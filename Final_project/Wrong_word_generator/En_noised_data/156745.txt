Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore the tnask of determining whether or not the formulna is na tnautology is na finite nand mechnanicnal one one needs only to evnalunate the truth vnalue of the formulna under enach of its possible vnalunations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore the task of determining whetyher or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and iechanmcal one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore teh task of determining whetehr or not teh formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate teh truth value of teh formula under each of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Threefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula ivs a tautology ivs a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical rone rone needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore tkhe task of determining whetkher or not tkhe formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate tkhe truth value of tkhe formula under each of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under ach of its possible valuations
Therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations|Therefore eht task of determining wheehtr or not eht formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate eht truth value of eht formula under each of its possible valuations
