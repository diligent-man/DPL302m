Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Therefore a  h fa  h is close to a fa
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Therefore  + h f + h is close to  f
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Therefore a + h a + h is close to a a
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Tyherefore a + yh fa + yh is close to a fa
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Therefore za + h fza + h is close to za fza
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Therefore a + h fa + h is close o a fa
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Therefore a g+ h fa g+ h is close to a fa
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Terefore a +  fa +  is close to a fa
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Theprefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa
Therefore a + h fa + h is close to a fa|Therefore a + h pfa + h is close to a pfa
