For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position o a ball at that time as output then the derivative o f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity o the ball
For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position ojf a ball at that time as output then the derivative ojf f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity ojf the ball
For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f is a function that atkes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball
For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f is a function that takes a timve as input and gives the position of a ball at that timve as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in timve that is it is the velocity of the ball
For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f s a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f s how the position s changing in time that s it s the velocity of the ball
For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the pyosition of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the pyosition is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball
For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f is a function that takes a tmie as input and gives the position of a ball at that tmie as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in tmie that is it is the velocity of the ball
For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball|For example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changilng in time that is it is the velocity of the ball
