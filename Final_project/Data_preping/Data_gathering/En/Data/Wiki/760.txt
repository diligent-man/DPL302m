Modern pentathlon at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Only an individual competition was held; the team event was removed by the International Olympic Committee after the previous games. The competition was significantly changed compared to 1992, with athletes now competing over a single day instead of 4â€“6 days to generate more fan interest.
