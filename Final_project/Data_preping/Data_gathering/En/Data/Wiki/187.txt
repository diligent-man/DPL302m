Liverpool John Moores University (abbreviated LJMU) is a public research university in the city of Liverpool, England. The university can trace its origins to the Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts, established in 1823. This later merged to become Liverpool Polytechnic. In 1992, following an Act of Parliament, the Liverpool Polytechnic became what is now Liverpool John Moores University. It is named after Sir John Moores, a local businessman and philanthropist, who donated to the university's precursor institutions.
The university had 25,050 students in 2019/20, of which 20,105 are undergraduate students and 4,945 are postgraduate, making it the 30th largest university in the UK by total student population.
It is a member of the University Alliance, the Northern Consortium and the European University Association.
Founded as a small mechanics institution (Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts) in 1823, the institution grew over the centuries by converging and amalgamating with different colleges, including the F.L.Calder School of Domestic Science, the City of Liverpool C.F. Mott Training College, before eventually becoming Liverpool Polytechnic in 1970. The university also has a long history of providing training, education and research to the maritime industry, dating back to the formation of the Liverpool Nautical College in 1892.
The institution then became a university under the terms of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 under the new title of "Liverpool John Moores University". This new title was approved by the Privy Council on 15 September 1992. The university took its name from Sir John Moores, the founder of the Littlewoods empire. Moores was a great believer in the creation of opportunity for all, which embodies the ethos of LJMU in providing educational routes for people of all ages and from all backgrounds. This belief led Sir John Moores to invest in the institution and facilities, such as the John Foster Building (housing the Liverpool Business School), designed by and named after leading architect John Foster. With the institution's backgrounds dating back as far as 1823, many of the university buildings date back also, with aesthetically pleasing Georgian and Victorian buildings found on a few of the campuses.
LJMU now has more than 27,000 students from over 100 countries world-wide, 2,400 staff and 250 degree courses. LJMU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2005.
Currently, Liverpool John Moores University is receiving more applications than previously seen; according to data in 2009, the total number of applications submitted to LJMU was 27,784.
On 28 March 2022, former student and founder of Mowgli, Nisha Katona was installed as Chancellor of the university.   Previously, in 2008, astrophysicist and Queen lead guitarist Brian May was appointed the fourth Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University. He replaced outgoing Chancellor Cherie Blair, wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Honorary fellows in attendance at the ceremony included astronomer Sir Patrick Moore and actor Pete Postlethwaite. May was succeeded as Chancellor by judge Sir Brian Leveson in 2013.
LJMU is a founding member of the Northern Consortium, an educational charity owned by 11 universities in northern England.
The university is separated into two campuses in Liverpool:
City Campus, mainly situated on Byrom Street and surrounding Great Crosshall Street up to Liverpool Exchange railway station, housing buildings such as the; James Parsons Building and Tithebarn Building, of the faculties of Science; Engineering and Technology and; Health.
Mount Pleasant Campus, next to the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral and Liverpool University, containing the John Lennon Art and Design Building and home to the Faculty of Business and Law and the Faculty of Arts, Professional and Social Studies. The Liverpool Science Park is also regarded to be part of this campus.Between the two campuses is the Copperas Hill Site, opened in summer 2021, containing many faculties moved from the former IM Marsh Campus, and home to the Student Life and LJMU Sports Buildings. Its location between the two sites has been described by the university to help connect both of its campuses together, and is not regarded to be part of either. It is however closer to the Mount Pleasant Campus and separated from the City Campus by the A5047, and Liverpool Lime Street railway station.
There are currently two libraries operated by LJMU, one for either campus:
The Aldham Robarts Library is part of the Mount Pleasant Campus, and provides for students studying at the Mount Pleasant Campus or otherwise residing in the central Knowledge Quarter area. The library is situated on Maryland Street and caters mainly for the Faculty of Business and Law and the Faculty of Media, Arts and Social Science.
The Avril Robarts Library is part of the City Campus, and mainly provides services to students studying in the City Campus. It is located on Tithebarn Street, and covers three faculties: Faculty of Health, the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Technology and Environment. The library hosts the Superlambanana sculpture at its front.There is an LRC present in the Learning Commons of the Student Life Building on the Copperas Hill site between the two campuses. 
Students of the university can use any library in term-time and some non-term time periods within the library's opening hours. The Student Life Building is open 24/7 in term time. Students need their student identification card for entry to all buildings.
There are more than 68,500 books in the Libraries' collections, with 1,630 work spaces available for students 24 hours a day. In addition to this there are over 16,000 e-books and 5,000 e-journals available. It is a member of the Libraries Together: Liverpool Learning Partnership (evolved from Liverpool Libraries Group) which formed in 1990. Under which, a registered reader at any of the member libraries can have access rights to the other libraries within the partnership.
The Tom Reilly Building houses the School of Sports and Exercise Sciences and the School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, which are both part of the Faculty of Science. Some 8,000 students use the building which is located at LJMU's City Campus on Byrom Street. The five storey, 6,493 m (69,890 sq ft) building was completed in November 2009 and opened in March 2010 by Liverpool F.C. captain Steven Gerrard. The building provides sports and science facilities including; appetite laboratories, psychology testing labs, neuroscience labs, an indoor 70-metre running track, force plates, caren disc, physiology suites, a DEXA scanner, a driving simulator and a chronobiology lab.
The university is organised into five faculties (which are each split into schools or centres), most of the faculties are based at a particular campus site however, with many joint honours degrees and some conventional degrees, the faculties overlap meaning students' degrees are from both faculties. The five faculties are:
Faculty of Business & LawLiverpool Business School
