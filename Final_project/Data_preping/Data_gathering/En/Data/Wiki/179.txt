Born in Caracas, Venezuela, on 16 August 1953, to Hungarian survivors of The Holocaust, Fenjves went to college in Illinois. His first journalism job was in Canada. He joined the National Enquirer in Florida in the late 1970s, where he befriended Judith Regan.
Fenjves has ghostwritten more than a dozen books, including two number one New York Times Best-Sellers (Witness and Blood Brother). Fenjves also ghostwrote the autobiographies and memoirs of Bernie Mac, Janice Dickinson, and music producer David Foster.
Fenjves collaborated with O. J. Simpson to ghostwrite If I Did It, an account of the O. J. Simpson murder case. The book was pulled by the publisher just weeks before its release date, but it was subsequently revived by Fred Goldman, father of murder victim Ron Goldman, and spent five weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. Fenjves had a personal connection to the Simpson case: Fenjves lived a few doors down from the Brentwood murder scene, and had testified against Simpson regarding the time at which he heard Nicole Simpson's dog barking.
