The Cerrito Government (Spanish: Gobierno del Cerrito, lit. "Little Hill Government") governed almost all the Uruguayan territory during the Great Siege of Montevideo (1843-1851). It was led by Manuel Oribe y Viana.
Uruguay was experiencing the Guerra Grande, between the two traditional parties Colorado and Blanco. Oribe sieged the city during 9 years; his headquarters were established at the present neighbourhood of Cerrito de la Victoria. Other notable posts were Villa Restauraci√≥n (with tribunal and university) and Buceo (with its harbor).
