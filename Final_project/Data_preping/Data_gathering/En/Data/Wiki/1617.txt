"Move On Up" is a song by Curtis Mayfield from his 1970 debut album Curtis. Nearly nine minutes long on the album version, it was released as a single in the United States (Curtom 1974), but failed to chart. An edited version of the song spent 10 weeks in the top 50 of the UK Singles Chart in 1971, peaking at number 12, and it has become a soul classic over the years.
A slowed sample of the music was used for the 2006 hip hop song "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West. 
In 1979, Destination recorded a medley, incorporating "Keep on Pushing", a 1964 hit by the Impressions, also written by Mayfield. Along with the tracks "Up Up Up" and "Destination's Theme", "Move On Up" hit number one on the disco chart for four weeks.  It peaked at number 68 on the soul singles chart.
The song was used in Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.
