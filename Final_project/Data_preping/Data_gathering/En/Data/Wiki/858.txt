Viśuddhacāritra (Sanskrit: विशुद्धचारित्र; also known as Pure Practice), is one of the four great  primarily or eternally evolved bodhisattvas mentioned in the 15th chapter of the Lotus Sutra. He is considered to represent the "purity" characteristic of buddhahood, "Nirvana's freedom from all that is impure."
