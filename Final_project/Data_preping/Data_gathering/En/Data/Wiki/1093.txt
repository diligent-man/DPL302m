Jews had first started settling in Radzymin in the middle of the seventeenth-century. By 1840 the community erected their first synagogue. In 1848, after the death of Rabbi Yitzchok of Vurka, Rabbi Yaakov Guterman founded the Radzymin dynasty and brought the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov to Radzymin making it a Chasidic centre.
