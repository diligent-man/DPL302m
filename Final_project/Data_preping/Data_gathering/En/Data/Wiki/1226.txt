Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Plasmawr is a Welsh-medium comprehensive secondary school in Cardiff. It opened in September 1998 as the second school of its kind in Cardiff. Its buildings had formerly belonged to Waterhall Secondary Modern School and more recently formed Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf's Lower School. The current headteacher is John Hayes.
The school serves a wide area of western Cardiff that includes Culverhouse Cross, Ely, Caerau, Grangetown, Butetown, Riverside (including Pontcanna), Canton, Fairwater (including Pentrebane), Llandaff, Radyr, Creigiau, Pentyrch,  and Gwaelod-y-Garth.
In 2010 it was noted that 75% of the pupils come from homes where English is the predominant language, with 22% coming from homes whose main language was Welsh. In 2013 9% of the pupils were recorded as having an ethnic background other than 'White-British'.
