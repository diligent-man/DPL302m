The Numbers is a film industry data website that tracks box office revenue in a systematic, algorithmic way. The company also conducts research services and forecasts incomes of film projects.
The site was launched in 1997 by Bruce Nash.
On March 21, 2020, the Numbers released a statement that because of movie theater closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, "We donâ€™t expect much box office reporting in the short term" and did not report the usual daily box office estimates due to lack of box office data from film studios.
