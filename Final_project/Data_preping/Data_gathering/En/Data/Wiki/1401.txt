The Terebikko (Japanese: てれびっこ, Hepburn: Terebikko) is an interactive VHS console game system released in Japan by Bandai in 1988.  Titles released included a wide variety of known franchises, such as Super Mario World,  Dragon Ball Z,  and many more. The system was also released in the U.S. as the See 'n Say Video Phone by Mattel in 1989.
This system has the shape of a toy phone, and is connected to the TV's audio output jack.
It has four large main buttons numbered 1 to 4, each with a different color (red, blue, green, yellow).
Throughout the video, the viewer receives calls from characters on-screen, and answers questions using the telephone. The phone uses signals from the video (inaudible through the built-in speaker), to interact with the viewer, as such for giving bad or good answers.
