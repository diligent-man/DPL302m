Battery life is rated at six hours of video viewing and eight hours of web browsing. The operating system is Android 4.2. A custom Facebook app comes pre-loaded.
In a review for the Times of India Javed Amwer wrote, "Vibe X is a good-looking device. In fact, it is more than good looking. It is incredibly thin and very light, especially for a phone that has a five-inch screen." Javed also wrote, "The frame around the screen is also made of tough plastic but has faux chrome finish. It is shiny and adds to the style of the device, though we are not sure how well the shine will hold up with the use. The volume rocker on the right and the power button on the left have chamfered edges. These buttons fit in their sockets snuggly and feel perfect." Javed concluded, "Vibe X has a great screen and a good design and the performance is also great. "
