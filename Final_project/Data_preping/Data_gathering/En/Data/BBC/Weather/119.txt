Here’s a look at some statistics from Hurricane Katrina.
Katrina makes landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana as a Category 3 storm with winds near 127 mph.- Severe flooding damage to cities along the Gulf Coast, from New Orleans to Biloxi, Mississippi.  - Numerous failures of levees around New Orleans led to catastrophic flooding in the city. - About 25,000 storm evacuees were sheltered at the Louisiana Superdome, a sports arena. Wind and water damage to the roof created unsafe conditions, leading authorities to conduct emergency evacuations of the Superdome.  - The total damage from Katrina is estimated to be $125 billion (or $193.8 billion in 2023 dollars), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
NOAA report- Direct deaths: 520 - Indirect deaths: 565 - Indeterminate cause: 307- Total number of fatalities: 1,392
