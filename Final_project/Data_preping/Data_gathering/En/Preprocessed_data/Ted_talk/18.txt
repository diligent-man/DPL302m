tips for dealing with meeting overload
have you ever reached the end of what feels like a grueling workday
only to realize you didn t actually accomplish anything
that it was just meeting after meeting
after meeting after meeting after meeting
the way we work
music
as a recovering corporate executive
i know we all feel like our time isn t our own
like other people are controlling our calendars
and we re simply reacting to their whims
but calendar creep isn t inevitable
there s so much in the world we can t control
we can t control our senior leaders
we can t control our customer demands
and we certainly can t control a global pandemic
but we can actually control our time
we ve just forgotten how to do it
i ve come up with five easy to implement steps
that can take your calendar from working against you
to working for you
and they really work
we worked with a big global company
and asked some of their leaders to put these tips into practice
while others didn t
and guess what
the leaders who used these steps saw significant hours open up
on their calendars
for you know actual work
tip ask yourself
tip number one
ask yourself do you really need the meeting
we re under the illusion that we need a meeting for everything
we think i need to make sure so and so is ok with this
so i ll book time
or i ve got a quick question on process i ll grab a meeting
the reality is for almost half of the meetings we schedule
we could simply pick up the phone or shoot a text for a quick answer
a trick to stop this
when you re thinking of calling a meeting
write the invitation first
and if you can t start with a subject line with an action verb
you shouldn t have the meeting
decide finalize create next steps
those are reasons to call a meeting
review on the other hand isn t an action verb
if you re calling a meeting to review something
send it out ahead of time
and schedule a minute meeting for questions
that should get joe to finally read the deck
related to that action verb
if you re going to call a meeting
you should be able to create a clear purpose statement
in this meeting we re going to decide boom boom boom
come prepared
you don t need a whole agenda
nobody s going to read it anyway
but that purpose statement is enough so that when you start
everybody is sitting up paying attention and focused on the goal
tip invite
tip number two
invite the least number of people possible
let s be honest
most of us invite people to meetings defensively
we know that raco s the one we need
but if dion doesn t feel like he s involved
he s going to be cranky
so you invite him and then shannon and then jane
and now we re wasting all of these people s time
instead of just going directly to the decision maker
it s time to let go of those grade school fears
and just invite the people who are necessary for the objective
everyone else can be informed later
let s also agree it s ok if we re not invited to everything
research has found that the optimal size of a decision making meeting
is around five to eight people
any time you re inviting more
you re making it less likely you ll achieve your goal
tip make meetings shorter
tip number three
make your meetings shorter
if you want your time back
ditch the hour long meeting
i schedule and minute meetings
that s it period
full stop
that gives people time to digest
figure out next steps
then take a breath
and maybe i don t know go to the bathroom
it stops that horrible snowball of lateness
that rolls downhill over the course of a day
tip say no
tip number four
say no to other s people s meetings
we re in the habit of saying yes to every meeting we re invited to
often we show up out of fear of missing out or worse yet ego
neither of those is a reason to spend your precious time in a meeting
a better way to decide
ask yourself is my opinion absolutely vital to the purpose of this meeting
even better does this meeting move my goals
my team s goals or my customers goals forward
if not just say no
now i know what you re thinking
it s hard to say no to a meeting
but it really isn t
simply tell the organizer the truth
you know that they ve got this
and if they need you
simply give you a ring
you can also use the opportunity to delegate the meeting
to a high performer or subject matter expert
who may be a better choice anyway
you can even simply let them know you have other priorities that week
and ask if your attendance is necessary
all you need to do is communicate with honesty and clarity
tip be ruthless
tip number five
be ruthless with your time
as any flight attendant will tell you
you have to put your own oxygen mask on first
it s the only way you can be at your best for others
so give yourself time to do the things you need to
in order to feel like a human being
that includes scheduling blocks of uninterrupted time
to focus on your own work
if you have a project that going to take you hours
of really focused time and effort
schedule that time in your calendar
try putting in no fly zones two hours a day
a few days a week
at whatever time you re at your most productive
you don t have to make these changes in a vacuum
like it s some kind of secret
you can tell people that you re trying something new
and taking control of your calendar
and you do not have to do everything at once
simply pick one idea and try it
people will not only understand it
but they ll appreciate it
so the only question left is
do you have the courage to own your own calendar
i think you do
