Have you ever reached the end of what feels like a grueling workday
only to realize you didn’t actually accomplish anything
That it was just meeting after meeting
after meeting after meeting after meeting --
I know we all feel like our time isn’t our own
like other people are controlling our calendars
and we’re simply reacting to their whims
There's so much in the world we can't control
and we certainly can’t control a global pandemic
But we can actually control our time
we’ve just forgotten how to do it
I’ve come up with five easy-to-implement steps
that can take your calendar from working against you
We worked with a big global company
and asked some of their leaders to put these tips into practice
The leaders who used these steps saw significant hours open up
Ask yourself Do you really need the meeting
We’re under the illusion that we need a meeting for everything
We think I need to make sure so-and-so is OK with this
Or I’ve got a quick question on process I’ll grab a meeting
The reality is for almost half of the meetings we schedule
we could simply pick up the phone or shoot a text for a quick answer
when you’re thinking of calling a meeting
And if you can’t start with a subject line with an action verb
Those are reasons to call a meeting
Review on the other hand isn’t an action verb
If you're calling a meeting to review something
and schedule a -minute meeting for questions
That should get Joe to finally read the deck
if you’re going to call a meeting
you should be able to create a clear purpose statement
In this meeting we’re going to decide boom boom boom
But that purpose statement is enough so that when you start
everybody is sitting up paying attention and focused on the goal
invite the least number of people possible
most of us invite people to meetings defensively
We know that Raco’s the one we need
but if Dion doesn’t feel like he’s involved
so you invite him and then Shannon and then Jane
And now we’re wasting all of these people’s time
instead of just going directly to the decision maker
It’s time to let go of those grade-school fears
and just invite the people who are necessary for the objective
Let’s also agree it’s OK if we’re not invited to everything
Research has found that the optimal size of a decision-making meeting
you're making it less likely you'll achieve your goal
and maybe I don’t know go to the bathroom
It stops that horrible snowball of lateness
that rolls downhill over the course of a day
We’re in the habit of saying yes to every meeting we’re invited to
Often we show up out of fear of missing out or worse yet ego
Neither of those is a reason to spend your precious time in a meeting
Ask yourself Is my opinion absolutely vital to the purpose of this meeting
Even better Does this meeting move my goals
my team’s goals or my customers’ goals forward
it’s hard to say no to a meeting
You can also use the opportunity to delegate the meeting
to a high performer or subject matter expert
who may be a better choice anyway
You can even simply let them know you have other priorities that week
and ask if your attendance is necessary
All you need to do is communicate with honesty and clarity
As any flight attendant will tell you
you have to put your own oxygen mask on first
It’s the only way you can be at your best for others
so give yourself time to do the things you need to
in order to feel like a human being
That includes scheduling blocks of uninterrupted time
If you have a project that going to take you hours
Try putting in no-fly zones two hours a day
at whatever time you’re at your most productive
You don’t have to make these changes in a vacuum
You can tell people that you’re trying something new
And you do not have to do everything at once
Simply pick one idea and try it
Do you have the courage to own your own calendar
