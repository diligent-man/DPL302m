how to quit your job without ruining your career
when you re fed up with your job
it can be tempting to do something big and dramatic
to yell i quit during a meeting and peace out
or post a video on social media calling out your former employer
but quitting well can actually be an opportunity for growth
the way we work
quitting well is important clearly
because it impacts many of us at some point in our career
and because there are some bridges you just don t want to burn
every industry is its own small world and word can travel fast
quitting well is also important for you
it s a time where you can practice caring for yourself
and really clarify what you want and need
when it comes to your future work life
here s how to leave your job with courage confidence and clarity
first i want you to find courage in leaving your job
that requires some reflecting
the people i work with rarely go through the job search process
because they want more money
there s almost always a deeper reason why they re moving on
i want you to be able to identify exactly what that is
so what about this job felt out of alignment
with your goals and values
what tasks and experiences did you enjoy
and which of your skills and strengths felt underutilized
what would make for a better fit in a work environment
by pinning down those deeper issues
you can come back to them any time you feel unsure or scared
once you ve asked those big questions
make a checklist for what you want in your next role
now prioritize your list
maybe you feel drawn to work for a mission driven company
but don t care as much about its size
maybe you d be cool with a commute
for the right opportunity to really grow in a role
maybe you value decision making responsibilities
but don t rank creativity as highly
maybe you re interested in a particular benefit such as equity
and would be willing to rank salary a little lower
one thing i found to be really helpful is to imagine the strongest boldest
most courageous version of yourself
and ask what would that version of me be doing next
if there was nothing in their way
the goal with this question isn t to figure out everything for your career
for the next years
it s just too big
instead try to identify that step
that will point you in the right direction
the one that will give you courage
and once you have it in mind i want you to set some goals
but not outcome based ones like find a new job in three months
or get a position in a major tech company
instead i want you to set process based goals
as they re much more within your locus of control
a great goal could be
every week i want to reach out to someone new in my industry or network
or every day for the next days
i want to dedicate minutes to my job search
you want to create great habits while you pursue your goals
you ll be more likely to achieve the outcomes you want
second i want you to have confidence in leaving your job
that means digging into the details
if you re leaving before having another job lined up
start by doing a financial checkup
so you know how much it costs you to live each month
total up all your non negotiable expenses to get that baseline figure
and try to have three to six months in savings
so you have a safety net and can handle emergencies
if you re in a country like the united states
where health insurance is often tied to your job
look into all of your options
and get clear on what kind of plan will be best for you
and while you re at it
comb through the nitty gritty of your package
and know what vacation time and bonuses you ll be owed
and how long you ll have to cash in any stock options
essentially this step is all about getting a holistic view
of what your new financial reality will be
so there are no surprises
once you ve reflected on what s next gotten ready on the financial end
that should bring you to the place where you can leave your job with clarity
when you give notice make sure to give the right amount of time
two weeks is customary in most places
but it may depend on your role and any new projects
talk to your manager about how you can close things out on a good note
and consider putting together a transition memo
with the details on all of your responsibilities
so others can step in and take them over
as you re getting ready to leave
think about strengthening relationships
invite those people you re close to for lunch or coffee
and tell them your plans
get their personal contact information
and lay the groundwork to stay in touch and really do it
so many people don t
and while you re at it
reach out to those senior leaders you ve always wanted to connect with
but never have
ask them if they have a few minutes to chat
if you feel nervous about it
just be authentic and let curiosity be your guide
why do you want to know this person
what do you hope to learn from them
share that and there will likely be an open door
which is great because these relationships and connections
can be so powerful to carry forward
if you have the resources
i also invite you to consider taking a career break
whether it s a couple of weeks or a couple of months
i ve seen a lot of clients do this and it can be so powerful
it puts you in an active position sure of what you want
and willing to wait for it
rather than limiting your options to what s available right now
so instead of jumping right into looking for a job
take that time to debrief
start sharing what you re looking for with your network
it s much more likely that your next step will come through your network
than through applications
don t worry about specific titles or specific companies
just give them the vision of what you re looking to do
and what your priorities are
this will help them get creative
in thinking about where you could be a good fit
and get them to think of you when they hear things
that could be a match
give them the broad target
rather than limiting it to a tiny bullseye
if this feels icky
and it often does when it comes to networking
remember it s a two way street
you can help them achieve their goals too
and you might be surprised what opportunities can come
as a result of these conversations
perhaps they recommend you for a role at their company
giving you a much better chance at landing an interview
or maybe they mention you to someone else who can open doors for you
the bottom line is that leaving a job
it s a chance to get to know yourself better
it has the power to shake up the status quo
and help you see those things that might not be so obvious
so my advice is to hone in on what matters
and from there you ll be able to chart your path
