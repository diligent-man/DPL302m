A few years ago my obsession with productivity
got so bad that I suffered an episode of burnout
that scared the hell out of me
I'm talking insomnia weight gain hair loss -- the works
I was so overworked that my brain
literally couldn't come up with another idea
That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity
Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day
Do you spend hours reading productivity hacks
trying new frameworks and testing new apps
I've tried them all -- task apps calendar apps
things that are meant to manage your day
We've been so obsessed with doing more
that we've missed the most important thing
OK let's talk about productivity for a second
Historically productivity as we know it today
It was a system that measured performance based on consistent output
and were responsible for creating X number of widgets
At the end of the day it was pretty easy to see
When we shifted to a knowledge economy
people suddenly had tasks that were much more abstract
how to tell who was working and who wasn't
so they just adopted the old systems as best as they could
leading to things like the dreaded time sheet
to justify how they spend every second of their day
These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work
We still think of productivity as an endurance sport
You try to churn out as many blog posts
or we cram our day full of meetings
But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought
Today knowledge workers are facing a big challenge
We're expected to be constantly productive and creative
for our brains to continuously generate new ideas
In fact downtime is a necessity for our brain
Consider that according to a team of researchers
letting our minds wander is an essential mental state
and it even influences our internal moral compass
Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling
in other words the stories that we as a society
tell each other about what success looks like
and what it takes to get there
which is one of our most deeply rooted beliefs
This tells us that if we work hard we'll be successful
it must mean that you're not working hard enough
And if you don't think you're doing enough
of course you're going to stay late pull all-nighters
and push yourself hard even when you know better
Productivity has wrapped itself up in our self-worth
so that it's almost impossible for us to allow ourselves
The average US employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave
further proving that even if we have the option
To be clear I don't think that productivity
or trying to improve our performance is bad
I'm just saying that the current models we're using to measure our creative work
We need systems that work with our creativity
There is no quick fix for this problem
And I know I know that sucks
No one loves a good framework or a good acronym
But the truth is everyone has their own narratives
It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around work
that I began to unravel the root of my own work story
finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors
And the only way to do that
is by asking yourself some hard questions
Does being busy make you feel valuable
Who do you hold up as an example of success
Where did your ideas of work ethic come from
How much of who you are is linked to what you do
Your creativity it has its own rhythms
Our energy fluctuates daily weekly even seasonally
I know that I'm always more energetic at the beginning of the week
so I front-load my workweek to account for that fact
As a proud night owl I free up my afternoons and evenings
And I know I'll get more writing done
in the cozy winter months than during the summer
this is the real work that we need to be doing
and I think it's time that we stopped working like one
