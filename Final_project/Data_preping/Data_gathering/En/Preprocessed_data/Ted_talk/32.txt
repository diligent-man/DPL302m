how burnout makes us less creative
a few years ago my obsession with productivity
got so bad that i suffered an episode of burnout
that scared the hell out of me
i m talking insomnia weight gain hair loss the works
i was so overworked that my brain
literally couldn t come up with another idea
that indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity
the way we work
do you feel guilty if you haven t been productive enough during the day
do you spend hours reading productivity hacks
trying new frameworks and testing new apps
to get even more done
i ve tried them all task apps calendar apps
time management apps
things that are meant to manage your day
we ve been so obsessed with doing more
that we ve missed the most important thing
many of these tools aren t helping
they re making things worse
ok let s talk about productivity for a second
historically productivity as we know it today
was used during the industrial revolution
it was a system that measured performance based on consistent output
you clocked into your shift
and were responsible for creating x number of widgets
on the assembly line
at the end of the day it was pretty easy to see
who worked hard and who hadn t
when we shifted to a knowledge economy
people suddenly had tasks that were much more abstract
things like writing problem solving or strategizing
tasks that weren t easy to measure
companies struggled to figure out
how to tell who was working and who wasn t
so they just adopted the old systems as best as they could
leading to things like the dreaded time sheet
where everyone is under pressure
to justify how they spend every second of their day
there s just one problem
these systems don t make a lot of sense for creative work
we still think of productivity as an endurance sport
you try to churn out as many blog posts
or we cram our day full of meetings
but this model of constant output isn t conducive to creative thought
today knowledge workers are facing a big challenge
we re expected to be constantly productive and creative
in equal measure
but it s actually almost impossible
for our brains to continuously generate new ideas
with no rest
in fact downtime is a necessity for our brain
to recover and to operate properly
consider that according to a team of researchers
from the university of southern california
letting our minds wander is an essential mental state
that helps us develop our identity
process social interactions
and it even influences our internal moral compass
our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling
in other words the stories that we as a society
tell each other about what success looks like
and what it takes to get there
stories like the american dream
which is one of our most deeply rooted beliefs
this tells us that if we work hard we ll be successful
but there s a flip side
if you aren t successful
it must mean that you re not working hard enough
and if you don t think you re doing enough
of course you re going to stay late pull all nighters
and push yourself hard even when you know better
productivity has wrapped itself up in our self worth
so that it s almost impossible for us to allow ourselves
to stop working
the average us employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave
further proving that even if we have the option
to take a break we don t
to be clear i don t think that productivity
or trying to improve our performance is bad
i m just saying that the current models we re using to measure our creative work
don t make sense
we need systems that work with our creativity
and not against it
so how do we fix it
there is no quick fix for this problem
and i know i know that sucks
no one loves a good framework or a good acronym
better than me
but the truth is everyone has their own narratives
that they have to uncover
it wasn t until i started digging around my own beliefs around work
that i began to unravel the root of my own work story
finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors
and make positive long lasting changes
and the only way to do that
is by asking yourself some hard questions
does being busy make you feel valuable
who do you hold up as an example of success
where did your ideas of work ethic come from
how much of who you are is linked to what you do
your creativity it has its own rhythms
our energy fluctuates daily weekly even seasonally
i know that i m always more energetic at the beginning of the week
than at the end
so i front load my workweek to account for that fact
as a proud night owl i free up my afternoons and evenings
for creative work
and i know i ll get more writing done
in the cozy winter months than during the summer
and that s the secret
dismantling myths challenging your old views
identifying your narratives
this is the real work that we need to be doing
we aren t machines
and i think it s time that we stopped working like one
