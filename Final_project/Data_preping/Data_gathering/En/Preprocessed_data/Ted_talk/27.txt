How we can use the hiring process to bring out the best in people
is basically a one-sided high pressure interrogation
can totally obscure a person's true potential
causing us to overlook a lot of people
We need a different way to interview and screen candidates
One that will reveal hidden potential and talent
Made possible with the support of Dropbox
More than half of our hundreds of employees
The problem I needed to solve when we started out was
Now if you're screening for Navy SEALS I totally get it
but the capacity to function under duress
is totally irrelevant if the actual job is stocking shelves
or folding T-shirts unless of course it's Black Friday
while she was waiting for her job interview
Clara was years old had cerebral palsy
but she was likable intelligent and talkative
And yet just a short while later
her interviewer told me that she had totally failed
that she couldn't string two words together
of let's pick our employees by viewing them at their worst
but anyone whose shine is diminished under harsh pressure
we go about things practically the opposite way
In a nutshell if you want to assess a candidate's true potential
see how they function at their best not their worst
which for most of us is when we're calm and relaxed
Three examples how you can achieve that
Start out by losing the whole interrogation vibe
Rather interviewers should view themselves as hosts
like making your interview room look like a living room
about which they are knowledgeable and passionate
So we ask candidates to fill out a short questionnaire
and we start out the interview by discussing those
so that candidates could bring forth their verbal skills
For instance sales positions require the ability to use persuasion
So ask the candidate to role play
to not look at their phone during a family dinner
Help them move beyond the stuck points
to see how they adapt and learn
We call it Who Wants to Be an Employee
If the candidate asks for a hint
the interviewer will model a few correct arguments
and ask the candidate to role play the scenario
to see how convincingly they absorb and convey those points
Finding people's true potential makes for happier
more diverse and more successful companies and employees
until she hit her targets of calls per hour
and then she kept on getting better
about how many years ago no one including herself
believed she had any potential at all
A job is so much more than a paycheck
By finding and hiring those you might otherwise overlook
you will not only benefit your own company
The opportunity to win with underdogs is all around you
