how we can use the hiring process to bring out the best in people
a traditional job interview
is basically a one sided high pressure interrogation
almost guaranteed to create
significant psychological strain
ironically such stressful procedures
can totally obscure a person s true potential
causing us to overlook a lot of people
who could be great employees
we need a different way to interview and screen candidates
one that will reveal hidden potential and talent
the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
the problem
twelve years ago i founded cy
an outsource call center
staffed and managed entirely by underdogs
more than half of our hundreds of employees
are severely disabled
others come from other disadvantaged populations
or just suffer from anxiety
low self esteem and lack of confidence
the problem i needed to solve when we started out was
that traditional interviewing and screening
especially for entry level positions
are totally biased towards people
who function well under intense stress
now if you re screening for navy seals i totally get it
but the capacity to function under duress
is totally irrelevant if the actual job is stocking shelves
or folding t shirts unless of course it s black friday
the screening philosophy
clara is a classic example
we met in cy s early days
while she was waiting for her job interview
clara was years old had cerebral palsy
and used a walker
she seemed quite nervous
but she was likable intelligent and talkative
and yet just a short while later
her interviewer told me that she had totally failed
that she couldn t string two words together
the screening philosophy
of let s pick our employees by viewing them at their worst
not only overlooks disabled people
but anyone whose shine is diminished under harsh pressure
we developed the reverse screening process
to find potential
and as the name implies
we go about things practically the opposite way
traditional approaches do
in a nutshell if you want to assess a candidate s true potential
see how they function at their best not their worst
which for most of us is when we re calm and relaxed
not stressed and anxious
so build screening procedures specifically tailored
to help candidates feel
as emotionally comfortable as possible
three examples
three examples how you can achieve that
lower anxiety and insecurity
start out by losing the whole interrogation vibe
rather interviewers should view themselves as hosts
be friendly and welcoming
choose an environment that s conducive
to putting a candidate at ease
like making your interview room look like a living room
people are most confident discussing things
about which they are knowledgeable and passionate
so we ask candidates to fill out a short questionnaire
about their hobbies
and we start out the interview by discussing those
so that candidates could bring forth their verbal skills
strengths and personality
assess skills
assess skills in everyday life situations
with which the candidates are familiar
for instance sales positions require the ability to use persuasion
so ask the candidate to role play
how they would persuade a neighbor
to pay an extra maintenance fee
for the renovations of their lobby
looking for tough full throttle negotiations
ask the candidate to describe
how they would persuade a teenager
to not look at their phone during a family dinner
reverse screening
help them move beyond the stuck points
to see how they adapt and learn
in the reverse screening process
we offer candidates three lifelines
we call it who wants to be an employee
if the candidate asks for a hint
the interviewer will model a few correct arguments
and ask the candidate to role play the scenario
to see how convincingly they absorb and convey those points
finding people s true potential makes for happier
more diverse and more successful companies and employees
remember clara we hired her
she gradually improved
until she hit her targets of calls per hour
and then she kept on getting better
and nowadays clara gives talks
about how many years ago no one including herself
believed she had any potential at all
a job is so much more than a paycheck
especially for marginalized populations
by finding and hiring those you might otherwise overlook
you will not only benefit your own company
you will literally transform people s lives
the opportunity to win with underdogs is all around you
make sure to grab it
