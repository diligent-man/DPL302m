this is the side hustle revolution
i can t think of anyone who just has one interest in life
and that s all they want to do for the rest of their life
the way we work
around percent of american workers don t have traditional full time jobs
they re half time part time contract workers or temps
the term side hustle just seems to fit with this ethos
where people are putting together a few different things to make a living
the word side hustle has its roots in popular african american newspapers
in the s these papers used the word hustle
to refer to some kind of scam
by the s they were using side hustle
to refer to legitimate work too
a side hustle is a little different than a second job
a second job is about necessity
while a side hustle can certainly bring in extra income
it s a little more aspirational
side hustle captures a certain kind of scrappy entrepreneurial spirit
i ve interviewed more than women of color
on side hustle pro
who started successful side hustles
nailah ellis brown started ellis island tea out of her trunk
arsha jones started her famous capital city co mambo sauce
with one product and a paypal link
all these women are running side hustles
what exactly does this tell us
first that people are seeing opportunity within their communities
the goal here isn t necessarily to be the next coca cola or google
scale is great but there s also beauty in a successful business
that s built for a specific audience
second people are increasingly interested in being their own boss
being your own boss takes discipline
self made millionaires tend to have one big trait in common
they make decisions hold themselves accountable
and push through in the face of challenges
a side hustle is a great way to try out being your own boss
and see if you have those skills before fully stepping out on your own
third people are multipassionate
i want to stress that not every side hustle is started
because someone hates their job
many are started simply because people are interested
in lots of different things
lisa price who started a hair and beauty company carol s daughter
was working in television production when she started side hustling
she says she actually loved her job
it was the fact that she came home every day feeling good
that led her to start experimenting
with making fragrances and hair oils in her kitchen
we re always being taught
that we re supposed to know what we want to do when we grow up
but when you re multipassionate
you want to dip and dabble in those different things
it doesn t mean that you re not committed to your job
it just means that you have other outlets that bring you joy
and that brings me to the final thing the side hustle revolution shows us
people want to make a bet on themselves
side hustles are appealing because it s easier to take that chance
when you have some kind of income coming in
even if a side hustle doesn t take off
it s still an investment in yourself
forty one percent of millennials who have a side hustle
say they ve shared this information with their employers
they re not worried about their managers reacting negatively
they recognize all the learning and growth that comes with running a side hustle
everyone is looking to feel fulfilled
thirty eight percent of baby boomers feel some kind of regret about their career
no one wants that
the truth is that there are many different ways to find happiness
through what we do
side hustles are about embracing that hope
that we can be the ones making the decisions
in how we spend our work lives
