our days feel filled with a million small interruptions
And this is true even of our days off
Maybe you've taken a call at the beach
texted your boss from the grocery store
or emailed a colleague while on a picnic with your family
We’ve convinced ourselves that these behaviors are no big deal
But there's a real cost to these interruptions
and there are smart strategies we can all take
These moments seem so small at the time
and yet research suggests they add up to a tremendous loss
The constant creep of work into our personal lives
researchers recruited parents who were visiting a science museum with their kids
Some parents were told to check their phone as much as possible
others were told to check their phone as little as possible
that the experience was significantly less meaningful
tourists who were asked to have their phones out
employees who were paid for their performance
spent increasingly less time interacting with friends and family
and more and more time interacting with colleagues and clients
These constant interruptions come at a cost to organizations too
Companies lose days of productivity each year to employee depression
which is often caused by the stress and burnout of our always-on culture
I too have found myself focusing on urgent work distractions
Most recently I found myself texting a client
while in the middle of my first child’s first ultrasound
When you add up all of these moments
the sum total is a life shortchanged on meaning
As we remake our models of work in the wake of the pandemic
now is our opportunity to create a new culture that respects time
And the way to make this really big change
is through small steps that we can take right now
The first step that we need to take is to reframe rest
Reflect for a moment about what you think about when you hear the word rest
I immediately worry about not being productive enough
we need to find ways in which we can enjoy the present moment
and savor the leisure time that we have available
as opposed to seeing it as an unproductive barrier to our work
is to treat our upcoming weekend like a vacation
jot down how you would act and behave as if you were on a holiday
Maybe you and your partner will buy a bottle of wine
and watch online clips of the Eiffel Tower
Or maybe you'll go for a long walk in the middle of the day
The plan doesn't have to be expensive or extravagant
Another strategy you can take is to create clear boundaries
Instead of saying I'm out of the office
I will not check email between and pm
I will have dinner with my family four nights a week
or I will go for a jog midday
If you or your teammates are unsuccessful
work together to help accomplish personal goals
Lastly you can negotiate for more time
to prevent work from creeping into your personal life
In business school I teach students to negotiate for salary
but realize I spoke almost nothing about negotiating for more time
What does this look like in practice
You can ask for more time on adjustable deadlines at work
If your client asks for a deliverable Monday morning
ask for an extension until Tuesday afternoon
so you don’t find yourself working on your well-deserved weekend
And don't worry too much about reputation
Quality truly is the metric that matters most
employees who proactively asked for more time
reported lower levels of stress and burnout
and were seen as more committed and professional by their colleagues
These are small but powerful changes to not only reframe rest
Once you discover the profound impact that these changes can have
you’ll feel empowered to demand that others respect
to piece together the fractured moments of their lives too
