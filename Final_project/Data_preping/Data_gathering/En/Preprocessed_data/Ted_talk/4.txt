The Secret to Successfully Pitching an Idea
Do you know the secret to successfully pitching an idea
It’s FOMO the fear of missing out
As someone who invests in companies early in their journeys
I listen to nearly pitches a year
and I work countless hours with company founders
to help them make their pitch even more compelling
You may equate pitching with a slick deck
based on some standard formatbut whether you're pitching a company or trying to get buy-in for a passion project at work so much of pitching is a storytelling exercise
You need to bring people along with you
You need to tell your audience a story that not only will draw them in
but it will make them feel that if they don't say yes
they will be missing out on something really big
When people think about pitching they're thinking inwards
how smoothly they're talking or what it takes to get to a yes
But the secret of successful pitching is to flip it outward
How can you speak to what motivates them
For example if you're pitching your start-up idea to a venture capitalist
who has lots of money to invest and needs big returns
they probably care about backing the next Uber or DoorDash
So you should focus your story on the size of the market opportunity
If you're pitching to a philanthropist or a nonprofit
their motivation is likely about large social impact
So focus on showing how your product or idea will improve things
If you're pitching a project at work
focus on the people you're pitching the project to
Tell them how your project will help them attain the goal that they want
in a way that makes it almost inevitable
Give them that feeling of If I don’t support this
I'm going to miss out on something I care about deeply
Pitching is much like telling a story
Just like a movie tells a story
You're charting the hero's journey in three acts
First you start by telling about the hero's world the status quo
that your product idea or service will be addressing
showing all the problems that existing products aren't yet addressing
This will lead you to the big confrontation
You the hero swooping in to save the day
How are things changed as a result of your actions
How does your product idea or service solve the problems
One of the best pitches I've heard followed this arc perfectly
The story started with a disturbing status quo
Depending on where and how it's produced
one gallon of milk can take roughly gallons of water to produce
and can create about six kilograms of CO equivalent or more in the process
the hero was the CEO and their team of scientists
who have come up with a way to engineer plants
They showed how a small crop of soybeans could create lots of delicious cheese
and how this could feed the global population
To anyone who cares about both the environment and good food
It made me feel like I needed to be part of it
or I would be missing out on a big opportunity
When people are done charting their hero's journey
I make them identify their biggest weakness
Is it that they're missing somebody on their team
or that they're trying to do something that has never been done before
Most people's instinct is to gloss over it or even skip it altogether
But that's exactly the wrong thing to do
because the audience will notice it and will ask you about it
Tell your audience Hey you may think this is a problem
but here's exactly what I'm going to do about it
And by showing the strengths and weaknesses of your story
you inspire confidence not only in you but also in your story
The best storytellers they live in the future
and they come here not to just tell us about it
but to show us the steps to get there
And this makes the audience lean forward
And all they need to do to be part of this amazing story is say yes
