how to embrace emotions at work
no matter how hard you might try
you can t just flip a switch when you step into the office
and turn your emotions off
feeling feelings is part of being human
the way we work
feelings are part of being human
a pervasive myth exists that emotions don t belong at work
and this often leads us
to mistakenly equate professionalism with being stoic or even cold
but research shows that in the moments when our colleagues
drop their glossy professional presentation
we re actually much more likely to believe what they re telling us
we feel connected to the people around us
we try harder we perform better
and we re just generally kinder
so it s about time that we learn how to embrace emotion at work
now that s not to say
you should suddenly become a feelings fire hose
a line exists between sharing which builds trust
and oversharing which destroys it
if you suddenly let your feelings run wild at work
and give people far more information than they bargained for
you make everyone around you uncomfortable
and you also undermine yourself
you re more likely to be seen as weak or lacking self awareness
so great to say you weren t feeling well last night
you don t need to go into every lurid detail
about how you got reacquainted with your half digested dinner
so there s a wide spectrum of emotional expression
the spectrum of emotions
on one hand you have under emoters
or people who have a hard time talking about their feelings
and on the other end are over emoters
those who constantly share everything that s going on inside
and neither of these make for a healthy workplace
so what s the balance between these two extremes
it s something called selective vulnerability
selective vulnerability is opening up
while still prioritizing stability and psychological safety
both for you and for your colleagues
luckily anyone can learn
to be selectively vulnerable with practice
here are four ways to get started
first flag your feelings without becoming emotionally leaky
flag your feelings
bad moods are contagious
and even if you re not vocalizing what you re feeling
chances are your body language or your expressions
are a dead giveaway
so if you are crossing your arms or hammering on your keyboard
your coworkers are going to know you re upset
and if you don t say anything
they might start to think it s about them and get worried
so if you are reacting to a non work related event
so traffic for example just flag it
you don t need to go into detail
you can say something as simple as i m having a bad morning
it has nothing to do with you
now if it s a work related event
that s causing you to feel strong emotions
that brings us to point number two
address the need
try to understand the need behind your emotion
and then address that need
if you suddenly start to find everyone around you irritating
sit back and reflect on that
and it might be that you re irritable because you re anxious
and you re anxious because you re worried about hitting a looming deadline
and in that case you can go back to your team
to address that need and say something like
i want to make sure i get everything done ahead of the deadline
can you help me put together a realistic plan to do that
share
if you re thinking of sharing
try and put yourself in the other person s shoes
so if what you re about to say would help you feel more supported
and better understand the situation
then go ahead and share it
but if it gives you any kind of pause you might want to leave it out
and finally read the room and provide a path forward
if everyone on your team has been pulling long hours
and you notice that one of your colleagues seems particularly deflated or anxious
you can acknowledge that and show some empathy
but then try to give them something actionable
that they could hold on to
and in this case
you could suggest that you go to your manager
and ask that your weekly meeting
be pushed back a day so you both have more time to work
you re showing you re invested in their success
but also that you care about their well being
when we can be honest about what we feel
and freely suggest ideas make mistakes
and just not have to hide every piece of who we are
we re much more likely to stay at the company for a long time
we re also happier and more productive
so take a moment to reflect on the emotional expression
that you bring to work each day
and if you are prone to oversharing try editing
and if you re a little bit more reserved
look for moments when you can open up to your colleagues
and be a bit vulnerable
and chances are there will be a big difference
in how people respond to you
and selective vulnerability might just become
one of your most valuable tools
