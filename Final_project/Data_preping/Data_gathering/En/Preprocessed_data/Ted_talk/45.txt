psychological tricks to help you save money
we all know that saving is important
and is something that we should be doing
and yet overall we re doing less and less of it
the way we work
we know what we need to do
the question is how do we do it
and that s what i m here to teach you
your savings behavior isn t a question of how smart you are
or how much willpower you have
the amount we save depends on the environmental cues around us
let me give you an example
we ran a study in which in one group
we showed people their income on a monthly basis
in another group we showed people their income on a weekly basis
and what we found was that people who saw their income on a weekly basis
were able to budget better throughout the month
now it s important to know
that we didn t change how much money people were receiving
we just changed the environment in which they understood their income
and environmental cues like this have an impact
so i m not going to share tricks with you that you already know
i m not going to tell you how to open up a savings account
or how to start saving for your retirement
what i am going to share with you is how to bridge this gap
from your intentions to save
and your actions
are you ready
harness the power of pre commitment
here s number one
harness the power of pre commitment
fundamentally we think about ourselves in two different ways
our present self and our future self
in the future we re perfect
in the future we re going to save for retirement
we re going to lose weight
we re going to call our parents more
but we oftentimes forget that our future self
is exactly the same person as our present self
we know that one of the best times to save is when you get your tax return
so we tried an a b test
in the first group we texted people in early february
hopefully before they even filed for their taxes
and we asked them
if you get a tax refund what percentage would you like to save
now this is a really hard question
they didn t know if they would receive a tax refund or how much
but we asked the question anyway
in the second group we asked people right after they received their refund
what percentage would you like to save
now here s what happened
in that second condition when people just received their tax refund
they wanted to save about percent of their tax refund
but in the condition when we asked people before they even filed their taxes
savings rates increased from percent to percent
when we asked in february
because you re committing for your future self
and of course your future self can save percent
these large changes in savings behavior
came from the fact that we changed the decision making environment
we want you to be able to harness that same power
so take a moment
and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self
for something that you know today will be a little bit hard
sign up for an app that lets you make savings decisions in advance
the trick is you have to have that binding contract
number two use transition moments to your advantage
use transitions to your advantage
we did an experiment with a website
that helps older adults share their housing
we ran two ads on social media
targeted to the same population of year olds
in one group we said hey you re getting older
are you ready for retirement
house sharing can help
in the second group we got a little bit more specific
and said you re turning
are you ready for retirement
house sharing can help
what we re doing in that second group
is highlighting that a transition is happening
all of a sudden
we saw click through rates and ultimately sign up rates increase
when we highlight that
in psychology we call this the fresh start effect
whether it s the start of a new year or even a new season
your motivation to act increases
so right now put a meeting request on your calendar
for the day before your next birthday
identify the one financial thing you most want to do
and commit yourself to it
the third and final trick
get a handle on small frequent purchases
get a handle on small frequent purchases
we ve run a few different studies
and found that the number one purchase people say they regret after bank fees
is eating out
it s a frequent purchase we make almost every day
and it s death by a thousand cuts
a coffee here a burrito there
it adds up and decreases our ability to save
back when i lived in new york city
i looked at my expenses
and saw that i spent over dollars on ride sharing apps
it was more than my new york city rent
i vowed to make a change
and the next month i spent dollars again
no change because the information alone didn t change my behavior
i didn t change my environment
so now that i was dollars in the hole i did two things
the first is that i unlinked my credit card
from my car sharing apps
instead i linked a debit card that only had dollars a month
if i needed more
i had to go through the whole process of adding a new card
and we know that every click every barrier changes our behavior
we aren t machines
we don t carry around an abacus every day
adding up what we re spending in comparison to what we wanted
but what our brains are very good at
is counting up the number of times we ve done something
so i gave myself a limit
i can only use ride sharing apps three times a week
it forced me to ration my travels
i got a handle on my car sharing expenses to the benefit of my husband
because of the environmental changes that i did
so get a handle on whatever that purchase is for you
and change your environment to make it harder to do so
those are my tips for you
but i want you to remember one thing
as human beings we can be irrational when it comes to saving
and spending and budgeting
but luckily we know this about ourselves
and we can predict how we ll act under certain environments
let s do that with saving
let s change our environment to help our future selves
