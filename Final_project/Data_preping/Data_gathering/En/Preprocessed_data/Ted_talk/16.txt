What working parents really need from workplaces
Every parent is a working parent
whether they have a job outside of the home or not
When Angela shows up at the office
know that Angela has been up for at least three hours
had her hand covered in human excrement
who has become lodged in between the washing machine and the wall
gotten down on her hands and knees and picked up oatmeal off the carpet
which is what parenting is and everything that goes along with parenting
it s not just taking care of a child
it s keeping a household running
it s keeping the schedule tight
We again assume that that work will be done by a wife who s at home
The reality has progressed beyond where we re at policy wise
Most people need multiple sources of income
women want to work outside of the home
we re still expected to do all of the same things
And so now we outsource a lot of that parenting work
and mainly women of color
We don t give it financial cultural value
and so we don t see it as real work
Care is really the backbone of our society
That work is what makes all other work possible
So how should we support parents in the workplace
There are only two industrialized countries in the entire world
that don t guarantee some paid family leave
and the United States is one of them
We should be envying Ghana
we re lagging behind the world on this
When I say paid family leave
I m not talking about necessarily just newborn maternity leave
families that are adopting and welcoming a new child into their home
people bringing foster children into their home
taking care of aging parents
You know at some point in your life
someone that you love and care about is going to need help
You should have the right to take time to take care of them
People do their best work
when they feel seen and supported by the people that they work for
Being a parent is often seen as a weakness in the workplace
You come back and people make a lot of assumptions about you
You're not invited to go on work trips
because assumptions are made that you don t want to do that
And that can be really disempowering to people
and it s really discouraging
in a period of time that s already stressful
can make you feel even worse
Asking a coworker about how things are going at home
making people feel like they don t have to hide that
What s up with your two year old
Ask to see a picture of their child
For parents the hours between pm are really crucial
It s sometimes the only time you really have with your kids
You re often running to pick them up somewhere
or to relieve someone from doing childcare
I would much rather send a few emails at pm than be on a call at pm
And so I think emphasizing and creating a culture of work
where it s the work that gets done
the work is what matters
the end result is what matters
as opposed to tracking time in a traditional way
and opening up the lines of communication around that can be really beneficial
Letting a coworker know that you have their back
if they want to say that doesn t work for them as a meeting time
that you ll step in and say that you can t do it either right
Just something to show solidarity
as a former breastfeeding mother in an office place
I should say that if you want to clean out your office fridge every now and then
that is a really beautiful thing to do for a pumping mother
because I used to do that in my office
I would put my little cooler that had breast milk amid like
year old bottles of salad dressing
pad thai that had become petrified
And no one should have to do that right
Again a very very small thing
that makes a big difference in someone s life
In striving to be as efficient as possible
we ve drifted away from this notion of care
and parenting being important work
But we need to talk about these things
and bring parenting and family life out into the open
because we can't fix problems that we don't see
We can t fix problems that we don t talk about
It really doesn t have to be this hard
and we can do much more to support people
