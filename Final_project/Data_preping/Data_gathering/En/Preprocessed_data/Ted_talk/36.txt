things new parents should consider before going back to work
when i was pregnant i just got very frustrated
don t eat deli meats do this particular prenatal test
why did you make that choice why didn t you make a different choice
i felt like i was being told to do things and i never got the answer to why
the way we work
sometimes in the world of modern parenting you just can t seem to win
if i go back to work i spend less time with my kid
what if they don t get the attention they need to adequately develop
if i stay home and give up my income stream
will i look back and regret my decision
there s a lot of conflicting advice out there
about whether to stay home or go back to work
so trying to make a choice between the two can be confusing and emotional
you love your kids and want what s best for them
but how do you determine what best means when everyone has a different opinion
there are many variations of parents that a household can have
and i think more families should be asking the question
of whether it makes sense for the male partner to stay home
but the truth is that in the current time
most of the discussions about stay at home parents
focus on women in particular
and it s usually the women who say they feel
that what they do during the day is going to determine at a deep level
what kind of mom and person they are
that is a huge weight to put on yourself as a parent
and when you re met with the side eye
after telling someone you re going back to work or not
it can poke holes in your confidence
i decided to dig in and find out
is it better to stay at home or go back to work
it s an emotional decision yes
but as an economist i ve learned that we can use data
to help navigate through those emotional decisions
and feel confident we re making the best decision for our family
specifically there are three main factors you should consider before you decide
first you need to think about
how this decision will affect your family budget
let s do some numbers
say your total household income is dollars
with you and your partner making each
that means you bring home about dollars after taxes
if both of you work
and the family pays dollars a month for childcare
your total disposable income would be dollars a year
are you with me so far
if you decide to stay home
your family makes less but you don t pay for childcare
your disposable income goes down in this scenario
but not by as much as it would if you didn t factor in the childcare
it becomes more complicated if childcare is more expensive in your area
a full time nanny can run dollars a year
depending on where you live
if that s the case in your neighborhood in the scenario i outlined
it would completely wipe out one parent s income
and you d be better off financially with one parent staying home
of course this is only a short term analysis
childcare is less expensive sometimes when kids are in school
and you may make a higher income later so you want to factor that in if you can
once you ve done the math you ll know what s possible
and you ll be able to make a more informed choice
which should feel empowering
second it s time to talk about what s best for your child
you may think this should be the core of your decision
but there s actually no right answer
according to studies from europe and the us
the decision to go back to work or stay at home
won t actually make or break your child s future success
research shows that two parents working full time
has a similar effect on your child s future test scores and income
to one parent working and one not
what seems to be most important is the environment
your child is in during their spare time
as long as they re engaging in enriching activities
reading practicing their motor skills interacting with other kids
they re going to thrive whether or not you re at home
there is a bit of nuance in the data
for example studies have found
that if both parents work
kids from poorer families are impacted positively
and kids from richer families are impacted less positively
so depending on your household configuration
the effects on your child could be a little positive
or a little negative
but the overall impact is negligible
now i want to call out an exception maternity leave
there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that babies do better
when their mothers take some maternity leave
the early days with your child can impact their development
so if you have paid leave you should take it
and if you don t maybe consider
taking some unpaid leave for those first few months
if your budget allows
and finally ask yourself what do i want
while this may seem simple
it s the factor that feels most taboo to explore
in talking to parents i find that when a woman chooses to stay home
she often feels obligated to say
she made this choice for her children s optimal development
which sure can be part of the reason
but a perfectly acceptable answer is this is the lifestyle i prefer
or this is what works for my family
the same goes for the working mother
saying i like my job and that s why i went back to work is enough
if you want to go back to work that s great
you re lucky to have a job that you love
and you have every right to keep it once you become a parent
be honest with yourself about what you d like to do
if you re upfront about that you re guaranteed to feel happier
which will allow you to be the best version of a parent you can be
and isn t that the whole point
there is no right and wrong when it comes to parenting
the best decision is the one
that will make you and your family the happiest
up to you to decide what s next
by acknowledging that the choice to stay home or not
is just that a choice
with factors pushing you in various directions
we can ditch the guilt and enjoy doing what feels best for our families
