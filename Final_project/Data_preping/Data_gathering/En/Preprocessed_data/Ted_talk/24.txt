the secret to being a successful freelancer
i used to be really bad at earning money
early on i was a junior financial planner
and my job was to help people manage their wealth
but my salary was so low that i started riding my bike to work
to save money on gas
and i started a garden to save money on food
now i run a bookkeeping agency
that specifically serves creative businesses
ted the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
this might sound strange coming from a former financial planner
but i m not a fan of capitalism
almost everyone i work with and know and love is an artist including me
so i know the way the system is set up
freelancers and artists are too often way underpaid
they often feel like focusing on money will corrupt their creativity
or they think they re just not that good at making money anyway
but the truth is we can be good at it
and in fact we have to be
because our freedom is at stake
our freedom to create to influence
and to use the power of money
to change the very exploitation that keeps artists broke to begin with
i m not struggling anymore
and i ve learned a lot since being a financial planner
and i just wanted to share that knowledge
so here s what i ve learned and done
what you do
one what you do
when it comes to your offer
you have to be able to answer the following question
why would anyone hire you over your competition
if you can t answer that question neither can your potential clients
which means you can t charge more for the thing that makes your work special
price becomes a differentiator and bidding becomes a race to the bottom
what sets you apart could be what you do why you do it or how you do it
a string quartet that arranges and plays hip hop medleys
or a branding firm that has a unique way of marketing technology to baby boomers
or a prop and set designer
who s known for crafting beautiful papier m ch miniatures
position yourself
two who you do it for
after you determine what sets you apart
position yourself for your ideal customer
in order for this to be effective you must narrow your focus
without focus you try to be everything for everyone
and you end up being nothing for nobody
then use the kind of language that appeals to your target customer
create the kind of marketing materials or the kind of portfolio that attracts them
then be in the real life and virtual places they are
for example if you re a videographer
and you want to work with mission driven companies
that bring clean water to places where it s scarce
create a video trailer that shows exactly how the power of film moves people to act
talk money
three when it s time to talk money understand the real value that you create
you re not just being compensated for the time that you work on a project
you re being compensated for everything you ve learned
and everything you ve done over the years
that make you excellent at what you do
ask yourself questions like
how does your service impact a customer s bottom line
how do you create efficiencies that generate cost savings
how much money can your customer make
from a product that you helped them create
for example if you re a freelancer that helps youtube creators
develop merch like t shirts and dad hats
mention how much money you ve helped your clients generate
or if you ve created a diversity and inclusion training program
for corporations
talk about how much time and money a company saves purchasing your product
instead of developing their own
pricing
four make sure your price includes your taxes your overhead and your profit
when you re a freelancer you are your own business
so you re responsible for marketing
accounting taxes legal insurance
overhead and profit
if you price too low
you ve already negotiated against yourself
and if a potential customer balks at your pricing
don t apologize
just say that you re running a business
and you can t afford to do the work for less
instead of corrupting your creativity
focusing on making more money could actually enhance it
by giving you the freedom of choice
because when you earn enough working with clients that value your work
you don t have to compromise by working with clients who don t
