how to help employees with disabilities thrive
all around the world
there s a huge disability employment gap
in most countries
the unemployment rate for people with disabilities
is twice that of people without disabilities
often it s as high as percent
there are over a billion people in the world living with a disability
to have percent of us unemployed
that s so much untapped potential
the way we work
as someone with a paralyzed arm and living with a mental health disability
who s worked in the financial sector and entertainment and tech
i know that having a disability doesn t bar you from doing good work
so it s shocking to me that this disability employment gap
is so persistent
in the us the americans with disabilities act
prohibits discrimination in hiring
and requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations
and studies show that companies who prioritize disability inclusion
are more profitable overall
so what exactly is the problem
recruiters human resources staff managers
they tend to think of hiring people with disabilities as a social good
or as something they have to do to meet a quota
but they should be hiring disabled people because of our strengths
and all of the value and innovation we can bring
here are three things every workplace can do
to truly welcome people with disabilities
it s not comprehensive but it s a start
make assumptions
first stop making assumptions
our culture tends to treat disability as a medical diagnosis
a tragedy or a charity case
and all of these things are rooted in pity
they prevent us from being seen as peers and equals
these assumptions lead to a lot of avoidance
people tend to not ask us about our lives and hobbies outside of work
or don t invite us to company social outings
there s so much fear about saying the wrong thing
that instead people say nothing at all
they treat disabled people like we re invisible
when all we want is to be seen and heard and accepted
like anyone else
these assumptions also make people jump to conclusions
about what we can and can t do without even asking
for me assuming i can t type because i can t use one of my arms
or assuming a blind person can t be an engineer
when to succeed at work you need to have people who see your full potential
because without that nobody wins
so please take the time to get to know us invite us to things
ask us the same kind of questions you would of any colleague
what drew you to this work what are your goals
what do you hope to do from here
and listen to our answers but also respect our boundaries
if there s something we re not comfortable discussing
we ll let you know
and any time you feel unsure just ask us privately
so we can make those decisions
you can even start by saying
i m still learning how to get better at talking about disability
rethink accessibility
second rethink accessibility and accommodations starting now
disability takes so many different forms
it can be about someone s sight hearing or mobility
it can be adhd dyslexia or chronic pain
about percent of employees with disabilities
have ones that are not apparent
so even if you don t think there are people with disabilities
in your organization there probably are
and that s why i strongly recommend that workplaces create spaces
with disability and accessibility in mind
that way you re paving the way for future employees
clients and customers
who might benefit from accommodations too
at one of my first jobs at an investment bank
the company did something cool
within a month of starting i and all other new hires
got an ergonomic assessment of our workstations
they actually had a person thinking about my access needs in multiple ways
like getting a foot rest and keyboard wrist pad
which a lot of colleagues got
to asking if i might benefit from speech to text technology
because i type with one hand
i ve always tried to find these little hacks
to make my work environment more comfortable
but the fact that this person offered so many options proactively
it made me feel so welcome
without making me feel like my needs were special
it would be amazing if every employer could do some version of this
i mean why not
but there are also more simple things that can make an impact
like what about listing accessibility information
if you re hosting an event
or automatically turning on captions for video meetings
another way to think about this is
what do my employees need in order to thrive
it starts with equipping people with a variety of tools
embrace flexibility
third embrace flexibility
like disabled people have had to do our whole lives
people with disabilities have been advocating for remote work environments
and flexible hours for decades now
and it took a pandemic for the world to realize it could happen
all of a sudden this thing that seemed so wild
has become commonplace
and this isn t the first time i can think of
when an accommodation for people with disabilities
ended up improving life for society at large
audiobooks curb cuts closed captioning even electric toothbrushes
disability is so often the root of innovation
so as we get back to the office
let s remember that all of us can thrive with flexibility
for people with disabilities
let s provide the option to work remotely
at the hours when we can be the most productive
from wherever works best
i mean some of us do great working from our bed
and really let s hold on to the openness that we can work around everyone s needs
let s keep finding ways to embrace flexibility
as part of our company s culture
we know that companies need to work harder on hiring us retaining us
promoting us paying us fairly and amplifying our efforts
to do that we need to stop making assumptions
rethink accessibility and embrace flexibility
that is what will help close the disability employment gap
