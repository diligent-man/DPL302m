how to introduce new ways of working that will actually stick
the way we work is evolving
practically every moment of every day
new approaches keep emerging
and the pressure to innovate is high
but too often even the most promising new ideas
can fail to get across the finish line

i m professor david schonthal
and i ve spent my career thinking
about why some new ideas businesses and systems succeed
while others especially good ones end up failing
over and over i ve seen great ideas
that never make it off the ground
and it s not because the ideas aren t worthy many are
instead it s because of how they re introduced
into the world
as it turns out
there s some fascinating and predictable human factors
that can stop new ideas in their tracks
my colleague loran nordgren and i
call these human factors frictions
frictions are the psychological forces that oppose change
the four we ve identified are
number one inertia
our overwhelming tendency to stick with what we know
even though we know the current system is inadequate
friction number two effort
the perceived exertion required
in order to make a change happen
the third friction is emotion
the unintended negative emotions triggered
by the suggested change
and number four is reactance
our impulse to resist being changed by others
or what i like to call
the don t tell me what to do friction
so when it comes to introducing new ways of working
how can we overcome these frictions
let me give you a couple of examples
for example number one
let s say your company is switching over
to a new internal software system
you and the tech team are confident
that this change will help make everyone s life easier
and save the company money
but when you announce it
you re surprised to meet a lot of resistance
people aren t eagerly signing up for the training
and they re saying you know what
i m cool
i m just gonna stick with the existing system
turns out you ve triggered the friction of inertia
people feel like they re being forced to leave a system
that they re comfortable with
and even though the new software
will make everyone s life easier
the human instinct to resist change is getting in the way
one tactic to avoid triggering this friction
is to shrink the size of the change
in other words position the change
not as one big major system shift
but as a series of smaller experiments
could we try this new software out for a month or two
and then decide whether or not
it should become our new system
starting small and framing new ideas as experiments
are useful tactics
because they make the change less intimidating
plus people know that experiments can be undone
or even totally fail
and here s example number two
let s say and tell me if this sounds familiar
your company wants the organization
to embrace a new commitment to innovation
the friction that this could trigger is effort
meaning people feel like they need to take on
all of the cognitive effort of figuring out
exactly what this change means for them
and how to build it into their day to day responsibilities
for employees directives like be more innovative
are ambiguous and often confusing
instead of feeling inspired and motivated
people feel paralyzed
one tactic for making this idea feel less ambiguous
is road mapping
turn this big directive into a series of steps
now getting concrete in this way
can not only help a team see where you re asking them to go
but they can see how to get there
ultimately the secret to getting buy in
to new ways of working
is about anticipating the frictions
that your change could stir up
and then putting just as much thought
into how you introduce those ideas
as you put into designing the idea itself
the results of doing this can be even more valuable
than generating simple buy in
you might even see the transformation of your listeners
from passive recipients of an idea
to enthusiastic champions of new ways of working
