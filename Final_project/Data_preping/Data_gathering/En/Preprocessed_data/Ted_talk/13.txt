How to introduce new ways of workingâ€¦ that will actually stick
and the pressure to innovate is high
But too often even the most promising new ideas
can fail to get across the finish line
about why some new ideas businesses and systems succeed
while others - especially good ones - end up failing
Over and over I've seen great ideas
that never make it off the ground
and it's not because the ideas aren't worthy many are
Instead it's because of how they're introduced
there's some fascinating - and predictable - human factors
that can stop new ideas in their tracks
Frictions are the psychological forces that oppose change
Our overwhelming tendency to stick with what we know
even though we know the current system is inadequate
in order to make a change happen
Our impulse to resist being changed by others
the don't tell me what to do Friction
So when it comes to introducing new ways of working
Let me give you a couple of examples
let's say your company is switching over
You and the tech team are confident
that this change will help make everyone's life easier
you're surprised to meet a lot of resistance
People aren't eagerly signing up for the training
I'm just gonna stick with the existing system
Turns out you've triggered the Friction of Inertia
People feel like they're being forced to leave a system
the human instinct to resist change is getting in the way
One tactic to avoid triggering this Friction
is to shrink the size of the change
not as one big major system shift
but as a series of smaller experiments
Could we try this new software out for a month or two
Starting small and framing new ideas as experiments
because they make the change less intimidating -
plus people know that experiments can be undone
Let's say and tell me if this sounds familiar
to embrace a new commitment to innovation
The Friction that this could trigger is effort -
meaning people feel like they need to take on
all of the cognitive effort of figuring out
exactly what this change means for them
and how to build it into their day-to-day responsibilities
For employees directives like be more innovative
One tactic for making this idea feel less ambiguous
Turn this big directive into a series of steps
can not only help a team see where you're asking them to go
but they can see how to get there
and then putting just as much thought
as you put into designing the idea itself
The results of doing this can be even more valuable
You might even see the transformation of your listeners
to enthusiastic champions of new ways of working
