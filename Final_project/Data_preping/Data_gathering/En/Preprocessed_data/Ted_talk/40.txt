This is what makes employees happy at work
We survey CEOs police officers truck drivers cooks engineers
If people are working we've surveyed them
And what we know in terms of their happiness
There's three billion working people in the world
And about percent of them would say they're happy at work
That means about billion or almost two billion people
both to those people and the organizations that they work in
Organizations that have a lot of happy employees
compared to organizations where that's not true
They outperform the stock market by a factor of three
And if you look at employee turnover
it's half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees
you don't have to spend more money to make this happen
It's not about ping pong tables and massages and pet walking
It's all about how they're treated by their leaders
and by the people that they work with
So I'd like to share a few ideas that create happy employees
what you find is two things are present
And then when an employee needs a laptop
So for the employee all the words are right
but levels of approval for a laptop
You've actually spent more money than the laptop on the approval
And the employee feels maybe they're really not trusted
So what can an organization do to have a high level of trust
The first organization that comes to mind is Four Seasons
They have magnificent properties all around the world
Do whatever you think is right when servicing the customer
To hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right
And this is why they're known for delivering some of the best service
The thing that erodes trust in an organization
is when employees feel that they're being treated unfairly
Employees want to be treated the same
regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age
or their experience or their job category
When I think about great organizations who get fairness right
the first organization that comes to mind is Salesforce
They found that men and women working in the same job
and they invested three million dollars to try and balance things out
So to be a listener who connects with all types of people
we have to unlearn a few things
We've all been taught about active listening and eye contact
Repeating what the person says that's not listening
and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible
And employees can feel whether you're doing that or not
They want to know when they talk to you and share an idea
did you consider it when you made a decision
The one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they're speaking
is to know that what they say matters so much
Otherwise what's the point of the conversation
We all know the things we need to change
the things that we need to do differently
The way you behave the way you treat others
the way you respond the way you support
defines the work experience for everyone around you
the world is littered with those failures
But changing because there's something you believe in
where you're willing to risk almost everything
If it's not you should probably find a different place to work
