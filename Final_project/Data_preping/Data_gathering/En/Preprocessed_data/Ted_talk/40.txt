this is what makes employees happy at work
we survey ceos police officers truck drivers cooks engineers
if people are working we ve surveyed them
and what we know in terms of their happiness
workers all want the same things
the way we work
there s three billion working people in the world
and about percent of them would say they re happy at work
that means about billion or almost two billion people
are not happy at work
what does that do
both to those people and the organizations that they work in
well let s talk about money
organizations that have a lot of happy employees
have three times the revenue growth
compared to organizations where that s not true
they outperform the stock market by a factor of three
and if you look at employee turnover
it s half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees
the miracle thing is
you don t have to spend more money to make this happen
it s not about ping pong tables and massages and pet walking
it s not about the perks
it s all about how they re treated by their leaders
and by the people that they work with
so i d like to share a few ideas that create happy employees
idea number one
in organizations where employees are happy
what you find is two things are present
trust and respect
leaders often say
we trust our employees
we empower our employees
and then when an employee needs a laptop
and this is a true example
people have to approve that laptop
so for the employee all the words are right
but levels of approval for a laptop
you ve actually spent more money than the laptop on the approval
and the employee feels maybe they re really not trusted
so what can an organization do to have a high level of trust
the first organization that comes to mind is four seasons
they have magnificent properties all around the world
and their employees are told
do whatever you think is right when servicing the customer
to hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right
makes the employees feel great
and this is why they re known for delivering some of the best service
in the world
idea number two fairness
the thing that erodes trust in an organization
faster than anything else
is when employees feel that they re being treated unfairly
employees want to be treated the same
regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age
or their experience or their job category
compared to anyone else
when i think about great organizations who get fairness right
the first organization that comes to mind is salesforce
they found that men and women working in the same job
with the same level of proficiency
were making different amounts of money
so immediately they calculated the difference
and they invested three million dollars to try and balance things out
idea number three is listening
so to be a listener who connects with all types of people
we have to unlearn a few things
we ve all been taught about active listening and eye contact
an intense stare
and a compassionate look
that s not listening
repeating what the person says that s not listening
being humble
and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible
that s what listening is
and employees can feel whether you re doing that or not
they want to know when they talk to you and share an idea
did you consider it when you made a decision
the one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they re speaking
is to know that what they say matters so much
you might actually change your mind
otherwise what s the point of the conversation
we all know the things we need to change
the things that we need to do differently
the way you behave the way you treat others
the way you respond the way you support
defines the work experience for everyone around you
changing to be a better person
the world is littered with those failures
but changing because there s something you believe in
some purpose that you have
where you re willing to risk almost everything
because it s so important to you
that s the reason to change
if it s not you should probably find a different place to work
