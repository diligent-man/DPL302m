how your unique story can get you hired
you re sitting at your computer about to apply for your dream job
but then thoughts start to go through your head
that this is a waste of your time
maybe you re thinking
my parents didn t go to college
or i have a learning disability
when i went on their website
and i looked at the folks in the most senior level roles
i didn t see anyone who represented my race or my gender
there s just no way i m going to get this job
so you don t even submit the application
but i m here to tell you that your self doubt
about your experiences can be the key
to driving your career success
the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
most of us experience self doubt at high stakes moments
especially if they re people of color
first generation college student
or they don t have a traditional background
so they don t fit the mold
if that s you you re a part of my community
what i ve realized is that these experiences
that seem like a liability
are actually your differentiating strength
the secret is to transform how you perceive your own story
even if you ve been on an untraditional path
you ve accrued some skills over time
that are really valuable in the workforce
your task is to identify those experiences and trumpet them
because it s likely that story
that is your ticket to a great job
i know this because i had my own self doubts
that i had to overcome
i didn t have top notch internships in college
i also wasn t an extraordinary student
by the time graduation came around
i was definitely the thank you laude versus the cum laude
what i didn t realize was that i was really good
at connecting with people
and now as a talent nerd and a ceo
i ve watched thousands of graduates
who actually had a lot of self doubts overcome those
and accomplish goals they never thought were imaginable
and here s how
ask yourself two questions
the first is why do you want to do this work
maybe you already know the kind of job or work environment
that makes you happy
or maybe you haven t quite figured that out yet
usually your personal experiences can help give you clues
for example did your grandmother do manual labor
and it made you really worry that she didn t get access
to high quality healthcare
did your brother have to overcome his dyslexia
and you helped him with his reading
and so you became really attuned to education policy
when you re in an interview
go ahead and talk about them
because it will show your passion
and your dedication to the work
one young person i know dylan
was not sharing his personal story
about filling out immigration papers for his parents
when he was younger
often when he told it
people would think that his parents weren t sophisticated
dylan realized that he needed to harness the power
of that incredible story
along with his academic talents
he told it in a way when he was applying to law school
that made it clear why he wanted to go into advocacy law
he is now in his third year at georgetown law
the second question you have to ask yourself is
how can i share my story
to showcase the unique strengths i will bring to the work
for example did you have to work multiple jobs
while you were in college that did not at all align
with your major
that shows an employer that you have time management skills
and a strong work ethic
did you need to drop out of college
because one of your parents was sick
fill in the gap
talk about how you administered their treatment plan
talk about how you had to work around their complex schedules
that shows that you re thoughtful
that you re compassionate and you know what
that is what makes a great teammate
reframing the hardship in your story
can remake your confidence over and over again
but it takes time
it s like running a marathon
you have to train and practice
go back and reflect on those tough questions
that you need to answer
the answers are what makes you you
and i have to tell you
when you learn to practice that story
tell it with conviction
i am sure that the hiring manager
is going to hear the strength in it too
