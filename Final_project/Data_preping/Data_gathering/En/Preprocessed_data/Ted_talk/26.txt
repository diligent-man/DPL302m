How your unique story can get you hired
You're sitting at your computer about to apply for your dream job
but then thoughts start to go through your head
that this is a waste of your time
and I looked at the folks in the most senior level roles
I didn't see anyone who represented my race or my gender
There's just no way I'm going to get this job
So you don't even submit the application
But I'm here to tell you that your self doubt
about your experiences can be the key
Made possible with the support of Dropbox
Most of us experience self doubt at high stakes moments
or they don't have a traditional background
If that's you you're a part of my community
What I've realized is that these experiences
The secret is to transform how you perceive your own story
Even if you've been on an untraditional path
that are really valuable in the workforce
Your task is to identify those experiences and trumpet them
that is your ticket to a great job
I know this because I had my own self doubts
I didn't have top notch internships in college
I was definitely the thank you laude versus the cum laude
What I didn't realize was that I was really good
and now as a talent nerd and a CEO
who actually had a lot of self doubts overcome those
and accomplish goals they never thought were imaginable
The first is why do you want to do this work
Maybe you already know the kind of job or work environment
or maybe you haven't quite figured that out yet
Usually your personal experiences can help give you clues
For example did your grandmother do manual labor
and it made you really worry that she didn't get access
Did your brother have to overcome his dyslexia
and you helped him with his reading
And so you became really attuned to education policy
about filling out immigration papers for his parents
people would think that his parents weren't sophisticated
Dylan realized that he needed to harness the power
He told it in a way when he was applying to law school
that made it clear why he wanted to go into advocacy law
He is now in his third year at Georgetown Law
The second question you have to ask yourself is
to showcase the unique strengths I will bring to the work
For example did you have to work multiple jobs
while you were in college that did not at all align
That shows an employer that you have time management skills
Did you need to drop out of college
because one of your parents was sick
talk about how you administered their treatment plan
Talk about how you had to work around their complex schedules
that you're compassionate and you know what
that is what makes a great teammate
can remake your confidence over and over again
Go back and reflect on those tough questions
The answers are what makes you you
when you learn to practice that story
I am sure that the hiring manager
is going to hear the strength in it too
