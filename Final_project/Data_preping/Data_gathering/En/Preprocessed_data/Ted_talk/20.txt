how to reduce bias in your workplace
we all have our biases
the set of assumptions that we make and the things we don t notice
about people s race gender religion
sexual orientation appearance and other traits
they come from the part of our mind that jumps to conclusions
that we might not even be aware that we have
trier bryant i really can t tell you
the number of times people assumed i was a receptionist
when i was an executive at the company
ks that kind of bias gets in the way of good collaboration
performance and decision making
tb it creates an invisible tax of resentment and frustration
the more frustrated we are the more silent we are likely to be
and the more silent we are
the less we may be able to do our best work
the good news though is bias is not inevitable
the way we work
tb so here s how to disrupt bias in three steps
the first step is to create a shared vocabulary
sometimes bias shows up in big embarrassing gaffes
but more often it comes out in the little words and phrases we choose
which are packed with assumptions
in meetings especially these often go unnoticed or even worse
people notice but don t know what to say
that s why we recommend coming up with a shared word or phrase
that everyone agrees to use to disrupt biased attitudes or behaviors
examples teams are using are bias alert stop light
or even throwing up a peace sign
ks leaders often ask us to give them the right words
but the best words are the ones your team will actually say
not the ones that leaders impose
so talk to your team
my very favorite is the one that you recommended trier
purple flag
when someone says or does something biased
we ll say purple flag
maybe we ll even wave a purple flag
it s not a red flag
it s a friendly purple flag
tb it helps us become more aware of our blind spots
ks purple flag
tb purple flag
thanks for pointing that out
i ve been noticing lately i use a lot of sight metaphors
that often portray disabilities like being visually impaired
in negative ways
but i m committed to doing better and working on it
ks i am too
another great shared vocabulary trick is to ask members of your team
to respond to bias with an i statement
an i statement invites the other person in
to understand things from your perspective rather than calling them out
like i don t think you re going to take me seriously
when you re calling me honey
or i don t think you meant that the way that it sounded
usually when people s biases are pointed out to them
clearly and compassionately
they apologize and correct things going forward
usually but not always
tb that brings us to the second step
create a shared norm for how to respond
when your bias is pointed out
ks when my bias is flagged
i can only be glad that i m learning something new
if i can move past the shame
i hate the idea that i ve harmed someone
and when i feel ashamed i rarely respond well
so it s really helpful to have that shared norm
so that i know what to say in those moments
tb we recommend you start with thank you for pointing that out
it took courage for that person to disrupt the bias
so it s important to acknowledge that
then there are two choices on what to say next
one i get it
or two i don t get it
could you explain more after the meeting
ks the other day
you and i were recording a podcast and i said
hr serves three masters
and you waved the purple flag
i knew what i had done wrong
why was i using a slavery metaphor
we hit pause
i thanked you and we rerecorded
it was no big deal
the thing i love about the purple flag is how efficient it is
tb flagging the bias didn t prevent us from getting the work done
in fact it helps us work together more honestly
ks it s even harder when i don t know what i did wrong
once i asked someone out to lunch
out came the purple flag
i had no idea why
so i was relieved to know what to say next
thank you for pointing it out but i don t get it
could we talk after the meeting
afterwards the person reminded me that they were fasting for ramadan
it instantly made sense to me
and i discovered something that i could be more aware of
but to get to awareness i had to move through shame
it was hard to say i don t get it
the shared norm helped me listen and learn
rather than getting defensive
the fact that there was a norm at all
reassured me that other people are making similar kinds of mistakes
and that we re all learning together
tb disrupting bias may start off feeling uncomfortable
but with time and consistency
we can build the stamina we need to push through it
when it becomes routine for us to notice our biases
all of a sudden they feel less threatening
it s hard to break bias habits
yet we can change the pattern with consistent effort
ks we ve got to be patient with ourselves and with others
tb patient and also persistent
which brings us to our last step
once a team has come up with a shared vocabulary
and agrees on the shared norm for how to respond
the team should commit to disrupting bias at least once in every meeting
ks if bias isn t flagged in a meeting it doesn t mean there wasn t any bias
it just means either nobody noticed
or nobody knew what to say
when we are silent about bias we reinforce it
and it can t be just the targets of bias who point it out
observers and leaders have got to speak up
we all have a responsibility
tb by making a practice of disrupting bias quickly and kindly
we prevent it from metastasizing into something worse
like prejudice bullying
discrimination or harassment
ks bias disrupters a shared vocabulary
a shared norm and a shared commitment
ensure that we notice and learn from the mistakes that we are all making
so that we can work better together
tb when we collaborate
we use our full capacity as humans to get more done collectively
than we could ever dream of accomplishing as individuals
so let s stop letting bias get in the way
