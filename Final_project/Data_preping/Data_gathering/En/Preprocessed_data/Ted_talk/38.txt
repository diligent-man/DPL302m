ways to create stronger connections
so when was the last time that you wrote a handwritten note
it s probably been a while
the way we work
technology has changed the way we communicate
we send emails not letters
text messages not phone calls
we order delivery instead of cooking dinners in our kitchen
all in the name of efficiency
but here s the point
technology has made it easier to communicate
but it hasn t made it easier to connect
with other human beings
i ve found that the secret to connecting
in the high tech fast paced world that we live in
is doing a few small things the old fashioned way
write a letter
i ve written thousands of handwritten notes
thanking people for advice thanking them for an interview
it just puts that extra effort to show someone that you really care
and that you re willing to go above and beyond
some advice for writing a thank you letter is to really make it clear
to the person that you re writing to
the impact that they have had on your life
talk about something specific
like thank you for the advice that you gave me
it s because of the advice you gave me that i am now doing x
people are looking to make a difference
and so if you can show someone that they ve really had an impact
on the life that you re living the life you re pursuing
it could have a huge impact
pick up the phone and dial
we ve hired thousands of employees
and i ve personally called every single one of them
to welcome them to the compass family
i m able to set the tone of really what i want the company to be
where you know people go above and beyond
to make people feel welcomed and to give people a sense of belonging
and sometimes i call people on their last day of work
when people leave sometimes they re more transparent
than they ever were when they were still at the company
and so it s a great opportunity to get feedback
that is very hard to get otherwise
ask interesting and meaningful questions when you get outside of the office
when i m traveling the country
every night i ll have dinner with people in the company
and i like to ask questions like what s your underlying motivation
what s something that s happened this week that meant a lot to you
and when you go around the table
and people really open up and are able to engage
it sets a different tone
when people come back to the office
they can see each other and they know each other in a deeper way
answer questions with honesty
you know how it feels when you go into an elevator
and someone says how was your weekend
it could ve been the best weekend ever you could ve met the love of your life
and you would say good how was yours
if you want to connect with people then you have to open up
i m not always that good at it and i imagine most people aren t
but that s why being open stands out so much
because most people aren t
turn the video on
i would always recommend a videoconference over a phone call
because that s when you can see the real personality come out
when you re on video you re forced to be present
it s almost a forcing mechanism to be in the moment
nobody succeeds alone
the more you can take time
to develop genuine authentic relationships
the more you re going to be able to realize your dreams
you re going to be able to take big risks and know that there s a network of people
to cheer you on and to support your efforts
