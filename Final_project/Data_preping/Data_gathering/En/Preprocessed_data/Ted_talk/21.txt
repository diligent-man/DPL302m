Want to truly succeed Lift others up while you climb
the analogy we've been given is a ladder
seeing just how high we can get
But if we want to be a part of organizations
and truly reflect the world that we live in
While we climb we also need to lift
that our companies and organizations rarely have leadership teams
That makes them less effective in their work
We need more women steering the ship
more people of color at the helm
more queer and trans folks calling the shots
who’s a proud member of one or more of these groups
or a longtime leader who is none of the above
each of us has a role to play in making this happen
Success is no longer about our individual ambitions
but about how we build something greater together
My mother introduced me to this concept of lifting while you climb
She was an absolute powerhouse in her work
and she spent so much of her time working with younger Black women
that the point of success isn’t success for success’s sake
She said that when you climb that ladder and you get to the top
you can take a moment to enjoy the view
but you must be principally concerned with using all of your might
to throw the ladder back down for those who are coming behind you
There’s no point in being the first if we’re also the last
So here are three ways that all of us
whether you’re a first in your company or a part of a deep legacy
is being around people whose experiences mirror your own
I want to ask you to really examine who’s there with you
people who look like your customers clients patients and community
If not I need you to ask why
If we don't name it we can't change it
we have a lot of data that women get interrupted during presentations
So make counting this an activity that you try in meetings
how often do women or nonbinary folks get interrupted
and how often are men getting interrupted
Add up your tally at the end of the week
Address it in the meeting if you can
Practice saying Hey Fred I think you interrupted June
Or if that feels like too much
you can just hand the mic back to June
When you notice it happening speak up
It’s a chance to give yourself and others the opportunity to show up better
Mentorship is making a connection for someone
helping them know when to ask for a promotion
It's great but we can do even better
Sponsorship is using your privilege your position your power
to give opportunities to someone else who’s traditionally been excluded
It’s not just saying that someone would excel in a make-or-break project
and helping them make it across the finish line
It’s sending their finished project to senior leaders
and letting them know how strong you thought it was
When the work gets picked up and used
it's reminding people where it came from
sponsorship happens right there in the front
not just before the meeting but in the meeting
not just on the private thread but in that big group email
Finally pass on the chance for glory
Think about how you can create opportunities
for the people in your organization who might not get them as often
The next time you’re asked to do a panel
consider offering your seat to someone who also has bold and imaginative ideas
but might be overlooked because of their race or gender
Take someone who wouldn’t normally have access to the meeting
If you’ve been running an ideation session for a while
talk them through what’s worked in the past and what hasn’t
It’s on the leadership of your company or your organization
to set goals and metrics for hiring equitably
but when it comes to inclusion and celebrating others
You can go to someone who doesn’t share your identities
You can amplify the work of a colleague
who might be the only person like them on the team
You may think about where you first started in this work
and feel so proud of what you've learned
and how brave you’ve been as you climbed
I need you to hold that feeling
because what good is our power and success
what use is it making it to the top
if all it affords us is a bird’s-eye view of everyone we’ve left behind
If your journey in inclusion feels easy
feel accomplished in your commitment to equity
but also feel like you have more work to do
