want to truly succeed lift others up while you climb
when it comes to our careers
the analogy we ve been given is a ladder
we re climbing climbing climbing
seeing just how high we can get
but if we want to be a part of organizations
that are diverse and inclusive
and truly reflect the world that we live in
that s simply not enough
while we climb we also need to lift
the way we work
music
it s no secret
that our companies and organizations rarely have leadership teams
that represent the communities they serve
that makes them less effective in their work
less innovative
and less profitable too
we need more women steering the ship
more people of color at the helm
more folks with disabilities in charge
more immigrants setting the tone
more queer and trans folks calling the shots
so whether you re a new hire
who s a proud member of one or more of these groups
or a longtime leader who is none of the above
each of us has a role to play in making this happen
success is no longer about our individual ambitions
but about how we build something greater together
my mother introduced me to this concept of lifting while you climb
she was an absolute powerhouse in her work
and she spent so much of her time working with younger black women
to help advance them too
she would remind me
that the point of success isn t success for success s sake
she said that when you climb that ladder and you get to the top
you can take a moment to enjoy the view
but you must be principally concerned with using all of your might
to throw the ladder back down for those who are coming behind you
there s no point in being the first if we re also the last
so here are three ways that all of us
whether you re a first in your company or a part of a deep legacy
can embrace this spirit
question your surroundings
question your surroundings
one of the benefits
and really the consequences of privilege
is being around people whose experiences mirror your own
so when you re at the table
i want to ask you to really examine who s there with you
and even more importantly
who isn t
do you see women
people of color
people with disabilities
people who look like your customers clients patients and community
if not i need you to ask why
calling it out matters
if we don t name it we can t change it
once you notice these disparities
let s do something about it
for example
we have a lot of data that women get interrupted during presentations
more than men do
so make counting this an activity that you try in meetings
where there s multiple people presenting
keep a tally
how often do women or nonbinary folks get interrupted
and how often are men getting interrupted
add up your tally at the end of the week
and if you notice discrepancies
talk about them
talk about them in the moment
address it in the meeting if you can
practice saying hey fred i think you interrupted june
june can you repeat that
or if that feels like too much
you can just hand the mic back to june
hey june what were you saying
i think i missed it
when you notice it happening speak up
it s a chance to give yourself and others the opportunity to show up better
aim for sponsorship
aim for sponsorship over mentorship
mentorship is making a connection for someone
giving them advice
helping them know when to ask for a promotion
it s great but we can do even better
sponsorship is using your privilege your position your power
to give opportunities to someone else who s traditionally been excluded
it s not just saying that someone would excel in a make or break project
but getting in there
and helping them make it across the finish line
it s sending their finished project to senior leaders
and letting them know how strong you thought it was
when the work gets picked up and used
it s reminding people where it came from
and who produced it
if mentorship happens behind the scenes
sponsorship happens right there in the front
not just before the meeting but in the meeting
not just on the private thread but in that big group email
because the platitudes
the kind of half stepping
it s not cutting it
pass on the chance
finally pass on the chance for glory
think about how you can create opportunities
for the people in your organization who might not get them as often
the next time you re asked to do a panel
consider offering your seat to someone who also has bold and imaginative ideas
but might be overlooked because of their race or gender
or disability
and then help that person prepare
take someone who wouldn t normally have access to the meeting
and bring them in with you
not to observe
but to present with you
if you ve been running an ideation session for a while
pass it on to someone new
keep the calendar invite intact
talk them through what s worked in the past and what hasn t
so that they can excel too
pass on your institutional knowledge
it s on the leadership of your company or your organization
to set goals and metrics for hiring equitably
and bringing in more diverse employees
but when it comes to inclusion and celebrating others
you can help with that
you can go to someone who doesn t share your identities
to partner on a project
you can amplify the work of a colleague
who might be the only person like them on the team
you may think about where you first started in this work
and feel so proud of what you ve learned
and how brave you ve been as you climbed
i need you to hold that feeling
please hold that feeling
but also chase that feeling
because what good is our power and success
what use is it making it to the top
if all it affords us is a bird s eye view of everyone we ve left behind
if your journey in inclusion feels easy
you have packed too light
so feel proud
feel uplifted
feel accomplished in your commitment to equity
but also feel like you have more work to do
because lifting
it s difficult
and your help
it s essential
