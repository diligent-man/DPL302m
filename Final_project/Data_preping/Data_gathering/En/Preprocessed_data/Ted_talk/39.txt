lessons on building a company people enjoy working for
hr jargon makes me crazy
we have to have all these stupid acronyms
that describe things that nobody understands okrs and pips
i think we can run our businesses
by just talking to each other like regular human beings
we might actually get more done
the way we work
i really always wanted to be an hr professional
patty mccord author maven
i wanted to be able to speak the language of management
and you know what i ve learned after all this time
i don t think any of it matters
there s all kinds of things that we call best practices
that aren t best practices at all
how do we know it s best we don t measure this stuff
in fact i ve learned that best practices usually means
copying what everybody else does
our world is changing and evolving all the time
here are some lessons to help you adapt
lesson one your employees are adults
lesson
you know we ve created so many layers
and so many processes and so many guidelines
to keep those employees in place
that we ve ended up with systems that treat people like they re children
and they re not
fully formed adults walk in the door every single day
they have rent payments they have obligations
they re members of society
they want to create a difference in the world
so if we start with the assumption
that everybody comes to work to do an amazing job
you d be surprised what you get
lesson two the job of management isn t to control people
lesson
it s to build great teams
when managers build great teams here s how you know it
they ve done amazing stuff
customers are really happy
those are the metrics that really matter
not the metrics of do you come to work on time
did you take your vacation did you follow the rules
did you ask for permission
lesson three people want to do work that means something
lesson
after they do it they should be free to move on
careers are journeys
nobody s going to want to do the same thing for years
so the idea of keeping people for the sake of keeping them
really hurts both of us
instead what if we created companies that were great places to be from
and everyone who leaves you
becomes an ambassador for not only your product
but who you are and how you operate
and when you spread that kind of excitement throughout the world
then we make all of our companies better
lesson four everyone in your company should understand the business
lesson
now based on the assumption that we ve got smart adults here
the most important thing we can teach them is how our business works
when i look at companies that are moving fast
that are really innovative
and that are doing amazing things with agility and speed
it s because they re collaborative
the best thing that we can do is constantly teach each other what we do
what matters to us what we measure what goodness looks like
so that we can all drive towards achieving the same thing
lesson five everyone in your company should be able to handle the truth
lesson
you know why people say giving feedback is so hard
they don t practice
let s take the annual performance review
what else do you do in your whole life that you re really good at
that you only do once a year
here s what i found
humans can hear anything if it s true
so let s rethink the word feedback
and think about it as telling people the truth the honest truth
about what they re doing right and what they re doing wrong
in the moment when they re doing it
that good thing you just did whoo
that s exactly what i m talking about
go do that again
and people will do that again today three more times
lesson six your company needs to live out its values
lesson
i was talking to a company not long ago to the ceo
he was having trouble because the company was rocky
and things weren t getting done on time
and he felt like things were sloppy
this also was a man who i observed
never showed up to any meeting on time
if you re part of a leadership team
the most important thing that you can do to uphold your values is to live them
people can t be what they can t see
we say yes we re here for equality
and then we proudly pound our chest
because we d achieved percent representation of women
on an executive team
well that s not equal that s percent
lesson seven all start up ideas are stupid
lesson
i spend a lot of time with start ups
and i have a lot of friends that work in larger more established companies
they are always pooh poohing the companies that i work with
that is such a stupid idea
well guess what all start up ideas are stupid
if they were reasonable somebody else would have already been doing them
lesson eight every company needs to be excited for change
lesson
beware of the smoke of nostalgia
if you find yourself saying remember the way it used to be
i want you to shift your thinking to say
think about the way it s going to be
if i had a dream company
i would walk in the door and i would say
everything s changed all bets are off
we were running as fast as we can to the right
and now we ll take a hard left
and everybody would go yes
it s a pretty exciting world out there and it s changing all the time
the more we embrace it and get excited about it
the more fun we re going to have
