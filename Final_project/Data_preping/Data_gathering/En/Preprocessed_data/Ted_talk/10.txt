How to Calm Your Anxiety From a Neuroscientist
You know when you get that ambiguous email from your boss
and you start to feel sweaty palms
and that empty freaked out sensation in your stomach
Most of us think of anxiety as a bad thing
something to be avoided at all costs
What if you could take all of that energy racing around your brain and your body
both the clinical kind and what I call the everyday kind
And many of us are noticing this at work
We might think of anxiety as something
that we'd rather just leave on the side of the road if we could
But anxiety is an important tool that arose during our evolution
So how come we don't even feel vaguely protected by it
It's because the volume of our individual and collective anxiety levels
has been turned way up too high
and too much of even a potentially good thing like anxiety is bad
So I would like to share two powerful science-based tools
for turning down the volume on our anxiety
and helping us get anxiety back to its helpful protective state
And both of these tools begin by connecting with our bodies
This can be one of the most immediate ways to calm anxiety
the natural de-stressing part of our nervous systems
which is inhale deeply on four counts
hold at the top for four counts
and hold at the bottom for four counts
You can even do this in the middle of any anxiety-provoking conversation
have figured this tool out and use it all the time
This one also has immediate positive effects on your mood state
you're releasing a whole bunch of beneficial neurochemicals
that work to both increase positive mood states
I like to say that every single time you move your body
it's like giving yourself a wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals
So when your boss's email comes in and your heart starts to race
try taking a short walk around the block
or even to the supply closet for some sticky notes
put on two of your favorite songs
and dance around the living room like no one is watching
Studies have shown that all it takes is ten minutes of walking
But be creative with your movement session
Whether that's a quick session of power vacuuming a la Mrs
or doing a set of jumping jacks
or getting off the elevator one floor early
to do a power walk up that last flight of stairs
All of these possibilities will all help your anxiety levels come down
In fact I tested this effect on my own NYU students
First I had them take an anxiety assessment
before leading them in a movement session
that included movements from kickbox and dance
Then I had them retake that same anxiety assessment again
their anxiety scores had decreased to normal levels
Now that's powerful real-world example that you can use in your life today
So make sure to incorporate these bursts of activity in your day
and try one out next time you're feeling stress
It can really make your anxiety feel less all-consuming
and turn the volume down on your anxiety
you'll be in a better position to evaluate
Is it that you've taken on too much
or that you feel insecure about a particular skill set
you'll be able to use this emotion anxiety
for exactly what it was evolved to do
warn you about potential dangers so you can become aware of them
and find ways to effectively and creatively address them
Second once you find the warning signals in your anxiety
you'll be able to communicate with others
You might seek out advice from a trusted colleague
Or you might even have a conversation with your boss
Because you're no longer in fight-or-flight mode
asking for that support won't feel nearly as threatening
And one of the best gifts of approaching your anxiety in this way
is that you will be able to notice those telltale signs of anxiety
especially those forms of anxiety you're most familiar with
That will allow you to give that person a smile or a kind word
your own form of anxiety can boost your personal super power of empathy
And I can't think of anything we need in this world today
more than higher levels of empathy for one another
move and take note of what your anxiety is signaling
And that's my wish for every one of us
