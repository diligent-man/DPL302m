how to calm your anxiety from a neuroscientist
you know when you get that ambiguous email from your boss
and you start to feel sweaty palms
and that empty freaked out sensation in your stomach
welcome back anxiety
most of us think of anxiety as a bad thing
something to be avoided at all costs
but what if it weren t
what if you could take all of that energy racing around your brain and your body
and transform it into something helpful
the way we work
global anxiety levels
both the clinical kind and what i call the everyday kind
have increased tremendously in recent years
and many of us are noticing this at work
we might think of anxiety as something
that we d rather just leave on the side of the road if we could
but anxiety is an important tool that arose during our evolution
that we use to avoid danger
it s essential for our survival
so how come we don t even feel vaguely protected by it
it s because the volume of our individual and collective anxiety levels
has been turned way up too high
and too much of even a potentially good thing like anxiety is bad
so i would like to share two powerful science based tools
for turning down the volume on our anxiety
and helping us get anxiety back to its helpful protective state
and both of these tools begin by connecting with our bodies
breathwork
tool number one is breath work
it s just simple deep breathing
slowly inhale and exhale
this can be one of the most immediate ways to calm anxiety
because deep breath directly activates
the natural de stressing part of our nervous systems
called the parasympathetic nervous system
i recommend a boxed breathing approach
which is inhale deeply on four counts
hold at the top for four counts
exhale deeply on four counts
and hold at the bottom for four counts
you can even do this in the middle of any anxiety provoking conversation
and no one will even know
lots of people
from ancient monks to modern meditators
have figured this tool out and use it all the time
movement
tool number two moving your body
this one also has immediate positive effects on your mood state
but for a different reason
every time you move your body
you re releasing a whole bunch of beneficial neurochemicals
in your brain
these neurochemicals include dopamine
serotonin noradrenaline and endorphins
mood and reward boosting neurochemicals
that work to both increase positive mood states
and decrease negative ones
i like to say that every single time you move your body
it s like giving yourself a wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals
for your brain
so when your boss s email comes in and your heart starts to race
what exactly can you do
if you re in an office
try taking a short walk around the block
or even to the supply closet for some sticky notes
if you re working from home
put on two of your favorite songs
and dance around the living room like no one is watching
studies have shown that all it takes is ten minutes of walking
to get those mood boosting effects
but be creative with your movement session
whether that s a quick session of power vacuuming a la mrs
doubtfire
when you re stressed about a deadline
or doing a set of jumping jacks
or getting off the elevator one floor early
to do a power walk up that last flight of stairs
before an important meeting
all of these possibilities will all help your anxiety levels come down
in fact i tested this effect on my own nyu students
first i had them take an anxiety assessment
before leading them in a movement session
that included movements from kickbox and dance
and yoga and martial arts
together with positive spoken affirmations
then i had them retake that same anxiety assessment again
what happened
after our movement session
their anxiety scores had decreased to normal levels
now that s powerful real world example that you can use in your life today
so make sure to incorporate these bursts of activity in your day
and try one out next time you re feeling stress
it can really make your anxiety feel less all consuming
once you connect with your body
and turn the volume down on your anxiety
two important things will happen
first when that email comes in
evaluate
you ll be in a better position to evaluate
what about it makes you anxious
is it that you ve taken on too much
or that you feel insecure about a particular skill set
in other words
you ll be able to use this emotion anxiety
for exactly what it was evolved to do
warn you about potential dangers so you can become aware of them
and find ways to effectively and creatively address them
in your everyday life
communicate
second once you find the warning signals in your anxiety
you ll be able to communicate with others
you might seek out advice from a trusted colleague
when that difficult issue arises
or you might even have a conversation with your boss
about how to prioritize projects
because you re no longer in fight or flight mode
asking for that support won t feel nearly as threatening
and one of the best gifts of approaching your anxiety in this way
is that you will be able to notice those telltale signs of anxiety
in everyone else around you
especially those forms of anxiety you re most familiar with
and what will that do
that will allow you to give that person a smile or a kind word
to help them through that moment
in other words
your own form of anxiety can boost your personal super power of empathy
and i can t think of anything we need in this world today
more than higher levels of empathy for one another
your take home in all of this
if you breathe
move and take note of what your anxiety is signaling
you ll feel more fulfilled
more creative more connected
and less stressed overall
and that s my wish for every one of us
