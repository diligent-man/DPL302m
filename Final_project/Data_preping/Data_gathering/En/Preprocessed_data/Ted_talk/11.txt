your step guide to setting better boundaries at work
i m a therapist whose job it is to help people create healthier relationships
and let me tell you
it can be really hard to tell someone what you need
it takes a lot of courage to stand up and say
this is the way i want to be treated
most of us aren t so great at vocalizing to the people in our lives
what makes us feel respected and valued
it s true with friends family partners and it s also true at work
you ve got to set healthy boundaries
the way we work
what are boundaries
boundaries can be an intimidating term
but they re very simply the expectations and needs that help us feel safe
and comfortable in relationships
work is the relationship we spend the most time in
and yet it s also the place where we have the hardest time setting limits
we re scared that people won t see us as a team player
our employers have boundaries built in
like the time your workday begins
and how many vacation days you can have
but work boundaries need to be a two way street
boundaries for your employer and boundaries for you
setting them can help you feel happier
and more fulfilled in your roles
not to mention less exhausted and overwhelmed at work
we often assume that other people have the same rules for life as we do
we think they can tell our preferences
and know our feelings from our body language
but no one not the people you ve known for years
and certainly not your coworkers can read your mind
you have to explicitly state what you need
communicating what works for us is one of the kindest things we can do
the short term discomfort is so worth it
for the long term ease of having healthier boundaries in the workplace
step identify your boundaries
here are three steps to help you get started
step one identify the boundaries you need to set
there are so many different kinds
for example
you can tell a colleague what hours you are and aren t available to work
you can share that you need to leave the office promptly at five
to pick up your children
or that you log off fully on the weekends to really recharge
you can tell them how you prefer to communicate
that you enjoy talking by phone rather than instant messaging or texting
especially with your bosses
you can set boundaries around how you like feedback
you can say i work best with clear deadlines
can you please set one
or you can tell them you like written notes on your work
so you have time to digest the feedback
you can set boundaries on how you interact with people socially
for example
it makes me feel uncomfortable when you share gossip at my desk
or no i m not interested in drinks after work
but i d love to go to a yoga class with you
you can even set boundaries around your calendar
and ask that people ask you before throwing a meeting on it
as you prefer to be aware of what your day looks like
step two think about how and when to make the statement
step think about when to set your boundaries
boundaries are like classroom rules
you want to set them as early as possible
people do it all the time in the job seeking process
they may say something like i have vacation planned for these dates
will i be able to take my vacation
if we can go into a new work environment
and with people already knowing what we can and can t do
that s a beautiful way to show up
if that feels like too much
orientation can be a great time to set boundaries
when your supervisor tells you the workday ends at six just flow it in
that s perfect
i need to leave work at six
one boundary i want you to set right away
is to take every single day of paid vacation
you ve earned it you need the rest
and recharging is good for work life balance
and by the way it s perfectly acceptable to set boundaries for yourself
when you notice something in the workday isn t making you feel good
so if you get a headache when you have five meetings in a day
tell yourself that four will be your maximum
if you get anxious
trying to respond to emails on monday morning
don t do that first thing
break it up in half hour increments throughout the day
i have a set of boundaries around my work
for me i like working in minute chunks
i don t like answering every email as soon as i get it
i like sitting with the information before i respond
you have to set in motion those new habits
and practices that will make you feel at ease
step stick to the boundaries
and now comes the most important part of the process
step three you have to stick to the boundaries you set
if you say you re not available after six
don t respond to the group chat
if you say you re not available on weekends
don t be available on weekends
when you respond to emails
or agree to look at that proposal out of those bounds
you re teaching people that the boundary isn t real
that it s ok to violate it
consistency is really key here
that might mean restating the boundary more than once
that might mean reminding yourself
why you set the boundary in the first place
setting boundaries is hard at first but the more you do it
the easier it gets
boundaries are contagious
once you start to consistently implement them others will too
you might be the inspiration that helps them set better boundaries
even if they don t have the courage right now
it s now in the back of their mind
