steps to getting what you want in a negotiation
when we think about negotiations we think about being tough
we charge in like it s a battle
brandishing our influence and our power moves
but a negotiation doesn t have to be a fight with winners and losers
think of it more like a dance
two or more people moving fluidly in sync
the way we work
we constantly negotiate at work
we negotiate for higher pay promotions vacations and even greater autonomy
in fact every day we negotiate just to get our job done
and to secure resources for ourselves and our teams
and yet when we go in with the wrong mindset
with a fist up ready to fight
we aren t as successful
you know why because negotiation is not about dominating
it s about crafting a relationship
and relationships thrive when we find ways to give and to take
and move together in unison
and to do that you have to be well prepared
do your research
first do your research
figure out whether what you re asking for is realistic
what is your aspiration
what do you want and what will make you walk away from the table
this might seem obvious but too many people don t think it through
let s say you re negotiating for a salary in a new job
some people they determine they ask based on their past salary
that isn t a good yardstick
you may end up asking for too much or too little
instead find out the range of what is possible
look at industrial reports websites
talk to people in your professional network
to find out the lowest average and the highest salary
for a similar role
and then make your ask closer to that upper limit
build a solid rationale for why you are above average
and thus deserving of that ask
let s say you re negotiating for something less black and white
like the ability to work from home to care for an aging parent
you need to study your company s policies on remote work
ask yourself when and why were these policies developed
in the first place
talk to trusted mentors to understand how working from home might affect issues
that aren t on your radar
and think about how changing to working from home
might actually affect others in your team
in fact make a table summarizing the parts of your job
that can be done remotely
and the parts that require face to face interaction
this may sound like a lot to do
but when the person you re negotiating with
sees that you ve done all this homework
you re more likely to get that yes
it also helps you avoid being lied to while building the person s respect
second prepare mentally for the negotiation
prepare mentally
asking for things can get emotional
there are real and complex feelings at play
fear anxiety anger even hurt
it s essential to have strategies in place to manage those feelings
one strategy is to adopt a mindset of defensive pessimism
defensive pessimism
that just means that you accept
obstacles and failures are likely in a negotiation
so it s better to put your energy in imagining
the ways to overcome those obstacles
that way you re ready to respond when you face it
another strategy is emotional distancing
emotional distancing
that is the idea of being less attached to any specific outcome
i know it s easier said than done
we all feel emotions like anger and hurt
when our core identities are being threatened
when your manager may be challenging a truth that you hold dear about yourself
like you re a hard worker and you deserve this
try and avoid thinking of negotiations as the ultimate test of your worth
go in knowing that your request might be met that it might be denied
and that none of this is a measure of your worth
also know that if you feel yourself getting upset hurt during a negotiation
it s ok to step back
you can leave the dance floor and move up to the balcony
just say let me think about this a little more
could we press pause and continue this tomorrow
the third and the final way you can prepare for negotiations
is by putting yourself in the other person s shoes
putting yourself in the others shoes
taking the time to anticipate the other s needs and challenges
what pressures may they be under
what risks would they be taking
do they even have the power to give you what you re asking for
what ripple effects might a yes mean
when you make that request
look to balance assertiveness about your own needs
with a concern for the other
as you lay out your case use phrases like
i m asking for this because i know it s good for my team
that i want to achieve x and y goals and i know this is what will enable it
arguments like that show that you are ambitious
you know what you want but you also care for others
so many of our negotiation missteps
they don t actually come from disagreements
but misunderstanding the other person
so it s important to listen well to ask why and why not
and you will surely find unexpected opportunities
for win win solutions
