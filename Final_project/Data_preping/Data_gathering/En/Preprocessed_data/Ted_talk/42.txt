why working from home is good for business
the basic problem with working in an office
is you re just not in control of your work environment
the way we work
howdy my name is matt and i m the ceo of automattic
the company behind wordpress com jetpack and woocommerce
we re coming up on over employees and they live everywhere
from california to alabama mississippi to where i live in texas
they re also in countries
canada mexico india new zealand
some of them choose not even to have a home base they re nomads
whether they are in rvs or traveling through airbnbs
they are in new places every day week or month
as long as they can find good wi fi we don t care where they are
our focus on distributed work didn t happen accidentally
it was a conscious choice from the very beginning
notice i don t use the word remote
because it sets up the expectation
that some people are essential and some aren t
i use the word distributed to describe what we do
where everyone is on an equal playing field
i think a distributed workforce
is the most effective way to build a company
the key is you have to approach it consciously
when we started wordpress
many of the first hires were people i d never met in person
but we d collaborated online sometimes for years
i wanted to continue that for one simple reason
i believe that talent and intelligence
are equally distributed throughout the world
but opportunity is not
in silicon valley the big tech companies fish
from essentially the same small pond or bay
a distributed company can fish from the entire ocean
instead of hiring someone who grew up in japan but lives in california
you can gain someone who lives works
wakes up and goes to sleep wherever they are in the world
they bring a different understanding of that culture
and a different lived experience
at the base of the decision to go distributed
there s a desire to give people autonomy over how they do their work
unless you re in a role where specific hours are important
you can make your own schedule
everyone can have a corner office their windows the food they want to eat
you can choose when there s music and when there s silence
you can choose what temperature the room should be
you can save the time you d spend commuting
and put it into things that are important to you
a distributed workforce is ideal for a technology company
but people often ask me
this works great for y all but what about everyone else
if you have an office
you can do a few things to build distributed capability
first document everything
in an office it s easy to make decisions in the moment
in the kitchen in the hall
but if people work remotely
and some members of the team are having those conversations
they don t have access to
they ll see these decisions being made without understanding the why
always leave a trail of where you were and what you were thinking about
this allows others to pick up where you left off
it allows people in different time zones to interact
it s also great to think about as an organization evolves
people leaving and people joining
try to have as much communication as possible online
when everything s shared and public it allows new people to catch up quickly
you also need to find the right tools
there are so many apps and services that help with day to day communication
video conferencing project management
the things that changed how you work probably aren t objects anymore
they re things you access through your computer
so experiment with different tools that enable collaboration
see what works
create productive face to face time
in a traditional office
you re in the same place weeks out of the year
and you might have three or four weeks apart
we try to flip that we come together for short intense bursts
once a year we do a grand meet up
where the entire company comes together for a week
it s half work half play
the primary goal is connecting people
we want to make sure everyone s aligned and on the same page
and they have a deeper connection with their colleagues
when they work together the rest of the year
they can bring together that understanding and empathy
and the final practice
give people the flexibility to make their own work environment
every person at automattic has a co working stipend
that they can put towards a co working space
or just to buy coffee so they don t get kicked out of the coffee shop
one group in seattle decided to pool their stipends together
and rented a workspace on a fishing pier
each person who joins the company gets a home office stipend
this is money they can invest in getting the right chair monitor
the right desk setup so they can have the most productive environment for them
today there are just a few companies that are distributed first
in a decade or two i predict that percent of companies
that are going to be changing the course of the world
are going to function this way
they will evolve to be distributed first or they ll be replaced by those that are
as you think about what you re going to build next
consider how you can tap into global talent
give people autonomy to live and work where they feel they should
and still participate fully in whatever it is that you re creating together
