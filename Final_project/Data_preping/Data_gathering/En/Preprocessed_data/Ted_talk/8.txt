steps to building a personal brand you feel good about
whether you realize it or not you have a personal brand
if i looked you up on google
and didn t find anything about you on the first page of results
that s your personal brand
if i found an out of date linkedin profile
or a bunch of random social media posts
that too is your personal brand
the way we work
people tend to think about a personal brand as bragging
self promotion and all about yourself
but it s actually something much more important
it s your reputation
in other words it s how people perceive you
your friends colleagues or the general public
and it s what people think about you when they hear your name
as well as what people say about you when you re not in the room
in our connected world
every single one of us has a personal brand
whether we like it or not
this is because whenever we engage with people both in person and online
that s every interaction or everything we post upload or comment on
we re creating a reputational narrative about ourselves
your reputation is already out there
the question is do you want to be the one who s driving and shaping this story
or do you want chance or algorithms to be doing it for you
i think most people would agree that they want to take control
and what this means is we need to make some very intentional decisions
so our brand stays in our hands
let me walk you through five key steps to building a strong personal brand
in a way that feels good
first you need to figure out what your goal is
let s start by answering a foundational question
what do you want your personal brand to help you accomplish
are you looking to change jobs or transition into a new industry
and you need your brand to reflect a new skill set
maybe you re looking to get a promotion at your current organization
and you need everyone to know all the amazing things
that you ve accomplished in your career
or maybe you re launching a new business
and you want to build your brand
around the products or services that you re offering
whatever your goal is write it down and make it specific
so that you re working towards a clear outcome
next you ll want to get clear on what you want to be known for
in other words how do you want people to describe you as a professional
start by answering the question so what do you do
and i m not just talking about your job title
are you a teacher who focuses on social and emotional learning
or maybe you re a project manager
who is reliable and always gets things done on time
or maybe you re an artist
who makes beautiful ceramic pots from natural materials
what you want to do is dig deeper into the what
how and why behind your work
so you can make it concrete and easy to remember
just make sure to lead with something that doesn t cause confusion
for example
i once coached someone who called herself a death midwife
which no one understood
but when she started introducing herself as a grief counselor
who works with families during a time of loss
all of a sudden everyone got it
if you re stumped think about how you can stand out
from the crowd in your industry
what are the things that make you unique
are there specific talents and expertise that you ve acquired in your career
what do you know more about than most people
sit down and make a list
and you might start to surprise yourself about all the things you know
now let s think about the audience
you want to share your personal brand with
the reality is your personal brand is not about you
it s about the people you want to educate with the skills
knowledge and value you can provide
who you decide to focus on should be based on two things
the goal of your personal brand
and the people who can best benefit from your unique talents and skills
so spend some time thinking about these two questions
who can most gain from what you have to share
and how exactly can you see yourself helping them
here s where it all starts to come together
let s pull all your answers into a single mission statement
that describes who you are what you do
who you do it for
and the transformation you can create in people s lives
let s take the example of the teacher
my name is alma and i m a third grade teacher
who specializes in social and emotional learning
i work with students to teach them the skills
for fostering empathy and compassion
so they can thrive and contribute to a more caring world
let s take the project manager
my name is jennifer
and i m a project manager for a sustainable fashion company
i work with teams across different departments
to plan organize and direct innovative marketing campaigns
that engage customers while also increasing brand loyalty
mission statements are going to look wildly different
depending on who you are in your career
but whatever your mission statement is
write it down and put it somewhere prominent
you can use it to make decisions about how you speak about yourself
when you first meet someone
to the communities you want to share it with
let s start building your personal brand online
there are two key personal branding assets you should think about developing
a personal website and social media
what s so important about a personal website
is that it allows you to take full control over your online reputation
it offers the most flexibility in sharing your brand and value to others
in a much deeper way than a resume or a linkedin profile
people want to work with others they like know and trust
and your personal website provides you an opportunity
to share more about your personality through photos
as well as more about your career and life story
this in turn will differentiate you from others in your industry
social media is also a great way to share your personal brand
with the audience you re looking to connect with
however i suggest trying not to be on every platform
pick one that aligns with your goals
as well as where your audience spends most of its time
if you re an artist or a creative instagram is a great fit
if you work in a more corporate environment
linkedin is the place you want to be
when posting focus on being helpful to others
share interesting articles relevant to your industry
post ideas or opinions that can benefit colleagues
and like or comment on posts shared by the people you follow
the key is to always engage in a way
that both reinforces your personal brand while also bringing value to others
look i know this may all sound a bit intimidating
but try to think of this branding process as an opportunity for personal growth
it s your chance to dig deeper into who you truly are
and who you want to become
this in turn will provide you the clarity you need
on how you can make your greatest impact in the world
