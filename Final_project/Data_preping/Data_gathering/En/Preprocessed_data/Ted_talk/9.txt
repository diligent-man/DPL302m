the unexpected key to boosting your productivity
i ve always secretly wanted to be a machine
i felt like if i was a machine
i d never let things fall through the cracks
i wouldn t forget things
and i d do everything i needed to do on time every time
i knew there were people out there that were like this
and i wanted to know what makes them tick
the way we work
so a few years ago i started a newsletter called super organizers
where i profiled of the top performers in a variety of fields
i ve talked to managers who track everything they do in a day
in minute increments
i ve talked to investors
who keep spreadsheets of every single person they ve ever met
and ceos who keep their calendars basically empty
and rarely ever do meetings ever
i ve also experimented with a lot of hacks myself
to try to get me closer to my ideal
i ve taped my mouth shut while i m sleeping
and stared at a sunlamp to increase my energy levels
i visualized my compassionate self
and tried all sorts of supplements to hack my body chemistry
sometimes the things i try work and sometimes they don t
sometimes they re just kind of ridiculous
but i want to share with you the best trick i ve learned
in all of my exploring
the ideal of being a machine is actually a trap
it gets in the way of our productivity because it makes us blind
to the roots of our actual problems
we are not machines we re emotional beings
and learning to skillfully recognize and work with our emotions
is the only way to actually be productive day to day
guilt shame fear
so often they re at the base of what s going on for us
in ways that we barely understand
what s underneath our productivity problems
isn t just a need for a new tool or system
but something going on in our emotional lives
and being aware of and observing how our emotions can affect us
can open up a lot of flexibility and freedom
to make progress when we d otherwise be stuck
i found that the most productive people in the world
the ones who are most machine like actually recognize this
and they often do three things to work with it
they re aware when they have a problem
they observe what s going on without judgment
so they can understand it
and they keep experimenting with systems or teams
mindsets and tools until it changes
this might sound simple and it is
but it s actually very hard to do because at each stage we get blocked
and twisted up by the shame guilt fear and doubt
the things that get in the way of seeing things clearly
to do this well requires a level of emotional mastery
that is very difficult to practice
so let me walk you through it and show you how it can work
awareness is the first step
that means being aware of problems in your productivity
but that s harder than it seems
no matter what the issue is
it s much easier to ignore it
and hope that it goes away than to admit that something s wrong
we feel like we should be able to just do better
we feel like well that s the job i should just suck it up
whatever the problems that you re encountering in your productivity
you might not think about them that often because it s pretty painful
but there s magic in becoming aware of the problems
that we re ordinarily not aware of
the most productive people have regular practices
that they use to maintain that awareness
sometimes it s journaling sometimes it s mindfulness
sometimes it s just a walk sometimes it s therapy
but everyone has something
here s an example from my own life
i have a ton of trouble staying on top of my inbox
i m the ceo of a start up
and so this was really hard for me to admit at first
it seemed like an indictment of me and my ability to be successful
if my inbox was a mess
but last year after a lot of reflection
i realized that i had to face the fact
that the backlog was causing problems throughout my company
once i was aware of the problem i could start the next step observation
when i moved into the observation stage
i wanted to see with as little judgment as possible
what usually leads to my inbox being crowded
observing without judgment was really difficult for me
my sense of doubt and fear came up
i thought should i really need to do this
i really felt like i should just be able to get through my inbox
without any problems
but once i got beneath that
i began to notice something really surprising
there were actually many periods where i was on top of my inbox
it s just that every couple of weeks there would be a shift
where it would just turn into a giant mess
and it had a very specific trigger
either a single email i really didn t want to deal with
or a really busy period in my life
where i couldn t look at my inbox for a day or two
and when this happened
emails would start to pile up and i d start to feel shame
i d avoid my inbox and the pile would just get way worse
it was a vicious cycle
once i saw this
i realized that there was a logical place to intervene
what i really needed to do was to catch myself
right at the point every couple of weeks
where my clean inbox was turning into a mess
and if i could do that i knew i could keep it clean the rest of the time
this brings us to the next step experimentation
once productive people have recognized a problem
and observed its contours without judgment
they try new solutions to find out what works
again this can be really easy to get twisted up about
we re all filled with preconceptions about what s in and out of bounds
to experiment with
and we re really boxed in by those preconceptions
we don t want to look silly or weak
but if we allow ourselves to find what works for us
we often find things that no one else would
i tried a lot of different experiments to deal with my inbox problems
i tried going to a new coffee shop
every time i needed to power through some emails
i tried talking about it with my business partner
and other people at my company to try to lower my sense of shame about it
i tried a one touch email strategy
i tried only checking my email twice a day
but none of these really solved the problem completely
so i kept going and i had a big insight
i figured out i might be able to use my own desire not to let people down
to help me get through my inbox
i m lucky enough to split a virtual assistant with my business partner
so i wondered what if i put an hour on my calendar a few times a week
where they would babysit me
at the beginning of the hour
they d message me and ask me how many emails i had in my inbox
and at the end of the hour
they d message me again to ask how many i d gotten done
i used my virtual assistant but you could use anyone in your life
a family member or friend who struggles with something similar
and propose a trade
it literally takes a couple of seconds to message back and forth
when i started to consider this my immediate reaction was shame
i felt like i should not need a babysitter to do my work
and i dreaded the conversation where i had to ask for this kind of thing
i also dreaded admitting it to anyone else
it all seemed very silly but i decided to try it anyway
and it turns out just that little interaction a few times a week
makes a gigantic difference for me
getting a message from my assistant keeps me on task on my email
and prevents the piles from being created
which makes it really easy for me to keep my inbox clean at every other time
and now i m sitting here almost a year later with a clean inbox
on a consistent basis
this may not work for you but it does work for me
you might find that other approaches are better
like transferring your emails to your to do list
or making sure you re following a one touch inbox strategy
or maybe even examining why you need to get through your inbox
in the first place
but the only way to find that out is to try it
what i ve realized in all of my exploring
is that i actually didn t really ever want to be a machine
i just felt guilty and ashamed for not being one
and once i started to work with that everything changed for me
we think productivity is about software notebooks and to do lists
frameworks calendars schedules and inboxes
and it is all of those things
but it s also about our brains and our bodies
it s about our emotions and how they guide us
and sometimes get in our way
if you turn over the rock of productivity you can find a lot hiding underneath
identifying what s there is the best productivity hack i know
