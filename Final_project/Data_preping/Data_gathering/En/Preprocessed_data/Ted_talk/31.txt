How to make faster decisions
You're probably familiar with FOMO
This guy invented the term
That's short for Fear Of Missing Out
It's that feeling you get
when it seems everyone else is doing something better
than what you're doing now
But there's another FO you need to know about
and it's far more dangerous
and it's short for Fear Of a Better Option
We live in a world of overwhelming choice
Even decisions that used to be simple
like choosing a restaurant or making everyday purchases
are now fraught with overanalysis
Technology has only made the issue more pronounced
If you want to buy a pair of white shoelaces online
you have to sort through thousands of items
and read through hundreds of reviews
That's an astounding amount of information to process
to just buy two pieces of string that cost less than your morning latte
Chances are you've experienced FOBO when you've struggled
to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable outcomes
It's a symptom of a culture which sees value
in collecting and preserving as many options as possible
You might wonder why all of this is so bad
Shouldn't it be a privilege to have so many good options
The problem is FOBO induces such severe analysis paralysis
that it can negatively impact both your personal and professional life
When you can't make decisions with conviction
you waste precious time and energy
Luckily there is a way to overcome FOBO
With any decision you make you first have to determine the stakes
as this will inform your decision making strategy
When it comes down to it
you only really face three types of decisions in life
high stakes low stakes and no stakes
Let's start with no stakes decisions
These are the minor details of life
where there is almost never an incorrect answer
and in a few hours you won't even remember
A good example of this is choosing what to watch on TV
With thousands of shows it's easy to get overwhelmed
yet no matter what you pick
the consequences are basically nonexistent
So spending more than a few moments on FOBO
is a massive waste of energy
You just need to move on
When it comes to no stakes decisions
the key is to outsource them to the universe
For example you can whittle down your choices to just two
and then flip a coin
Or try my personal favorite ask the watch
Assign each one of your choices to one half of your watch
then let the second hand tell you what you're going to do
Looks like I'll be having the fish
That brings us to low stakes decisions
These have consequences but none are earth shattering
and there are plenty of acceptable outcomes
Many routine things at work like purchasing a printer
booking a hotel or choosing between possible venues for an off site
are classically low stakes in nature
but these aren't make or break deliberations
and you'll probably forget about them in a few weeks
Here you can also outsource decision making
but you want some critical thinking involved
as there are some stakes
This time you'll outsource to a person
select someone to present a recommendation
and then take their advice
Make sure to avoid the temptation to canvass
Your goal is to clear your plate
not to kick the can down the road
Now that you tackled low stakes and no stakes decisions
you've created the space and time you'll need
to handle high stakes decisions
These are things like which house should I buy
or which job should I accept
Since the stakes are high and there are long term implications
you absolutely want to get it right
Before we get to work let's establish a few basic principles
to guide you through the process
First think about what really matters to you
and set your criteria accordingly
Second gather the relevant facts
Make sure you collect data about all of the options
so you can be confident
that you're truly making an informed decision
And third remember that FOBO by nature
comes when you struggle to choose just one
from a group of perfectly acceptable options
So no matter what you choose
you can rest assured that the downside is limited
Now that you've established some ground rules
Start by identifying a front runner based on your intuition
then compare each of your options head to head
with the front runner one by one
Each time choose the better of the two based on the criteria
and discard the other one
Here's the trick to avoiding FOBO
When you eliminate an option it's gone forever
If you keep returning to discarded options
Now repeat this process until you get down to one final choice
If you follow this system
you will usually end up with a decision on your own
On the rare occasion that you get stuck
you will outsource the final decision
to a small group of qualified people who you trust
and who are equipped to provide you with guidance
Engage a group of five or less ideally an odd number of people
so that you have a built in tiebreaker if you need it
Now that you've made your choice one last challenge remains
I can't promise you that you'll ever truly know if you've made the perfect decision
but I can tell you this
a significant percentage of people in the world
will never have to worry about FOBO
Unlike the billions of people who have few options if any
due to war poverty or illness
you have plentiful opportunities to live decisively
You may not get everything you want
but the mere fact you get to decide is powerful
In fact it's a gift
Make the most of it
