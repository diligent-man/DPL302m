ways to better connect with your coworkers
people feel pretty disconnected at work right now
disconnected from their organizations from their jobs
and especially from their colleagues
you might feel too burned out to do anything about this last one
or maybe think that it doesn t matter
but actually our relationships with our coworkers
play a huge role in determining how successful
innovative and happy we ll be at work
the way we work
our work relationships give us two valuable things
social support and access to information
and research shows it s the combination
that can make us happier and more successful
i m a social scientist
and i study how the way we collaborate affects our well being
and professional success
i have a few tips
and you don t have to be a social butterfly to give them a try
ok tip number one
build trust by opening up
having a close friend at work makes us more effective at our jobs
and definitely improves our well being
if you get along with your coworkers you probably already have a sense of this
but our work friends are important for another reason
and it has to do with access to information
people don t just share their best ideas with anyone
we share with people we know and trust
i ran a multi year study at google
to find out why some teams are successful and others fail
and what we found is that the teams who trust each other do so much better
because people on those teams feel safe sharing their best ideas
so how can you start to build that trust
there s a concept called a vulnerability loop
and the basic idea is that when you re vulnerable in front of somebody
it makes it a lot easier for them to be vulnerable in front of you
we usually think you have to trust somebody before you can open up
but what this research suggests is that often
trust comes after we ve been vulnerable and people have responded empathetically
so taking that risk to share that this week you feel a little off
because your kid s starting at a new school
or maybe you re really worried about the status of your big project
that can actually go a long way towards building a sense of trust
that can make you and your teams much more effective
ok tip number two be a joiner
surprisingly our closest friends aren t the best people
for giving us access to new information
it s often our acquaintances
because they connect us to different social circles
and consequently new ways of thinking
social scientists call these relationships weak ties
and when it comes to innovation
they re more important than our strongest connections
for example in one study
i found that people who had many weak ties
that connected different groups in a large organization
were more likely to have high performance scores
more likely to be promoted
and even more likely to say they were a part of a creative breakthrough
the best way i ve seen for developing weak ties
is to join groups outside of your day to day work
things like philanthropic organizations
sports clubs or employee resource groups are great examples
you never know
tobin from legal who you met playing pickleball
might have a great idea
that can really help you out in your next project
and for leaders trying to spark innovation
having a regular trivia group might be more effective
the best run strategy summit
ok this last tip is especially helpful for managers
tip three make it a little bit easier for people to belong to something
a number of years ago
i helped redesign the onboarding process at a big company
at the time the onboarding week was maybe informative
but it didn t do a lot to create meaningful connection
so i ran an experiment
every week i assigned new employees to one of five groups
each with a different colored t shirt
and something amazing started to happen
almost immediately
people wearing yellow t shirts started having breakfast together
people in the green t shirts
started walking between the different sessions together
and at the end of the week
we blew by our happy hour budget because people hung out together
so much longer than they ever had
the best part is after that onboarding week
many of those people stayed in touch for years
which became a great source of weak ties across the organization
the reason the t shirt experiment worked so well
is because it gave people an easy way to identify the group they belong to
you could be creative here
even things like swag t shirts and project code names
can go a long way towards creating a sense of belonging
look people feel really isolated and disconnected right now
that s not surprising
we ve all just been through a global pandemic
the best part about reconnecting is that it doesn t just benefit you
it benefits the whole community that you help create
