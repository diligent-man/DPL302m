ways to improve your relationship with money
When you think about money and your dreams
you're like My bank account does not align with my dreams
Financial health for a typical American household can be stressful
We know that percent of all Americans would struggle
coming up with dollars in the event of an emergency
And percent of all Americans will face that emergency
When you ask the question What does money mean to you
most people will say things like I feel anxious
And so the insecurities come The shame comes
I think we have a fraught relationship with money
When you're not able to pay your bills on time
I don't want anyone to think that I'm not smart
I don't want anyone to know that I am very insecure with money
I don't want anyone to know that I am super stressed out
lessons on how to improve our relationship with money
You can't do it alone And that's when your squad has to come in
We typically don't talk about our stresses when it comes to money
We need to come together as a group of friends
Celebrate the fact that we've made a decision
that we want to have a better relationship with money
That is worth applauding or snapping your fingers about
Once you've done that then you get real
Why am I spending all this money on things that don't align with my goals
What are your fears What are your hopes What are your dreams
But then we start to take action
What can we do this week Or what can we do this month
It's the mechanism to accomplish whatever your goals are
It's just a mechanism to accomplish what matters to you most
Ask yourself one fundamental question what are you saving for
If you're saving for a car if you're saving to pay down your debt
if you're saving for that rainy day fund
Visualize what you're really trying to accomplish
So if we break it down go get a poster board
Take magazine pictures cut it all out
Have that picture of that great trip
Have the picture of you paying down your student debt
The vision board sounds like Oh how can that really help
The point is your goals need to align with your behaviors
and the vision board is really a representation
of where you wanna go and then how you live your life
and in the meantime are the steps to really get there
It's not what you make it's what you keep
It's not about what you make it's about what you keep
It's about understanding do I have the ability
with what I'm making to take care of my basic needs
And if not what adjustments do I need to make
And then we start to break it down and talk about the tools
We start to say Do we have our savings account auto save
Set it and forget it or every day put a dollar a day
the goal is the rhythm not the amount
You can start small but you have to start now
And then let me give you a trick we all have impulses
Many times because the phone is always with us
Go out to any site shop up put it in your cart
Wait hours go back and ask yourself
What about these items map to my goal
And if it's nothing hit delete and you got your fix
that your self worth is not determined by your net worth
This is something that we can do better about
And when you make that misstep no judgment no shame
