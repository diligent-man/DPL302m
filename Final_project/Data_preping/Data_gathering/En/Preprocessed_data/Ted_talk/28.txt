how working couples can best support each other
it may sound strange to bring up work
but when we fall in love
we often consider what that love will do to our life
and our work and careers are a big part of that
the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
all working couples face hard choices
and these can feel like a zero sum game
one partner gets offered a job in another city
so the other needs to leave their job and start over
one partner takes on more childcare and puts their career on hold
so the other can pursue an exciting promotion
one gains and one loses
and while some couples who make these choices are satisfied
others regret them bitterly
what makes the difference
i ve spent the last seven years studying working couples
and i ve found that it s not what couples choose
it s how they choose
of course we can t control our circumstances
nor do we have limitless choices
but for those we do
how can couples choose well
first start early
first start early long before you have something to decide
the moment you re faced with a hard choice
say whether one of you should go back to school
or take a risky job offer
it s too late
choosing well begins with understanding each other s aspirations early on
aspirations like wanting to start a small business
live close to extended family
save enough money to buy a house of our own
or have another child
many of us measure our lives by comparing what we re doing
with our aspirations
when the gap is small
we feel content
when it s large
we feel unhappy
and if we re part of a couple
we place at least some of that blame with our partner
set aside time at least twice a year
to discuss your aspirations
i m a big fan of keeping a written record of these conversations
putting pen to paper with our partners
helps us remember each other s aspirations
and that we re writing the story of our lives together
eliminate options
next eliminate options
that don t support the life you want to live together
you can do this agreeing on boundaries that make hard choices easier
boundaries like geography where would you like to live and work
time how many working hours a week will make family life possible
travel how much work travel can you really stand
once you ve agreed to your boundaries the choice becomes easy
when faced with an opportunity that falls outside of them
i m not going to interview for that job
because we ve agreed we don t want to move across country
or i m going to cut back on my overtime
because we ve agreed it s essential we spend more time together as a family
couples who understand each other s aspirations
and commit to strong boundaries
can let go of seemingly attractive opportunities without regret
if you re faced with an opportunity that falls within your boundaries
then what matters is that the choices you make
keep your couple in balance over time
even if they don t perfectly align with both partners aspirations
at the same time
if your choices are mainly driven by one partner
or support one partner s aspirations more than the other
an imbalance of power will develop
that imbalance i ve found
is the reason most working couples who fail do so
eventually one gets fed up with being a prop
rather than a partner
to avoid this
track your decisions over time
unlike your aspirations and boundaries
there s no need to keep a detailed record of every decision you make
just keep an open conversation going about how able each of you feel
to shape decisions that affect you both
how will you know you ve chosen well
one common misunderstanding
is that you can only know what choice is right in hindsight
and maybe it s true we judge life backwards
but we must live it forwards
i ve found that couples who look back on a choice as a good one
did so not just because of the outcome eventually
they did it because that choice empowered them individually and as a couple
as they made it
it wasn t what they chose
it was that they were choosing deliberately
and that made them feel closer and freer together
