How reverse mentorship can help create better leaders
as the older generation passing down wisdom to the young
but there's a huge benefit to flipping that around
and allowing the novice to teach the master
Made possible with the support of Dropbox
The workforce currently consists of up to five generations
But that change is not arriving nearly as fast
in regards to their perspectives and experiences
Our organizations can fall right through that gap
into the trap of stale thinking blind spots
Reverse mentoring could be an antidote to that tunnel vision
isn't as simple as finding a mentor
And you have to be intentional about the relationship
I know this because I was asked
just a year into my career at Virgin Atlantic
to be the first ever reverse mentor
but this it was a whole different ball game
Craig had revealed that he had no black women
and he was keen to understand my perspective
on how to build a more inclusive culture at Virgin Atlantic
about how to make reverse mentoring work
on the key spokespeople in the organization
This doesn't have to be someone in human resources
just someone who knows you and your teams well
The VP of people experience chose me
because I was open to sharing my ideas
and also my enthusiasm for leadership development
that your mentor isn't a direct report or part of your team
because it will be really difficult to elicit honest feedback
from someone who you also have to review
or if you're in engineering find someone in customer service
This will ensure that you develop perspectives
to make things simple set some ground rules
The first meeting should be offsite in a neutral location
If you're the mentee you should set the agenda
What is it that you really want to learn
or perhaps whether they've had any major obstacles
and whether there are any topics which are off limits
as a long elevator pitch of your life stories
Pivot to seek differences and not similarities
because that's the real power of reverse mentoring
that we had formative experiences in common
him a second generation growing up in the US
There were a few times in our conversation
where Craig slipped into giving me career advice
And I had to say Craig this is really interesting
and I'd love to come back to this later
is there anything else you'd like to understand from me
but you have to remember that as a mentor
for this very short period of time
your insights are actually more valuable to the organization
Agree the key takeaways from each of the sessions
either at the end or through follow-up email
We found that three to four weeks provided a great rhythm
the mentor isn't expected to be given credit
where the mentee actually holds a lot of the power
use reverse mentoring as one of the tools
to help them build a more inclusive environment
feel more confident in sharing their perspectives
And when accompanied by a comprehensive diversity
it leads to higher retention amongst these groups
that my reverse mentoring relationship with Craig
enabled me to have a sense of ownership and leadership
in building an inclusive culture at Virgin
that even when you're at the pinnacle of your career
