how reverse mentorship can help create better leaders
we ve always thought of mentoring
as the older generation passing down wisdom to the young
but there s a huge benefit to flipping that around
and allowing the novice to teach the master
the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
the workforce currently consists of up to five generations
and it s becoming more diverse
across all spectrums of underrepresented groups
but that change is not arriving nearly as fast
in c suites and in boardrooms
which means there s a growing gap
between leaders and their people
in regards to their perspectives and experiences
our organizations can fall right through that gap
into the trap of stale thinking blind spots
and having policies that could alienate
these underrepresented groups
not only in regards to age
race or gender
but all different kinds of viewpoints
reverse mentoring could be an antidote to that tunnel vision
but making reverse mentoring work
isn t as simple as finding a mentor
and pressing go
you have to be genuinely curious
about learning from that individual
and you have to be intentional about the relationship
in order to make it valuable
i know this because i was asked
just a year into my career at virgin atlantic
to be the first ever reverse mentor
to mentor ceo craig kreeger
i d met craig a few times
and presented to him in meetings
but this it was a whole different ball game
craig had revealed that he had no black women
in his inner circle
and he was keen to understand my perspective
on how to build a more inclusive culture at virgin atlantic
no pressure
here s what i learned
about how to make reverse mentoring work
make your match thoughtfully
lesson one make your match thoughtfully
find someone who has a pulse
on the key spokespeople in the organization
to help you make your match
this doesn t have to be someone in human resources
just someone who knows you and your teams well
because chemistry really matters
the vp of people experience chose me
because i was open to sharing my ideas
and also my enthusiasm for leadership development
also make sure
that your mentor isn t a direct report or part of your team
because it will be really difficult to elicit honest feedback
from someone who you also have to review
at the end of the year
if you re in finance
find someone creative in marketing
or if you re in engineering find someone in customer service
this will ensure that you develop perspectives
from outside of your immediate team
and different perspectives make better leaders
set some ground rules
lesson two
to make things simple set some ground rules
the first meeting should be offsite in a neutral location
if you re the mentee you should set the agenda
what is it that you really want to learn
maybe you d like to understand
your mentor s career journey
or perhaps whether they ve had any major obstacles
they ve had to overcome
or maybe you d like to understand
how specific company policies impact them
either directly or indirectly
agree that your conversations together
will be confidential
and whether there are any topics which are off limits
such as family life
or specific feedback on individuals
start with an icebreaker
lesson three start with an icebreaker
i like to think of this
as a long elevator pitch of your life stories
who are you
poignant moments in your life
what are your hopes and dreams
pivot to seek differences and not similarities
because that s the real power of reverse mentoring
craig and i found
that we had formative experiences in common
both of us immigrants
him a second generation growing up in the us
and myself first generation
arriving in the uk from jamaica
at the age of three
but from there
our stories are quite different
beware of role reversion
lesson four beware of role reversion
there were a few times in our conversation
where craig slipped into giving me career advice
and i had to say craig this is really interesting
and i d love to come back to this later
but in our limited time together
is there anything else you d like to understand from me
now this was quite hard
but you have to remember that as a mentor
for this very short period of time
your insights are actually more valuable to the organization
make time for reflection
lesson five make time for reflection
agree the key takeaways from each of the sessions
either at the end or through follow up email
and schedule your sessions
to allow time between for reflection
we found that three to four weeks provided a great rhythm
and finally
give credit
give credit where credit s due
in the traditional mentoring relationship
the mentor isn t expected to be given credit
however in reverse mentoring
where the mentee actually holds a lot of the power
accurate credit really counts
forward thinking organizations
use reverse mentoring as one of the tools
to help them build a more inclusive environment
and studies have shown
that when organizations embrace reverse mentoring
members of those underrepresented groups
feel more confident in sharing their perspectives
and when accompanied by a comprehensive diversity
and inclusion strategy
it leads to higher retention amongst these groups
personally i found
that my reverse mentoring relationship with craig
enabled me to have a sense of ownership and leadership
in building an inclusive culture at virgin
and for craig it showed
that even when you re at the pinnacle of your career
there s still more you can learn
