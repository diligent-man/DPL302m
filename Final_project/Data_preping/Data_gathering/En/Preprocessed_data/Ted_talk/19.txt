My wife was three months pregnant and I knew that I wanted to take time off
But when I walked in to ask my boss
I was about to ask for seven months of paternity leave
and I just didn’t know how my boss would react to that
I grew up being told that masculinity is supposed to look a certain way
You’re supposed to be stoic and strong
She pushed me on thinking that men should always pay for dates
and assuming that women should always do the childcare
Japan offers both mothers and fathers months of paid parental leave
It’s been ranked number one in the world
in terms of length and compensation for paternity leave
In only about seven percent of fathers took it
three quarters took a leave of two weeks or less
most Japanese men just aren’t at home during this pivotal time
Here is why normalizing it is so important
I took my wife’s last name and even wrote a book about it
and still I was terrified asking for paternity leave
I'd heard of bosses denying the request
I was scared that in asking for time off
I might be replaced or left behind
and he let me focus on what was important
I can’t describe how much joy I got seeing my newborn son each day
I especially loved my early morning shift with him
but when he got a little bigger
as a cheerleader during my morning runs in his stroller
or as a human dumbbell for squats and biceps curls
I feel so close to my son now
Men who take paternity leave experience a stronger bond with their babies
Research shows that the longer the paternity leave
the more engaged the father is in the first few years of a child’s life
that over half of all US fathers report feeling dissatisfied
with the amount of time they spend with their children
Paternity leave is a chance to change that
My relationship with my wife also deepened on my leave
We went on a walk together every day
and I became a better cook and cleaner
because I was able to spend more time on household duties
percent of fathers who took paternity leave said
This happens along a few different dimensions
First because you gain a whole new respect
for what’s involved in childcare and housework
and it makes you step up and take on more
Statistics show that when a mother’s partner is involved
especially in the first few weeks after birth
it reduces the risk of postpartum depression significantly
But this is really just the start
because paternity leave is also good for business
Paternity leave can have a profound impact on gender equality in the workforce
if women take childcare leave and men don’t
Working mothers are often juggling two full-time jobs
one at work and one at home
and even boost their ability to rise into leadership roles
that for every month of parental leave taken by the father
the mother’s earnings increased by approximately seven percent
It’s interesting to note that percent of female students in Japan say
they’d want their future partner to take parental leave
and nearly percent of men entering the workforce here --
and I suspect in other countries too --
say they want to take paternity leave
For employers to have that open inclusive culture
that can help companies attract and retain the best talent
Workers are increasingly choosing the companies based on the culture
This is a space where any company can give themselves a boost
I’ve been back at my job for about three months now
I feel so much more productive and very focused
and always looking for ways to be more efficient
so I can get home to my family
I’ve heard this from many mothers coming back from maternity leave too
that offer paid family leave report a positive impact on morale
and percent notice a boost in productivity
and that brings me to my final point
Paternity leave is one of the big steps we can make
in giving partners the opportunity to share the work
It’s one of our best bets to bridge the gender gap overall
Research shows that when that gender gap gets smaller
Iceland Norway and Finland ranked top three
and over percent of fathers take paternity leave
And if you take a look at their ranking in the World Happiness Report
And what I've realized is that the same world that systematically favors men
it's also trapping us in a cage
We need more countries to set up systems
that allow all parents to take paid childcare leave
that encourages and values men as caretakers
