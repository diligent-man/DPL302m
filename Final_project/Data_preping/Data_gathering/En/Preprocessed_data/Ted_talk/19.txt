why paternity leave benefits everyone
i remember the day
my wife was three months pregnant and i knew that i wanted to take time off
but when i walked in to ask my boss
i was so nervous
i was about to ask for seven months of paternity leave
and i just didn t know how my boss would react to that
the way we work
like most men in japan
i grew up being told that masculinity is supposed to look a certain way
you re supposed to be stoic and strong
dominant and in control
the breadwinner for your family
but when i met my wife
she challenged me on that
she pushed me on thinking that men should always pay for dates
and assuming that women should always do the childcare
japan offers both mothers and fathers months of paid parental leave
it s been ranked number one in the world
in terms of length and compensation for paternity leave
but here s the crazy thing
in only about seven percent of fathers took it
and of that seven percent
three quarters took a leave of two weeks or less
with pressure at work
most japanese men just aren t at home during this pivotal time
and that s a shame
because paternity leave
it benefits everyone
here is why normalizing it is so important
i believe deeply in gender equality
i took my wife s last name and even wrote a book about it
and still i was terrified asking for paternity leave
i d heard of bosses denying the request
or questioning their employees masculinity
i was scared that in asking for time off
i might be replaced or left behind
but my boss
he accepted my request right away
which made me feel so valued
and he let me focus on what was important
my family
i can t describe how much joy i got seeing my newborn son each day
i especially loved my early morning shift with him
so his mom could sleep in
when he was a newborn
we d just cuddle on the couch
but when he got a little bigger
he became my best workout buddy
as a cheerleader during my morning runs in his stroller
or as a human dumbbell for squats and biceps curls
i feel so close to my son now
and it s not just me
men who take paternity leave experience a stronger bond with their babies
research shows that the longer the paternity leave
the more engaged the father is in the first few years of a child s life
i was shocked to learn
that over half of all us fathers report feeling dissatisfied
with the amount of time they spend with their children
paternity leave is a chance to change that
my relationship with my wife also deepened on my leave
we went on a walk together every day
and i became a better cook and cleaner
because i was able to spend more time on household duties
which made her happy
in a mckinsey and company survey
percent of fathers who took paternity leave said
it improved their relationship too
this happens along a few different dimensions
first because you gain a whole new respect
for what s involved in childcare and housework
and it makes you step up and take on more
and by being home
you re providing emotional support
statistics show that when a mother s partner is involved
especially in the first few weeks after birth
it reduces the risk of postpartum depression significantly
but this is really just the start
because paternity leave is also good for business
paternity leave can have a profound impact on gender equality in the workforce
there s an inherent imbalance
if women take childcare leave and men don t
working mothers are often juggling two full time jobs
one at work and one at home
many don t return to the workforce
or decide to take reduced roles
by taking paternity leave
men can give women more options
and even boost their ability to rise into leadership roles
a study in sweden showed
that for every month of parental leave taken by the father
the mother s earnings increased by approximately seven percent
it s interesting to note that percent of female students in japan say
they d want their future partner to take parental leave
and nearly percent of men entering the workforce here
and i suspect in other countries too
say they want to take paternity leave
for employers to have that open inclusive culture
where paternity leave is respected
that can help companies attract and retain the best talent
workers are increasingly choosing the companies based on the culture
this is a space where any company can give themselves a boost
i ve been back at my job for about three months now
and i can already tell you
i feel so much more productive and very focused
and always looking for ways to be more efficient
so i can get home to my family
i ve heard this from many mothers coming back from maternity leave too
and studies confirm
percent of companies
that offer paid family leave report a positive impact on morale
and percent notice a boost in productivity
it s a positive for any company
and that brings me to my final point
paternity leave
it s good for society
paternity leave is one of the big steps we can make
in giving partners the opportunity to share the work
both at home and at work
it s one of our best bets to bridge the gender gap overall
research shows that when that gender gap gets smaller
people report higher life satisfaction
iceland norway and finland ranked top three
in the global gender gap index
and over percent of fathers take paternity leave
and if you take a look at their ranking in the world happiness report
they re very very high
this might be a coincidence but
i don t think so
that freedom to be yourself
and make choices without gender expectations
it feels really good
we live in a patriarchy
and what i ve realized is that the same world that systematically favors men
it s also trapping us in a cage
we need more countries to set up systems
that allow all parents to take paid childcare leave
to give everyone new options
we need to build a culture
that encourages and values men as caretakers
because we can do it too
