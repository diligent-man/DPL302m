common questions about workplace romance
how do we manage the boundaries
between our personal and professional lives
how do we deal with gender imbalances and power dynamics in the workplace
there s a lot of gray area in workplace romance
i d like to take a few minutes
and answer some of your frequently asked questions
so question one should i date my coworker
should i date my coworker
it depends
do you want to date your coworker for a bit of fun
do you want to date your coworker to hook up
because then you re really better off on tinder
if you want to date your coworker
because you really sincerely think you re falling in love with them
or there s a real potential for a long term committed relationship
maybe you should date your coworker
studies show that your coworkers are generally positive about it
if they perceive that you re falling in love
and genuinely care about each other
it s when your coworkers sense that something else is in play
that can be disruptive
should i date my boss
question two
should i date my boss
in almost all cases no you should not date your boss
because now you ve got a power dynamic
when there s a relationship between a boss and a subordinate
it generates a lot of negative feelings
and the negative feelings tend to fall on the person
who s lower on the totem pole
people usually assume some kind of favoritism
some kind of inside knowledge
and there can be resentment stirred up by that
there was a study published last year
that suggested dating a superior can even have a negative impact on your career
the researchers asked third party evaluators online
to imagine that they worked at a law firm
they asked them to make recommendations on which employee should get picked
for a special training program
and which should get promoted to partner
they looked at credentials for imaginary employees
and when it was stated that an employee had been dating
or was in a relationship with a superior
the evaluators were less likely to pick that person for the training program
or the promotion
even if they had the exact same credentials
as someone who wasn t dating their boss
the evaluators were also quick to dismiss their accomplishments
question three
can i date someone who reports to me
can i date someone who reports to me
still a big no
you may not feel like you re really the boss right
but you are and there s a power dynamic there
that s simply not there for other couples
if you really believe there is a sincere honestly felt personal connection
that would be lasting and meaningful
one of you may need to move
and it shouldn t always be the person who s lower in the company pecking order
ive just started seeing a coworker
question four
i ve just started seeing a coworker
how do we handle things
i get this question a lot
are they dating are they not dating
don t keep it a secret
you don t have to make a big deal of it but secrecy tends to be corrosive
people tend to see workplace couples as a coalition or a unit
so try to make it clear to your coworkers that you re not the same person
you love each other but you are going to disagree
question five
why are coworkers often attracted
why are coworkers often attracted to each other
well the obvious answer is people tend to be attracted to each other
the more time they spend together
but there s another ingredient that has to be added
attraction tends to happen
when there s work that demands close collaboration
so imagine you have a big group project with a tight deadline
and you re working late nights and brainstorming ideas
you look up and across the table
one of your colleagues throws out a really great idea
you may feel something and that s natural
we call this task interdependence
it s a ripe ground for attraction
the second reason why people at work are attracted to each other
is they may often be similar to each other
there s two old adages
birds of a feather flock together and opposites attract
well the psychological research suggests
birds of a feather flock together
and we like people who are like us
question six
my coworkers are flirting
my coworkers are flirting
i m annoyed
what do i do
some researchers argue that for people flirting at work
flirting is good and it boosts creativity
but my own research suggests things are different
for people who are watching or who are subjected to the flirting
it can be awkward right
witnessing flirtation in the workplace creates a sense of not knowing the rules
not knowing what s going on
or maybe seeing something that you shouldn t be seeing
people who frequently witness flirting at work
they actually report feeling less satisfied in their jobs
and they feel less valued by their company
they re more likely to give a negative appraisal of the work environment
and they may even consider leaving
for women this association can be even stronger
this appears to be the case
even when people report not being bothered by the flirting
it s true even when they say they enjoy it
so a flirtatious environment really could be toxic
do i need a policy
question seven
do i need a policy on workplace relationships
you certainly need a policy on a sexual harassment
and i think most hr departments recognize that
but for the kind of consensual behavior we ve been talking about
it s a little different
as much as people in hr would love to wave a magic wand
and say thou shall not fall in love at work
it s just not realistic
emotional connection and sexuality is who we are
i kind of want you to flip the script a little bit
i encourage hr to really think more broadly
about their role in not necessarily stamping out office romance
because i don t think that s realistic
but how do i help create a workplace climate and culture
where people feel respected for their individual contributions
not for their appearance or their gender
or their personal relationships
so the larger question is
how do you make sure people are valued and respected
