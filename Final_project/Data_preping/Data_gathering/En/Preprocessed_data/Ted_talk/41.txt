How do we deal with gender imbalances and power dynamics in the workplace
There's a lot of gray area in workplace romance
I'd like to take a few minutes
and answer some of your frequently asked questions
So question one Should I date my coworker
Do you want to date your coworker for a bit of fun
Do you want to date your coworker to hook up
Because then you're really better off on Tinder
If you want to date your coworker
because you really sincerely think you're falling in love with them
or there's a real potential for a long term committed relationship
Studies show that your coworkers are generally positive about it
if they perceive that you're falling in love
It's when your coworkers sense that something else is in play
In almost all cases no you should not date your boss
because now you've got a power dynamic
When there's a relationship between a boss and a subordinate
it generates a lot of negative feelings
and the negative feelings tend to fall on the person
People usually assume some kind of favoritism
and there can be resentment stirred up by that
There was a study published last year
that suggested dating a superior can even have a negative impact on your career
to imagine that they worked at a law firm
They asked them to make recommendations on which employee should get picked
and which should get promoted to partner
They looked at credentials for imaginary employees
and when it was stated that an employee had been dating
or was in a relationship with a superior
the evaluators were less likely to pick that person for the training program
even if they had the exact same credentials
as someone who wasn't dating their boss
The evaluators were also quick to dismiss their accomplishments
Can I date someone who reports to me
Can I date someone who reports to me
You may not feel like you're really the boss right
But you are and there's a power dynamic there
that's simply not there for other couples
If you really believe there is a sincere honestly felt personal connection
one of you may need to move
and it shouldn't always be the person who's lower in the company pecking order
Are they dating Are they not dating
You don't have to make a big deal of it but secrecy tends to be corrosive
People tend to see workplace couples as a coalition or a unit
so try to make it clear to your coworkers that you're not the same person
you love each other but you are going to disagree
Why are coworkers often attracted to each other
Well the obvious answer is people tend to be attracted to each other
But there's another ingredient that has to be added
when there's work that demands close collaboration
So imagine you have a big group project with a tight deadline
and you're working late nights and brainstorming ideas
You look up and across the table
one of your colleagues throws out a really great idea
You may feel something and that's natural
The second reason why people at work are attracted to each other
is they may often be similar to each other
Birds of a feather flock together And Opposites attract
and we like people who are like us
Some researchers argue that for people flirting at work
flirting is good and it boosts creativity
But my own research suggests things are different
for people who are watching or who are subjected to the flirting
Witnessing flirtation in the workplace creates a sense of not knowing the rules
or maybe seeing something that you shouldn't be seeing
People who frequently witness flirting at work
they actually report feeling less satisfied in their jobs
and they feel less valued by their company
They're more likely to give a negative appraisal of the work environment
For women this association can be even stronger
even when people report not being bothered by the flirting
It's true even when they say they enjoy it
So a flirtatious environment really could be toxic
Do I need a policy on workplace relationships
You certainly need a policy on a sexual harassment
and I think most HR departments recognize that
But for the kind of consensual behavior we've been talking about
As much as people in HR would love to wave a magic wand
and say Thou shall not fall in love at work
Emotional connection and sexuality is who we are
I kind of want you to flip the script a little bit
I encourage HR to really think more broadly
about their role in not necessarily stamping out office romance
but how do I help create a workplace climate and culture
where people feel respected for their individual contributions
not for their appearance or their gender
how do you make sure people are valued and respected
