how to come out at work about anything
coming out
typically we think of this
as being an experience specific to the queer community
but we all have things that we re keeping in our closets
it could be something about our home and family life
about our mental or physical health
maybe you re not allergic to cats you just don t like them
i feel you on that one
whatever it is that you re keeping in your closet
it shapes the way you navigate the world
that can include your work life
so how do we go about disclosing these important
but sometimes difficult to talk about aspects of who we are
and when someone comes out to us
what can we best do to listen and support them
the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
hi my name s micah
but it hasn t always been
after a year at my current place of work
i started the process of coming out as trans
when i sat down with human resources to talk
about how to reintroduce myself to everybody
neither of us had answers
nobody at my place of work had come out as trans before
but that s what i m here to offer you
three tips on how to talk
about things that are hard to talk about
and for those of you on the other side of the conversation
i have some advice for you too on how you can best listen
respond and be an active ally for your colleague
i can t give you the exact words to say
because they should be your own
after all i don t know what you re keeping in your closet
but whatever it might be
i hope these tips will provide you with a framework
that s going to help you decide exactly what you want to say
and how you want to say it
know what you want and don t want out of the conversation
to know this ask yourself questions like
do i need anything
from the person that i m disclosing this to
where do i want the conversation to go from here
if anywhere at all
and how do i want this person
to understand my own relationship with this aspect of who i am
so in my case i knew i wanted people to call me
by my new name and pronouns
but i also didn t want them to avoid me
out of fear of messing them up
this was going to take time
and i wanted this to feel like any other ordinary fact
about who i am
so now we know what we want to communicate
let s talk about how we re going to say it
by setting the tone
you re going to want to present the information
in the same way you want people to respond to it
they re going to be looking and listening for cues
on what the appropriate response is
is this something that you want to be celebrated
i m trans
or do you want to just address it and move on with your life
oh by the way i m trans
there s no one right way to say it for everybody
what s most important here is what s right for you
another note
we re not going to be able to control the way
in which everybody responds to this
but what we do have control over
is how they understand our own relationship
with this part of who we are
so now that we know what we want to say
and how we want to say it
where do we want the conversation to go from here
well my advice is to give an action item
this will help you keep control of the conversation
by giving people direction
on what they re supposed to do or say next
i knew i wanted this to feel like any other ordinary fact about who i am
so i decided i was going to use my coming out
to solve an ordinary problem
and i sent the following email
hello all i need your help
i am in the market for a moisturizer to help with my dry skin
i m also in the process of out as trans
i m changing my name to micah
and my pronouns are he him his
if you have any questions about my change in pronouns
or my skin care needs
feel free to send an email
to my updated contact information
and i d also like to note that while my skin is dry
it is not too sensitive
we re all going to mess up my name and my pronouns
myself included
so when this happens don t panic or cringe
please be kind to yourself
as we stumble through these growing pains together
i m fortunate and grateful to work in a place
where i feel embraced in any form
be it as a transgender man or a person with dry skin
or in this case both
now i m going to be honest
i haven t made many changes to my skin care routine
since sending this email
but i will say that i am feeling much more comfortable
in my own skin
and that s what thanks to responses like these
you have all the love and support micah
and please know that i highly rec clinique products
you are the best
you are and will always be one of my favorite people at work
even if you do have terribly dry skin
thank you for being you
however much or little you want to talk about dry skin genders bodies etc
i will be here for you
thank you for giving us permission to mess up
now you might be wondering
if i m the listener in this conversation
what can i best do to support my colleague
other than maybe referring them to my dermatologist
well for starters listen
with an open heart and an empathetic ear
you re especially going to want to listen here
for the specific language the person is using
to describe themself and their experience
because that s the same language
you re going to want to use back to them
you might be tempted to ask your coworkers some questions
about their identity
before you ask them a question
ask yourself
can i find the answer to this in a search engine
chances are the answer is yes
and if the answer is no ask yourself
is this too personal of a question
for me to be asking my colleague
one question that is okay to ask though
is there anything i can do to support you at this time
this is a note for if you re responding in the moment and in person
but if you want to be an active ally
the conversation doesn t end here
it picks up again with your colleagues and human resources
on how you can make your workplace more inclusive
of this person s identity
chances are it s not just going to help them
but maybe someone else down the line
now in my case
it would be adding pronouns to your email signature
and asking your coworkers to do the same
in order to help normalize it across the org
it could also be talking to hr
about having more trans inclusive health care policies
and my last piece of advice is for both the listener
and the leader in the conversation
remember that they re the same person
you ve always known them to be
it s the weight of stereotypes and stigmas
that often keep our closet doors shut
we re afraid people are now going to see us as this thing
instead of seeing this thing as an aspect of who we are
of we ve always been
i know that was the case for me too
but it got easier for me to say my name is micah
because of the way i saw it not only accepted
but enthusiastically embraced by all of my coworkers
so whatever it is you re keeping in your closet
i hope these tips empower you
to bring your authentic self into your workplace
and hopefully feel more comfortable in your own skin
