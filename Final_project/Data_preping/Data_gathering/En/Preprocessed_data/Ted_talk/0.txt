how to make applying for jobs less painful
applying for jobs online
is one of the worst digital experiences of our time
and applying for jobs in person really isn t much better
the way we work
the problem
hiring as we know it is broken on many fronts
it s a terrible experience for people
about percent of people
who applied to jobs using various methods in the past year
said they never heard anything back from the employer
and at the company level it s not much better
percent of people get fired or quit
within the first year of starting their jobs
it s pretty mind blowing
it s also bad for the economy
for the first time in history
we have more open jobs than we have unemployed people
and to me that screams that we have a problem
i believe that at the crux of all of this is a single piece of paper the r sum
a r sum definitely has some useful pieces in it
what roles people have had computer skills
what languages they speak
but what it misses is what they have the potential to do
that they might not have had the opportunity to do in the past
and with such a quickly changing economy where jobs are coming online
that might require skills that nobody has
if we only look at what someone has done in the past
we re not going to be able to match people to the jobs of the future
so this is where i think technology can be really helpful
you ve probably seen that algorithms have gotten pretty good
at matching people to things
but what if we could use that same technology
to actually help us find jobs that we re really well suited for
but i know what you re thinking
algorithms picking your next job sounds a little bit scary
but there is one thing that has been shown
to be really predictive of someone s future success in a job
and that s what s called a multimeasure test
multimeasure tests really aren t anything new
but they used to be really expensive
and required a phd sitting across from you
and answering lots of questions and writing reports
multimeasure tests are a way
to understand someone s inherent traits
your memory your attentiveness
multimeasure tests
what if we could take multimeasure tests
and make them scalable and accessible
and provide data to employers about really what the traits are
of someone who can make them a good fit for a job
this all sounds abstract
let s try one of the games together
you re about to see a flashing circle
and your job is going to be to clap when the circle is red
and do nothing when it s green
ready
begin
green circle
green circle
red circle
green circle
red circle
maybe you re the type of person
who claps the millisecond after a red circle appears
or maybe you re the type of person
who takes just a little bit longer to be percent sure
or maybe you clap on green even though you re not supposed to
the cool thing here is that this isn t like a standardized test
where some people are employable and some people aren t
instead it s about understanding the fit between your characteristics
and what would make you good a certain job
we found that if you clap late on red and you never clap on the green
you might be high in attentiveness and high in restraint
people in that quadrant tend to be great students great test takers
great at project management or accounting
but if you clap immediately on red and sometimes clap on green
that might mean that you re more impulsive and creative
and we ve found that top performing salespeople often embody these traits
the way we actually use this in hiring
is we have top performers in a role go through neuroscience exercises
like this one
then we develop an algorithm
that understands what makes those top performers unique
and then when people apply to the job
we re able to surface the candidates who might be best suited for that job
so you might be thinking there s a danger in this
diversity
the work world today is not the most diverse
and if we re building algorithms based on current top performers
how do we make sure
that we re not just perpetuating the biases that already exist
for example if we were building an algorithm based on top performing ceos
and use the s p as a training set
you would actually find
that you re more likely to hire a white man named john than any woman
and that s the reality of who s in those roles right now
but technology actually poses a really interesting opportunity
we can create algorithms that are more equitable
and more fair than human beings have ever been
every algorithm that we put into production has been pretested
to ensure that it doesn t favor any gender or ethnicity
and if there s any population that s being overfavored
we can actually alter the algorithm until that s no longer true
when we focus on the inherent characteristics
that can make somebody a good fit for a job
we can transcend racism classism sexism ageism
even good schoolism
our best technology and algorithms shouldn t just be used
for helping us find our next movie binge or new favorite justin bieber song
imagine if we could harness the power of technology
to get real guidance on what we should be doing
based on who we are at a deeper level
