tips to future proof your career
how many jobs have you had
how many do you expect to have over the course of your career
well the scary thing is that number has historically been around
but in the future
i predict it ll be closer to or or more
and a lot of those jobs don t even exist yet
this future of work sounds overwhelming
especially when you take into account our old fashioned system of resumes
job postings and applicant tracking systems
it s hard enough to navigate just a single career transition
but you re far more prepared than you think
to navigate your next job change
and all the ones that come after
the way we work
i m dr
michelle weise
and i advise companies and educational institutions
on how to prepare workers for successful and longer careers
right now i want to talk about how you can navigate that longer career
starting with your next job change
number one highlight your human skills
highlight your human skills
when we talk about skills
we tend to focus on hard skills like coding editing
data visualization or budgeting
but human skills need to share the spotlight too
these are skills like adaptability collaboration exercising judgment
or mediating tense situations
they may not always show up in obvious ways on your resume
but they have enormous value
to surface your human skills
make a timeline of all of your experiences
both personal and professional
do you see patterns
have certain skills grown over time
maybe your stint as a barista made you a great team player
or good at communicating in chaos
or maybe your experience as a caregiver for a child
or someone with special needs
gave you strengths like patience or empathy
which informs how you design human centered digital products
or guide teams through a reorganization
human skills are deeply transferable
you might surprise yourself by how prepared you already are
for your next role
second become a skills translator
become a skills translator
you need to translate your skills
into the language of your prospective employer
research the industry you want to move into
because the same skill can have vastly different meanings
depending on the context
for instance
when a marketing position is asking for a candidate
who s strong in communication
they re usually looking for you to display storytelling or branding skills
but when a behavioral health position mentions communication
it s likely the employer is looking for your experience with counseling
or crisis management
become their translator
find data in discomfort
third find data in discomfort
at work when do you feel uncomfortable
maybe you feel out of depth when people bring up a new technology or a platform
or maybe someone at your current organization got the raise or promotion that you wanted
pay attention to those signals
that kind of discomfort is good
it s data telling you where you need to level up
sign up for a course to get up to speed on that new platform or application
transform that discomfort around your skills gaps into action
finally get picky
get picky
you shouldn t be the only one committed to your skill development
your employer should be too
the next time you change jobs
try to choose a company or organization that is building talent from within
look at linkedin and see if people have risen within the company
ask during the interview whether there are clear road maps
for internal advancement
the reality is most companies have so much work to do
when it comes to recognizing human skills
spotting talent in unexpected places
and cultivating the careers of their own employees
you want an employer that takes the long view on your career
and can help you fill your skills gaps on the job
even if the job market can feel broken at times
remember you can take control you can steer the process
you can surface your hidden skills
translate your strengths and level up your gaps
you can show employers new ways to think about why they should hire you
and when you do all of those lane changes ahead will feel a whole lot less intimidating
and maybe even a little
