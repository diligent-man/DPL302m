How many do you expect to have over the course of your career
Well the scary thing is that number has historically been around
I predict it'll be closer to or or more
And a lot of those jobs don't even exist yet
especially when you take into account our old fashioned system of resumes
It's hard enough to navigate just a single career transition
but you're far more prepared than you think
and all the ones that come after
and I advise companies and educational institutions
on how to prepare workers for successful and longer careers
Right now I want to talk about how you can navigate that longer career
we tend to focus on hard skills like coding editing
But human skills need to share the spotlight too
These are skills like adaptability collaboration exercising judgment
They may not always show up in obvious ways on your resume
make a timeline of all of your experiences
Maybe your stint as a barista made you a great team player
Or maybe your experience as a caregiver for a child
gave you strengths like patience or empathy
which informs how you design human centered digital products
You might surprise yourself by how prepared you already are
into the language of your prospective employer
Research the industry you want to move into
because the same skill can have vastly different meanings
when a marketing position is asking for a candidate
they're usually looking for you to display storytelling or branding skills
But when a behavioral health position mentions communication
it's likely the employer is looking for your experience with counseling
At work when do you feel uncomfortable
Maybe you feel out of depth when people bring up a new technology or a platform
or maybe someone at your current organization got the raise or promotion that you wanted
It's data telling you where you need to level up
Sign up for a course to get up to speed on that new platform or application
Transform that discomfort around your skills gaps into action
You shouldn't be the only one committed to your skill development
try to choose a company or organization that is building talent from within
Look at LinkedIn and see if people have risen within the company
Ask during the interview whether there are clear road maps
The reality is most companies have so much work to do
when it comes to recognizing human skills
and cultivating the careers of their own employees
You want an employer that takes the long view on your career
and can help you fill your skills gaps on the job
Even if the job market can feel broken at times
remember you can take control you can steer the process
translate your strengths and level up your gaps
You can show employers new ways to think about why they should hire you
And when you do all of those lane changes ahead will feel a whole lot less intimidating
