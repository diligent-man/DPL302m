the secret to giving great feedback
if you look at a carpenter they have a toolbox
a dentist they have their drills
in our era and the type of work most of us are doing
the tool we most need is actually centered
around being able to give and receive feedback well
the way we work
humans have been talking about feedback for centuries
in fact confucius way back in bc
talked about how important it is to be able to say difficult messages well
but to be honest we re still pretty bad at it
in fact a recent gallup survey found
that only percent of employees strongly agree
that the feedback they get actually improves their work
those numbers are pretty dismal
so what s going on
the way that most people give their feedback
actually isn t brain friendly
people fall into one of two camps
either they re of the camp that is very indirect and soft
and the brain doesn t even recognize that feedback is being given
or it s just simply confused
or they fall into the other camp of being too direct
and with that it tips the other person into the land of being defensive
there s this part of the brain called the amygdala
and it s scanning at all times to figure out
whether the message has a social threat attached to it
with that we ll move forward to defensiveness
we ll move backwards in retreat
and what happens is the feedback giver then starts to disregulate as well
they add more ums and ahs and justifications
and the whole thing gets wonky really fast
it doesn t have to be this way
i and my team have spent many years going into different companies
and asking who here is a great feedback giver
anybody who s named again and again
we actually bring into our labs to see what they re doing differently
and what we find is that there s a four part formula
that you can use to say any difficult message well
ok are you ready for it here we go
the first part of the formula is what we call the micro yes
great feedback givers begin their feedback
by asking a question that is short but important
it lets the brain know that feedback is actually coming
it would be something for example like
do you have five minutes to talk about how that last conversation went
or i have some ideas for how we can improve things
can i share them with you
this micro yes question does two things for you
first of all it s going to be a pacing tool
it lets the other person know that feedback is about to be given
and the second thing it does is it creates a moment of buy in
i can say yes or no to that yes or no question
and with that i get a feeling of autonomy
the second part of the feedback formula is going to be giving your data point
here you should name specifically what you saw or heard
and cut out any words that aren t objective
there s a concept we call blur words
a blur word is something that can mean different things to different people
blur words are not specific
so for example if i say you shouldn t be so defensive
or you could be more proactive
what we see great feedback givers doing differently
is they ll convert their blur words into actual data points
so for example instead of saying
you aren t reliable
we would say you said you d get that email to me by
and i still don t have it yet
specificity is also important when it comes to positive feedback
and the reason for that is that we want to be able to specify exactly
what we want the other person to increase or diminish
and if we stick with blur words
they actually won t have any clue particularly
what to do going forward to keep repeating that behavior
the third part of the feedback formula is the impact statement
here you name exactly how that data point impacted you
so for example i might say because i didn t get the message
i was blocked on my work and couldn t move forward
or i really liked how you added those stories
because it helped me grasp the concepts faster
it gives you a sense of purpose
and meaning and logic between the points
which is something the brain really craves
the fourth part of the feedback formula is a question
great feedback givers wrap their feedback message with a question
they ll ask something like
well how do you see it
or this is what i m thinking we should do
but what are your thoughts on it
what it does is it creates commitment rather than just compliance
it makes the conversation no longer be a monologue
but rather becomes a joint problem solving situation
but there s one last thing
great feedback givers not only can say messages well
but also they ask for feedback regularly
in fact our research on perceived leadership
shows that you shouldn t wait for feedback to be given to you
what we call push feedback
but rather you should actively ask for feedback
what we call pulling feedback
pulling feedback establishes you as a continual learner
and puts the power in your hands
the most challenging situations
are actually the ones that call for the most skillful feedback
but it doesn t have to be hard
now that you know this four part formula
you can mix and match it to make it work for any difficult conversation
