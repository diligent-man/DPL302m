rules to help you build a successful business
Running a business means being a constant problem solver
distribution creating content or I don't know
deciding what to do during a pandemic
The trick isnâ€™t always knowing all the answers
but becoming adept at figuring them out
comes from growing up in Latino neighborhoods in LA
and being surrounded by so many people who are immigrants
It takes heart and ingenuity to move to a new country
so many examples of people getting creative with limited resources
whether it was the pupusa lady outside rain or shine
or my dad who started as a field worker and now owns his own restaurant
and used my entire life savings to launch Rizos Curls
Helping people embrace their natural hair texture
has been my personal passion since I was a teenager
Learning to love my hair in its natural state
was the first step to learning to love myself
multimillion dollar business that has been profitable since day one
But turns out that entrepreneurial spirit was there all along
Here are my top three principles that guide me in doing business
With every transaction your customer is giving you power
so don't take that power for granted
I feel so immersed with our customers
because I see them in my family my tias
my cousins my parents and even in myself
And that means nobody not even the haircare giants
can speak to them like I can
We get to know our customers on a personal level
because we take the time to really listen
Building that kind of relationship creates an authentic
Two Don't be afraid to break the rules
where my business is the first of its kind
This year we launched Rizos Curls into a mainstream retailer
where we became the first Latina-owned curly hair care brand
It was a big deal for us
that we should have invested a lot of marketing dollars
but instead I showed up on a horse
I spent less than a dollars on that launch
So my point is don't be afraid to try things differently
Don't expect the same rules to apply to your small business
Embrace what makes you you and make it a part of your strategy
rather than following the same old playbook that's out there
Running a business is noisy and demanding
There's retailers customers your team your finances
and things happening in the world beyond your control
How do you make big and important decisions with all of that
Yes facts and data matter but at the end of the day
and I have a checklist that I go through after every big meeting
where I ask myself questions like Am I uneasy Am I excited
How do they make me really feel
It's a thing that can't be explained through numbers or logic
But when I go through my list of questions
I'm able to quiet the noise and tune into that voice inside me
that helps me stay true to myself and my mission
It's important to know who you are and who you are not
That means knowing when to say no
For me that's meant turning down outside capital
Yeah that extra cash flow would have been amazing
but investors would want to maximize profits and in turn
compromise a community and culture aspects of what we stand for
At the end of the day you have to be grateful
No one has to work for you and no one has to be your customer
so remember to appreciate every employee effort
