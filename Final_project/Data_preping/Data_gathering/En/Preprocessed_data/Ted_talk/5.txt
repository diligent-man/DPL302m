how to succeed in your new job
in many workplaces there are rules that are completely unspoken
understanding them is crucial for success
and yet you won t find them in your employee handbook
unless you re lucky enough to have a mentor or manager
who pulls you aside to help
you just kind of have to figure them out on your own
the way we work
starting a new job can feel like starting at a new school
you re meeting new people
you re getting thrown into unfamiliar situations
and you re constantly wondering what does everyone think of me
but whether you re starting your first job ever
or just starting a new role
making a great impression doesn t have to be so scary
it all comes down to deciphering those unspoken rules
and demonstrating what i call the three cs
competence commitment and compatibility
the first c is competence
competence
on day one your new colleagues are probably looking at you
and thinking can you do your job
the way to convince others
not to mention yourself that yes you can
is to show your homework
and to give others something to react to
let s say it s your first day and it s utter chaos
people are forwarding you messages
with nothing more than a see below at the top
and pulling you into meetings without any notice or context
your manager just gave you a task
and two minutes in you re already confused
instead of going back to them right away and saying
i don t know what to do next help
or doing what i did
which is not asking questions at all
think about a similar task that you tried in a previous job
in school or just for yourself
what steps did you take then
then make your best guess and just give it a try
then go back to your manager and say
i m working on x
and i m not quite sure of what to do next
i ve taken x steps and spoken to so and so and i understand this part
but i m still unclear about this other part
what do you think about this approach
no i m not suggesting that you fake it till you make it
but what i am suggesting is that you try until you can t try anymore
time matters though so give yourself a limit
and depending on your deadline figuring things out on your own
then ask and then learn from what others tell you
it s your first bit of knowledge around how things work here
commitment
the second c is commitment
besides looking to see if you can do your job
your colleagues are also looking to see if you re dedicated
during your first week in a new job
try asking your manager questions about expectations
my favorites are one what are my top priorities in this role
two how would you like to communicate day to day and week to week
and three what have your highest performers done
that you d suggest that i do too
for your peers try to go more casual
in your first few days your manager will be probably or well
at least hopefully
taking you around and introducing you to your other teammates
in those moments
think about how you can transform some of those hi s into conversations
and then those conversations into relationships
one option is to ask how others weeks are going
for those you really get along with
try involving them in your work
and maybe even your life with phrases like
oh i d love to get your input on a
or could i get your advice on b
these can all go a long way in deepening a relationship
compatibility
the third c it s compatibility
every time a new person joins a team
the others on it want to know will you get along with us
by initiating conversations
you re already expressing compatibility
but while you re at it
use this time to try and identify who s in charge of what
or what i call invisible swim lanes
let s say you ve just started a new remote job
first ask your manager if there s an org chart
it s a diagram showing who reports to whom
and if there is one amazing
but formal job titles and reporting lines
can only tell you so much about how things really work
so when you re in meetings and group chats pay attention
what s each person s role
who reports to whom
who s on whose side who commands respect
which behaviors get rewarded and which behaviors get punished
understanding these norms loyalties power brokers
and swim lanes
is what people are really referring to
when they say that it s important to understand a team s culture
and by the way while you re mapping out these swim lanes
look around to see if there s any swim lane that might be unoccupied
or in other words what tasks might be available
that aren t currently being done
that can help your team accomplish more better faster cheaper safer
more securely
by doing this
you ll show that you re competent enough to spot gaps
committed enough to fill them
and compatible enough to not overstep
here s the reality of starting a new job
doing your job is only part of it
the rest is about how you get along with other people
but as much as we ve been talking about others sizing you up
don t forget to do the same
is this an environment where you can flourish and do your best work
can you see yourself getting along with your coworkers
is this even work you re excited to do
every job is a two way street
you can do well only if you want to do well
and if you re set up to do well
so look around reflect and be honest with yourself about whether this is a good place for you
