how to lead in a crisis
we think of a great leader
as the unwavering captain who guides us forward
through challenge and complexity
confident unwavering leaders
armed with data and past experience
have long been celebrated in business and politics alike
but sometimes and certainly now
a crisis comes along that is so new and so urgent
that it upends everything we thought we knew
the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
one thing we know for sure
is that more upheavals are coming
in a completely interconnected world
a single political uprising
a viral video a distant tsunami
or a tiny virus can send shock waves around the world
upheaval creates fear
and in the midst of it people crave security
which can incline leaders
toward the usual tropes of strength confidence constancy
but it won t work
we have to flip the leadership playbook
communication
first this type of leadership requires
communicating with transparency communicating often
so how can leaders lead when there is so little certainty
so little clarity
whether you are a ceo a prime minister a middle manager
or even a head of school
upheaval means you have to ramp up the humility
when what you know is limited
pretending that you have the answers isn t helpful
amidst upheaval leaders must share what they know
and admit what they don t know
paradoxically that honesty creates more psychological safety for people
not less
for example when the pandemic devastated the airline industry
virtually overnight
ceo of delta airlines ed bastian
ramped up employee communication
despite having so little clarity
about the path ahead facing truly dire results
at one point in
losing over a hundred million dollars a day
it would have been far easier for bastian
to wait for more information before taking action
but effective leaders during upheaval
don t hide in the shadows
in fact as bastian put it
it is far more important to communicate
when you don t have the answers than when you do
action
second act with urgency despite incomplete information
admitting you don t have the answers
does not mean avoiding action
while it s natural to want more information
fast action is often the only way to get more information
worse inaction leaves people feeling lost and unstable
when new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern
laid out a four level alert system very early
in the covid crisis
she lacked information with which to set the level
despite lacking answers she did not wait to communicate
about the threat with the nation
at first she set the level at two
only to change it to four two days later as cases rose
that triggered a national lockdown
which no doubt saved countless lives
later when cases began to dissipate
she made subsequent decisions
reflecting that new information
values
third leaders must hold purpose and values steady
even as goals and situations change
values can be your guiding light
when everything else is up in the air
if you care about customer experience
don t let go of that in times of upheaval
if a core value is health and safety
put that at the center of every decision you make
now doing this requires being very transparent
about what your values are
and in this way your steadfastness shows
not in your plans but in your values
prime minister ardern s clear purpose all along
was protecting human life
even as the immediate goal shifted from preventing illness
to preparing health systems
and ultimately to bolstering the economy
sharing power
and finally give power away
our instincts are to hold even more tightly
to control in times of upheaval but it backfires
one of the most effective ways to show leadership
if counterintuitive
is to share power with those around you
doing this requires asking for help
being clear that you can t do it alone
this also provokes innovation
while giving people a sense of meaning
nothing is worse in a crisis
than feeling like there s nothing you can do to help
we follow this new kind of leader through upheaval
because we have confidence
not in their map but in their compass
we believe they ve chosen the right direction
given the current information
and that they will keep updating
most of all we trust them
and we want to help them in finding and refinding
the path forward
