as the unwavering captain who guides us forward
have long been celebrated in business and politics alike
a crisis comes along that is so new and so urgent
that it upends everything we thought we knew
Made possible with the support of Dropbox
or a tiny virus can send shock waves around the world
and in the midst of it people crave security
toward the usual tropes of strength confidence constancy
We have to flip the leadership playbook
So how can leaders lead when there is so little certainty
Whether you are a CEO a prime minister a middle manager
upheaval means you have to ramp up the humility
pretending that you have the answers isn't helpful
Amidst upheaval leaders must share what they know
Paradoxically that honesty creates more psychological safety for people
For example when the pandemic devastated the airline industry
about the path ahead facing truly dire results
losing over a hundred million dollars a day
it would have been far easier for Bastian
to wait for more information before taking action
it is far more important to communicate
when you don't have the answers than when you do
Second act with urgency despite incomplete information
While it's natural to want more information
fast action is often the only way to get more information
Worse inaction leaves people feeling lost and unstable
When New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern
laid out a four level alert system very early
she lacked information with which to set the level
Despite lacking answers she did not wait to communicate
At first she set the level at two
only to change it to four two days later as cases rose
Third leaders must hold purpose and values steady
when everything else is up in the air
don't let go of that in times of upheaval
If a core value is health and safety
put that at the center of every decision you make
Now doing this requires being very transparent
and in this way your steadfastness shows
not in your plans but in your values
Prime Minister Ardern's clear purpose all along
Even as the immediate goal shifted from preventing illness
Our instincts are to hold even more tightly
to control in times of upheaval but it backfires
One of the most effective ways to show leadership
is to share power with those around you
being clear that you can't do it alone
while giving people a sense of meaning
than feeling like there's nothing you can do to help
We follow this new kind of leader through upheaval
not in their map but in their compass
We believe they've chosen the right direction
and we want to help them in finding and refinding
