how to know if it s time to change careers
i was not one of those kids
that knew exactly what they wanted to do when they were growing up
in the last years of my career
i ve been an english teacher attorney video game creator
and now a toilet paper salesman
selling millions of rolls of toilet paper a year
the way we work
life is about finding the intersection of what you really really love
with what you re really really good at
as simple as it sounds it s really not that easy to find
after a brief stint as an english teacher
i went to law school and ended up becoming an attorney
at a big law firm here in new york city
like most americans for the next two three years
i was holding on to my job for dear life
working really late hours at a job that i thought maybe i was good at
but certainly not one that i really loved
i then came upon the epiphany
that it takes years if not tens of thousands of hours
to get really good at something
i really didn t have a lot of time to waste
this talk isn t for those looking to quit their job
because they don t like their boss or they had a long day at work
this is for those that are ready to make the completely scary leap
into a brand new career
so as you think about making a career change
here are a few tips i hope you consider
and a few things i ve picked up along the way
first there s three things to think about before you re ready to move on
number one professional life is about learning
if you re not even interested in learning anymore
that s a huge red flag
that there might not be a future for you in that industry
number two career changes are often gut driven
if you constantly have sleepless nights
where you re wide awake staring at the ceiling thinking
oh man
i can t live with myself if i never try to make this change
or if i don t even actually investigate it
then trust your gut
it might be time for that career change
on the flip side
one reason to not move on is short term pain
if you don t like your boss
or people at the office are grating on you
that s actually not a good reason to absolutely change your career
because when you do change a career
you generally have to start from the bottom
and you ll probably feel a lot of short term pain
whether it s through a lack of salary or lack of a title
pain at any job is inevitable
so now you re convinced that it s time to change your career
then there s three things to do immediately
first network network network
no one ever builds a career without a good mentor
or a good support network
what i mean by networking is getting all the great advice
that you can possibly get
technology has made it so simple to reach out to new people
to say hey i m thinking about making a career change
do you have just five minutes to chat with me
that passion and that hunger and that ability to be a sponge
really attracts awesome mentors
and people willing to give you their time
to give you some good advice
so go out there and meet new people
the second thing you need to do immediately
is shore up your finances
the reality is when you change your career
you ll either start with a job with a lower title
or lower pay or maybe even no pay
especially if you re starting your own business
so going out there and making sure your finances are in order
to make the transition less painful
is really really important
for me personally as i made the transition from being an attorney
over to a video game creator
i wanted to have at least six to months of personal runway in the bank
six to months might not be the right number for you
but be honest with yourself on what that number should be
number three if you re not ready to make the full jump right at this moment
then get your side hustle on
side hustles could be anything from volunteering with an organization
that s in the new industry you want to go into
could be starting your business part time on the weekends
it s a free way to get a taste to see if you really love something
so you re ready to make the move
or maybe you already made the move
here are three things you should think about doing right now
one do not i repeat do not burn bridges
you spent years building those bridges
why burn them now
the world is such a small place
especially with all these online platforms
that believe me you will see these people again
and probably in the most inopportune times
number two take stock of what you ve learned
in your previous career or careers
most likely a lot of those things are really applicable
to your new job and your new career
whether it s interacting with people playing on a team
or dealing with jerks and assholes
all those things are really universally applicable
you ll find jerks no matter what industry you re in
no one s immune to it everyone s got to figure it out
and you probably know how to do it already
lastly when you start your new job you re going to be nervous
but don t worry take a deep breath
because this is what i want to tell you
you re part of a new team now
and everyone around you is rooting for your success
because your success is their success
so welcome to your new career
