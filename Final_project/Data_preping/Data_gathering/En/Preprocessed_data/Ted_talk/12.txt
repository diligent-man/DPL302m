how to be a team player without burning out
collaborative work is everything we do to come up with big new ideas
and make plans to bring them to life with other people
the modern workplace is set up with so many ways to foster collaboration
meetings and brainstorming sessions
zooms and slack channels email instant messaging
so many tools to help us work closely together
and aspects of this are great
but we re doing more collaborative work than ever before
and the problem is it s overloading us
the way we work
from launching a new product to creating a vaccine
almost every endeavor we do at work requires working with others
towards a common goal
and collaboration is a great thing
it can help us work better and smarter
it can help us come up with ideas we never would have had on our own
and it can make us happier than executing tasks alone
but collaborative work has risen percent over the past decade
it s now taking up to percent of most people s workweeks
and those numbers from my research were pre pandemic
studies show that people are working five to eight hours more a week now
with collaborations drifting earlier into the morning
and later into the evening
when i came into this research
i was percent convinced the enemy was external
it was emails time zones and demanding clients to name just a few
but after hundreds of interviews
i ve discovered that even when given a choice not to participate
people are taking on more collaborative work than ever before
we re just too eager to jump in to collaborations that burn up our time
and that might actually run better without people in the fray
about percent of the collaboration overload problem starts
with the beliefs we have about ourselves and what it means to be a good colleague
and a productive person
these beliefs are hard to change
but if we examine them more closely
it can allow us to make stronger choices about what we do at work
and who we do it with
there are many triggers that spark our desire to say yes so often
but today i want to focus on the top three
the desire to help others
the need for accomplishment and fear
desire to help others
the first trigger is the desire to help
and the desire to help others is a positive constructive thing
and an important factor in success
it fulfills a deep need to be useful
and bolster our identity as a good teammate
but it s also one of the most significant drivers of overload
the more you re helpful the more people ask for your help
the problem is that you get so bogged down in helping
that it prevents you from meeting your own goals
and over time you become a bottleneck slowing others down
and this is all coming from a good place
the desire to help
need for accomplishment
the second trigger s the need for accomplishment
our drive to achieve is another admirable trait critical to success
and productivity in the workplace
and it also feels good
as little wins throughout the day and week give us a burst of satisfaction
the issue is that the cycle can get addictive
it leads you to solve more and more small problems for other people
and avoid the bigger thornier ones critical to your own success
this is my trigger
if i see a five minute window
i will inevitably try to jam minutes of these little fixes into it
and completely ignore the three hours of coordination i need to do
to get my team on board with what i m up to
and then i end up overwhelmed six weeks out
again all from a good place of trying to get something positive done
the third trigger is fear
fear is a major driver of overload today that takes several forms
the fear of missing out on better projects
better colleagues better opportunities
can become a persistent nagging problem that never lets you rest
you feel a frantic need to be a part of things
worrying that it ll be your last opportunity
the fear of losing control is just as bad
it makes you reluctant to delegate or connect the people around you
sentencing you to a life of doing everything yourself
and the fear of what others will say is powerful too
your knee jerk response becomes to say yes early and often
so everyone can see how responsive you are
unfortunately these fears drive unproductive choices
and lead us into burnout today
chances are you recognize yourself in one or more of these triggers
and since i gave you three triggers how about three ways to deal with them
get comfortable saying no
number one learn to get comfortable saying no
don t let yourself fall into the belief
that you don t have power in situations where your help is requested
remember that your answer doesn t have to be a binary yes or no
if you get a request from a boss or a colleague
chances are they have no idea what obligations you re juggling
be clear about what projects or deadlines you have ahead
ask them to help you prioritize
and if you just don t have the bandwidth
ask the person if you can show them how to do the task they re asking
or discuss if there s a different way to accomplish their goals
at the end of the day every yes means saying no to something else
save your yeses for when they really matter to you
remember you can delegate
number two remember you can delegate
opting out of a request can actually help others become more self reliant
i ve found that the most efficient collaborators get their sense of worth
not from always giving input and being involved
but from developing others and positioning them to grow too
draw a line between tasks that really do require you
and lower risk ones that you can delegate without concern
look for moments when you can give partial direction empower someone
and then step out of the way
and celebrate other s wins
don t succumb to the temptation
to point out how you would have done it differently
be intentional
number three be intentional in crafting your work life
high performers are strategic in knowing their goals
and identifying what they can and should take on
they think about their priorities not only for the week ahead
but on a two to three month time horizon too
so when a collaboration surfaces
make sure you re not making an emotional decision based on a false belief
ask yourself how does it align with my goals
how much time and energy will it take each week
and what are the upsides of the outcome
try to maximize those collaborations where you want to do the work
it contributes to your goals and you re the best person to do it
the crazy thing about collaboration overload is that it feels good
right up until it doesn t
all it takes is one thing too many to start a downward spiral
remember you re the only one who knows all your goals and obligations
and that you often have more choice than you think
