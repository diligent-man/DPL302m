steps to stop remote work burnout
you might think that working remotely is an introvert s dream
you re in your own home hidden behind a computer
possibly in your pajamas
but the truth is
for many introverts remote work is kind of a nightmare
ted the way we work
made possible with the support of dropbox
remote work is a nightmare
now that the pandemic has chased many of us out of our offices
we re chafing under the new remote rules of work
too much screen time
a lack of boundaries between work and home
endless video calls
the same things that make remote work difficult for introverts
make it difficult for everyone
far and away the worst part of remote work is video calls
being on camera is a performance
thoughtless scheduling can mean you re basically onstage performing
for eight hours a day
there are none of the nuanced cues that help you read a room
staring at disembodied heads on a screen
offers only a pale imitation of real human connection
social anxiety only makes this worse
when you have a camera in your face
that can really trigger your social anxiety
it takes energy to be on
so the key to managing remote work is to protect your energy
ritual and routine
first pay attention to ritual and routine
as much as we hated our commutes
they were a ritual that created a boundary between work and home
and we need that
for many of us those little breaks that we would build in to the work day
going to get a cup of coffee or a chat with a coworker
those are gone too
for me those rituals are when i gather my energy
assume my work character
and get into the right headspace
to dive in
so how can you recreate those breaks and boundaries at home
the key is to be intentional
it could be music or lighting
a pep talk with a friend
you could take a walk around the block at a certain time of day
or even a breathing or stretching routine
before you sit
whatever it takes for you to delineate the transition
between work and home
second we need to manage our pace place and space
you can think of pacing as managing the interactions
that tax your energy
versus those that recharge you
you could schedule fewer videoconferences
because remember those are performances
you could schedule downtime or recharge time after performances
oprah does this
as do many introverted performers and ceos
you could consider the time of day
think about when you can typically summon the energy to be on
and save other times for quiet work
for place use your workspace
to help you enforce good boundaries
even if your desk is in your kitchen
place space
make it feel like a workplace
for space build in some alone time every day
and this includes time away from your kids
it s really key to avoiding burnout
finally if you re a manager
you have a special role to play
to help employees protect their pace place and space
manage the room during video calls
even remotely chatty extroverts tend to dominate
to create a space where everyone can be heard
structure agendas
assign presentation rules
and minimize brainstorming
brainstorming can trigger social anxiety
and it can freeze up introverts
instead create a shared space where people can write their ideas
before a brainstorming session
favor audio
favor audio over video calls
research shows that we actually communicate more emotion and nuance
via audio alone
try asynchronous communication
for more complicated or provocative one on ones
you can steal this idea from author robert glazer
record a voice memo or video on your phone explaining your perspective
and send it to a colleague
and that way they can respond and react in their own time
along with a lot of challenges now
we have an opportunity
remote work is here to stay
so don t just transfer old habits and old company culture
to remote work
build something better
to get started
ask the introverts in your office what their ideal day looks like
and take your cue from there
