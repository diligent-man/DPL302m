You might think that working remotely is an introvert's dream
you're in your own home hidden behind a computer
for many introverts remote work is kind of a nightmare
Made possible with the support of Dropbox
Now that the pandemic has chased many of us out of our offices
we're chafing under the new remote rules of work
a lack of boundaries between work and home
The same things that make remote work difficult for introverts
Far and away the worst part of remote work is video calls
Thoughtless scheduling can mean you're basically onstage performing
There are none of the nuanced cues that help you read a room
Staring at disembodied heads on a screen
offers only a pale imitation of real human connection
When you have a camera in your face
that can really trigger your social anxiety
So the key to managing remote work is to protect your energy
First pay attention to ritual and routine
As much as we hated our commutes
they were a ritual that created a boundary between work and home
For many of us those little breaks that we would build in to the work day
going to get a cup of coffee or a chat with a coworker
For me those rituals are when I gather my energy
So how can you recreate those breaks and boundaries at home
You could take a walk around the block at a certain time of day
or even a breathing or stretching routine
whatever it takes for you to delineate the transition
Second we need to manage our pace place and space
You can think of pacing as managing the interactions
You could schedule downtime or recharge time after performances
as do many introverted performers and CEOs
You could consider the time of day
Think about when you can typically summon the energy to be on
and save other times for quiet work
Even if your desk is in your kitchen
For space build in some alone time every day
And this includes time away from your kids
you have a special role to play
to help employees protect their pace place and space
Even remotely chatty extroverts tend to dominate
To create a space where everyone can be heard
Instead create a shared space where people can write their ideas
Research shows that we actually communicate more emotion and nuance
You can steal this idea from author Robert Glazer
record a voice memo or video on your phone explaining your perspective
And that way they can respond and react in their own time
Along with a lot of challenges now
so don't just transfer old habits and old company culture
ask the introverts in your office what their ideal day looks like
