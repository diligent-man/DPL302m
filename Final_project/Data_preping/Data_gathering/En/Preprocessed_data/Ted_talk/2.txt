five out of american workers watching this
will have a freelance career by
that s just two or three years out
some of us will perform tasks like making deliveries or doing remote data entry
and some of us will be writers graphic designers product specialists
marketeers software engineers data analysts or business consultants
who are paid per project and not tied to any one company
having a freelance career gives you the power
to get your true market value
and the flexibility to build life the way you want it
but most importantly it gives you control over your future
making you less reliant on a single employer
hiring freelancers is good for organizations too
when freelancers come on board
they come with knowledge from multiple employers
freelancers also tend to be more up to date on their skills
they constantly read listen and learn new approaches to remain employable
and freelancers offer a jolt of energy
they arrive ready to hit the ground running
so how can you be part of this freelance future
here are some steps
step one identify your core value
talk to people in your network of current and former employers
and ask them what qualities make you someone who s worth hiring
are you thorough or fast
are you strategic
what types of projects do you really excel at
figure out exactly what value you bring as a freelancer
step two communicate it to employers
once you know your value
you re in great place to approach potential employers
whether it s places you ve worked with in the past
or other businesses in the same industry and say
this is what i will do for you
and this is the impact it could have on your business
make your value clear on your linkedin profile
and on your personal website
and ask to be paid what you re worth
which means you should do some research on pricing
and your value should translate into your fees
step three nurture early relationships
in the beginning
it s often in your best interest to take whatever jobs you re offered
it s not all going to be great or easy but you will learn so much
you ll start to see that you re better working with mission driven companies
or with managers who don t beat around the bush
or whether you re happier working remotely
or going into an office working with peers
every time you finish working with a new client
ask them for feedback
find out what worked well
what can i do better
as a freelancer you need to be proactive and find ways to improve
it will not only make you better
but help raise your value in the marketplace
step four grow your client base over time
as a freelancer
your existing customers are your best references
when a project is about to end
ask whether they know others who might benefit from your services
or ask if they can promote you and your work in their internal channels
social media platforms or email groups
don t be discouraged
it takes time and consistency to build a stable of clients
put your focus on building a reputation for good work
and you ll eventually have to turn down more jobs than you can accept
step five join a freelance community
whatever type of freelancer you are
find ways to connect with others in your field
what are the linkedin or facebook groups to join
which events to go to and which podcasts to listen to
this community will not only help you learn and give you leads on work
but it will also contain peers that you can vent to when you need it
if you re interested in freelancing
don t wait until you get fired or laid off to make that leap
remember when you rely on one employer they own your future
but by building your freelance capabilities
you ll have the power to decide not only who you want to work with
but when and in what capacity
and when downturns come
you ll be better able to withstand them
with a network of people who are excited to work with you
