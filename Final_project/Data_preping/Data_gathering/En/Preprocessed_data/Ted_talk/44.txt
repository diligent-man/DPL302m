why you should bring your whole self to work
a leader is steady firm decisive unwavering
never let em see you sweat always have an answer
the way we work
my name is dan i m a partner at a global creative consultancy
but there s another side to me
carrie dragshaw
the character i created on instagram
as i thought about my double life i couldn t help but wonder
when your true self is a little nontraditional
how much of it can you really bring to the office
for some of us is authenticity off limits
for the first years of my career
i thought there was one way to be a leader
decisive and serious
but that s not me
office drag
so i d put on basically office drag to fit the role
i d talk in a deeper voice try to hold in my hand motions
i m someone who gets really excited about things
so i d temper that
i had this little voice in my head telling me
you re too gay too feminine too flamboyant
i had one well intentioned adviser who said
everyone knows you re gay
and that s great
but you don t need to beat them over the head with it
carrie bradshaw
cut to me in a tutu for halloween
i dressed up as my favorite tv show character carrie bradshaw
thinking my friends would get a kick out of it
and then things got crazy
the post went viral and at first it was pure fun
i started getting these incredible messages from people
about how happy it made them
how it encouraged them to be their authentic selves
and i started to think
maybe this is the time to tell that little voice in my head to just shut up
and let myself be me
but then things got a little too big
carrie dragshaw was everywhere in the new york post us weekly
and i got terrified
what would my bosses think
would my coworkers still respect me as a leader
what would my clients think
i thought i was going to have to get a different job
the power of one
but then something happened something small
i got a text from my boss it wasn t long it just said
wow cosmo
with a link to an article that had just gone up about me
and it let me put that little scared voice away
and just be excited about this whole new world
rather than freaked out
that s the power of one person
sometimes all it takes is one ally to make you feel comfortable
and my coworkers started acting differently
they became more open more playful with me
it was as if knowing this other side of me
gave them permission to be more of themselves as well
i thought that openness and vulnerability
would actually decrease my standing with my team
but it s done the opposite
two years in
i never could have imagined that this part of me would not just be embraced
but could actually help my career
now i m lucky
i work in new york city
in an office where creativity is valued
and i was already pretty established in my career when all of this started
maybe that s you maybe it isn t
but all of this has taught me so much
about just the importance of bringing your whole self to work
and it s really challenged my own misperceptions
about what it takes to be successful
there s no one kind of way to be a leader
it s about finding your strengths and finding ways to amplify them
before if a meeting was hard i d put on my perfect leader mask
now i can say gosh that was frustrating
we can talk about challenges and struggles in an open way
rather than everybody pretending that they re fine until it s too late
concealing an identity takes work
think of all the wasted energy spent pretending
wishing you were someone different
what s most interesting to me though is that in this big study of covering
percent of those who say they re doing it
also believe their organization values inclusion
so clearly our workplaces and all of our strange inner voices
have a long way to go on acceptance
there s a big difference between adapting and disguising
and i think i learned that a little late
outro
personally i m taking all of this as a call to be the ally
who like my boss did for me
lets people know that it s ok to open up
if you re gay or proud of your ethnic background
or have a disability or are deeply religious
see what it s like being your full self at work
you might be pleasantly surprised
