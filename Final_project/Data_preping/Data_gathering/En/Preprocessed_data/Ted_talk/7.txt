ways to make hybrid work better for everyone
people keep talking
about how remote work is part of the future of work
well i have news that future is here
remote and hybrid work are the new reality
and now we have to figure out how to make them work for all of us
the way we work
future is here
in march when the covid pandemic hit
remote work went into hyperspeed
work routines that were tied to commutes and buildings
where people shared time and space went away
many people wondered
what would become of teamwork collaboration and productivity
they soon found that they could accomplish more at home
and find the best work life flexibility of their careers
today the verdict is in
using surveys polls and meta analyses
i found that over percent of employees in most global surveys
want a mix of in person and remote formats moving forward
this makes us multimodal workers
what does this mean
it means we have to be awesome in person
we have to be awesome remotely
and we have to be awesome when we re in hybrid mode
while that might sound like a lot
with some new thinking and new skills
we can use the office as one of our many work tools
i ve been doing research and advisory work on distributed work
for over years
and have spoken with over companies around the world
here are four things we know work well
coordinate anchor days
first coordinate anchor days
when we go to the office
let s make sure we overlap with our colleagues and collaborators
that s why we call these anchor days
otherwise we ll find ourselves in the office with no one around
no use in gathering at the water cooler if we re the only ones there
second plan spontaneity
second plan spontaneous
in my work
i ve heard over and over again
that while people prize the flexibility of hybrid work
they long for informal and spontaneous interactions with their colleagues
this is a classic paradox
but it s quite solvable through what we call structuring unstructured time
structure unstructured time
one thing to try is to set aside the initial six to seven minutes
of an hour long meeting for informal chat about non work matters
just to talk or even complain
you can also ask people the one word
that describes how they re doing verbally or in chat
you can have informal contact by scheduling virtual
or in person lunches with your colleagues
breaks for coffee tea or a snack
and even happy hour trivia challenge
if you re a leader
you should demonstrate the value of informal talk
by initiating it yourself
use the right tools
third use the right tools to communicate
the key here is to match our digital tools with our communication objectives
which means we have to mix it up
if we have to solve a really complicated problem
the best digital tool to use is one that allows real time discussion
if we need to process complex information
sending an email might be the best option
giving people time to review and absorb the content
video can be great
when we need our communication to include emotional cues
it helps to see someone s face when discussing tricky topics
it also increases immediacy and intimacy
but it can be exhausting
many people reporting tech exhaustion but it doesn t have to be that way
we need to know when to take a break
for one on ones
try audio and keep the cameras off
this last takeaway is for management but it affects all of us
commit to the new culture
avoid mixed messages
top leaders have to avoid sending mixed messages
too many are saying they re all for hybrid
while signaling that they prefer everyone to be in the office
or saying this conversation is so important
we should have it in person
leaders need to make sure that their words actions and attitudes
are aligned with the hybrid arrangements that they ve chosen
consistency between hybrid policies and attitudes
is the only way to build an inclusive hybrid culture for everyone
