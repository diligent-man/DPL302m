There are wide varieties of economic inequality most notably income inequality measured using the distribution of income the amount of money people are paid and wealth inequality measured using the distribution of wealth the amount of wealth people own
Besides economic inequality between countries or states there are important types of economic inequality between different groups of people
Important types of economic measurements focus on wealth income and consumption
There are many methods for measuring economic inequality the Gini coefficient being a widely used one
Another type of measure is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index which is a statistic composite index that takes inequality into account
Important concepts of equality include equity equality of outcome and equality of opportunity
Whereas globalization has reduced global inequality between nations it has increased inequality within nations
Income inequality between nations peaked in the s when world income was distributed bimodally into rich and poor countries
Since then income levels across countries have been converging with most people now living in middle-income countries
However inequality within most nations has risen significantly in the last years particularly among advanced countries
In this period close to percent of advanced economies have seen an increase in income inequality with over recording an increase in their Gini coefficients exceeding two points
Research has generally linked economic inequality to political and social instability including revolution democratic breakdown and civil conflict
Research suggests that greater inequality hinders economic growth and macroeconomic stability and that land and human capital inequality reduce growth more than inequality of income
Inequality is at the center stage of economic policy debate across the globe as government tax and spending policies have significant effects on income distribution
In advanced economies taxes and transfers decrease income inequality by one-third with most of this being achieved via public social spending such as pensions and family benefits
In the ratio between the income of the top and bottom percent of the world's population was three to one
A study titled Divided we Stand Why Inequality Keeps Rising by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD sought to explain the causes for this rising inequality by investigating economic inequality in OECD countries it concluded that the following factors played a role
Changes in the structure of households can play an important role
Single-headed households in OECD countries have risen from an average of in the late s to in the mid-s resulting in higher inequality
Assortative mating refers to the phenomenon of people marrying people with similar background for example doctors marrying other doctors rather than nurses
OECD found out that of couples where both partners work belonged to the same or neighbouring earnings deciles compared with some years before
In the bottom percentiles number of hours worked has decreased
The main reason for increasing inequality seems to be the difference between the demand for and supply of skillsThe study made the following conclusions about the level of economic inequality
Income inequality in OECD countries is at its highest level for the past half century
The ratio between the bottom and the top has increased from to in years
There are tentative signs of a possible convergence of inequality levels towards a common and higher average level across OECD countries
With very few exceptions France Japan and Spain the wages of the best-paid workers have risen relative to those of the lowest paidA OECD study investigated economic inequality in Argentina Brazil China India Indonesia Russia and South Africa
It concluded that key sources of inequality in these countries include a large persistent informal sector widespread regional divides eg
urban-rural gaps in access to education and barriers to employment and career progression for women
A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest of adults alone owned of global assets in the year
The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest nations combined
The combined wealth of the million dollar millionaires grew to nearly trillion in
Oxfam's report on global inequality said that the COVID- pandemic has increased economic inequality substantially the wealthiest people across the globe were impacted the least by the pandemic and their fortunes recovered quickest with billionaires seeing their wealth increase by trillion while at the same time those living on less than a day likely increased by million
The report also emphasized that the wealthiest are by far the biggest polluters and main drivers of climate change and said that government policy should focus on fighting both inequality and climate change simultaneously
The Oxfam report said that growing economic inequality has been a factor in increased mortality rates during the pandemic contributing to the deaths of people on a daily basis while the wealth of the world's richest billionaires doubled and advocated a tax on the ultra rich to ameliorate these deadly inequalities
According to PolitiFact the top richest Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined According to The New York Times on July the richest percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom percent
Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a substantial head start
A report by the IPS said that three individuals Jeff Bezos Bill Gates and Warren Buffett own as much wealth as the bottom half of the population or million people and that the growing disparity between the wealthy and the poor has created a moral crisis noting that we have not witnessed such extreme levels of concentrated wealth and power since the first gilded age a century ago In the world's billionaires increased their combined global wealth to a record trillion
In they increased their collective wealth to trillion
income inequality reached the highest level ever recorded by the Census Bureau
The existing data and estimates suggest a large increase in international and more generally inter-macroregional components between and
It might have slightly decreased since that time at the expense of increasing inequality within countries
The United Nations Development Programme in asserted that greater investments in social security jobs and laws that protect vulnerable populations are necessary to prevent widening income inequality
There is a significant difference in the measured wealth distribution and the public's understanding of wealth distribution
Michael Norton of the Harvard Business School and Dan Ariely of the Department of Psychology at Duke University found this to be true in their research conducted in
The actual wealth going to the top quintile in was around whereas the average amount of wealth that the general public estimated to go to the top quintile was around
According to a study global earnings inequality has decreased substantially since
During the s and s the share of earnings by the world's poorest half doubled
Two researchers claim that global income inequality is decreasing due to strong economic growth in developing countries
According to a January report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs economic inequality between states had declined but intrastate inequality has increased for of the world population over the period
In the OECD reported in that income inequality is higher than it has ever been within OECD member nations and is at increased levels in many emerging economies
According to a June report by the International Monetary Fund
Widening income inequality is the defining challenge of our time
In advanced economies the gap between the rich and poor is at its highest level in decades
Inequality trends have been more mixed in emerging markets and developing countries EMDCs with some countries experiencing declining inequality but pervasive inequities in access to education health care and finance remainIn October the IMF warned that inequality within nations in spite of global inequality falling in recent decades has risen so sharply that it threatens economic growth and could result in further political polarization
The Fund's Fiscal Monitor report said that progressive taxation and transfers are key components of efficient fiscal redistribution
In October Oxfam published a Reducing Inequality Index which measured social spending tax and workers' rights to show which countries were best at closing the gap between the rich and the poor
The World Inequality Report a four-year research project organized by the economists Lucas Chancel Thomas Piketty Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman shows that the world is marked by a very high level of income inequality and an extreme level of wealth inequality and that these inequalities seem to be about as great today as they were at the peak of western imperialism in the early th century According to the report the bottom half of the population owns of global wealth while the top owns of it
The following table shows information about individual wealth distribution in different countries from a report by Crdit Suisse
The wealth is calculated by various factor for instance liabilities debts exchange rates and their expected development real estate prices human resources natural resources and technical advancements etc
Median and mean wealth per adult in US dollars
Countries and subnational areasInitially in rank order by median wealth
Income inequality is measured by Gini coefficient expressed in percent that is a number between and
Here expresses perfect equality meaning that everyone has the same income whereas represents perfect inequality meaning that one person has all the income and others have none
A Gini index value above is considered high countries including Brazil Colombia South Africa Botswana and Honduras can be found in this category
A Gini index value of or above is considered medium countries including Vietnam Mexico Poland the United States Argentina Russia and Uruguay can be found in this category
A Gini index value lower than is considered low countries including Austria Germany Denmark Norway Slovenia Sweden and Ukraine can be found in this category
In the low income inequality category below is a wide representation of countries previously being part of Soviet Union or its satellites like Slovakia Czech Republic Ukraine and Hungary
In the Gini index for income inequality for whole European Union was only
Income distribution can differ from wealth distribution within each country
The wealth inequality is also measured in Gini index
There the higher Gini index signify greater inequality within the wealth distribution in country means total wealth equality and represents situation where everyone has no wealth except an individual that has everything
For instance countries like Denmark Norway and Netherlands all belonging to the last category below low income inequality also have very high Gini index in wealth distribution ranging from up to
There are various reasons for economic inequality within societies including both global market functions such as trade development and regulation as well as social factors including gender race and education
Recent growth in overall income inequality at least within the OECD countries has been driven mostly by increasing inequality in wages and salaries
Economist Thomas Piketty argues that widening economic disparity is an inevitable phenomenon of free market capitalism when the rate of return of capital r is greater than the rate of growth of the economy g
A major cause of economic inequality within modern market economies is the determination of wages by the market
Where competition is imperfect information unevenly distributed opportunities to acquire education and skills unequal market failure results
Since many such imperfect conditions exist in virtually every market there is in fact little presumption that markets are in general efficient
According to Joseph Stiglitz this means that there is an enormous potential role for government to correct such market failures
In his book The Price of Inequality published in Stiglitz argues that the economical inequality is inevitable and permanent because it is caused by the great amount of political power the richest haveWhile there may be underlying economic forces at play politics have shaped the market and shaped it in ways that advantage the top at the expense of the rest- The Price of InequalityIn the United States real wages are flat over the past years for occupations across income and education levels eg
auto mechanics cashiers doctors and software engineers
However stock ownership favors higher income and education levels thereby resulting in disparate investment income
Thomas Malthus was originally a demographer but later in his life he focused on studying economy mainly inequalities across population
In his work he raised questions related to population growth and economy
In his Essay on Principle of Population published in Thomas Malthus claims that the population grows at geometrical speed but the resources can only grow at arithmetical speed
In his theory also referred to as Malthusianism he explains that whenever there is spare food or resources the population will grow faster to fulfill the gap
The happiness of a country does not depend absolutely upon its poverty or its riches upon its youth or its age upon its being thinly or fully inhabited but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population - An Essay on the Principle of PopulationThe malthusian argument could be described as Despite the population getting bigger the quality of life will not increase
Even with new technologies and more effective ways of providing resources the population will grow to the size at which the quality is the same as before per capita
This would lead to the point at which there would be not enough food for everyone cause great famine or war for resources among the people and potentially die out of the whole population
This event is called Malthusian catastrophe and causes reduction of population back to the sustainable level
In his theory Malthus uses checks - terms describing the limiting factors of the population size at any time
He divided them into groups the preventive checks and the positive checks
A preventive check is a conscious decision to abstain from procreation based on material or spiritual belief for example a lack of resources or sex abstinence
Malthus explained this by his statement that people are perceiving the possible consequences of uncontrolled population growth and so wouldn't knowingly contribute to that
A positive check is on the other hand any event that shortens the human life span for example war diseases or famine
This also includes poor financial or health situation
The Malthusian catastrophe occurs when the rate of early death is too high in the population
Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system
A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases
In a progressive tax system the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society either increasing it or decreasing it provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime
Additionally steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board
Tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the US can also decrease income inequality
The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation
An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education
Education especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers creates high wages for those with this education
However increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality
As a result those who are unable to afford an education or choose not to pursue optional education generally receive much lower wages
The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes and thus lower aggregate saving and investment
Conversely quality education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor
Access to education was in turn influenced by land inequalities
In the less industrialized parts of th century Europe for example landowners still held more political power than industrialists
These landowners did not benefit from educating their workers as much as industrialists did since educated workers have more incentives to migrate to urban industrial areas than their less educated counterparts Consequently lower incentives to promote education in regions where land inequality was high led to lower levels of numeracy in these regions
John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality
In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism where unions have remained strong they concluded The US
economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion including high levels of income inequality high relative and absolute poverty rates poor and unequal educational outcomes poor health outcomes and high rates of crime and incarceration
At the same time the available evidence provides little support for the view that US-style labor market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes
Despite popular prejudices to the contrary the US
economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available
More recently the International Monetary Fund has published studies which found that the decline of unionization in many advanced economies and the establishment of neoliberal economics have fueled rising income inequality
The growth in importance of information technology has been credited with increasing income inequality
Technology has been called the main driver of the recent increases in inequality by Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT
In arguing against this explanation Jonathan Rothwell notes that if technological advancement is measured by high rates of invention there is a negative correlation between it and inequality
Countries with high invention rates — as measured by patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty — exhibit lower inequality than those with less
In one country the United States salaries of engineers and software developers rarely reach above year the lower limit for the top earners
Schor highlight the role of for-profit online sharing economy platforms as an accelerator of income inequality and calls into question their supposed contribution in empowering outsiders of the labour market
Taking the example of TaskRabbit a labour service platform she shows that a large proportion of providers already have a stable full-time job and participate part-time in the platform as an opportunity to increase their income by diversifying their activities outside employment which tends to restrict the volume of work remaining for the minority of platform workers
In addition there is an important phenomenon of labour substitution as manual tasks traditionally performed by workers without a degree or just a college degree integrated into the labour market in the traditional economy sectors are now performed by workers with a high level of education in of TaskRabbit's workforce held a bachelor's degree a master's degree and a PhD
The development of platforms which are increasingly capturing demand for these manual services at the expense of non-platform companies may therefore benefit mainly skilled workers who are offered more earning opportunities that can be used as supplemental or transitional work during periods of unemployment
It has also been proposed that information technologies contribute to winner take most market concentration reducing the need for labor across competing suppliers
Market concentration drives down labor's share of the GDP increasing the wealth of capital and thereby exacerbating inequality
Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale
When rich countries trade with poor countries the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages
Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States
He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable
Anthropologist Jason Hickel contends that globalization and structural adjustment set off the race to the bottom a significant driver of surging global inequality
Another driver Hickel mentions is the debt system which advanced the need for structural adjustment in the first place
In many countries there is a gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market
Several factors other than discrimination contribute to this gap
On average women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work and may be less willing to travel or relocate
Thomas Sowell in his book Knowledge and Decisions claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy
Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men
A study done on three post-soviet countries Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan reveals that gender is one of the driving forces of income inequality and being a female have significant negative effect on income when other factors are held equal
The results show more than gender pay gap in all three countries
These findings are because usually employers tend to avoid hiring women because of possible maternity leave
Other reason for this can be occupational segregation which implies that women are usually accumulated in lower-paid positions and sectors such as social services and education
There is also a globally recognized disparity in the wealth income and economic welfare of people of different races
In many nations data exists to suggest that members of certain racial demographics experience lower wages fewer opportunities for career and educational advancement and intergenerational wealth gaps
Studies have uncovered the emergence of what is called ethnic capital by which people belonging to a race that has experienced discrimination are born into a disadvantaged family from the beginning and therefore have less resources and opportunities at their disposal
The universal lack of education technical and cognitive skills and inheritable wealth within a particular race is often passed down between generations compounding in effect to make escaping these racialized cycles of poverty increasingly difficult
Additionally ethnic groups that experience significant disparities are often also minorities at least in representation though often in number as well in the nations where they experience the harshest disadvantage
As a result they are often segregated either by government policy or social stratification leading to ethnic communities that experience widespread gaps in wealth and aid
As a general rule races which have been historically and systematically colonized typically indigenous ethnicities continue to experience lower levels of financial stability in the present day
The global South is considered to be particularly victimized by this phenomenon though the exact socioeconomic manifestations change across different regions
Even in economically developed societies with high levels of modernization such as may be found in Western Europe North America and Australia minority ethnic groups and immigrant populations in particular experience financial discrimination
While the progression of civil rights movements and justice reform has improved access to education and other economic opportunities in politically advanced nations racial income and wealth disparity still prove significant
In the United States for example a survey of African-American populations show that they are more likely to drop out of high school and college are typically employed for fewer hours at lower wages have lower than average intergenerational wealth and are more likely to use welfare as young adults than their white counterparts
Mexican-Americans while suffering less debilitating socioeconomic factors than black Americans experience deficiencies in the same areas when compared to whites and have not assimilated financially to the level of stability experienced by white Americans as a whole
These experiences are the effects of the measured disparity due to race in countries like the US where studies show that in comparison to whites blacks suffer from drastically lower levels of upward mobility higher levels of downward mobility and poverty that is more easily transmitted to offspring as a result of the disadvantage stemming from the era of slavery and post-slavery racism that has been passed through racial generations to the present
These are lasting financial inequalities that apply in varying magnitudes to most non-white populations in nations such as the US the UK France Spain Australia etc
In the countries of the Caribbean Central America and South America many ethnicities continue to deal with the effects of European colonization and in general nonwhites tend to be noticeably poorer than whites in this region
In many countries with significant populations of indigenous races and those of Afro-descent such as Mexico Colombia Chile etc income levels can be roughly half as high as those experiences by white demographics and this inequity is accompanied by systematically unequal access to education career opportunities and poverty relief
This region of the world apart from urbanizing areas like Brazil and Costa Rica continues to be understudied and often the racial disparity is denied by Latin Americans who consider themselves to be living in post-racial and post-colonial societies far removed from intense social and economic stratification despite the evidence to the contrary
African countries too continue to deal with the effects of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade which set back economic development as a whole for blacks of African citizenship more than any other region
The degree to which colonizers stratified their holdings on the continent on the basis of race has had a direct correlation in the magnitude of disparity experienced by nonwhites in the nations that eventually rose from their colonial status
Former French colonies for example see much higher rates of income inequality between whites and nonwhites as a result of the rigid hierarchy imposed by the French who lived in Africa at the time
Another example is found in South Africa which still reeling from the socioeconomic impacts of Apartheid experiences some of the highest racial income and wealth inequality in all of Africa
In these and other countries like Nigeria Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone movements of civil reform have initially led to improved access to financial advancement opportunities but data shows that for nonwhites this progress is either stalling or erasing itself in the newest generation of blacks that seek education and improved transgenerational wealth
The economic status of one's parents continues to define and predict the financial futures of African and minority ethnic groups
Asian regions and countries such as China the Middle East and Central Asia have been vastly understudied in terms of racial disparity but even here the effects of Western colonization provide similar results to those found in other parts of the globe
Additionally cultural and historical practices such as the caste system in India leave their marks as well
While the disparity is greatly improving in the case of India there still exists social stratification between peoples of lighter and darker skin tones that cumulatively result in income and wealth inequality manifesting in many of the same poverty traps seen elsewhere
Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development
According to Kuznets countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth
As a country develops it acquires more capital which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality
Eventually through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality
Andranik Tangian argues that the growing productivity due to advanced technologies results in increasing wages' purchase power for most commodities which enables employers underpay workers in labor equivalents maintaining nevertheless an impression of fair pay
This illusion is dismantled by the wages' decreasing purchase power for the commodities with a significant share of hand labor
This difference between the appropriate and factual pay goes to enterprise owners and top earners increasing the inequality
Wealth concentration is the process by which under certain conditions newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities
Accordingly those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth and thus they are the beneficiaries of the new wealth
Over time wealth concentration can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society
Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital r than economic growth g and that larger fortunes generate higher returns
According to a study by the RAND Corporation the top of US
income earners have taken trillion from the bottom between and
Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration which may better be explained by the non-market force known as rent-seeking
While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation greater productivity etc it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices profits and large compensation
A better explainer of growing inequality according to Stiglitz is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them
This process known to economists as rent-seeking brings income not from creation of wealth but from grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort
Jamie Galbraith argues that countries with larger financial sectors have greater inequality and the link is not an accident
A study published in PNAS found that global warming plays a role in increasing economic inequality between countries boosting economic growth in developed countries while hampering such growth in developing nations of the Global South
The study says that of gap between the developed world and the developing world can be attributed to global warming
A report by Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute says that the wealthiest of the global population were responsible for more than half of global carbon dioxide emissions from to which increased by
According to a report by the UNEP overconsumption by the rich is a significant driver of the climate crisis and the wealthiest of the world's population are responsible for more than double the greenhouse gas emissions of the poorest combined
Inger Andersen in the foreword to the report said this elite will need to reduce their footprint by a factor of to stay in line with the Paris Agreement targets
Countries with a left-leaning legislature generally have lower levels of inequality
Many factors constrain economic inequality they may be divided into two classes government sponsored and market driven
The relative merits and effectiveness of each approach is a subject of debate
Typical government initiatives to reduce economic inequality include
Public education increasing the supply of skilled labor and reducing income inequality due to education differentials
Progressive taxation the rich are taxed proportionally more than the poor reducing the amount of income inequality in society if the change in taxation does not cause changes in incomeMarket forces outside of government intervention that can reduce economic inequality include
propensity to spend with rising wealth income a person may spend more
In an extreme example if one person owned everything they would immediately need to hire people to maintain their properties thus reducing the wealth concentration
On the other hand high-income persons have higher propensity to save
Robin Maialeh then shows that increasing economic wealth decreases propensity to spend and increases propensity to invest which consequently leads to even greater growth rate of already rich agentsResearch shows that since the only periods with significant declines in wealth inequality in Europe were the Black Death and the two World Wars
Historian Walter Scheidel posits that since the Stone Age only extreme violence catastrophes and upheaval in the form of total war Communist revolution pestilence and state collapse have significantly reduced inequality
He has stated that only all-out thermonuclear war might fundamentally reset the existing distribution of resources and that peaceful policy reform may well prove unequal to the growing challenges ahead
A lot of research has been done about the effects of economic inequality on different aspects in society
Health For long time the higher material living standards lead to longer life as those people were able to get enough food water and access to warmth
Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems obesity mental illness homicides teenage births incarceration child conflict drug use in countries and states with higher inequality
Their research included developed countries including most US
states and found that in the more developed countries such as Finland and Japan the heath issues are much lower than in states with rather higher inequality rates such as Utah and New Hampshire
Some studies link a surge in deaths of despair suicide drug overdoses and alcohol related deaths to widening income inequality
Conversely other research did not find these effects or concluded that research suffered from issues of confounding variables
Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found lower rates of social goods life expectancy by country educational performance trust among strangers women's status social mobility even numbers of patents issued in countries and states with higher inequality
Social cohesion Research has shown an inverse link between income inequality and social cohesion
In more equal societies people are much more likely to trust each other measures of social capital the benefits of goodwill fellowship mutual sympathy and social connectedness among groups who make up a social units suggest greater community involvement
Crime The cross national research shows that in societies with less economic inequality the homicide rates are consistently lower
A study finds that interregional inequality increases terrorism
Other research has argued inequality has little effect on crime rates
Welfare Studies have found evidence that in societies where inequality is lower population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher
Poverty Study made by Jared Bernstein and Elise Gould suggest that the poverty in the United States could have been reduced by the lowering of economic inequality for the past few decades
Debt Income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle
Economic growth A meta-analysis found that the effect of inequality on growth is negative and more pronounced in less developed countries than in rich countries though the average impact on growth was not significant
The study also found that wealth inequality is more pernicious to growth than income inequality
Civic participation Higher income inequality led to less of all forms of social cultural and civic participation among the less wealthy
Political instability Studies indicate that economic inequality leads to greater political instability including an increased risk of democratic breakdown and civil conflict
A significant impact of inequality on civil war probability has been found through anthropometric methods
Political party responses One study finds that economic inequality prompts attempts by left-leaning politicians to pursue redistributive policies while right-leaning politicians seek to repress the redistributive policiesAccording to Christina Starmans et al
Beh the research literature contains no evidence on people having an aversion on inequality
In all studies analyzed the subjects preferred fair distributions inequity aversion to equal distributions in both laboratory and real-world situations
In public researchers may loosely speak of equality instead of fairness when referring to studies where fairness happens to coincide with equality but in many studies fairness is carefully separated from equality and the results are univocal
Very young children seem to prefer fairness over equality
When people were asked what would be the wealth of each quintile in their ideal society they gave a -fold sum to the richest quintile than to the poorest quintile
The preference for inequality increases in adolescence and so do the capabilities to favor fortune effort and ability in the distribution
Preference for unequal distribution has been developed to the human race possibly because it allows for better co-operation and allows a person to work with a more productive person so that both parties benefit from the co-operation
Inequality is also said to be able to solve the problems of free-riders cheaters and ill-behaving people although this is heavily debated
Researches demonstrate that people usually underestimate the level of actual inequality which is also much higher than their desired level of inequality
In many societies such as the USSR the distribution led to protests from wealthier landowners
In the current US many feel that the distribution is unfair in being too unequal
In both cases the cause is unfairness not inequality the researchers conclude
Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment financial assets and corporate stock
By contrast the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary
In order to rectify this situation socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product
Marxian economics attributes rising inequality to job automation and capital deepening within capitalism
The process of job automation conflicts with the capitalist property form and its attendant system of wage labor
In this analysis capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs workers under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits
Over the long term this trend increases the organic composition of capital meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs increasing unemployment the reserve army of labour
This process exerts a downward pressure on wages
The substitution of capital equipment for labor mechanization and automation raises the productivity of each worker resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class
Marxist socialists ultimately predict the emergence of a communist society based on the common ownership of the means of production where each individual citizen would have free access to the articles of consumption From each according to his ability to each according to his need
According to Marxist philosophy equality in the sense of free access is essential for freeing individuals from dependent relationships thereby allowing them to transcend alienation
Meritocracy favors an eventual society where an individual's success is a direct function of his merit or contribution
Economic inequality would be a natural consequence of the wide range in individual skill talent and effort in human population
David Landes stated that the progression of Western economic development that led to the Industrial Revolution was facilitated by men advancing through their own merit rather than because of family or political connections
Most modern social liberals including centrist or left-of-center political groups believe that the capitalist economic system should be fundamentally preserved but the status quo regarding the income gap must be reformed
Social liberals favor a capitalist system with active Keynesian macroeconomic policies and progressive taxation to even out differences in income inequality
Research indicates that people who hold liberal beliefs tend to see greater income inequality as morally wrong
However contemporary classical liberals and libertarians generally do not take a stance on wealth inequality but believe in equality under the law regardless of whether it leads to unequal wealth distribution
In Ludwig von Mises a prominent figure in the Austrian School of economic thought explains
The liberal champions of equality under the law were fully aware of the fact that men are born unequal and that it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization
Equality under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the inexorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disappear
It was on the contrary the device to secure for the whole of mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it
Henceforth no man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station in which he can best serve his fellow citizensRobert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force usually in the form of taxation and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force
However Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves
John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole including the poorest members
Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice
Some see Rawls's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls's theory of justice
Classical liberal Milton Friedman believed that if government action is taken in pursuit of economic equality then political freedom would suffer
A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither
A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of bothEconomist Tyler Cowen has argued that though income inequality has increased within nations globally it has fallen over the years leading up to
He argues that though income inequality may make individual nations worse off overall the world has improved as global inequality has been reduced
Patrick Diamond and Anthony Giddens professors of Economics and Sociology respectively hold that 'pure meritocracy is incoherent because without redistribution one generation's successful individuals would become the next generation's embedded caste hoarding the wealth they had accumulated'
They also state that social justice requires redistribution of high incomes and large concentrations of wealth in a way that spreads it more widely in order to recognise the contribution made by all sections of the community to building the nation's wealth Patrick Diamond and Anthony Giddens June New Statesman
Pope Francis stated in his Evangelii gaudium that as long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality no solution will be found for the world's problems or for that matter to any problems He later declared that inequality is the root of social evil
When income inequality is low aggregate demand will be relatively high because more people who want ordinary consumer goods and services will be able to afford them while the labor force will not be as relatively monopolized by the wealthy
In most western democracies the desire to eliminate or reduce economic inequality is generally associated with the political left
One practical argument in favor of reduction is the idea that economic inequality reduces social cohesion and increases social unrest thereby weakening the society
There is evidence that this is true see inequity aversion and it is intuitive at least for small face-to-face groups of people
Alberto Alesina Rafael Di Tella and Robert MacCulloch find that inequality negatively affects happiness in Europe but not in the United States
It has also been argued that economic inequality invariably translates to political inequality which further aggravates the problem
Even in cases where an increase in economic inequality makes nobody economically poorer an increased inequality of resources is disadvantageous as increased economic inequality can lead to a power shift due to an increased inequality in the ability to participate in democratic processes
The capabilities approach sometimes called the human development approach looks at income inequality and poverty as form of capability deprivation
Unlike neoliberalism which defines well-being as utility maximization economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself
Its goal is to widen people's choices and the level of their achieved well-being through increasing functionings the things a person values doing capabilities the freedom to enjoy functionings and agency the ability to pursue valued goals
When a person's capabilities are lowered they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise
An old ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home
There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives
As a result income inequality increases and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid
A OECD study makes a number of suggestions to its member countries including
Facilitation and encouragement of access to employment
Better job-related training and education for the low-skilled on-the-job training would help to boost their productivity potential and future earnings
Better access to formal educationProgressive taxation reduces absolute income inequality when the higher rates on higher-income individuals are paid and not evaded and transfer payments and social safety nets result in progressive government spending
Wage ratio legislation has also been proposed as a means of reducing income inequality
The OECD asserts that public spending is vital in reducing the ever-expanding wealth gap
Deferred investment programs that increase stock ownership amongst lower income levels can supplement income to compensate wage stagnation
The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty recommend much higher top marginal tax rates on the wealthy up to percent percent or even percent
Ralph Nader Jeffrey Sachs the United Front Against Austerity among others call for a financial transaction tax also known as the Robin Hood tax to bolster the social safety net and the public sector
The Economist wrote in December A minimum wage providing it is not set too high could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobsAmerica's federal minimum wage at of median income is one of the rich world's lowest
Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages others see a small one but none finds any serious damage
General limitations on and taxation of rent-seeking are popular across the political spectrum
Public policy responses addressing causes and effects of income inequality in the US include progressive tax incidence adjustments strengthening social safety net provisions such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children welfare the food stamp program Social Security Medicare and Medicaid organizing community interest groups increasing and reforming higher education subsidies increasing infrastructure spending and placing limits on and taxing rent-seeking
A study in the Journal of Political Economy by Daron Acemoglu James Robinson and Thierry Verdier argues that American cutthroat capitalism and inequality gives rise to technology and innovation that more cuddly forms of capitalism cannot
As a result the diversity of institutions we observe among relatively advanced countries ranging from greater inequality and risk-taking in the United States to the more egalitarian societies supported by a strong safety net in Scandinavia rather than reflecting differences in fundamentals between the citizens of these societies may emerge as a mutually self-reinforcing world equilibrium
If so in this equilibrium 'we cannot all be like the Scandinavians' because Scandinavian capitalism depends in part on the knowledge spillovers created by the more cutthroat American capitalism A working paper by the same authors making similar arguments was challenged by Lane Kenworthy who posited that among other things the Nordic countries are consistently ranked as some of the world's most innovative countries by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index with Sweden ranking as the most innovative nation followed by Finland for the US
There are however global initiative like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal which aims to garner international efforts in reducing economic inequality considerably by
