david gritten of the telegraph observed buttressed by a formidable cast
miller navigates her story between sharp satire dark comedy and wrenching drama
pippa feels like a character from films of an earlier vintage including diary of a mad housewife and the graduate however she is less of a rebel than housewife s protagonist and more non conformist than mrs
robinson
hints and traces of a playful late s mood abound
yet miller s film is a triumph
uniformly well acted it boasts a psychologically knowing script clearly written by a smart assertive human being rather than a software programme
philip french of the observer said the humour is forced the shocking revelations too sudden and not altogether convincing but it s enjoyable in an uninvolving way
peter bradshaw of the guardian rated the film two out of five stars calling it a hugely overegged pudding of a film indulgent complacent and a film that is very pleased with itself
trevor johnston of time out london rated the film three out of five stars and commented no challenge to surmise where all this is heading but there are pleasures to be had while it takes the scenic route
with the story structure working backwards and forwards at the same time the lack of tension is no surprise nor does miller help herself by flitting through a variety of moods from period satire whimsical imagining and character comedy to more sinewy drama
on a scene by scene basis though it s classily effective mainly because of wright penn s skill in nailing the precise tenor of every moment
she s a great actress and a subtle one too
anyone who can wrestle scenes away from a lovably grouchy alan arkin must be on top of their game
hannah forbes black from channel rated the film out of five stars calling it a soft focus chocolate box fairytale she continued the whole thing is vaguely reminiscent of post war domestic dramas aimed at a daytime audience of housewives like a photo negative of brief encounter
miller s self adapted script is no more strained and compromised than the average book to film adaptation but one wishes that she d seized this amazing opportunity to take liberties with her own work
toured rapidly around pippa s life we can see the outline of the traumas and choices that have shaped her personality but the film doesn t seem to know what it wants to say about any of it
darren amner of eye for film rated it three out of five stars and called the script very wry funny and emotionally charged
peter brunette of the hollywood reporter called it the kind of film that most critics desperately want to like and added
unfortunately writer director rebecca miller s script tries so hard to be nervous and edgy that it ultimately succeeds only in making its viewers nervous and edgy
it s as though miller threw a really loud party for all her hollywood friends but forgot to invite the audience
the acting is top notch if consistently over the top and the direction is perky not to say frenzied but the script is just immensely too much of a good thing
virtually every character in the film and virtually everything they say is so self consciously quirky that viewers quickly start wincing when they should be laughing or crying
the film s basic structure is to alternate between pippa s present day life as a suburban mom and her wild youth but the transitions are often awkward and the polar opposite moods of each part tend to work against rather than reinforce each other
the ultimate intent of the film seems to be to make some honest points about seeking one s own happiness rather than living for the sake of others but it also wants to be outrageous and outrageously funny at the same time and the clash of tones is fatal alissa simon of variety noted cardboard characters and severe problems of tone fatally flaw the awkward satirical relationship drama that feels as schizophrenic as its eponymous heroine
while the film marks a change of pace from the intense seriousness of miller s earlier work she never finds the dark comic edge that would make pippa more satisfying viewing
indeed she never sustains any tone at all
the dialogue teeters from flat comedy to wince worthy whimsy with detours through blithe and earnest
visual style too is all over the place
period music does a better job of evoking the era than the laughable costumes hair and makeup
