kiss started as a rough acoustic demo with a verse and a chorus written by prince
he gave his demo to the funk band mazarati who approached him in the first place for an extra song for their debut album and they worked on it with producer david z at sunset sound studio while prince was busy working in the studio next to them studio
z recalls having one of the band members play a piano part inspired by bo diddley s song say man
in the sound on sound article for kiss he recalled programming the song s beat on a linndrum drum machine but the mixonline article he refers to a linn
however it s unlikely either of them were used as the drums sound more like the lm prince s usual drum machine
in the end prince decided to finish the song retaining david z s unique funky rhythm and background vocal arrangements by mazarati s bruce deshazer and marvin gunn david z recounts how the band had expected a song writing credit and were pissed when it did not materialise he removed the bass line and added signature guitar and falsetto vocal
for the distinctive ah wah ah backing vocals david z adapted vocals by brenda lee one of the biggest us chart toppers in the sixties from her hit sweet nothin s a single from her eponymous album
to make up for the absence of bass the kick drum was run through an ams rmx reverb on the non linear setting
the underlying keyboard chop in the background is in fact an acoustic guitar played by david z run through a kepex noise gate triggered by the hi hat track on the multitrack tape this effect however was rather difficult to recreate live on keyboards
the final minimalist song was a hard sell to warner bros but upon prince s insistence the song was released and added to parade
despite warner bros
not wanting to release it as a single kiss became prince s third number one us hit following s highly successful when doves cry and let s go crazy
it was also a big hit across the atlantic reaching number on the uk singles chart
the song won prince another th annual grammy awards for grammy award for best r b performance by a duo or group with vocals and was nominated for grammy award for best r b song
the song became a staple at prince s concerts and was usually sung partially by the audience
the inch single of the song is an extension of the album track
the extended section is based on the funky guitar line and contains much fuller instrumentation than the main track including bass guitar organ and horns
new lyrics are present from prince along with jill jones that end with a humorous dialogue between a wife and her husband watching prince on television
the b side of kiss was or love or money sung in a processed higher pitched vocal which prince would later use for his camille material
the song relates to the theme in under the cherry moon and a bit of the song was heard in the film as was a bit of the extended version of kiss
the extended kiss was included on s ultimate or was recently re released as a digital b side on itunes
revolution bassist brownmark claims to have co written the song with prince he most likely wrote the second verse as the first verse was on the demo prince provided himself and mazarati with to work from
despite being promised a songwriting credit by prince he never got any proper credit and didn t receive any royalties from it
the song is written in the key of a major and has a tempo of beats per minute in common time
the music video was directed by rebecca blake
in the plot of the video prince appears in a half shirt and leather jacket and then all shirtless and performs dance choreography in a hall
the trousers he wears are strip off pants
he is accompanied by the veiled dancer monique mannen wearing black lingerie and sunglasses while revolution member wendy melvoin sits playing guitar
