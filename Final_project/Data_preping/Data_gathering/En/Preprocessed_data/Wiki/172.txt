daniel sorenson is a fictional detective on the popular tv series nypd blue appearing from season six through season eight
the character was played by actor rick schroder
sorenson a us army desert storm veteran approximately years old was introduced in episode six of the sixth season as the th squad s replacement for the deceased bobby simone
he was partnered with detective andy sipowicz
in childhood sorenson immigrated to the united states from norway along with his younger sisters following the death of his father
they were raised by their aunt in albany new york and he felt a lifelong sense of responsibility for their care
at first other officers tended to regard sorenson as somewhat inexperienced and often referenced his youthful appearance but sorenson s hard core professionalism and aggressive tactics soon earned respect
in private however sorenson a us army reservist was shown to be tormented by personal issues stemming from childhood events that centered on family responsibilities
despite this he was regarded by his contemporaries among his fellow officers as a source of good advice and stability and as something of a mentoring type
sorenson was shown in season seven to be attracted to detective diane russell widow of detective bobby simone whom sorenson replaced
the pair became romantically involved for a time
in actor rick schroder voiced dislike of the presentation of the character of sorenson claiming writers had changed him to the point that he schroder had lost both sympathy for him and interest in him and stated a desire to leave the series at the end of season eight
as a result sorenson who was depicted late in season eight as having mentored a homeless drug addict whose addiction ultimately killed him was shown to enter a state of personal turmoil becoming inattentive and apathetically disrespectful while on the job and spending his off duty hours drinking and carousing
exactly to what extent this was in fact part of an act was left unresolved but it was written into the storyline that sorenson had taken on an assignment that involved pretending to fall from grace with the nypd and infiltrating organized crime factions within manhattan
after being reported as missing sorenson s remains were discovered in a shallow grave at the beginning of season nine with the character s death being attributed to the mob syndicate he had been attempting to infiltrate just before the september attacks
