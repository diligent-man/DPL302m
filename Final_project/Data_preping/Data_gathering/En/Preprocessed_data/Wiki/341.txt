the judiciary is the system of courts that interprets defends and applies the law in the name of the state
the judiciary can also be thought of as the mechanism for the resolution of disputes
under the doctrine of the separation of powers the judiciary generally does not make statutory law which is the responsibility of the legislature or enforce law which is the responsibility of the executive but rather interprets defends and applies the law to the facts of each case
however in some countries the judiciary does make common law
in many jurisdictions the judicial branch has the power to change laws through the process of judicial review
courts with judicial review power may annul the laws and rules of the state when it finds them incompatible with a higher norm such as primary legislation the provisions of the constitution treaties or international law
judges constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution thus in common law countries creating the body of constitutional law
this is a more general overview of the development of the judiciary and judicial systems over the course of history
the most important part was ius civile latin for civil law
this consisted of mos maiorum latin for way of the ancestors and leges latin for laws
mos maiorum was the rules of conduct based on social norms created over the years by predecessors
in bc the mos maiorum was written down in the twelve tables
leges were rules set by the leaders first the kings later the popular assembly during the republic
in these early years the legal process consisted of two phases
the first phase in iure was the judicial process
one would go to the head of the judicial system at first the priests as law was part of religion who would look at the applicable rules to the case
parties in the case could be assisted by jurists
then the second phase would start the apud iudicem
the case would be put before the judges which were normal roman citizens in an uneven number
no experience was required as the applicable rules were already selected
they would merely have to judge the case
the most important change in this period was the shift from priest to praetor as the head of the judicial system
the praetor would also make an edict in which he would declare new laws or principles for the year he was elected
this edict is also known as praetorian law
the principate is the first part of the roman empire which started with the reign of augustus
this time period is also known as the classical era of roman law in this era the praetor s edict was now known as edictum perpetuum which were all the edicts collected in one edict by hadrian
also a new judicial process came up cognitio extraordinaria latin for extraordinary process
this came into being due to the largess of the empire
this process only had one phase where the case was presented to a professional judge who was a representative of the emperor
appeal was possible to the immediate superior
during this time period legal experts started to come up
they studied the law and were advisors to the emperor
they also were allowed to give legal advise on behalf of the emperor
this era is also known as the post classical era of roman law
the most important legal event during this era was the codification by justinianus the corpus iuris civilis
this contained all roman law
it was both a collection of the work of the legal experts and commentary on it and a collection of new laws
the corpus iuris civilis consisted of four parts
institutiones this was an introduction and a summary of roman law
digesta pandectae this was the collection of the edicts
codex this contained all the laws of the emperors
novellae this contained all new laws created during the late middle ages education started to grow
first education was limited to the monasteries and abbies but expanded to cathedrals and schools in the city in the th century eventually creating universities
the universities had five faculties arts medicine theology canon law and ius civile or civil law
canon law or ecclesiastical law are laws created by the pope head of the roman catholic church
the last form was also called secular law or roman law
it was mainly based on the corpus iuris civilis which had been rediscovered in
roman law was mainly used for worldly affairs while canon law was used for questions related to the church
the period starting in the th century with the discovery of the corpus iuris civilis is also called the scholastics which can be divided in the early and late scholastics
it is characterised with the renewed interest in the old texts
the rediscovery of the digesta from the corpus iuris civilis led the university of bologna to start teaching roman law
professors at the university were asked to research the roman laws and advise the emperor and the pope with regards to the old laws
this led to the glossators to start translating and recreating the corpus iuris civilis and create literature around it
glossae translations of the old roman laws
summae summaries
brocardica short sentences that made the old laws easier to remember a sort of mnemonic
quaestio disputata sic et non a dialectic method of seeking the argument and refute it accursius wrote the glossa ordinaria in ending the early scholastics
the successors of the glossators were the post glossators or commentators
they looked at a subject in a logical and systematic way by writing comments with the texts treatises and consilia which are advises given according to the old roman law
canon law knows a few forms of laws the canones decisions made by councils and the decreta decisions made by the popes
the monk gratian one of the well known decretists started to organise all of the church law which is now known as the decretum gratiani or simply as decretum
it forms the first part of the collection of six legal texts which together became known as the corpus juris canonici
it was used by canonists of the roman catholic church until pentecost may when a revised code of canon law codex iuris canonici promulgated by pope benedict xv on may obtained legal force
the decretalists like the post glossators for ius civile started to write treatises comments and advises with the texts
around the th century a process of reception and acculturation started with both laws
the final product was known as ius commune
it was a combination of canon law which represented the common norms and principles and roman law which were the actual rules and terms
it meant the creation of more legal texts and books and a more systematic way of going through the legal process
in the new legal process appeal was possible
the process would be partially inquisitorial where the judge would actively investigate all the evidence before him but also partially adversarial where both parties are responsible for finding the evidence to convince the judge
after the french revolution lawmakers stopped interpretation of law by judges and the legislature was the only body permitted to interpret the law this prohibition was later overturned by the napoleonic code
in common law jurisdictions courts interpret law this includes constitutions statutes and regulations
they also make law but in a limited sense limited to the facts of particular cases based upon prior case law in areas where the legislature has not made law
for instance the tort of negligence is not derived from statute law in most common law jurisdictions
the term common law refers to this kind of law
common law decisions set precedent for all courts to follow
this is sometimes called stare decisis
