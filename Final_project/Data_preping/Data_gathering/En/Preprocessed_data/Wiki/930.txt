Criticism of the series focuses mainly on three topics
the series was originally set in Dublin and only transferred to Cardiff when commissioned by SC
the large amount of English spoken not just as some characters are non Welsh speakers but also English words in Welsh dialogue
explicit sex scenes of both a heterosexual and homosexual natureA row started after the broadcast of episode three in series III as it emerged that a sex scene was actually filmed on location in a toilet room of the Senedd the Welsh National Assembly building and not in a television studio Officials of the National Assembly for Wales Commission who approved the filming for the Neuadd area the corridors of the building and for one scene in the baby changing room were not made aware of the nature of the scene The scene itself filmed on March involves Lea Kennedy played by Alys Thomas who is working for an unnamed party group and her much older boyfriend Stephen James Dewi Rhys Williams having sexual intercourse As a result SC announced that it was investigating the matter and had contacted producers One AM William Graham Conservative called for scripts to be vetted more closely in the future
SC's investigation came to this conclusion SC has looked into the circumstances surrounding the filming of drama series Caerdydd at the Senedd and is satisfied that the production company followed the correct procedures We are confident that Senedd personnel who dealt with this issue were not misled
The National Assembly's investigation came to this conclusion The National Assembly has carried out a full internal review of the circumstances of the filming of Caerdydd We can confirm that at no stage of the negotiations about the use of the building for filming or during the filming itself was the content of the scene disclosed by the programme makers Despite this setback the Assembly is committed to being open and accessible to all including programme makers and we sincerely hope that this does not prevent us from working with responsible companies in future
