first commissioned by s c s drama editor angharad jones in as part of a drive by s c to reach a younger audience the third series of caerdydd started its run on s c on march
a fourth series was commissioned and went into production in spring
it started broadcasting on june

the second series was also nominated at the celtic media festival for best drama series
the third series has been nominated for best drama series at the bafta cymru awards roger wiliams as best screenwriter and ryland teifi as best actor
criticism of the series focuses mainly on three topics
the series was originally set in dublin and only transferred to cardiff when commissioned by s c
the large amount of english spoken not just as some characters are non welsh speakers but also english words in welsh dialogue
explicit sex scenes of both a heterosexual and homosexual nature a row started after the broadcast of episode three in series iii as it emerged that a sex scene was actually filmed on location in a toilet room of the senedd the welsh national assembly building and not in a television studio
officials of the national assembly for wales commission who approved the filming for the neuadd area the corridors of the building and for one scene in the baby changing room were not made aware of the nature of the scene
the scene itself filmed on march involves lea kennedy played by alys thomas who is working for an unnamed party group and her much older boyfriend stephen james dewi rhys williams having sexual intercourse
as a result s c announced that it was investigating the matter and had contacted producers
one am william graham conservative called for scripts to be vetted more closely in the future
s c s investigation came to this conclusion s c has looked into the circumstances surrounding the filming of drama series caerdydd at the senedd and is satisfied that the production company followed the correct procedures
we are confident that senedd personnel who dealt with this issue were not misled
the national assembly s investigation came to this conclusion the national assembly has carried out a full internal review of the circumstances of the filming of caerdydd
we can confirm that at no stage of the negotiations about the use of the building for filming or during the filming itself was the content of the scene disclosed by the programme makers
despite this setback the assembly is committed to being open and accessible to all including programme makers and we sincerely hope that this does not prevent us from working with responsible companies in future
