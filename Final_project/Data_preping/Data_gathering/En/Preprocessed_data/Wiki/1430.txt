Mayfield Mall was a shopping mall in Mountain View, California, United States
Operational from 1966 to 1984, it was the first air-conditioned, enclosed shopping mall in Northern California, though it has been an office complex since the 1980s
In 2013, Google rented the entire 500,000 square feet (46,000 m) property and ultimately purchased it in 2016 for $225 million; it is now known as the company's Building RLS1.
Mayfield Mall opened in 1966 and was the first enclosed mall of its type in the region, taking its name from the original town of Mayfield, which was annexed by Palo Alto in 1925
Its original anchor was JCPenney, which closed stores on Castro Street and University Avenue to consolidate into the mall location
At the time, the JCPenney outlet was the chain's largest suburban location
There were 24 original tenants, notably including Joseph Magnin and Woolworth
The mall declared itself the first enclosed and carpeted center in the United States.
The mall did decent business but closed in the face of newer, larger centers such as Vallco Fashion Park
JCPenney announced it would close its branch there in May 1983, sounding an immediate death knell for a small center with no room to grow; after the mall's ownership found no way to lure another anchor tenant, it closed in January 1984
The JCPenney store moved to the San Antonio Shopping Center, where it would last until the mid-1990s
Several outlets, as well as a Greyhound bus terminal, continued to operate.
After the mall's closure, Hewlett-Packard became the mall's only tenant and renovated the structure to serve as offices, adding an atrium and high ceilings
Under HP, the building housed the company's American response center and some 1,600 workers
However, in the early 2000s, HP opted to consolidate into other office spaces, leaving the mall vacant
By 2003, the old mall was on the market after a deal to sell to Stanford Hospital failed over zoning issues
The property was bought by Rockwood Capital and Four Corners Properties for $90 million in 2012, after William Lyons Homes, which had hoped to develop a 260-unit housing complex on the site and demolish the mall, went into bankruptcy
Rockwood and Four Corners instead sought to remodel the site and maintain the office use, renaming the complex San Antonio Station.
In September 2013, Google rented the entire mall in the largest lease deal of the year in Silicon Valley
Google is not the only large tech company to buy and renovate a former mall for office use; the headquarters of Rackspace are located at the former Windsor Park Mall near San Antonio, Texas
Three years into the lease deal, Google purchased the entire property outright.
