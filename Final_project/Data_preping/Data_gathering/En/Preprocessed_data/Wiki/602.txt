teresa of vila born teresa s nchez de cepeda y ahumada march or october also called saint teresa of jesus was a spanish noblewoman who was called to convent life in the catholic church
a carmelite nun prominent spanish mystic religious reformer author theologian of the contemplative life and of mental prayer she earned the rare distinction of being declared a doctor of the church
active during the catholic reformation she reformed the carmelite orders of both women and men
the movement she initiated was later joined by the younger spanish carmelite friar and mystic john of the cross
it led eventually to the establishment of the discalced carmelites
a formal papal decree adopting the split from the old order was issued in
teresa who had been a social celebrity in her home province was dogged by early family losses and ill health
in her mature years she became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal borne out of an inner conviction and honed by ascetic practice
she was also at the center of deep ecclesiastical controversy as she took on the pervasive laxity in her order against the background of the protestant reformation sweeping over europe and the spanish inquisition asserting church discipline in her home country
the consequences were to last well beyond her life
one papal legate described her as a restless wanderer disobedient and stubborn femina who under the title of devotion invented bad doctrines moving outside the cloister against the rules of the council of trent and her prelates teaching as a master against paul s orders that women should not teach
her written contributions which include her autobiography the life of teresa of jesus and her seminal work the interior castle are today an integral part of spanish renaissance literature
together with the way of perfection her works form part of the literary canon of christian mysticism and christian meditation practice and continue to attract interest from people both within and outside the catholic church
other associations with teresa beyond her writings continue to exert a wide influence
a santero image of the immaculate conception of el viejo said to have been sent by her with a brother emigrating to peru was canonically crowned by pope john paul ii on december at the shrine of el viejo in nicaragua
another catholic tradition holds that teresa is personally associated with devotion to the infant jesus of prague a statue she may have owned
since her death her reputation has grown leading to multiple portrayals
she continues to be widely noted as an inspiration to philosophers theologians historians neurologists fiction writers psychologists and artists as well as to countless ordinary people interested in christian spirituality and mysticism
forty years after her death in teresa was canonized by pope gregory xv
at the time she was considered a candidate for national patron saint of spain but this designation was awarded to james the great
she has since become one of the patron saints of spain
on september pope paul vi proclaimed teresa the first female doctor of the church in recognition of her centuries long spiritual legacy to catholicism
teresa s nchez de cepeda y ahumada was born in in vila spain
her paternal grandfather juan s nchez de toledo was a marrano or converso a jew forced to convert to christianity or emigrate
when teresa s father was a child juan was condemned by the spanish inquisition for allegedly returning to the jewish faith but he was later able to assume a catholic identity
her father alonso s nchez de cepeda was a successful wool merchant and one of the wealthiest men in vila
he bought a knighthood and assimilated successfully into christian society
previously married to catalina del peso y henao with whom he had three children in s nchez de cepeda married teresa s mother beatriz de ahumada y cuevas in gotarrendura
teresa s mother brought her up as a dedicated christian
fascinated by accounts of the lives of the saints she ran away from home at age seven with her brother rodrigo to seek martyrdom in the fight against the moors
her uncle brought them home when he spotted them just outside the town walls
when teresa was eleven years old her mother died leaving her grief stricken
this prompted her to embrace a deeper devotion to the virgin mary as her spiritual mother
teresa was also enamored of popular fiction which at the time consisted primarily of medieval tales of knighthood and works about fashion gardens and flowers
teresa was sent to the augustinian nuns school at vila
after completing her education she initially resisted the idea of a religious vocation but after a stay with her uncle and other relatives she relented
in aged much to the disappointment of her pious and austere father she decided to enter the local easy going carmelite convent of the incarnation significantly built on top of land that had been used previously as a burial ground for jews
she took up religious reading on contemplative prayer especially osuna s third spiritual alphabet
her zeal for mortification caused her to become ill again and she spent almost a year in bed causing huge worry to her community and family
she nearly died but she recovered attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of saint joseph
she began to experience bouts of religious ecstasy
her reading of the medieval mystics consisted of guides to examination of conscience and spiritual exercises and inner contemplation known in mystical terms as oratio recollectionis or oratio mentalis
she also dipped into other mystical ascetical works such as the tractatus de oratione et meditatione of peter of alcantara
she reported that during her illness she had progressed from the lowest stage of recollection to the devotions of silence and even to the devotions of ecstasy which was one of perceived perfect union with god see mysticism
during this final stage she said she frequently experienced the rich blessing of tears
as the catholic distinction between mortal and venial sin became clear to her she came to understand the awful horror of sin and the inherent nature of original sin
she also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin and the need for absolute surrender to god
around the same time she received a copy of the full spanish translation of augustine of hippo s autobiographical work confessions which helped her resolve and to tend to her own bouts of religious scruples
the text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and she found solace in the idea that such a great saint was once an inveterate sinner
in her autobiography she wrote that she was very fond of st
augustine
for he was a sinner too
around friends suggested that her newfound knowledge could be of diabolical and not of divine origin
she had begun to inflict mortifications of the flesh upon herself
but her confessor the jesuit francis borgia reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts
on st
peter s day in teresa became firmly convinced that jesus christ had presented himself to her in bodily form though invisible
these visions lasted almost uninterruptedly for more than two years
in another vision a seraph drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart causing her an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain
the account of this vision was the inspiration for one of bernini s most famous works the ecstasy of saint teresa at santa maria della vittoria in rome
although based in part on teresa s description of her mystical transverberation in her autobiography bernini s depiction of the event is considered by some to be highly eroticized especially when compared to the entire preceding artistic teresian tradition
the memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of jesus epitomized in the adage often associated with her lord either let me suffer or let me die
teresa who became a celebrity in her town dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille was also known for her raptures which sometimes involved levitation
it was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred
subsequently historians neurologists and psychiatrists like peter fenwick and javier lvarez rodr guez among others have taken an interest in her symptomatology
the fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the th century has been preserved
examination of this record has led to the speculative conclusion that she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy
over time teresa found herself increasingly at odds with the spiritual malaise prevailing in her convent of the incarnation
among the nuns living there the observance of cloister designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose
the daily invasion of visitors many of high social and political rank disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation
such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved teresa that she longed to intervene
the incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the franciscan priest peter of alcantara who met her early in and became her spiritual adviser
she resolved to found a reformed carmelite convent correcting the laxity which she had found at the incarnation convent and elsewhere besides
guimara de ulloa a woman of wealth and a friend supplied the funds for the project
the abject poverty of the new convent established in and named st
joseph s san jos at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of vila and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression
however powerful patrons including the local bishop coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose turned animosity into approval
in march after teresa had moved to the new convent house she received papal sanction for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property which she proceeded to formulate into a constitution
her plan was the revival of the earlier stricter monastic rules supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial flagellation prescribed for the divine office every week and the discalceation of the religious
for the first five years teresa remained in seclusion mostly engaged in prayer and writing
in teresa received a patent from the carmelite general rubeo de ravenna to establish further houses of the new order
this process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of spain
she left a record of the arduous project in her libro de las fundaciones
between and reformed convents were established at medina del campo malag n valladolid toledo pastrana salamanca and alba de tormes
as part of the original patent teresa was given permission to set up two houses for men who wished to adopt the reforms
she convinced two carmelite friars john of the cross and anthony of jesus to help with this
they founded the first monastery of discalced carmelite brothers in november at duruelo
another friend of teresa jer nimo graci n the carmelite visitator of the older observance of andalusia and apostolic commissioner and later provincial of the teresian order gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at segovia beas de segura seville and caravaca de la cruz murcia
meanwhile john of the cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher
in unreformed members of the carmelite order began to persecute teresa her supporters and her reforms
following a number of resolutions adopted at the general chapter at piacenza the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents
the general chapter instructed her to go into voluntary retirement at one of her institutions
she obeyed and chose st
joseph s at toledo
meanwhile her friends and associates were subjected to further attacks
several years later her appeals by letter to king philip ii of spain secured relief
as a result in the cases before the inquisition against her graci n and others were dropped
this allowed the reform to resume
an edict from pope gregory xiii allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the carmelite religious and a royal decree created a protective board of four assessors for the reform
during the last three years of her life teresa founded convents at villanueva de la jara in northern andalusia palencia soria burgos and granada
in total seventeen convents all but one founded by her and as many men s monasteries were owed to her reforms over twenty years
her final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from burgos to alba de tormes
she died in just as catholic europe was making the switch from the julian to the gregorian calendar which required the excision of the dates of october from the calendar
she died either before midnight of october or early in the morning of october which is celebrated as her feast day
according to the liturgical calendar then in use she died on the th in any case
her last words were my lord it is time to move on
well then may your will be done
o my lord and my spouse the hour that i have longed for has come
it is time to meet one another she was buried at the convento de la anunciaci n in alba de tormes
nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be intact but the clothing had rotted
before the body was re interred one of her hands was cut off wrapped in a scarf and sent to vila
graci n cut the little finger off the hand and according to his own account kept it with him until it was taken by the occupying ottoman turks from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and reales
the body was exhumed again on november to be moved to vila and found to be incorrupt
an arm was removed and left in alba de tormes at the nuns request to compensate for losing the main relic of teresa but the rest of the body was reburied in the discalced carmelite chapter house in vila
the removal was done without the approval of the duke of alba de tormes and he brought the body back in with pope sixtus v ordering that it remain in alba de tormes on pain of excommunication
a grander tomb on the original site was raised in and the body was moved to a new chapel in
the body still remains there except for the following parts
rome right foot and part of the upper jaw
lisbon hand
ronda spain left eye and left hand the latter was kept by francisco franco until his death after francoist troops captured it from republican troops during the spanish civil war
museum of the church of the annunciation alba de tormes left arm and heart
church of our lady of loreto paris france one finger
sanl car de barrameda one fingerin forty years after her death she was canonized by pope gregory xv
the cortes exalted her to patroness of spain in
the university of salamanca had granted her the title doctor ecclesiae latin for doctor of the church with a diploma in her lifetime but that title is distinct from the papal honour of doctor of the church which is always conferred posthumously
the latter was finally bestowed upon her by pope paul vi on september along with catherine of siena making them the first women to be awarded the distinction
teresa is revered as the doctor of prayer
the mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries such as francis of sales f nelon and the port royalists
in her coffin was plated in silver
teresa of avila is remembered in the church of england with a lesser festival on october
the ultimate preoccupation of teresa s mystical thought as consistently reflected in her writings is the ascent of the soul to god in four stages see the autobiography chs
the first devotion of the heart consists of mental prayer and contemplation
it means the withdrawal of the soul from without penitence and especially the devout meditation on the passion of christ autobiography
the second devotion of peace is where human will is surrendered to god
this occurs by virtue of an uplifted awareness granted by god while other faculties such as memory reason and imagination are not yet safe from worldly distraction
although a partial distraction can happen due to outer activity such as repetition of prayers or writing down spiritual things the prevailing state is one of quietude autobiography
the third devotion of union concerns the absorption in god
it is not only a heightened but essentially an ecstatic state
at this level reason is also surrendered to god and only the memory and imagination are left to ramble
this state is characterized by a blissful peace a sweet slumber of at least the higher soul faculties that is a consciousness of being enraptured by the love of god
the fourth devotion of ecstasy is where the consciousness of being in the body disappears
sensory faculties cease to operate
memory and imagination also become absorbed in god as though intoxicated
body and spirit dwell in the throes of exquisite pain alternating between a fearful fiery glow in complete unconscious helplessness and periods of apparent strangulation
sometimes such ecstatic transports literally cause the body to be lifted into space
this state may last as long as half an hour and tends to be followed by relaxation of a few hours of swoon like weakness attended by the absence of all faculties while in union with god
the subject awakens from this trance state in tears
it may be regarded as the culmination of mystical experience
indeed teresa was said to have been observed levitating during mass on more than one occasion teresa is regarded as one of the foremost writers on mental prayer and her position among writers on mystical theology as unique
her writings on this theme stem from her personal experiences thereby manifesting considerable insight and analytical gifts
her definitions have been used in the catechism of the catholic church
teresa states contemplative prayer oraci n mental in my opinion is nothing other than a close sharing between friends
it means frequently taking time to be alone with him whom we know loves us throughout her writings teresa returns to the image of watering one s garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer
teresa s writings are regarded as among the most remarkable in the mystical literature of the catholic church
they include
christia mercer columbia university philosophy professor claims that the seventeenth century frenchman ren descartes lifted some of his most influential ideas from teresa of vila who fifty years before descartes wrote popular books about the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth
she describes a number of striking similarities between descartes seminal work meditations on first philosophy and teresa s interior castle
teresa who reported visions of jesus and mary was a strong believer in the efficacy of holy water claiming to have used it with success to repel evil spirits and temptations
she wrote i know from frequent experience that there is nothing which puts devils to flight better than holy water
the prayer nada te turbe let nothing disturb you is attributed to teresa having been found within her breviary
a modern prayer christ has no body but yours though widely attributed to teresa is not found in her writings
the spanish nuns who established carmel in france brought a devotion to the infant jesus with them and it became widespread in france
though there are no written historical accounts establishing that teresa of vila ever owned the famous infant jesus of prague statue according to tradition such a statue is said to have been in her possession and teresa is reputed to have given it to a noblewoman travelling to prague
the age of the statue dates to approximately the same time as teresa
it has been thought that teresa carried a portable statue of the child jesus wherever she went the idea circulated by the early s in at the request of philip iv of spain the castilian parliament elected teresa without lacking one vote as copatron saint of castile
this status was affirmed by pope urban viii in a brief issued on july in which he stated
more broadly the s the entirety of spain castile and beyond debated who should be the country s patron saint the choices were either the current patron james matamoros or a pairing of him and the newly canonised saint teresa of vila
teresa s promoters said spain faced newer challenges especially the threat of protestantism and societal decline at home thus needing a more contemporary patron who understood those issues and could guide the spanish nation
santiago s supporters santiaguistas fought back and eventually won the argument but teresa of vila remained far more popular at the local level
james the great kept the title of patron saint for the spanish people and the most blessed virgin mary under the title immaculate conception as the sole patroness for the entire spanish kingdom
portrayals of teresa include the following
