Teresa of Ávila (born Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada; 28 March 1515 – 4 or 15 October 1582),  also called Saint Teresa of Jesus, was a Spanish noblewoman who was called to convent life in the Catholic Church
A Carmelite nun, prominent Spanish mystic, religious reformer, author, theologian of the contemplative life and of mental prayer, she earned the rare distinction of being declared a Doctor of the Church
Active during the Catholic Reformation, she reformed the Carmelite Orders of both women and men
The movement she initiated was later joined by the younger Spanish Carmelite friar and mystic John of the Cross
It led eventually to the establishment of the Discalced Carmelites
A formal papal decree adopting the split from the old order was issued in 1580.
Teresa, who had been a social celebrity in her home province, was dogged by early family losses and ill health
In her mature years, she became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal borne out of an inner conviction and honed by ascetic practice
She was also at the center of deep ecclesiastical controversy as she took on the pervasive laxity in her order against the background of the Protestant reformation sweeping over Europe and the Spanish Inquisition asserting church discipline in her home country
The consequences were to last well beyond her life
One papal legate described her as a "restless wanderer, disobedient, and stubborn femina who, under the title of devotion, invented bad doctrines, moving outside the cloister against the rules of the Council of Trent and her prelates; teaching as a master against Paul's orders that women should not teach."
Her written contributions, which include her autobiography, The Life of Teresa of Jesus and her seminal work The Interior Castle, are today an integral part of Spanish Renaissance literature
Together with The Way of Perfection, her works form part of the literary canon of Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practice, and continue to attract interest from people both within and outside the Catholic Church.
Other associations with Teresa beyond her writings continue to exert a wide influence
A Santero image of the Immaculate Conception of El Viejo, said to have been sent by her with a brother emigrating to Peru, was canonically crowned by Pope John Paul II on 28 December 1989 at the Shrine of El Viejo in Nicaragua
Another Catholic tradition holds that Teresa is personally associated with devotion to the Infant Jesus of Prague, a statue she may have owned
Since her death, her reputation has grown, leading to multiple portrayals
She continues to be widely noted as an inspiration to philosophers, theologians, historians, neurologists, fiction writers, psychologists and artists, as well as to countless ordinary people interested in Christian spirituality and mysticism.
Forty years after her death, in 1622, Teresa was canonized by Pope Gregory XV
At the time she was considered a candidate for national patron saint of Spain, but this designation was awarded to James the Great
She has since become one of the patron saints of Spain
 On 27 September 1970 Pope Paul VI proclaimed Teresa the first female Doctor of the Church in recognition of her centuries-long spiritual legacy to Catholicism.
Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada was born in 1515 in Ávila, Spain
Her paternal grandfather, Juan Sánchez de Toledo, was a marrano or Converso, a Jew forced to convert to Christianity or emigrate
When Teresa's father was a child, Juan was condemned by the Spanish Inquisition for allegedly returning to the Jewish faith, but he was later able to assume a Catholic identity
Her father, Alonso Sánchez de Cepeda, was a successful wool merchant and one of the wealthiest men in Ávila
He bought a knighthood and assimilated successfully into Christian society.
Previously married to Catalina del Peso y Henao, with whom he had three children, in 1509, Sánchez de Cepeda married Teresa's mother, Beatriz de Ahumada y Cuevas, in Gotarrendura.
Teresa's mother brought her up as a dedicated Christian
Fascinated by accounts of the lives of the saints, she ran away from home at age seven, with her brother Rodrigo, to seek martyrdom in the fight against the Moors
Her uncle brought them home, when he spotted them just outside the town walls.
When Teresa was eleven years old, her mother died, leaving her grief-stricken
This prompted her to embrace a deeper devotion to the Virgin Mary as her spiritual mother
Teresa was also enamored of popular fiction, which at the time consisted primarily of medieval tales of knighthood and works about fashion, gardens and flowers
Teresa was sent to the Augustinian nuns' school at Ávila.
After completing her education, she initially resisted the idea of a religious vocation, but after a stay with her uncle and other relatives, she relented
In 1536, aged 20, much to the disappointment of her pious and austere father, she decided to enter the local easy-going Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation, significantly built on top of land that had been used previously as a burial ground for Jews
She took up religious reading on contemplative prayer, especially Osuna's Third Spiritual Alphabet (1527)
Her zeal for mortification caused her to become ill again and she spent almost a year in bed, causing huge worry to her community and family
She nearly died but she recovered, attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of Saint Joseph
She began to experience bouts of religious ecstasy.
Her reading of the medieval mystics, consisted of guides to examination of conscience and spiritual exercises and inner contemplation known in mystical terms as oratio recollectionis or oratio mentalis
She also dipped into other mystical ascetical works such as the Tractatus de oratione et meditatione of Peter of Alcantara.
She reported that, during her illness, she had progressed from the lowest stage of "recollection", to the "devotions of silence" and even to the "devotions of ecstasy", which was one of perceived "perfect union with God" (see § Mysticism)
During this final stage, she said she frequently experienced the rich "blessing of tears"
As the Catholic distinction between mortal and venial sin became clear to her, she came to understand the awful horror of sin and the inherent nature of original sin
She also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin and the need for absolute surrender to God.
Around the same time, she received a copy of the full Spanish translation of Augustine of Hippo's autobiographical work Confessions, which helped her resolve and to tend to her own bouts of religious scruples
The text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and she found solace in the idea that such a great saint was once an inveterate sinner
In her autobiography, she wrote that she 'was very fond of St
Augustine ..
for he was a sinner too.'
Around 1556, friends suggested that her newfound knowledge could be of diabolical and not of divine origin
She had begun to inflict mortifications of the flesh upon herself
But her confessor, the Jesuit Francis Borgia, reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts
On St
Peter's Day in 1559, Teresa became firmly convinced that Jesus Christ had presented Himself to her in bodily form, though invisible
These visions lasted almost uninterruptedly for more than two years
In another vision, a seraph drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart, causing her an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain:
The account of this vision was the inspiration for one of Bernini's most famous works, the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa at Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome
Although based in part on Teresa's description of her mystical transverberation in her autobiography, Bernini's depiction of the event is considered by some to be highly eroticized, especially when compared to the entire preceding artistic Teresian tradition.
The memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life, and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of Jesus, epitomized in the adage often associated with her: "Lord, either let me suffer or let me die."
Teresa, who became a celebrity in her town dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille, was also known for her raptures, which sometimes involved levitation
It was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred
Subsequently, historians, neurologists and psychiatrists like Peter Fenwick and Javier Álvarez-Rodríguez, among others, have taken an interest in her symptomatology
The fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the 16th century has been preserved
Examination of this record has led to the speculative conclusion that she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.
Over time, Teresa found herself increasingly at odds with the spiritual malaise prevailing in her convent of the Incarnation
Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of cloister, designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer, became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose
The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation
Such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved Teresa that she longed to intervene.
The incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the Franciscan priest, Peter of Alcantara, who met her early in 1560 and became her spiritual adviser
She resolved to found a "reformed" Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found at the Incarnation convent and elsewhere besides
Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds for the project.
The abject poverty of the new convent, established in 1562 and named St
Joseph's (San José), at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of Ávila, and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression
However, powerful patrons, including the local bishop, coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose, turned animosity into approval.
In March 1563, after Teresa had moved to the new convent house, she received papal sanction for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property, which she proceeded to formulate into a "constitution"
Her plan was the revival of the earlier, stricter monastic rules, supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial flagellation prescribed for the Divine Office every week, and the discalceation of the religious
For the first five years, Teresa remained in seclusion, mostly engaged in prayer and writing.
In 1567, Teresa received a patent from the Carmelite General, Rubeo de Ravenna, to establish further houses of the new order
This process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of Spain
She left a record of the arduous project in her Libro de las Fundaciones
Between 1567 and 1571, reformed convents were established at Medina del Campo, Malagón, Valladolid, Toledo, Pastrana, Salamanca, and Alba de Tormes.
As part of the original patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for men who wished to adopt the reforms
She convinced two Carmelite friars, John of the Cross and Anthony of Jesus to help with this
They founded the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite brothers in November 1568 at Duruelo
Another friend of Teresa, Jerónimo Gracián, the Carmelite visitator of the older observance of Andalusia and apostolic commissioner, and later provincial of the Teresian order, gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at Segovia (1571), Beas de Segura (1574), Seville (1575), and Caravaca de la Cruz (Murcia, 1576)
Meanwhile, John of the Cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher.
In 1576, unreformed members of the Carmelite order began to persecute Teresa, her supporters and her reforms
Following a number of resolutions adopted at the general chapter at Piacenza, the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents
The general chapter instructed her to go into "voluntary" retirement at one of her institutions
She obeyed and chose St
Joseph's at Toledo
Meanwhile, her friends and associates were subjected to further attacks.
Several years later, her appeals by letter to King Philip II of Spain secured relief
As a result, in 1579, the cases before the inquisition against her, Gracián and others, were dropped
This allowed the reform to resume
An edict from Pope Gregory XIII allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the Carmelite religious, and a royal decree created a "protective" board of four assessors for the reform.
During the last three years of her life, Teresa founded convents at Villanueva de la Jara in northern Andalusia (1580), Palencia (1580), Soria (1581), Burgos, and Granada (1582)
In total, seventeen convents, all but one founded by her, and as many men's monasteries, were owed to her reforms over twenty years.
Her final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from Burgos to Alba de Tormes
She died in 1582, just as Catholic Europe was making the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, which required the excision of the dates of 5–14 October from the calendar
She died either before midnight of 4 October or early in the morning of 15 October, which is celebrated as her feast day
According to the liturgical calendar then in use, she died on the 15th in any case
Her last words were: "My Lord, it is time to move on
Well then, may your will be done
O my Lord and my Spouse, the hour that I have longed for has come
It is time to meet one another."She was buried at the Convento de la Anunciación in Alba de Tormes
Nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be intact but the clothing had rotted
Before the body was re-interred one of her hands was cut off, wrapped in a scarf and sent to Ávila
Gracián cut the little finger off the hand and – according to his own account – kept it with him until it was taken by the occupying Ottoman Turks, from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and 20 reales
The body was exhumed again on 25 November 1585 to be moved to Ávila and found to be incorrupt
An arm was removed and left in Alba de Tormes at the nuns' request, to compensate for losing the main relic of Teresa, but the rest of the body was reburied in the Discalced Carmelite chapter house in Ávila
The removal was done without the approval of the Duke of Alba de Tormes and he brought the body back in 1586, with Pope Sixtus V ordering that it remain in Alba de Tormes on pain of excommunication
A grander tomb on the original site was raised in 1598 and the body was moved to a new chapel in 1616.
The body still remains there, except for the following parts:
Rome – right foot and part of the upper jaw
Lisbon – hand
Ronda, Spain – left eye and left hand (the latter was kept by Francisco Franco until his death after Francoist troops captured it from Republican troops during the Spanish Civil War)
Museum of the Church of the Annunciation, Alba de Tormes – left arm and heart
Church of Our Lady of Loreto, Paris, France – one finger
Sanlúcar de Barrameda – one fingerIn 1622, forty years after her death, she was canonized by Pope Gregory XV
The Cortes exalted her to patroness of Spain in 1627
The University of Salamanca had granted her the title Doctor ecclesiae (Latin for "Doctor of the Church") with a diploma in her lifetime, but that title is distinct from the papal honour of Doctor of the Church, which is always conferred posthumously
The latter was finally bestowed upon her by Pope Paul VI on 27 September 1970, along with Catherine of Siena, making them the first women to be awarded the distinction
Teresa is revered as the Doctor of Prayer
The mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries, such as Francis of Sales, Fénelon, and the Port-Royalists
In 1670, her coffin was plated in silver.
Teresa of Avila is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 15 October.
The ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought, as consistently reflected in her writings, is the ascent of the soul to God in four stages (see: The Autobiography Chs
10–22):
The first, Devotion of the Heart, consists of mental prayer and contemplation
It means the withdrawal of the soul from without, penitence and especially the devout meditation on the passion of Christ (Autobiography 11.20).
The second, Devotion of Peace, is where human will is surrendered to God
This occurs by virtue of an uplifted awareness granted by God, while other faculties, such as memory, reason, and imagination, are not yet safe from worldly distraction
Although a partial distraction can happen, due to outer activity such as repetition of prayers or writing down spiritual things, the prevailing state is one of quietude (Autobiography 14.1).
The third, Devotion of Union, concerns the absorption-in-God
It is not only a heightened, but essentially, an ecstatic state
At this level, reason is also surrendered to God, and only the memory and imagination are left to ramble
This state is characterized by a blissful peace, a sweet slumber of at least the higher soul faculties, that is a consciousness of being enraptured by the love of God.
The fourth, Devotion of Ecstasy, is where the consciousness of being in the body disappears
Sensory faculties cease to operate
Memory and imagination also become absorbed in God, as though intoxicated
Body and spirit dwell in the throes of exquisite pain, alternating between a fearful fiery glow, in complete unconscious helplessness, and periods of apparent strangulation
Sometimes such ecstatic transports literally cause the body to be lifted into space
This state may last as long as half an hour and tends to be followed by relaxation of a few hours of swoon-like weakness, attended by the absence of all faculties while in union with God
The subject awakens from this trance state in tears
It may be regarded as the culmination of mystical experience
Indeed, Teresa was said to have been observed levitating during Mass on more than one occasion.Teresa is regarded as one of the foremost writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology as unique
Her writings on this theme stem from her personal experiences, thereby manifesting considerable insight and analytical gifts
Her definitions have been used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church
Teresa states: "Contemplative prayer (oración mental), in my opinion is nothing other than a close sharing between friends
It means frequently taking time to be alone with Him whom we know loves us." Throughout her writings, Teresa returns to the image of watering one's garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer.
Teresa's writings are regarded as among the most remarkable in the mystical literature of the Catholic Church
They include:
Christia Mercer, Columbia University philosophy professor, claims that the seventeenth-century Frenchman René Descartes lifted some of his most influential ideas from Teresa of Ávila, who, fifty years before Descartes, wrote popular books about the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth
She describes a number of striking similarities between Descartes' seminal work Meditations on First Philosophy and Teresa's Interior Castle.
Teresa, who reported visions of Jesus and Mary, was a strong believer in the efficacy of holy water, claiming to have used it with success to repel evil spirits and temptations
She wrote: "I know from frequent experience that there is nothing which puts devils to flight better than holy water."
The prayer Nada te turbe (Let nothing disturb you) is attributed to Teresa, having been found within her breviary:
A modern prayer Christ has no body but yours, though widely attributed to Teresa, is not found in her writings.
The Spanish nuns who established Carmel in France brought a devotion to the Infant Jesus with them, and it became widespread in France.
Though there are no written historical accounts establishing that Teresa of Ávila ever owned the famous Infant Jesus of Prague statue, according to tradition, such a statue is said to have been in her possession and Teresa is reputed to have given it to a noblewoman travelling to Prague
The age of the statue dates to approximately the same time as Teresa
It has been thought that Teresa carried a portable statue of the Child Jesus wherever she went; the idea circulated by the early 1700s.In 1626, at the request of Philip IV of Spain, the Castilian parliament elected Teresa "without lacking one vote" as copatron saint of Castile
This status was affirmed by Pope Urban VIII in a brief issued on 21 July 1627 in which he stated:
More broadly, the 1620s, the entirety of Spain (Castile and beyond) debated who should be the country's patron saint; the choices were either the current patron, James Matamoros, or a pairing of him and the newly canonised Saint Teresa of Ávila
Teresa's promoters said Spain faced newer challenges, especially the threat of Protestantism and societal decline at home, thus needing a more contemporary patron who understood those issues and could guide the Spanish nation
Santiago's supporters (Santiaguistas) fought back and eventually won the argument, but Teresa of Ávila remained far more popular at the local level
James the Great kept the title of patron saint for the Spanish people, and the most Blessed Virgin Mary under the title Immaculate Conception as the sole patroness for the entire Spanish Kingdom.
Portrayals of Teresa include the following:
Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed two motets for the feast of Saint Teresa: Flores, flores o Gallia for two voices, two flutes and continuo (H.374), c
1680 and the other, for three voices and continuo (H.342), in 1686–87.

The contemporary poet Jorie Graham features Saint Teresa in the poem Breakdancing in her volume The End of Beauty.
Barbara Mujica's novel Sister Teresa, while not strictly hagiographical, is based upon Teresa's life.
