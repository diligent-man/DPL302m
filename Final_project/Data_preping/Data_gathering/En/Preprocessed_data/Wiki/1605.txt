the shashe river or shashi river is a major left bank tributary of the limpopo river in zimbabwe
it rises northwest of francistown botswana and flows into the limpopo river where botswana zimbabwe and south africa meet
the confluence is at the site of the greater mapungubwe transfrontier conservation area
the shashe river is a highly ephemeral river with flow generally restricted to a few days of the year
the river contributes of the mean annual runoff of the limpopo basin
major tributaries of the shashe river include the simukwe shashani thuli tati and ramokgwebana rivers
the lower shashe is a sand filled channel with extensive alluvial aquifers in the river channel and below the alluvial plains
these supply water for a number of irrigation schemes including sibasa and shashi
more than two million years ago the upper zambezi river used to flow south through what is now the makgadikgadi pan presently a vast seasonal wetland to the shashe river and thence the limpopo river
there is a road bridge and a rail bridge south of francistown
the lower shashe river forms the border between botswana and zimbabwe and is unbridged
however at tuli both sides of the river are in zimbabwe and there are two legal crossing points
the shashi runs through the shashi irrigation scheme and the tuli block
the shashe river is dammed near francistown at shashe dam
the original purpose was to supply water to the industrial city of selebi phikwe
in it was found that groundwater from the local wells in francistown had high levels of nitrate and was also inadequate to meet public demand
so the public water supply for that city was changed over to using water from the shashe dam
the dam also supplies water to surrounding villages phoenix mine tati nickel mining company norilsk nickel and mupane gold mine iamgold
further downstream the dikgatlhong dam impounds the shashe near the village of robelela completed in december
when full it will hold cubic metres cu ft
the next largest dam in botswana the gaborone dam has capacity of cubic metres cu ft
a pipeline from the dikgatlhong dam will connect to the north south carrier nsc pipeline at the bpt break pressure tank at moralane
the nsc will take the water south to gaborone
