the iron age is the final epoch of the three age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity
it was preceded by the stone age paleolithic mesolithic neolithic and chalcolithic bronze age
the concept has been mostly applied to europe and the ancient near east but also by analogy to other parts of the old world
the duration of the iron age varies depending on the region under consideration
it is defined by archaeological convention
the iron age begins locally when the production of iron or steel has advanced to the point where iron tools and weapons replace their bronze equivalents in common use
in the ancient near east this transition took place in the wake of the so called bronze age collapse in the th century bc
the technology soon spread throughout the mediterranean basin region and to south asia
its further spread to central asia eastern europe and central europe is somewhat delayed and northern europe was not reached until around the start of the th century bc
the iron age is taken to end also by convention with the beginning of the historiographical record
this usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record for the ancient near east the establishment of the achaemenid empire c
bc is traditionally and still usually taken as a cut off date later dates being considered historical by virtue of the record by herodotus despite considerable written records from far earlier well back into the bronze age now being known
in central and western europe the roman conquests of the st century bc serve as marking for the end of the iron age
the germanic iron age of scandinavia is taken to end c
ad with the beginning of the viking age
in the indian sub continent the iron age is taken to begin with the ironworking painted gray ware culture
recent estimates suggest that it ranges from the th century bc through to the reign of ashoka in the rd century bc
the use of the term iron age in the archaeology of south east and southeast asia is more recent and less common than for western eurasia
in china written history started before iron working arrived so the term is infrequently used
the sahel sudan region and sub saharan africa are outside of the three age system there being no bronze age but the term iron age is sometimes used in reference to early cultures practicing ironworking such as the nok culture of nigeria
the three age system was introduced in the first half of the th century for the archaeology of europe in particular and by the later th century expanded to the archaeology of the ancient near east
its name harks back to the mythological ages of man of hesiod
as an archaeological era it was first introduced for scandinavia by christian j rgensen thomsen in the s
by the s it was embraced as a useful division of the earliest history of mankind in general and began to be applied in assyriology
the development of the now conventional periodization in the archaeology of the ancient near east was developed in the s to s
as its name suggests iron age technology is characterized by the production of tools and weaponry by ferrous metallurgy ironworking more specifically from carbon steel
increasingly the iron age in europe is being seen as a part of the bronze age collapse in the ancient near east in ancient india with the post rigvedic vedic civilization ancient iran and ancient greece with the greek dark ages
in other regions of europe the iron age began in the th century bc in central europe and the th century bc in northern europe
the near eastern iron age is divided into two subsections iron i and iron ii
iron i bc illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous late bronze age
there is no definitive cultural break between the th and th centuries bc throughout the entire region although certain new features in the hill country transjordan and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the aramaean and sea people groups
there is evidence however of strong continuity with bronze age culture although as one moves later into iron age the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late nd millennium
the iron age as an archaeological period is roughly defined as that part of the prehistory of a culture or region during which ferrous metallurgy was the dominant technology of metalworking
the characteristic of an iron age culture is the mass production of tools and weapons made from steel typically alloys with a carbon content between approximately and by weight
only with the capability of the production of carbon steel does ferrous metallurgy result in tools or weapons that are equal or superior to bronze
the use of steel has been based as much on economics as on metallurgical advancements
early steel was made by smelting iron
by convention the iron age in the ancient near east is taken to last from c
bc the bronze age collapse to c
bc or bc roughly the beginning of historiography with herodotus the end of the proto historical period
in central and western europe the iron age is taken to last from c
bc to c
bc in northern europe from c
bc to ad
in china there is no recognizable prehistoric period characterized by ironworking as bronze age china transitions almost directly into the qin dynasty of imperial china iron age in the context of china is sometimes used for the transitional period of c
bc to bc during which ferrous metallurgy was present even if not dominant
the earliest known iron artifacts are nine small beads dated to bc which were found in burials at gerzeh lower egypt
they have been identified as meteoric iron shaped by careful hammering
meteoric iron a characteristic iron nickel alloy was used by various ancient peoples thousands of years before the iron age
such iron being in its native metallic state required no smelting of ores
smelted iron appears sporadically in the archeological record from the middle bronze age
whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant the high temperatures required to smelting iron ore c f placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium bc
tin s low melting point of c f and copper s relatively moderate melting point of c f placed them within the capabilities of the neolithic pottery kilns which date back to bc and were able to produce temperatures greater than c f
in addition to specially designed furnaces ancient iron production needed to develop complex procedures for the removal of impurities the regulation of the admixture of carbon and for hot working to achieve a useful balance of hardness and strength in steel
the earliest tentative evidence for iron making is a small number of iron fragments with the appropriate amounts of carbon admixture found in the proto hittite layers at kaman kaleh y k and dated to bc
akanuma concludes that the combination of carbon dating archaeological context and archaeometallurgical examination indicates that it is likely that the use of ironware made of steel had already begun in the third millennium bc in central anatolia
souckova siegolov shows that iron implements were made in central anatolia in very limited quantities around bc and were in general use by elites though not by commoners during the new hittite empire bc
similarly recent archaeological remains of iron working in the ganges valley in india have been tentatively dated to bc
tewari concludes that knowledge of iron smelting and manufacturing of iron artifacts was well known in the eastern vindhyas and iron had been in use in the central ganga plain at least from the early second millennium bc
by the middle bronze age increasing numbers of smelted iron objects distinguishable from meteoric iron by the lack of nickel in the product appeared in the middle east southeast asia and south asia
african sites are turning up dates as early as bc
modern archaeological evidence identifies the start of large scale iron production in around bc marking the end of the bronze age
between bc and bc diffusion in the understanding of iron metallurgy and the use of iron objects was fast and far flung
anthony snodgrass suggests that a shortage of tin as a part of the bronze age collapse and trade disruptions in the mediterranean around bc forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze
as evidence many bronze implements were recycled into weapons during that time
more widespread use of iron led to improved steel making technology at a lower cost
thus even when tin became available again iron was cheaper stronger and lighter and forged iron implements superseded cast bronze tools permanently
the iron age in the ancient near east is believed to have begun with the discovery of iron smelting and smithing techniques in anatolia or the caucasus and balkans in the late nd millennium bc c
the earliest bloomery smelting of iron is found at tell hammeh jordan around bc c dating
the early iron age in the caucasus area is conventionally divided into two periods early iron i dated to around bc and the early iron ii phase from the tenth to ninth centuries bc
many of the material culture traditions of the late bronze age continued into the early iron age
thus there s a sociocultural continuity during this transitional period
in iran the earliest actual iron artifacts were unknown until the th century bc
for iran the best studied archaeological site during this time period is teppe hasanlu
in the mesopotamian states of sumer akkad and assyria the initial use of iron reaches far back to perhaps bc
one of the earliest smelted iron artifacts known was a dagger with an iron blade found in a hattic tomb in anatolia dating from bc
the widespread use of iron weapons which replaced bronze weapons rapidly disseminated throughout the near east north africa southwest asia by the beginning of the st millennium bc
the development of iron smelting was once attributed to the hittites of anatolia during the late bronze age
as part of the late bronze age early iron age the bronze age collapse saw the slow comparatively continuous spread of iron working technology in the region
it was long held that the success of the hittite empire during the late bronze age had been based on the advantages entailed by the monopoly on ironworking at the time
accordingly the invading sea peoples would have been responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region
the view of such a hittite monopoly has come under scrutiny and no longer represents a scholarly consensus
while there are some iron objects from bronze age anatolia the number is comparable to iron objects found in egypt and other places of the same time period and only a small number of these objects are weapons

prehistoric or proto historic iron age historic iron agethe iron age in egyptian archaeology essentially corresponds to the third intermediate period of egypt
iron metal is singularly scarce in collections of egyptian antiquities
bronze remained the primary material there until the conquest by neo assyrian empire in bc
the explanation of this would seem to be that the relics are in most cases the paraphernalia of tombs the funeral vessels and vases and iron being considered an impure metal by the ancient egyptians it was never used in their manufacture of these or for any religious purposes
it was attributed to seth the spirit of evil who according to egyptian tradition governed the central deserts of africa
in the black pyramid of abusir dating before bc gaston maspero found some pieces of iron
in the funeral text of pepi i the metal is mentioned
a sword bearing the name of pharaoh merneptah as well as a battle axe with an iron blade and gold decorated bronze shaft were both found in the excavation of ugarit
a dagger with an iron blade found in tutankhamun s tomb th century bc was recently examined and found to be of meteoric origin
in europe the iron age is the last stage of prehistoric europe and the first of the protohistoric periods which initially means descriptions of a particular area by greek and roman writers
for much of europe the period came to an abrupt local end after conquest by the romans though ironworking remained the dominant technology until recent times
elsewhere it may last until the early centuries ad and either christianization or a new conquest in the migration period
iron working was introduced to europe in the late th century bc probably from the caucasus and slowly spread northwards and westwards over the succeeding years
the iron age did not start when iron first appeared in europe but it began to replace bronze in the preparation of tools and weapons
it did not happen at the same time all around europe local cultural developments played a role in the transition to the iron age
for example the iron age of prehistoric ireland begins around bc when the greek iron age had already ended and finishes around ad
the widespread use of the technology of iron was implemented in europe simultaneously with asia
the prehistoric iron age in central europe divided into two periods based on historical events hallstatt culture early iron age and la t ne late iron age cultures
material cultures of hallstatt and la t ne consist of phases a b c d phases
the iron age in europe is characterized by an elaboration of designs in weapons implements and utensils
these are no longer cast but hammered into shape and decoration is elaborate and curvilinear rather than simple rectilinear the forms and character of the ornamentation of the northern european weapons resemble in some respects roman arms while in other respects they are peculiar and evidently representative of northern art
citania de briterios located in guimar es portugal is one of the examples of archaeological sites of the iron age
this settlement fortified villages covered an area of hectares acres and served as a celtiberian stronghold against roman invasions

prehistoric or proto historic iron age historic iron agein china chinese bronze inscriptions are found around bc preceding the development of iron metallurgy which was known by the th century bc
therefore in china prehistory had given way to history periodized by ruling dynasties by the start of iron use so iron age is not typically used as to describe a period in chinese history
iron metallurgy reached the yangtse valley toward the end of the th century bc
the few objects were found at changsha and nanjing
the mortuary evidence suggests that the initial use of iron in lingnan belongs to the mid to late warring states period from about bc
important non precious husi style metal finds include iron tools found at the tomb at guwei cun of the th century bc
the techniques used in lingnan are a combination of bivalve moulds of distinct southern tradition and the incorporation of piece mould technology from the zhongyuan
the products of the combination of these two periods are bells vessels weapons and ornaments and the sophisticated cast
an iron age culture of the tibetan plateau has tentatively been associated with the zhang zhung culture described in early tibetan writings
iron objects were introduced to the korean peninsula through trade with chiefdoms and state level societies in the yellow sea area in the th century bc just at the end of the warring states period but before the western han dynasty began
yoon proposes that iron was first introduced to chiefdoms located along north korean river valleys that flow into the yellow sea such as the cheongcheon and taedong rivers
iron production quickly followed in the nd century bc and iron implements came to be used by farmers by the st century in southern korea
the earliest known cast iron axes in southern korea are found in the geum river basin
the time that iron production begins is the same time that complex chiefdoms of proto historic korea emerged
the complex chiefdoms were the precursors of early states such as silla baekje goguryeo and gaya iron ingots were an important mortuary item and indicated the wealth or prestige of the deceased in this period
in japan iron items such as tools weapons and decorative objects are postulated to have entered japan during the late yayoi period c
bc ad or the succeeding kofun period c
ad most likely through contacts with the korean peninsula and china
distinguishing characteristics of the yayoi period include the appearance of new pottery styles and the start of intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields
yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern ky sh to northern honsh
the kofun and the subsequent asuka periods are sometimes referred to collectively as the yamato period the word kofun is japanese for the type of burial mounds dating from that era

artefacts including small knives and blades have been discovered in the indian state of telangana which have been dated between bc and bc the history of metallurgy in the indian subcontinent began prior to the rd millennium bc
archaeological sites in india such as malhar dadupur raja nala ka tila lahuradewa kosambi and jhusi allahabad in present day uttar pradesh show iron implements in the period bc
as the evidence from the sites raja nala ka tila malhar suggest the use of iron in c bc
the extensive use of iron smelting is from malhar and its surrounding area
this site is assumed as the center for smelted bloomer iron to this area due to its location in the karamnasa river and ganga river
this site shows agricultural technology as iron implements sickles nails clamps spearheads etc by at least c bc
archaeological excavations in hyderabad show an iron age burial site
the beginning of the st millennium bc saw extensive developments in iron metallurgy in india
technological advancement and mastery of iron metallurgy were achieved during this period of peaceful settlements
one ironworking centre in east india has been dated to the first millennium bc
in southern india present day mysore iron appeared as early as th to th centuries bc these developments were too early for any significant close contact with the northwest of the country
the indian upanishads mention metallurgy
and the indian mauryan period saw advances in metallurgy
as early as bc certainly by ad high quality steel was produced in southern india by what would later be called the crucible technique
in this system high purity wrought iron charcoal and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon
the protohistoric early iron age in sri lanka lasted from bc to bc
radiocarbon evidence has been collected from anuradhapura and aligala shelter in sigiriya
the anuradhapura settlement is recorded to extend ha acres by bc and grew to ha acres by bc to become a town
the skeletal remains of an early iron age chief were excavated in anaikoddai jaffna
the name ko veta is engraved in brahmi script on a seal buried with the skeleton and is assigned by the excavators to the rd century bc
ko meaning king in tamil is comparable to such names as ko atan and ko putivira occurring in contemporary brahmi inscriptions in south india
it is also speculated that early iron age sites may exist in kandarodai matota pilapitiya and tissamaharama

in philippines and vietnam the sa huynh culture showed evidence of an extensive trade network
sa huynh beads were made from glass carnelian agate olivine zircon gold and garnet most of these materials were not local to the region and were most likely imported
han dynasty style bronze mirrors were also found in sa huynh sites
conversely sa huynh produced ear ornaments have been found in archaeological sites in central thailand as well as the orchid island
in sub saharan africa where there was no continent wide universal bronze age the use of iron immediately succeeded the use of stone
metallurgy was characterized by the absence of a bronze age and the transition from stone to iron in tool substances
early evidence for iron technology in sub saharan africa can be found at sites such as km and km in northwest tanzania and parts of nigeria and the central african republic
nubia was one of the relatively few places in africa to have a sustained bronze age along with egypt and much of the rest of north africa
very early copper and bronze working sites in niger may date to as early as bc
there is also evidence of iron metallurgy in termit niger from around this period
nubia was a major manufacturer and exporter of iron after the expulsion of the nubian dynasty from egypt by the assyrians in the th century bc
though there is some uncertainty some archaeologists believe that iron metallurgy was developed independently in sub saharan west africa separately from eurasia and neighboring parts of north and northeast africa
archaeological sites containing iron smelting furnaces and slag have also been excavated at sites in the nsukka region of southeast nigeria in what is now igboland dating to bc at the site of lejja eze uzomaka and to bc and at the site of opi holl
the site of gbabiri in the central african republic has yielded evidence of iron metallurgy from a reduction furnace and blacksmith workshop with earliest dates of bc and bc respectively
similarly smelting in bloomery type furnaces appear in the nok culture of central nigeria by about bc and possibly a few centuries earlier
iron and copper working in sub saharan africa spread south and east from central africa in conjunction with the bantu expansion from the cameroon region to the african great lakes in the rd century bc reaching the cape around ad
however iron working may have been practiced in central africa as early as the rd millennium bc
instances of carbon steel based on complex preheating principles were found to be in production around the st century ad in northwest tanzania
