the long christmas dinner inspired a famous scene in orson welles s film citizen kane the breakfast table montage in which the nine year deterioration of kane s marriage is told through a conversation seen in five vignettes
several breakfast scenes were to be filmed but during shooting welles had the idea of simply photographing it as a continuous scene without dissolves with the camera whipping back and forth
the idea was stolen from the long christmas dinner of thornton wilder welles told filmmaker peter bogdanovich
i did the breakfast scene thinking i d invented it
it wasn t in the script originally
and when i was almost finished with it i suddenly realized that i d unconsciously stolen it from thornton and i called him up and admitted to it when bogdanovich asked how wilder reacted welles replied he was pleased welles and wilder were good friends
