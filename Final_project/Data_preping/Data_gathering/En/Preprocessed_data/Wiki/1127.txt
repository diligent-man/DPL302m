The Long Christmas Dinner inspired a famous scene in Orson Welles's film Citizen Kane â€” the breakfast-table montage in which the nine-year deterioration of Kane's marriage is told through a conversation seen in five vignettes
Several breakfast scenes were to be filmed but during shooting Welles had the idea of simply photographing it as a continuous scene without dissolves with the camera whipping back and forth
The idea was stolen from The Long Christmas Dinner of Thornton Wilder Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich
I did the breakfast scene thinking I'd invented it
And when I was almost finished with it I suddenly realized that I'd unconsciously stolen it from Thornton and I called him up and admitted to it When Bogdanovich asked how Wilder reacted Welles replied He was pleased Welles and Wilder were good friends
