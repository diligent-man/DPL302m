tito vuolo as postal clerkthe film was originally titled paradise lost and was to star dana andrews who had appeared in sword in the desert also produced by robert buckner andrews became unavailable and victor mature and john garfield were discussed as possible alternatives
eventually the lead role was assigned to jeff chandler after he had impressed universal studios with his performance in sword of the desert and broken arrow
i don t know why i got it chandler said of the role joking that maybe it s because i m saving them money
chandler required a three week leave of absence from the our miss brooks radio program in order to make the film
his second daughter was born during the making of the film
much of the film was shot in italy on location in naples siena and tuscany over five weeks in late
of the actors only chandler and m rta tor n were brought in from the u s with the rest coming from italy or france
filming began early in
writer producer robert buckner praised filming on location in italy
he said that universal had set aside in frozen currency to make the film but he ended up using only
he also said that if chandler had not been required to return to the u s
to fulfil a radio commitment requiring three weeks of filming in a hollywood studio another could have been saved
the film is said to be based on the famous italian gangster lucky luciano
however chandler denied this saying that the character that he played was that of a small time gangster and what happens after he lands is quite different from what happened to luciano
i understand luciano was really disappointed when our producer robert buckner mentioned this to him
