Blackhorse Lane tram stop is a light rail stop in the London Borough of Croydon in the southern suburbs of London
The tram stop is located on a section of line which follows the trackbed of the former Woodside and South Croydon Railway and is adjacent to the point at which that railway's branch to Addiscombe station diverged from the line between Elmers End station and Sanderstead station
Prior to the opening of Tramlink there was no station at this site which had previously contained long-disused allotments
