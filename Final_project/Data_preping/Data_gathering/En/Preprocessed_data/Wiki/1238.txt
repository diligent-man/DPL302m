strictest sense racket consists handled frame open hoop across network string stretched tightly
racket may solid perforated hitting surface instead network strings
racket design material manufacturing ha changed considerably centuries
frame racket sport wa traditionally made solid wood later laminated wood string animal intestine known catgut
traditional racket size wa limited strength weight wooden frame strong enough hold string stiff enough hit ball shuttle
manufacturer started adding non-wood laminate wood racket improve stiffness
non-wood racket made first steel aluminum carbon fiber composites
racket made composite material including carbon fiber fiberglass metal titanium alloy ceramics
catgut ha partially replaced synthetic material including nylon polyamide polymers
despite name catgut ha never made part cat

squash equipment ha evolved intervening century racket equipment ha changed little
according current racquetball rule limitation weight racquetball racket
racquetball racket unlike many type generally little neck grip connecting directly head
also tend head shape notably wider top older racket looking almost triangular teardrop shaped
real tennis also called court tennis inch mm long racket made wood tight string cope game's heavy balls
racket head bent slightly make striking ball close floor corner easier
traditionally made laminated timber typically ash small strung area using natural gut strings

popular lawn tennis racket vary primarily length weight balance point stiffness beam thickness string pattern string density head size
made wood original racket frame row material steel fiberglass aluminium considered obsolete although material technically legal play
inexpensive racket often poor performance characteristic excessive flexibility inadequate weight
recent manufacturer use single-throated beam although prince tried reintroduce single throat design professional used one wa mirjana lui
braided graphite racket considered high-end recently molded racket norm time
length inch cm normally junior racket range inch cm stronger physically-mature players
gamma big bubba wa produced inch cm length longer legal length
gamma responded changing length grip portion racket continue sales
length restriction wa based concern long racket would make serve dominant concern ha never objectively supported testing
moreover player john isner much taller longer arm average professional especially low stature one giving much larger advantage term height service possible several inch racket length
finally professional nearly always choose use longest racket typically choose use two-handed groundstrokes forehand backhand using extra length improve reach
type player dominant sport even close average term per caput representation length restriction seems even unnecessary
despite prince's attempt market longer length longbody racket standard length remains overwhelming choice player negating argument favor length restriction
player choose use longer racket inch cm choose one typically use inch cm model rather one approaching inch cm
weight racket also vary ounce g unstrung ounce g strung
medium weight heavier racket produced since wa discontinued companies
pete sampras added lead tape make racket ounce g weight venus williams known using frame modified quite heavy term recent time average
contrast andy roddick surprised many said used stock pro drive series model series racket wa light compared racket used top professionals
recreational professional tennis trend ha away heavy racket toward lighter racket despite drawback light racket increased twisting
lawn tennis racket originally flared outward bottom handle prevent slippage
rounded bottom wa called bark bottom inventor matthew barker
mass give racket plow momentum continues player ha managed get racket motion resistant stoppage ball's momentum
give perception racket produce shot power although complicated typically slower stroke production
higher mass typically involves slower swing energy execute swing
mass also provides cushioning ball impact shock source injury tennis elbow
however high racket mass cause fatigue shoulder area
drawback heavier racket lower maneuverability reducing reaction time require energy move
racket get heavier player find increasingly difficult fast reaction shot quick volley return serve
however additional mass help return serve particular making racket much resistant twist high-powered service
light racket additional drawback making easier beginning player use inappropriate wrist-dominant stroke often lead injury
poor stroke mechanic much easier produce lightweight racket using one's wrist mostly swing racket
extremely typical mistake beginning player make choke heavily racket try compensate twist light racket well high racket angle upon impact use wrist much
professional well-known player success strongly choked-up grip zina garrison
head size play key role racket's performance characteristics
larger head size generally mean power larger sweet spot
area string bed partially forgiving off-center hit produce ball-reflective power string deformation known trampoline effect
however large head size increase twisting make off-center hit difficult control reduce player's overall power production due playing compensating extra inherent power typically stiffer string reduce increased string deformation large heads
smaller head size generally offer control many shot particularly service groundstrokes aimed near line lead shank wild miss hitting frame missing sweet spot
drawback common professional player using single-handed topspin backhand well recreational aged player net
shanking due small racket head size typically exacerbated racket weight slows reaction time well lesser degree racket's balance point
professional tennis currently-used racket head size vary square inch cm player adopting one square inch cm
racket smaller larger head size square inch cm still produced used professional currently
small number professional monica seles used square inch cm racket point careers
racket smaller head square inch cm production since racket larger head size square inch cm currently legal sport even though elderly player typically choose use racket beyond square inch cm nearly unheard-of serious player elderly choose racket square inch cm
weed company founded tad weed specializes producing large racket primarily elderly market
racket moderately higher power production moderately lower weight moderately larger size typically posse slightly head-heavy balance often called tweener racket racket smallest head current use highest weight current use headlight even balance referred players' rackets
oversize racket typically square inch cm size pejoratively referred granny stick resistance seen illegitimate racket younger player decreased dramatically successful use racket small number professional andre agassi pam shriver
originally even midsize frame square inch cm considered jumbo top player martina navratilova rod laver said banned making sport easy
later professional including john mcenroe signed letter supporting switch back wood frame limitation original standard size approximately square inch cm
perhaps last professional use standard-size racket professional tennis wa aaron krickstein known strongly-contested match connors u open
used wilson ultra-ii standard-size graphite racket also used hard-hitting teen andrea jaeger
first oversize fiberglass bentley fortissimo germany wa praised racket designer wa considered large taken seriously small number player exposed it
head-light balance point rarer professional tennis wa sport ha converted larger-headed racket stiffer racket stiffer string western grip accompanying stroke production topspin
head-light balance point optimal serve volley style continental grip
serve volley longer viable option nearly professional mode playing point match
head-heavy racket became popular mainly recreational player primarily introduction wilson profile widebody racket
head-light balance make volley serf easier produce groundstrokes le stable
head-heavy balance make groundstrokes stable typically increase player's comfort swinging harder add power make serf volley cumbersome
vibration dampener also sometimes known gummies may interlaced proximal part string array reduce percussive sound ball hitting string andor reduce perceived vibration
professional andre agassi used rubber band instead specialized dampeners
first us two central main string hold place
second sometimes called worm woven many main strings
dampener nearly always placed near bottom racket string bed
racket become lighter stiffer larger-headed professional game ha moved basically completely softer flexible string material stiff materials
large part tone additional power potential modern rackets
however also related tendency different string material move place subjected heavy topspin strokes
polyester string choice today resistance despite increased stiffness harsher feel aggravating joint reduced tension-holding ability versus string like natural gut excels that
top professional earlier despite access stiffer material nylon nearly always chose use flexible natural gut instead
string bed stiffness increased using stiffer material kevlar polyester increasing density string pattern stringing higher tension
racket maker player experimented dense string pattern open pattern beginning snauwaert hi ten pattern main crosses
recently grigor dimitrov known played open-patterned racket part career
string choice thickness material string tension string pattern string pattern density large effect racket performs
throughout lawn tennis' history racket made laminated wood head around square inch cm
late wilson popularized t- steel racket wire wound around frame make string loop purchased design ren lacoste produced racket first limited run
wa popularized top american player jimmy connors wa also prior connors using billie jean king early career
many player said lacked control power compared wood frame period
connors used rarer firm model additional throat weld increase stiffness
aluminum though lighter flexible steel wa sometimes le accurate wood
biggest complaint however wa metal racket caused strong case tennis elbow especially kind hole string directly frame rather using external wire wrapper t-
drawback particular top player still preferred use wooden frames
aluminum construction improvement allowed introduction first american oversized racket wa manufactured weed
prince popularized oversize racket head size approximately square inch cm
howard head wa able obtain broad patent prince despite prior art bentley fortissimo first oversize made germany fiberglass weed
popularity prince aluminum oversize side effect popularizing racket non-standard head size mid-size square inch cm mid-plus size square inch cm
fairly quickly midsize frame began become most-used frame pro tours
martina navratilova popularized midsize graphite racket win using yonex r- first midsize graphite racket made yonex
nearly time however said jumbo racket midsize included removed sport making easier
fewer player chose use oversize racket switched midplus frame earliest career control
fiberglass frame also brief period limited popularity making fewer inroad among top player aluminum
also earliest composite head competition series used arthur ashe made without graphite
flexible typical early graphite composite stiffer wood fiberglass aluminum
early graphite carbon fibre composite introduced material added composite including ceramic glass fibre boron titanium
stiff racket typically preferred player familiarity comfortable softness wood
early model tended flexible powerful although power upgrade wood metal rackets
wilson created jack kramer pro staff graphite version wood racket name extremely popular late 's early 's
chris evert's first graphite racket wa jack kramer version fiberglass
wa market success along everyone else quickly replaced stiffer pro staff kevlar
used mold braided graphite offered noticeable improvement power
popular prince original graphite oversize popular form wa also quite influential used many pro especially juniors
jennifer capriati monica seles instance used prince graphite contest influential wimbledon match ha often hailed beginning power baselining game wta although claim somewhat hyperbolic large part due mistaken impression player hitting much harder fact racket powerful
however large head size compared midsize especially old standard size made easier produce power
prince original graphite name rather misnomer went significant design adjustment lifetime
instance truly original model reverse teardrop head shape something subsequent version had
stiffer composite racket compared first second generation graphite composite contemporary standard
last wooden racket used wimbledon appeared long abandoned practically professionals
borg tried stage comeback standard wood racket premature retirement quickly ended failure standard wood wa match placed stiff midplus graphite
also commonly argued chris evert would able beat martina navratilova latter's dominant period switched wood racket year sooner
additionally last influential wooden racket prince woodie layer graphite increase stiffness wa oversize
wa used tommy haas gabriela sabatini quite others
offered little power offer much surface area standard-size wooden frame
sabatini found helpful compared smaller racket due production heavy topspin
woman beat martina navratilova kathleen horvath used prince woodie one six loss navratilova suffered three-year stretch involving matches
denser pattern often considered deliver control expense spin potential
open pattern often believed offer greater potential power spin
however much power produced player strongly influenced player adapts characteristic racket
player may hit harder dense string pattern producing faster shot added control dense pattern
racket including much wood era marked recommended string tension range
basic rule lower tension creates power trampoline effect higher string tension creates control le string deformation result predictable power angle departure string bed professional used small-headed racket flexible-material string natural gut strung high tension
many professional standard wood era strung relatively low tension used natural gut string decision increase trampoline effect power
contrast almost every professional player today us much stiffer polyester string much stiffer racket also larger head tend lighter
madeline hauptman sold line racket called mad raq featured star david pattern six-pointed figure consisting two interlaced equilateral triangle used three string instead two stringing racket
stringing pattern wa said feature le string notching improving string lifespan
wa even claimed many pro shop refused carry racket le string breakage would reduce string stringing service sales
ha also claimed racket difficult string two string racket
however wilson t- type requires great deal time stringing typical racket racket series popular
whatever cause failure mad raq marketplace wa time snowshoe pattern wa used tennis
hauptman switched racket line two string diamond pattern powerangle
pattern already used much earlier racket much popularity
said easier string mad raq doe benefit reduced string notching least degree
claim diagonal pattern offer comfort traditional square pattern
stiffest graphite racket ha sold prince game mp rated ra industry-standard babolat measuring equipment
prince series used two piece top side bottom side racket left side right side grommet strip
prince briefly used design without grommet strip early version original graphite oversize
famous user series racket wa martina navratilova returned play double using prince control db midplus initial win mixed double wimbledon australian open leander paes
navratilova later switched design warren bosworth founder bosworth tennis customized asymmetric grip unusual geometric head shape
stiffer racket typically offer power control expense increased ball shock lead injury tennis elbow aggravation
however case stiff racket le energy dissipated racket deforming transmitting back ball
however player's overall power level may decrease due need moderate ball striking effort reduce discomfort even injury
although known hard hitter younger year wa known precision player used finesse especially tactic power
fact last double partner major mixed bob bryan remarked slow serve wa despite effective wa court
navratilova also used string wa much softer anyone else tour used thick uncoated natural gut help compensate stiffness racket
vastly higher injury rate tennis compared wood era part due increase stiffness racket strings
