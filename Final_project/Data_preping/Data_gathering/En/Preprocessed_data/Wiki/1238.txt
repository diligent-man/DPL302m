a racket or racquet is a sports implement used for striking a ball or shuttlecock in games such as squash tennis racquetball badminton and padel
in the strictest sense a racket consists of a handled frame with an open hoop across which a network of strings is stretched tightly
some rackets may have a solid or perforated hitting surface instead of a network of strings
such rackets may be called a paddle or bat
collectively these games are known as racket sports
racket design materials and manufacturing has changed considerably over the centuries
the frame of rackets for all sports was traditionally made of solid wood later laminated wood and the strings of animal intestine known as catgut
the traditional racket size was limited by the strength and weight of the wooden frame which had to be strong enough to hold the strings and stiff enough to hit the ball or shuttle
manufacturers started adding non wood laminates to wood rackets to improve stiffness
non wood rackets were made first of steel then of aluminum and then carbon fiber composites
wood is still used for real tennis rackets and xare
most rackets are now made of composite materials including carbon fiber or fiberglass metals such as titanium alloys or ceramics
catgut has partially been replaced by synthetic materials including nylon polyamide and other polymers
rackets are restrung when necessary which may be after every match for a professional
despite the name catgut has never been made from any part of a cat
racket is the standard american spelling of the word
racquet is an alternative spelling more common in britain as evidenced by the bbc style guide
racquet is used more commonly in certain sports such as tennis squash racquetball and badminton and less commonly in others
however the international tennis federation uses racket which is the original and predominant spelling dating from the th century
racquet appeared in the th century as a french influenced variant of racket
the origin of the term racket is unclear
it may be derived from the flemish word raketsen which is itself derived from middle french rachasser meaning to strike the ball back
badminton rackets are light with top quality rackets weighing between about and grams
modern rackets are composed of carbon fiber composite graphite reinforced plastic which may be augmented by a variety of materials
carbon fiber has an excellent strength to weight ratio is stiff and gives excellent kinetic energy transfer
before the adoption of carbon fiber composite rackets were made of wood to their excessive weight and cost
there is a wide variety of racket designs although the badminton racket size and shape are limited by the laws of the game
different rackets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players
the traditional oval head shape is still available but an isometric head shape is increasingly common in new rackets
various companies have emerged but yonex of japan and victor of taiwan are the dominant players in the market
the majority of top tournaments are sponsored by these companies
every year new technology is introduced by these companies but predominantly all rackets are made of carbon graphite composite
this predecessor to the modern game of squash rackets is played with inch mm wooden rackets
while squash equipment has evolved in the intervening century rackets equipment has changed little
according to the current racquetball rules there are no limitations on the weight of a racquetball racket
racquetball rackets unlike many other types generally have little or no neck the grip connecting directly to the head
they also tend to have head shapes that are notably wider at the top with some older rackets looking almost triangular or teardrop shaped
in real tennis also called court tennis inch mm long rackets are made of wood and very tight strings to cope with the game s heavy balls
the racket heads are bent slightly to make striking balls close to the floor or in corners easier
standard squash rackets are governed by the rules of the game
traditionally they were made of laminated timber typically ash with a small strung area using natural gut strings
after a rule change in the mid s they are now almost always made of composite materials such as carbon fiber or metals graphite kevlar titanium and or boron with synthetic strings
modern rackets are cm long with a maximum strung area of square centimetres approximately square inches and a mass between and grams ounces
table tennis uses a table tennis racket made from laminated wood covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the grip of the player
unlike a conventional racket it does not contain strings strung across an open frame
this is called either a paddle racket or a bat with usage differing by region
in the usa the term paddle is common in europe the term is bat and the official ittf term is racket
table tennis racket specs are defined at the ittf handbook section and currently include the following
popular lawn tennis rackets vary primarily in length weight balance point stiffness beam thickness string pattern string density and head size
they generally conform to unofficial standards that differ from past rackets
currently almost all adult rackets are made from a graphite composite
those made from wood the original racket frame row material steel fiberglass or aluminium are considered obsolete although those materials are technically legal for play
inexpensive rackets often have poor performance characteristics such as excessive flexibility and inadequate weight
no recent manufacturers use single throated beams although prince tried to reintroduce the single throat design in the s the only professional who used one was mirjana lu i
braided graphite rackets were considered high end until recently and molded rackets have been the norm for some time
molding is less expensive to manufacture and offer high stiffness
graphite composite rackets are today s industry standard in professional tennis
for length to inches to cm is normally the junior racket range while inches cm is for stronger more physically mature players
some are also available at lengths of to inches to cm
the gamma big bubba was produced with a inches cm length but it is no longer legal in that length
gamma responded by changing the length of the grip portion of the racket to continue sales
the length restriction was based on the concern that such long rackets would make the serve too dominant but that concern has never been objectively supported with testing
moreover some players such as john isner are much taller and have longer arms than average professionals and especially low stature ones giving them a much larger advantage in terms of height for the service than is possible with several inches of racket length
this makes the length restriction more questionable
finally the professionals who nearly always choose to use the longest rackets typically choose them because they use two handed groundstrokes for both forehand and backhand using the extra length to improve their reach
an example is marion bartoli
as this type of player is not dominant in the sport or even close to being average in terms of per capita representation the length restriction seems even more unnecessary
despite prince s attempt to market longer length longbody rackets in the s standard length remains the overwhelming choice of players further negating the argument in favor of the length restriction
when most players who choose to use a longer racket than inches cm choose one they typically only use a inches cm model rather than one approaching inches cm
longer rackets were introduced by dunlop
weights of a racket also vary between ounces g unstrung and ounces g strung
until the s rackets weighted at medium were produced
heavy rackets were produced during the height of the wood era e g
the s very sparingly
the medium weight is heavier than any of the rackets produced since it was discontinued by companies
many professionals added weight to their rackets to improve stability
many continue to do so
pete sampras added lead tape to make his racket have a ounces g weight and venus williams is known for using a frame modified to be quite heavy in terms of the recent times average
by contrast andy roddick surprised many when he said he used a stock pro drive series model series of racket which was light when compared with the rackets used by most top professionals
in both recreational and professional tennis the trend has been away from heavy rackets and toward lighter rackets despite the drawbacks from light rackets such as increased twisting
lawn tennis rackets originally flared outward at the bottom of the handle to prevent slippage
the rounded bottom was called a bark bottom after its inventor matthew barker
but by this style became superfluous
more mass gives rackets plow through momentum that continues once the player has managed to get the racket into motion and which is more resistant to stoppage from the ball s momentum
this can give the perception that the racket produces shots with more power although this is complicated by the typically slower stroke production
higher mass typically involves a slower swing but more energy to execute the swing
more mass also provides more cushioning against ball impact shock a source of injuries such as tennis elbow
however high racket mass can cause fatigue in the shoulder area
typically it is safer for the body to have higher mass
more mass additionally provides more stability
it makes the racket more resistant to twisting forces and pushback
the drawbacks are that heavier rackets have lower maneuverability reducing reaction time and require more energy to move
as a racket gets heavier the player finds it increasingly difficult to do fast reaction shots such as quick volleys and returns of serve
however the additional mass can help with return of serve in particular by making the racket much more resistant to twist from a high powered service
light rackets have the additional drawback of making it easier for beginning players to use inappropriate wrist dominant strokes which often leads to injury
this is because poor stroke mechanics can be much easier to produce with a lightweight racket such as in using one s wrist to mostly swing the racket
an extremely typical mistake beginning players make is to choke up heavily on the racket to try to compensate for twist from a light racket as well as too high racket angle upon impact and use the wrist too much
the only professional well known player to have had success with a strongly choked up grip is zina garrison
head size plays a very key role in a racket s performance characteristics
a larger head size very generally means more power and a larger sweet spot
this is an area in the string bed that is partially more forgiving on off center hits and which produces more ball reflective power from string deformation known as the trampoline effect
however large head sizes can increase twisting which makes off center hits more difficult to control and can reduce a player s overall power production due to the playing compensating for the extra inherent power typically with stiffer strings to reduce the increased string deformation of large heads
a smaller head size generally offers more control for many shots particularly the service and groundstrokes aimed near the lines but can lead to more shanks wild misses from hitting the frame or missing the sweet spot
this drawback is most common for professional players using single handed topspin backhands as well as for recreational and aged players at net
shanking due to small racket head size is typically exacerbated by racket weight which slows the reaction time as well as to a lesser degree the racket s balance point
in professional tennis currently used racket head sizes vary between square inches cm with most players adopting one from square inches cm
rackets with smaller and larger head sizes and square inches and cm are still produced but are not used by professionals currently
a very small number of professionals such as monica seles used square inches cm rackets during some point in their careers
rackets with smaller heads than square inches cm have not been in production since the s and rackets with larger head sizes than square inches cm are not currently legal for the sport even though only elderly players typically choose to use rackets beyond square inches cm and it is nearly unheard of for a serious player who is not elderly to choose a racket over square inches cm
the weed company founded by tad weed specializes in producing very large rackets primarily for the elderly market
rackets that are moderately higher in power production moderately lower in weight moderately larger in size and which typically possess a slightly head heavy balance are often called tweener rackets rackets that have the smallest heads in current use the highest weights in current use and headlight or even balance are referred to as players rackets
oversize rackets typically square inches cm in size were once pejoratively referred to as granny sticks but resistance to them being seen as illegitimate rackets for younger players decreased dramatically with the successful use of these rackets by a small number professionals such as andre agassi and pam shriver
originally even midsize frames square inches cm were considered jumbo and some top players such as martina navratilova and rod laver said they should be banned for making the sport too easy
later these same professionals including john mcenroe signed a letter supporting a switch back to wood frames or a limitation to the original standard size of approximately square inches cm
perhaps the last professional to use a standard size racket in professional tennis was aaron krickstein known for the strongly contested match against connors at the us open
he used a wilson ultra ii standard size graphite racket also used in the s by the hard hitting teen andrea jaeger
the first oversize the fiberglass bentley fortissimo from germany was praised by racket designers but was considered too large to be taken seriously by the small number of players who were exposed to it
the head light balance point is rarer in professional tennis than it once was as the sport has converted to larger headed rackets stiffer rackets stiffer strings more western grips and accompanying stroke production and more topspin
the head light balance point is most optimal for the serve and volley style with a continental grip
serve and volley is no longer a viable option for nearly all professionals as the mode of playing for most points in a match
head heavy rackets became popular mainly with recreational players primarily with the introduction of the wilson profile widebody racket
the head light balance makes volleys and serves easier to produce while groundstrokes are less stable
the head heavy balance makes groundstrokes more stable which typically increases the player s comfort for swinging harder to add power but makes serves and volleys more cumbersome
a head heavy balance also puts more stress on the elbow and shoulder
vibration dampeners also sometimes known as gummies may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array to reduce the percussive sound of the ball hitting the strings and or to reduce perceived vibration
they do not however reduce impact shock significantly so they are of no safety value
some professionals such as andre agassi used rubber bands instead of specialized dampeners
dampeners come in two main types
the first uses the two central main strings to hold it in place
the second is sometimes called a worm and it is woven between many of the main strings
dampeners are nearly always placed very near the bottom of the racket string bed
as rackets have become lighter stiffer and larger headed the professional game has moved basically completely from softer and more flexible string materials to stiff materials
this is in large part to tone down the additional power potential of the modern rackets
however it also is related to the tendency for different string materials to move out of place when subjected to heavy topspin strokes
polyester is the string of choice today because of that resistance despite its increased stiffness harsher feel and more aggravating for the joints and reduced tension holding ability versus a string like natural gut which excels at that
the top professionals of the s and earlier despite having access to stiffer materials such as nylon nearly always chose to use the very flexible natural gut instead
string bed stiffness can be increased by using stiffer materials such as kevlar and polyester by increasing the density of the string pattern and by stringing with a higher tension
racket makers and players have experimented with very dense string patterns and very open patterns beginning with the snauwaert hi ten which had a pattern with as few as mains and crosses
doubles great mark woodforde used one of them
more recently grigor dimitrov is known for having played with a very open patterned racket during part of his career
string choice both in thickness and material string tension string pattern and string pattern density can have a very large effect on how a racket performs
throughout most of lawn tennis history most rackets were made of laminated wood with heads of around square inches cm
a small number of them were made of metal such as a s racket by dayton
some rarely also had metal strings
in the late s wilson popularized the t steel racket with wire wound around the frame to make string loops after having purchased the design from ren lacoste who produced the racket first in a more limited run
it was popularized by the top american player jimmy connors and was also prior to connors using it by billie jean king in her early career
many players said it lacked control but had more power when compared with wood frames of the period
connors used the rarer firm model that had additional throat welds to increase its stiffness
in spalding launched an aluminum racket called the smasher
aluminum though lighter and more flexible than steel was sometimes less accurate than wood
the biggest complaint however was that metal rackets caused strong cases of tennis elbow especially the kind that had holes for the strings directly in the frame rather than using an external wire wrapper as in the t
because of that drawback in particular most of the top players still preferred to use wooden frames
by aluminum construction improvements allowed for the introduction of the first american oversized racket which was manufactured by weed
prince popularized the oversize racket which had a head size of approximately square inches cm
howard head was able to obtain a broad patent for prince despite the prior art of the bentley fortissimo the first oversize made in germany of fiberglass and the weed
the patent was rejected by germany but approved in the usa
the popularity of the prince aluminum oversize had the side effect of popularizing rackets having other non standard head sizes such as mid size square inches cm and mid plus sizes square inches cm
fairly quickly midsize frames began to become the most used frames in the pro tours
martina navratilova popularized the midsize graphite racket with her wins using the yonex r the first midsize graphite racket made by yonex
nearly at the same time however she said the jumbo rackets midsize included should be removed from the sport for making it easier
she said she would use them only because other players could as they were tournament legal
fewer players chose to use oversize rackets and some switched to midplus frames after their earliest career for more control
fiberglass frames also had a brief period of limited popularity making fewer inroads among top players than aluminum
also the earliest composites such as the head competition series used by arthur ashe were made without graphite
these were more flexible than a typical early graphite composite but stiffer than wood fiberglass and aluminum
in the early s graphite carbon fibre composites were introduced and other materials were added to the composite including ceramics glass fibre boron and titanium
some of the earliest models typically had or more fiberglass to make them more flexible
stiff rackets were typically not preferred by most players because of their familiarity with the comfortable softness of wood
these early models tended to be very flexible and not very powerful although they were a power upgrade over wood and metal rackets
wilson created the jack kramer pro staff the graphite version of the wood racket of the same name extremely popular in the late s and early s
this was the origin of the extremely influential wilson pro staff
chris evert s first graphite racket was this jack kramer version which had fiberglass
it was not a market success and she along with everyone else quickly replaced it with the stiffer pro staff which had kevlar
it used the same mold and had the same braided graphite but offered a very noticeable improvement in power
the very popular prince original graphite an oversize in its most popular form was also quite influential and used by many pros especially as juniors
jennifer capriati and monica seles for instance used the prince graphite to contest their influential wimbledon match in that has often been hailed as the beginning of the power baselining game in the wta although that claim is somewhat hyperbolic and is in large part due to the mistaken impression that the players were hitting much harder when in fact the rackets were more powerful
however the very large head size when compared with the midsize and especially the old standard size made it easier to produce power
the racket also had an open string pattern
the prince original graphite name is rather a misnomer as it went through some significant design adjustments over its lifetime
for instance the truly original model had a reverse teardrop head shape something no subsequent versions had
stiffer composite rackets when compared with the first and second generations of graphite composites are the contemporary standard
the last wooden racket used at wimbledon appeared in long after they were abandoned by practically all professionals
borg tried to stage a comeback with his standard wood racket after his premature retirement but it quickly ended in failure as the standard wood was no match when placed against a stiff midplus graphite
it is also commonly argued that chris evert would have been able to beat martina navratilova during the latter s most dominant period if she had switched from her wood racket years sooner
additionally the last influential wooden racket the prince woodie had layers of graphite to increase its stiffness and was an oversize
it was used by tommy haas gabriela sabatini and quite a few others
it offered very little power but did offer much more surface area than a standard size wooden frame
sabatini found it helpful as compared with smaller rackets due to her production of heavy topspin
the only woman to beat martina navratilova in kathleen horvath used the prince woodie one of only six losses navratilova suffered in a three year stretch involving matches
a denser pattern is often considered to deliver more control at the expense of spin potential
a more open pattern is often believed to offer greater potential for power and spin
however how much power is produced by a player can be strongly influenced by how a player adapts to the characteristics of the racket
some players may hit harder with a dense string pattern producing faster shots because of the added control from the dense pattern
rackets including those of much of the wood era are marked with a recommended string tension range
the basic rule is that a lower tension creates more power from the trampoline effect and a higher string tension creates more control less string deformation which results in a more predictable the power and angle of the departure from the string bed some professionals used small headed rackets with flexible material strings natural gut strung at very high tension
examples include pete sampras and bj rn borg
some used large headed rackets with very inflexible material strings kevlar
andre agassi is an example
many professionals during the standard wood era strung at relatively low tension and used natural gut string both decisions were to increase the trampoline effect for more power
by contrast almost every professional player today uses the much stiffer polyester string in their much stiffer rackets which also have larger heads and which tend to be lighter
madeline hauptman sold a line of rackets called the mad raq which featured a star of david pattern a six pointed figure consisting of two interlaced equilateral triangles as it used three strings instead of two for stringing the racket
this pattern is used in snowshoes
this stringing pattern was said to feature less string notching improving string lifespan
it was even claimed that many pro shops refused to carry the racket because less string breakage would reduce string and stringing service sales
it has also been claimed that the racket is more difficult to string than a two string racket
however the wilson t type requires a great deal more time for stringing than a typical racket and rackets of that series were very popular
whatever the cause of the failure of the mad raq in the marketplace it was the only time a snowshoe pattern was used in tennis
hauptman switched her racket line to a two string diamond pattern powerangle
this pattern had already been used in much earlier rackets but had not had much popularity
it is said to be easier to string than the mad raq but does not have the benefit of reduced string notching at least not to the same degree
the claim is that this diagonal pattern offers more comfort than a traditional square pattern
the stiffest graphite racket that has been sold is the prince more game mp which is rated at ra on the industry standard babolat measuring equipment
the prince more series used two pieces a top side and bottom side of the racket or a left side and a right side and no grommet strip
prince had briefly used a design without a grommet strip in an early version of its original graphite oversize
the most famous user of a more series racket was martina navratilova who returned to play doubles in her s using a prince more control db a midplus for her initial wins in the mixed doubles at wimbledon and the australian open with leander paes
she had used the stiffer more game mp prior
navratilova later switched to a design by warren bosworth the founder of bosworth tennis which had a customized asymmetric grip and an unusual geometric head shape
stiffer rackets typically offer more power and control at the expense of increased ball shock which can lead to injury or tennis elbow aggravation
typically power and control are at odds
however in the case of stiff rackets less energy is dissipated by the racket deforming transmitting it back to the ball
control is improved because there is less deformation
however a player s overall power level may decrease due to the need to moderate ball striking effort to reduce discomfort and even injury
although known as a hard hitter in her younger years in her s she was known more as a precision player who used finesse and especially tactics more than power
in fact the last doubles partner she won a major with in mixed bob bryan remarked on how slow her serve was despite how effective she was on the court
navratilova also used string that was much softer than what anyone else on tour used thick uncoated natural gut to help compensate for the stiffness of her racket
the vastly higher injury rate in tennis when compared with the wood era is in part due to the increase in stiffness both of the racket and of the strings
real tennis uses wooden rackets and cork filled balls
it is a very different sport from today s lawn tennis
