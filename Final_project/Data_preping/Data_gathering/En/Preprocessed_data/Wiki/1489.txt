the rugby league world cup was the thirteenth staging of the rugby league world cup since its inauguration in and the first since the tournament
the tournament was held in australia from october culminating in the final between australia and new zealand on november
was the fourth time that the world cup was held in australia the first being in
the tournament was won by new zealand who defeated australia in the final in one of the greatest upsets in the history of the sport
the tournament featured the best ten teams around the globe which were split into three groups
a total of eighteen matches took place in twelve different venues across four australian states
the tournament ended a year of celebrations commemorating the centenary of the game in the southern hemisphere and was part of the festival of world cups
the thirteenth cup was scheduled to be held in australia in however the lack of international success by great britain and new zealand after the world cup and the rise of the tri nations tournament meant that it was delayed for a further four years
the rugby league international federation officially announced this tournament on may with further details on scheduling and dates following on april
the first match took place in townsville between england and papua new guinea although the official opening ceremony of the competition occurred before the australia and new zealand match the following day in sydney
the final took place at lang park suncorp stadium in brisbane
the tournament proved a commercial success delivering a profit of a million and re establishing the credibility of the competition
the draw after being confirmed by the rlif on april involved three groups
the first group was made up of four teams australia england new zealand and papua new guinea
whilst the other two groups involved three teams each
the semi finals were made up of the first three teams in the first group and the winner of a playoff between the winners of the second and third groups
the draw was put into doubt after the papua new guinea team claimed that it was unfair to them and threatened to boycott the tournament should it not be changed
marcus bai former papua new guinean winger and captain said
fortunately for the tournament this separate island competition did not eventuate
papua new guinea still remained upset with the draw seeing it as a huge challenge but one which would have seen them be rewarded if they had won
the draw was finalised on october
teams received points for a win and point for a draw
this meant that unlike in the australasian national rugby league there was no golden point rule enforced
in group stages if two teams had the same number of points then positions were determined on points difference the number of points scored minus the number of points conceded
after group matches were completed a match featuring the second placed teams in group b and group c took place with the winner receiving th place
similarly the third placed teams in group b and group c played off for th place
it was believed that these results were to be taken into account in the rlif world rankings
the hosts australia were given automatic entry into the world cup along with new zealand england france and papua new guinea
the five remaining places in the world cup were determined by qualification rounds
two european rounds and pacific atlantic and rep chage rounds were scheduled
tonga and fiji became the first two nations to qualify after tonga defeated samoa in leeds on october forcing samoa to enter the rep chage
in the european group two ireland drew with lebanon to ensure qualification while lebanon were forced to enter the rep chage
the final automatic place went to scotland who defeated wales on aggregate after two legs
wales then faced lebanon in the rep chage semi final where they lost in a surprise defeat to knock them out of world cup qualifying
lebanon then faced samoa who beat usa in the first semi final on november for the final qualifying position
the game was won by samoa and so they booked the tenth and final place
many qualification matches were broadcast live by sky sports in the united kingdom and new zealand whilst bigpondtv broadcast matches online for other fans around the world

these four nations also provided touch judges while england and australia provided the video referees

damien blanch due to the generally poor response of the world cup there were several key criticisms of the tournament before any matches had kicked off
the rlif were forced to defend the credibility of the tournament in october after new zealand one of the favourites for the competition were heavily beaten in a test match in wellington against australia
another concern was whether there would be enough competitiveness throughout the ten teams with some fans worried about the possibility of too many one sided matches which was a common sight in the group stages of the tournament
ricky stuart coach of the australian team was reported to be so incensed by his team s defeat in the final that he verbally attacked geoff carr the chief executive of australian rugby league claiming that tournament organisers and match officials conspired to cause the australian loss
the next morning he had a chance meeting with ashley klein who refereed the final and stuart cummings the rugby football league s director of match officials at their hotel
he reportedly abused both officials in front of a number of witnesses calling klein a cheat and behaved in an aggressive and physically intimidating manner
stuart later apologised for his behaviour and resigned from his post
