The 2008 Rugby League World Cup was the thirteenth staging of the Rugby League World Cup since its inauguration in 1954, and the first since the 2000 tournament
The tournament was held in Australia from 26 October, culminating in the final between Australia and New Zealand on 22 November.
2008 was the fourth time that the World Cup was held in Australia, the first being in 1957
The tournament was won by New Zealand, who defeated Australia 34–20 in the final in one of the greatest upsets in the history of the sport
The tournament featured the best ten teams around the globe which were split into three groups
A total of eighteen matches took place in twelve different venues across four Australian states
The tournament ended a year of celebrations commemorating the centenary of the game in the southern hemisphere and was part of the Festival of World Cups.
The thirteenth Cup was scheduled to be held in Australia in 2004, however the lack of international success by Great Britain and New Zealand after the 2000 World Cup and the rise of the Tri-Nations tournament meant that it was delayed for a further four years
The Rugby League International Federation officially announced this tournament on 6 May 2006, with further details on scheduling and dates following on 19 April 2007.
The first match took place in Townsville between England and Papua New Guinea, although the official opening ceremony of the competition occurred before the Australia and New Zealand match the following day in Sydney
The final took place at Lang Park (Suncorp Stadium) in Brisbane.
The tournament proved a commercial success, delivering a profit of A$5 million and re-establishing the credibility of the competition.
The draw, after being confirmed by the RLIF on 19 April 2007, involved three groups
The first group was made up of four teams; Australia, England, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea
Whilst the other two groups involved three teams each
The semi finals were made up of the first three teams in the first group and the winner of a playoff between the winners of the second and third groups.
The draw was put into doubt after the Papua New Guinea team claimed that it was unfair to them and threatened to boycott the tournament should it not be changed
Marcus Bai, former Papua New Guinean winger and captain, said:
Fortunately for the tournament, this separate island competition did not eventuate
Papua New Guinea still remained upset with the draw, seeing it as a huge challenge but one which would have seen them be rewarded if they had won
The draw was finalised on 4 October 2007.
Teams received 2 points for a win, and 1-point for a draw
This meant that, unlike in the Australasian National Rugby League, there was no "golden point" rule enforced
In group stages, if two teams had the same number of points then positions were determined on points difference, the number of points scored minus the number of points conceded.
After group matches were completed, a match featuring the second placed teams in Group B and Group C took place with the winner receiving 7th place
Similarly the third placed teams in Group B and Group C played off for 9th place
It was believed that these results were to be taken into account in the 2009 RLIF World Rankings.
The hosts, Australia, were given automatic entry into the World Cup, along with New Zealand, England, France and Papua New Guinea
The five remaining places in the World Cup were determined by qualification rounds
Two European rounds and Pacific, Atlantic and Repêchage rounds were scheduled.
Tonga and Fiji became the first two nations to qualify after Tonga defeated Samoa 18–10 in Leeds on 22 October, forcing Samoa to enter the repêchage
In the European Group Two, Ireland drew 16–16 with Lebanon to ensure qualification, while Lebanon were forced to enter the repêchage
The final automatic place went to Scotland, who defeated Wales 37–32 on aggregate after two legs
Wales then faced Lebanon in the repêchage semi-final, where they lost in a surprise 50–26 defeat, to knock them out of World Cup Qualifying
Lebanon then faced Samoa, who beat USA 42–10 in the first semi-final, on 14 November for the final qualifying position
The game was won by Samoa, 38–16, and so they booked the tenth and final place
Many qualification matches were broadcast live by Sky Sports in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, whilst BigPondTV broadcast matches online for other fans around the world.
Six referees from four countries controlled matches in the tournament
These four nations also provided touch judges while England and Australia provided the video referees
In support of the Australian National Breast Cancer Foundation, the referees wore pastel pink shirts while officiating matches to raise awareness
The shirts, which carried the NBCF logo on the collar, were signed by the team captains at each World Cup game and were later auctioned off with the proceeds going to the NBCF.

Due to Rugby League World Cup rules prohibiting the use of commercial venue names, all venues were known by their non-commercial names, e.g
Suncorp Stadium was known as Lang Park during the tournament
Lang Park would also host the World Cup Final.
On Sunday night, 26 October, the Sydney Football Stadium hosted the Opening Ceremony of the World Cup
It started with Greg Inglis reciting a speech about "Playing Fair"
Following Inglis' speech there was an Aboriginal Smoking ceremony to welcome all the athletes and participants
This included a rather large sized Rainbow Serpent which represented the Aboriginal Dreamtime
The last part of the ceremony involved a performance of the Rugby League World Cup anthem "Hero" by Natalie Bassingthwaighte
A curtain raiser to the Australia vs
New Zealand match included an Indigenous Australian squad playing against New Zealand Māori which featured several prominent NRL players and rising stars, including Chris Sandow, Wairangi Koopu, Preston Campbell, Sam Thaiday, Shaun Kenny-Dowall and Carl Webb.
Welcome to the Country Match
As part of the official opening of the World Cup on 26 October, an exhibition game was played between an Aboriginal selection and a New Zealand Māori side.
The 2008 Rugby League World Cup's eighteen matches were played during October and November in various locations throughout the east coast of Australia
The tournament's teams were divided into three pool groups
The teams finishing highest amongst those groups progressed to the play-offs.
All teams from group A (shaded in green) with the exception of the bottom qualifying team progressed to the semi-finals, the other two groups the top finisher progressed to a playoff match, in which the winner would qualify to the semi-finals.

The RLIF were forced to defend the credibility of the tournament in October 2007 after New Zealand, one of the favourites for the competition, were heavily beaten in a Test match 58–0 in Wellington against Australia
Another concern was whether there would be enough competitiveness throughout the ten teams, with some fans worried about the possibility of too many one-sided matches, which was a common sight in the Group Stages of the 2000 tournament.
Ricky Stuart, coach of the Australian team, was reported to be so incensed by his team's defeat in the final that he verbally attacked Geoff Carr, the chief executive of Australian Rugby League, claiming that tournament organisers and match officials conspired to cause the Australian loss
The next morning he had a chance meeting with Ashley Klein, who refereed the final, and Stuart Cummings, the Rugby Football League's director of match officials, at their hotel
He reportedly abused both officials in front of a number of witnesses, calling Klein a cheat, and behaved in an aggressive and physically intimidating manner
Stuart later apologised for his behaviour and resigned from his post.

At the launch, Paul Kind, the World Cup Director of Marketing, explained, "Heroes Here 08 underlines that fact that the international game, and particularly this tournament, will bring out the best in every player who takes part
It will create heroes."
Natalie Bassingthwaighte recorded an "Australian version" of the Mariah Carey song "Hero" which accompanied the "Heroes 08" promotional video and other World Cup advertising
The World Cup Opening Ceremony featured a live performance of the song by Bassingthwaighte.
Filming of visuals for the promotional video began in Leeds during the worldwide ticketing launch for the event in November 2007.
Advertising agency MJW, celebrity photographer Garry Heery and production company Engine worked together to combine the latest digital animation with a dark and determined set that highlighted the passion players feel in representing their country on the international stage.
The Heroes campaign featured Mark Gasnier (Australia), Roy Asotasi (New Zealand), Rob Burrow (England), Keith Peters (PNG), Waisale Sukanaveita (Fiji), Nigel Vagana (Samoa), Jerome Guisset (France), Lee Paterson (Scotland), Stuart Littler (Ireland) and Lopini Paea (Tonga)
Gasnier was later removed from some of the promotional material after he left the sport mid-season and was replaced by Darren Lockyer.
The video also appeared in the video game Rugby League 2: World Cup Edition, which featured a world cup mode based on the event.
