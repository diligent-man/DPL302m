macrophage abbreviated mp greek large eater greek makrs large phagein eat type white blood cell immune system engulfs digest pathogen cancer cell microbe cellular debris foreign substance protein specific healthy body cell surface
process called phagocytosis act defend host infection injury
large phagocyte found essentially tissue patrol potential pathogen amoeboid movement
take various form various name throughout body eg histiocyte kupffer cell alveolar macrophage microglia others part mononuclear phagocyte system
besides phagocytosis play critical role nonspecific defense innate immunity also help initiate specific defense mechanism adaptive immunity recruiting immune cell lymphocytes
human dysfunctional macrophage cause severe disease chronic granulomatous disease result frequent infections
beyond increasing inflammation stimulating immune system macrophage also play important anti-inflammatory role decrease immune reaction release cytokines
macrophage encourage inflammation called macrophage whereas decrease inflammation encourage tissue repair called macrophages
difference reflected metabolism macrophage unique ability metabolize arginine killer molecule nitric oxide whereas macrophage unique ability metabolize arginine repair molecule ornithine
however dichotomy ha recently questioned complexity ha discovered

according grouping classically-activated macrophage wound-healing macrophage also known alternatively-activated macrophage regulatory macrophage mregs
macrophage reside adult healthy tissue either derive circulating monocyte established birth maintained adult life independently monocytes
contrast macrophage accumulate diseased site typically derive circulating monocytes
monocyte enters damaged tissue endothelium blood vessel process known leukocyte extravasation undergoes series change become macrophage
monocyte attracted damaged site chemical substance chemotaxis triggered range stimulus including damaged cell pathogen cytokine released macrophage already site
unlike short-lived neutrophil macrophage survive longer body several months
macrophage professional phagocyte highly specialized removal dying dead cell cellular debris

first step understanding importance macrophage muscle repair growth regeneration two wave macrophage onset damageable muscle use subpopulation directly influence repairing muscle
initial wave phagocytic population come along period increased muscle use sufficient cause muscle membrane lysis membrane inflammation enter degrade content injured muscle fibers
early-invading phagocytic macrophage reach highest concentration hour following onset form muscle cell injury reloading
second group non-phagocytic type distributed near regenerative fibers
