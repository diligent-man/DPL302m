macrophages abbreviated as m m or mp greek large eaters from greek makr s large phagein to eat are a type of white blood cell of the immune system that engulfs and digests pathogens such as cancer cells microbes cellular debris and foreign substances which do not have proteins that are specific to healthy body cells on their surface
the process is called phagocytosis which acts to defend the host against infection and injury
these large phagocytes are found in essentially all tissues where they patrol for potential pathogens by amoeboid movement
they take various forms with various names throughout the body e g histiocytes kupffer cells alveolar macrophages microglia and others but all are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system
besides phagocytosis they play a critical role in nonspecific defense innate immunity and also help initiate specific defense mechanisms adaptive immunity by recruiting other immune cells such as lymphocytes
for example they are important as antigen presenters to t cells
in humans dysfunctional macrophages cause severe diseases such as chronic granulomatous disease that result in frequent infections
beyond increasing inflammation and stimulating the immune system macrophages also play an important anti inflammatory role and can decrease immune reactions through the release of cytokines
macrophages that encourage inflammation are called m macrophages whereas those that decrease inflammation and encourage tissue repair are called m macrophages
this difference is reflected in their metabolism m macrophages have the unique ability to metabolize arginine to the killer molecule nitric oxide whereas m macrophages have the unique ability to metabolize arginine to the repair molecule ornithine
however this dichotomy has been recently questioned as further complexity has been discovered
human macrophages are about micrometres in in diameter and are produced by the differentiation of monocytes in tissues
they can be identified using flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining by their specific expression of proteins such as cd cd cd b cd f mice emr human lysozyme m mac mac and cd
macrophages were first discovered and named by lie metchnikoff a russian zoologist in
a majority of macrophages are stationed at strategic points where microbial invasion or accumulation of foreign particles is likely to occur
these cells together as a group are known as the mononuclear phagocyte system and were previously known as the reticuloendothelial system
each type of macrophage determined by its location has a specific name
investigations concerning kupffer cells are hampered because in humans kupffer cells are only accessible for immunohistochemical analysis from biopsies or autopsies
from rats and mice they are difficult to isolate and after purification only approximately million cells can be obtained from one mouse
macrophages can express paracrine functions within organs that are specific to the function of that organ
in the testis for example macrophages have been shown to be able to interact with leydig cells by secreting hydroxycholesterol an oxysterol that can be converted to testosterone by neighbouring leydig cells
also testicular macrophages may participate in creating an immune privileged environment in the testis and in mediating infertility during inflammation of the testis
cardiac resident macrophages participate in electrical conduction via gap junction communication with cardiac myocytes
macrophages can be classified on basis of the fundamental function and activation
according to this grouping there are classically activated m macrophages wound healing macrophages also known as alternatively activated m macrophages and regulatory macrophages mregs
macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes
by contrast most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes
when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel a process known as leukocyte extravasation it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage
monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site
at some sites such as the testis macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation
unlike short lived neutrophils macrophages survive longer in the body up to several months
macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris
this role is important in chronic inflammation as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age see cd for a description of this process
the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site where they perform their function and die before they or their neutrophil extracellular traps are phagocytized by the macrophages
when at the site the first wave of neutrophils after the process of aging and after the first hours stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils
the removal of dying cells is to a greater extent handled by fixed macrophages which will stay at strategic locations such as the lungs liver neural tissue bone spleen and connective tissue ingesting foreign materials such as pathogens and recruiting additional macrophages if needed
when a macrophage ingests a pathogen the pathogen becomes trapped in a phagosome which then fuses with a lysosome
within the phagolysosome enzymes and toxic peroxides digest the pathogen
however some bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis have become resistant to these methods of digestion
typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis
macrophages can digest more than bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds
macrophages are versatile cells that play many roles
as scavengers they rid the body of worn out cells and other debris
along with dendritic cells they are foremost among the cells that present antigens a crucial role in initiating an immune response
as secretory cells monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances monokines including enzymes complement proteins and regulatory factors such as interleukin
at the same time they carry receptors for lymphokines that allow them to be activated into single minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells
after digesting a pathogen a macrophage will present the antigen a molecule most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification of the pathogen to the corresponding helper t cell
the presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an mhc class ii molecule mhcii indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen despite having antigens on its surface
eventually the antigen presentation results in the production of antibodies that attach to the antigens of pathogens making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose
in some cases pathogens are very resistant to adhesion by the macrophages
the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages in the context of mhc class ii in a lymph node stimulates th type helper t cells to proliferate mainly due to il secretion from the macrophage
when a b cell in the lymph node recognizes the same unprocessed surface antigen on the bacterium with its surface bound antibody the antigen is endocytosed and processed
the processed antigen is then presented in mhcii on the surface of the b cell
t cells that express the t cell receptor which recognizes the antigen mhcii complex with co stimulatory factors cd and cd l cause the b cell to produce antibodies that help opsonisation of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by phagocytes
macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites
once a t cell has recognized its particular antigen on the surface of an aberrant cell the t cell becomes an activated effector cell producing chemical mediators known as lymphokines that stimulate macrophages into a more aggressive form
there are several activated forms of macrophages
in spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages there are two main groups designated m and m
m macrophages as mentioned earlier previously referred to as classically activated macrophages m killer macrophages are activated by lps and ifn gamma and secrete high levels of il and low levels of il
m macrophages have pro inflammatory bactericidal and phagocytic functions
in contrast the m repair designation also referred to as alternatively activated macrophages broadly refers to macrophages that function in constructive processes like wound healing and tissue repair and those that turn off damaging immune system activation by producing anti inflammatory cytokines like il
m is the phenotype of resident tissue macrophages and can be further elevated by il
m macrophages produce high levels of il tgf beta and low levels of il
tumor associated macrophages are mainly of the m phenotype and seem to actively promote tumor growth
macrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation
phenotypes can be predominantly separated into two major categories m and m
m macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators interferon ifn tumor necrosis factor tnf and damage associated molecular patterns damps
these mediator molecules create a pro inflammatory response that in return produce pro inflammatory cytokines like interleukin and tnf
unlike m macrophages m macrophages secrete an anti inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin or interleukin
they also play a role in wound healing and are needed for revascularization and reepithelialization
m macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles m a m b m c and m d
how m phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound
m macrophages are needed for vascular stability
they produce vascular endothelial growth factor a and tgf
there is a phenotype shift from m to m macrophages in acute wounds however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds
this dysregulation results in insufficient m macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair
with a lack of these growth factors anti inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro inflammatory cytokines from m macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner
normally after neutrophils eat debris pathogens they perform apoptosis and are removed
at this point inflammation is not needed and m undergoes a switch to m anti inflammatory
however dysregulation occurs as the m macrophages are unable do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation
both m and m macrophages play a role in promotion of atherosclerosis
m macrophages promote atherosclerosis by inflammation
m macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels but when the cholesterol is oxidized the m macrophages become apoptotic foam cells contributing to the atheromatous plaque of atherosclerosis
the first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair growth and regeneration is that there are two waves of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle
the initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers
these early invading phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading
their concentration rapidly declines after hours
the second group is the non phagocytic types that are distributed near regenerative fibers
these peak between two and four days and remain elevated for several days during while muscle tissue is rebuilding
the first subpopulation has no direct benefit to repairing muscle while the second non phagocytic group does
it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation differentiation growth repair and regeneration of muscle but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown
it is known that macrophages involvement in promoting tissue repair is not muscle specific they accumulate in numerous tissues during the healing process phase following injury
macrophages are essential for wound healing
they replace polymorphonuclear neutrophils as the predominant cells in the wound by day two after injury
attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls
numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs
once they are in the wound site monocytes mature into macrophages
the spleen contains half the body s monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue
the macrophage s main role is to phagocytize bacteria and damaged tissue and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases
macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines especially during the third and fourth post wound days
these factors attract cells involved in the proliferation stage of healing to the area
macrophages may also restrain the contraction phase
macrophages are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis and they also stimulate cells that re epithelialize the wound create granulation tissue and lay down a new extracellular matrix
by secreting these factors macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase
scientists have elucidated that as well as eating up material debris macrophages are involved in the typical limb regeneration in the salamander
they found that removing the macrophages from a salamander resulted in failure of limb regeneration and a scarring response
as described above macrophages play a key role in removing dying or dead cells and cellular debris
erythrocytes have a lifespan on average of days and so are constantly being destroyed by macrophages in the spleen and liver
macrophages will also engulf macromolecules and so play a key role in the pharmacokinetics of parenteral irons
the iron that is released from the haemoglobin is either stored internally in ferritin or is released into the circulation via ferroportin
in cases where systemic iron levels are raised or where inflammation is present raised levels of hepcidin act on macrophage ferroportin channels leading to iron remaining within the macrophages
melanophages are a subset of tissue resident macrophages able to absorb pigment either native to the organism or exogenous such as tattoos from extracellular space
in contrast to dendritic juncional melanocytes which synthesize melanosomes and contain various stages of their development the melanophages only accumulate phagocytosed melanin in lysosome like phagosomes
this occurs repeatedly as the pigment from dead dermal macrophages is phagocytosed by their successors preserving the tattoo in the same place
every tissue harbors its own specialized population of resident macrophages which entertain reciprocal interconnections with the stroma and functional tissue
these resident macrophages are sessile non migratory provide essential growth factors to support the physiological function of the tissue e g
macrophage neuronal crosstalk in the guts and can actively protect the tissue from inflammatory damage
nerve associated macrophages or nams are those tissue resident macrophages that are known to be associated with nerves
some of them are known to have an elongated morphology of upto um
due to their role in phagocytosis macrophages are involved in many diseases of the immune system
for example they participate in the formation of granulomas inflammatory lesions that may be caused by a large number of diseases
some disorders mostly rare of ineffective phagocytosis and macrophage function have been described for example
in their role as a phagocytic immune cell macrophages are responsible for engulfing pathogens to destroy them
some pathogens subvert this process and instead live inside the macrophage
this provides an environment in which the pathogen is hidden from the immune system and allows it to replicate
diseases with this type of behaviour include tuberculosis caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis and leishmaniasis caused by leishmania species
in order to minimize the possibility of becoming the host of an intracellular bacteria macrophages have evolved defense mechanisms such as induction of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates which are toxic to microbes
macrophages have also evolved the ability to restrict the microbe s nutrient supply and induce autophagy
once engulfed by a macrophage the causative agent of tuberculosis mycobacterium tuberculosis avoids cellular defenses and uses the cell to replicate
recent evidence suggests that in response to the pulmonary infection of mycobacterium tuberculosis the peripheral macrophages matures into m phenotype
macrophage m phenotype is characterized by increased secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines il tnf and il and increased glycolytic activities essential for clearance of infection
upon phagocytosis by a macrophage the leishmania parasite finds itself in a phagocytic vacuole
under normal circumstances this phagocytic vacuole would develop into a lysosome and its contents would be digested
leishmania alter this process and avoid being destroyed instead they make a home inside the vacuole
infection of macrophages in joints is associated with local inflammation during and after the acute phase of chikungunya caused by chikv or chikungunya virus
adenovirus most common cause of pink eye can remain latent in a host macrophage with continued viral shedding months after initial infection
brucella spp
can remain latent in a macrophage via inhibition of phagosome lysosome fusion causes brucellosis undulant fever
legionella pneumophila the causative agent of legionnaires disease also establishes residence within macrophages
macrophages are the predominant cells involved in creating the progressive plaque lesions of atherosclerosis
focal recruitment of macrophages occurs after the onset of acute myocardial infarction
these macrophages function to remove debris apoptotic cells and to prepare for tissue regeneration
macrophages also play a role in human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection
like t cells macrophages can be infected with hiv and even become a reservoir of ongoing virus replication throughout the body
hiv can enter the macrophage through binding of gp to cd and second membrane receptor ccr a chemokine receptor
both circulating monocytes and macrophages serve as a reservoir for the virus
macrophages are better able to resist infection by hiv than cd t cells although susceptibility to hiv infection differs among macrophage subtypes
macrophages can contribute to tumor growth and progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion fostering tumor angiogenesis and suppressing antitumor immune cells
attracted to oxygen starved hypoxic and necrotic tumor cells they promote chronic inflammation
inflammatory compounds such as tumor necrosis factor tnf alpha released by the macrophages activate the gene switch nuclear factor kappa b
nf b then enters the nucleus of a tumor cell and turns on production of proteins that stop apoptosis and promote cell proliferation and inflammation
moreover macrophages serve as a source for many pro angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial factor vegf tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf alpha macrophage colony stimulating factor m csf csf and il and il contributing further to the tumor growth
macrophages have been shown to infiltrate a number of tumors
their number correlates with poor prognosis in certain cancers including cancers of breast cervix bladder brain and prostate
tumor associated macrophages tams are thought to acquire an m phenotype contributing to tumor growth and progression
some tumors can also produce factors including m csf csf mcp ccl and angiotensin ii that trigger the amplification and mobilization of macrophages in tumors
research in various study models suggests that macrophages can sometimes acquire anti tumor functions
for example macrophages may have cytotoxic activity to kill tumor cells directly also the co operation of t cells and macrophages is important to suppress tumors
this co operation involves not only the direct contact of t cell and macrophage with antigen presentation but also includes the secretion of adequate combinations of cytokines which enhance t cell antitumor activity
recent study findings suggest that by forcing ifn expression in tumor infiltrating macrophages it is possible to blunt their innate protumoral activity and reprogram the tumor microenvironment toward more effective dendritic cell activation and immune effector cell cytotoxicity
additionally subcapsular sinus macrophages in tumor draining lymph nodes can suppress cancer progression by containing the spread of tumor derived materials
experimental studies indicate that macrophages can affect all therapeutic modalities including surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy immunotherapy and targeted therapy
macrophages can influence treatment outcomes both positively and negatively
macrophages can be protective in different ways they can remove dead tumor cells in a process called phagocytosis following treatments that kill these cells they can serve as drug depots for some anticancer drugs they can also be activated by some therapies to promote antitumor immunity
macrophages can also be deleterious in several ways for example they can suppress various chemotherapies radiotherapies and immunotherapies
because macrophages can regulate tumor progression therapeutic strategies to reduce the number of these cells or to manipulate their phenotypes are currently being tested in cancer patients
however macrophages are also involved in antibody mediated cytotoxicity adcc and this mechanism has been proposed to be important for certain cancer immunotherapy antibodies
it has been observed that increased number of pro inflammatory macrophages within obese adipose tissue contributes to obesity complications including insulin resistance and diabetes type
the modulation of the inflammatory state of adipose tissue macrophages has therefore been considered a possible therapeutic target to treat obesity related diseases
although adipose tissue macrophages are subject to anti inflammatory homeostatic control by sympathetic innervation experiments using adrb gene knockout mice indicate that this effect is indirectly exerted through the modulation of adipocyte function and not through direct beta adrenergic receptor activation suggesting that adrenergic stimulation of macrophages may be insufficient to impact adipose tissue inflammation or function in obesity
within the fat adipose tissue of ccr deficient mice there is an increased number of eosinophils greater alternative macrophage activation and a propensity towards type cytokine expression
furthermore this effect was exaggerated when the mice became obese from a high fat diet
this is partially caused by a phenotype switch of macrophages induced by necrosis of fat cells adipocytes
in an obese individual some adipocytes burst and undergo necrotic death which causes the residential m macrophages to switch to m phenotype
this is one of the causes of a low grade systemic chronic inflammatory state associated with obesity
though very similar in structure to tissue macrophages intestinal macrophages have evolved specific characteristics and functions given their natural environment which is in the digestive tract
macrophages and intestinal macrophages have high plasticity causing their phenotype to be altered by their environments
like macrophages intestinal macrophages are differentiated monocytes though intestinal macrophages have to coexist with the microbiome in the intestines
this is a challenge considering the bacteria found in the gut are not recognized as self and could be potential targets for phagocytosis by the macrophage
to prevent the destruction of the gut bacteria intestinal macrophages have developed key differences compared to other macrophages
primarily intestinal macrophages do not induce inflammatory responses
whereas tissue macrophages release various inflammatory cytokines such as il il and tnf intestinal macrophages do not produce or secrete inflammatory cytokines
this change is directly caused by the intestinal macrophages environment
surrounding intestinal epithelial cells release tgf which induces the change from proinflammatory macrophage to noninflammatory macrophage
even though the inflammatory response is downregulated in intestinal macrophages phagocytosis is still carried out
there is no drop off in phagocytosis efficiency as intestinal macrophages are able to effectively phagocytize the bacteria s
typhimurium and e
coli but intestinal macrophages still do not release cytokines even after phagocytosis
also intestinal macrophages do not express lipopolysaccharide lps iga or igg receptors
the lack of lps receptors is important for the gut as the intestinal macrophages do not detect the microbe associated molecular patterns mamps pamps of the intestinal microbiome
nor do they express il and il growth factor receptors
intestinal macrophages have been shown to play a role in inflammatory bowel disease ibd such as crohn s disease cd and ulcerative colitis uc
in a healthy gut intestinal macrophages limit the inflammatory response in the gut but in a disease state intestinal macrophage numbers and diversity are altered
this leads to inflammation of the gut and disease symptoms of ibd
intestinal macrophages are critical in maintaining gut homeostasis
the presence of inflammation or pathogen alters this homeostasis and concurrently alters the intestinal macrophages
there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages
