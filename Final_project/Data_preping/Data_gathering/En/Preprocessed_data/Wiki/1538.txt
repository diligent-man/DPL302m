The Book of Common Prayer BCP is the name given to a number of related prayer books used in the Anglican Communion and by other Christian churches historically related to Anglicanism The original book published in in the reign of King Edward VI of England was a product of the English Reformation following the break with Rome The work of was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English It contained Morning Prayer Evening Prayer the Litany and Holy Communion and also the occasional services in full the orders for Baptism Confirmation Marriage prayers to be said with the sick and a funeral service It also set out in full the propers that is the parts of the service which varied week by week or at times daily throughout the Church's Year the introits collects and epistle and gospel readings for the Sunday service of Holy Communion Old Testament and New Testament readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the Psalms and canticles mostly biblical that were provided to be said or sung between the readings
The book was soon succeeded by a more Reformed revision in under the same editorial hand that of Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury It was used only for a few months as after Edward VI's death in his half sister Mary I restored Roman Catholic worship Mary died in and in Elizabeth I reintroduced the book with modifications to make it acceptable to more traditionally minded worshippers and clergy
In James I ordered some further changes the most significant being the addition to the Catechism of a section on the Sacraments Following the tumultuous events surrounding the English Civil War when the Prayer Book was again abolished another modest revision was published in That edition remains the official prayer book of the Church of England although through the later twentieth century alternative forms which were technically supplements have largely displaced the Book of Common Prayer for the main Sunday worship of most English parish churches
Various permutations of the Book of Common Prayer with local variations are used in churches within and exterior to the Anglican Communion in over countries and over different languages In many of these churches the prayer book remains authoritative even if other books or patterns have replaced it in regular worship
Traditional English language Lutheran Methodist and Presbyterian prayer books have borrowed from the Book of Common Prayer and the marriage and burial rites have found their way into those of other denominations and into the English language Like the King James Version of the Bible and the works of Shakespeare many words and phrases from the Book of Common Prayer have entered common parlance
The full name of the Book of Common Prayer is The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church according to the use of the Church of England Together with the Psalter or Psalms of David pointed as they are to be Sung or said in churches And the Form and Manner of Making ordaining and Consecrating of Bishops Priests and Deacons
The forms of parish worship in the late medieval church in England which followed the Latin Roman Rite varied according to local practice By far the most common form or use found in Southern England was that of Sarum Salisbury However there was no single book the services that would be provided by the Book of Common Prayer were to be found in the Missal the Eucharist the Breviary daily offices Manual the occasional services of baptism marriage burial etc and Pontifical services appropriate to a bishop—confirmation ordination The chant plainsong plainchant for worship was contained in the Roman Gradual for the Mass the Antiphonale for the offices and the Processionale for the litanies The Book of Common Prayer has never contained prescribed music or chant however John Merbecke produced his Booke of Common Praier noted in which set what would have been the ordinary of the Mass Kyrie Gloria Creed etc in the new BCP to simple plainchant inspired by Sarum Use
The work of producing a liturgy in the English language was largely done by Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury starting cautiously in the reign of Henry VIII and then more radically under his son Edward VI In his early days Cranmer was a conservative humanist and an admirer of Erasmus After Cranmer's contacts with reformers from continental Europe helped to change his outlook The Exhortation and Litany the earliest English language service of the Church of England was the first overt manifestation of his changing views It was no mere translation from the Latin instead making its Protestant character clear by the drastic reduction of the place of saints compressing what had been the major part into three petitions Published in the Exhortation and Litany borrowed greatly from Martin Luther's Litany and Myles Coverdale's New Testament and was the only service that might be considered Protestant to have been finished within the lifetime of Henry VIII
Only after the death of Henry VIII and the accession of Edward VI in could revision of prayer books proceed faster Despite conservative opposition Parliament passed the Act of Uniformity on January and the newly authorised Book of Common Prayer BCP was required to be in use by Whitsunday Pentecost June Cranmer is credited with the overall job of editorship and the overarching structure of the book though he borrowed and adapted material from other sources
The prayer book had provisions for the daily offices Morning and Evening Prayer scripture readings for Sundays and holy days and services for Communion public baptism confirmation matrimony visitation of the sick burial purification of women upon the birth of a child and Ash Wednesday An ordinal for ordination services of bishops priests and deacons was added in There was also a calendar and lectionary which meant a Bible and a Psalter were the only other books required by a priest
The BCP represented a major theological shift in England towards Protestantism Cranmer's doctrinal concerns can be seen in the systematic amendment of source material to remove any idea that human merit contributed to an individual's salvation The doctrines of justification by faith and predestination are central to Cranmer's theology These doctrines are implicit throughout the prayer book and had important implications for his understanding of the sacraments Cranmer believed that someone who was not one of God's elect received only the outward form of the sacrament washing in baptism or eating bread in Communion but did not receive actual grace with only the elect receiving the sacramental sign and the grace Cranmer held the position that faith a gift given only to the elect united the outward sign of sacrament and its inward grace with only the unity of the two making the sacrament effective This position was in agreement with the Reformed churches but was in opposition to Roman Catholic and Lutheran views
As a compromise with conservatives the word Mass was kept with the service titled The Supper of the Lord and the Holy Communion commonly called the Mass The service also preserved much of the medieval structure of the Mass—stone altars remained the clergy wore traditional vestments much of the service was sung and the priest was instructed to put the communion wafer into communicants' mouths instead of in their hands Nevertheless the first BCP was a radical departure from traditional worship in that it eliminated almost everything that had till then been central to lay Eucharistic piety
A priority for Protestants was to replace the Roman Catholic teaching that the Mass was a sacrifice to God the very same sacrifice as that of the cross with the Protestant teaching that it was a service of thanksgiving and spiritual communion with Christ Cranmer's intention was to suppress Catholic notions of sacrifice and transubstantiation in the Mass To stress this there was no elevation of the consecrated bread and wine and eucharistic adoration was prohibited The elevation had been the central moment of the medieval Mass attached as it was to the idea of real presence Cranmer's eucharistic theology was close to the Calvinist spiritual presence view and can be described as Receptionism and Virtualism ie the real presence of Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit The words of administration in the rite were deliberately ambiguous they could be understood as identifying the bread with the body of Christ or following Cranmer's theology as a prayer that the communicant might spiritually receive the body of Christ by faith
Many of the other services were little changed Cranmer based his baptism service on Martin Luther's service which was a simplification of the long and complex medieval rite Like communion the baptism service maintained a traditional form The confirmation and marriage services followed the Sarum rite There were also remnants of prayer for the dead and the Requiem Mass such as the provision for celebrating holy communion at a funeral Cranmer's work of simplification and revision was also applied to the Daily Offices which were reduced to Morning and Evening Prayer Cranmer hoped these would also serve as a daily form of prayer to be used by the laity thus replacing both the late medieval lay observation of the Latin Hours of the Virgin and its English equivalent the Primer
The book was from the outset intended only as a temporary expedient as German reformer Bucer was assured on meeting Cranmer for the first time in April concessionsmade both as a respect for antiquity and to the infirmity of the present age as he wrote According to historian Christopher Haigh the prayer book broke decisively with the past The services for baptism confirmation communion and burial were rewritten and ceremonies hated by Protestants were removed Unlike the version the prayer book removed many traditional sacramentals and observances that reflected belief in the blessing and exorcism of people and objects In the baptism service infants no longer received minor exorcism Anointing was no longer included in the services for baptism ordination and visitation of the sick These ceremonies were altered to emphasise the importance of faith rather than trusting in rituals or objects
Many of the traditional elements of the communion service were removed in the version The name of the service was changed to The Order for the Administration of the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion removing the word Mass Stone altars were replaced with communion tables positioned in the chancel or nave with the priest standing on the north side The priest was to wear the surplice instead of traditional Mass vestments The service appears to promote a spiritual presence view of the Eucharist meaning that Christ is spiritually but not corporally present
There was controversy over how people should receive communion kneeling or seated John Knox protested against kneeling Ultimately it was decided that communicants should continue to kneel but the Privy Council ordered that the Black Rubric be added to the prayer book to clarify the purpose of kneeling The rubric denied any real and essential presence of Christ's natural flesh and blood in the Eucharist and was the clearest statement of eucharistic theology in the prayer book The service removed any reference to the body of Christ in the words of administration to reinforce the teaching that Christ's presence in the Eucharist was a spiritual presence and in the words of historian Peter Marshall limited to the subjective experience of the communicant Instead of communion wafers the prayer book instructed that ordinary bread was to be used to take away the superstition which any person hath or might have To further emphasise there was no holiness in the bread and wine any leftovers were to be taken home by the curate for ordinary consumption This prevented eucharistic adoration of the reserved sacrament above the high altar
The burial service was removed from the church It was to now take place at the graveside In there had been provision for a Requiem not so called and prayers of commendation and committal the first addressed to the deceased All that remained was a single reference to the deceased giving thanks for their delivery from 'the myseryes of this sinneful world' This new Order for the Burial of the Dead was a drastically stripped down memorial service designed to undermine definitively the whole complex of traditional Catholic beliefs about Purgatory and intercessory prayer for the dead
The Orders of Morning and Evening Prayer were extended by the inclusion of a penitential section at the beginning including a corporate confession of sin and a general absolution although the text was printed only in Morning Prayer with rubrical directions to use it in the evening as well The general pattern of Bible reading in the edition was retained as it was in except that distinct Old and New Testament readings were now specified for Morning and Evening Prayer on certain feast days Following the publication of the Prayer Book a revised English Primer was published in adapting the Offices Morning and Evening Prayer and other prayers for lay domestic piety
The book however was used only for a short period as Edward VI had died in the summer of and as soon as she could do so Mary I restored union with Rome The Latin Mass was re established altars roods and statues of saints were reinstated in an attempt to restore the English Church to its Roman affiliation Cranmer was punished for his work in the English Reformation by being burned at the stake on March Nevertheless the book was to survive After Mary's death in it became the primary source for the Elizabethan Book of Common Prayer with subtle if significant changes only
Hundreds of English Protestants fled into exile establishing an English church in Frankfurt am Main A bitter and very public dispute ensued between those such as Edmund Grindal and Richard Cox who wished to preserve in exile the exact form of worship of the Prayer Book and those such as John Knox the minister of the congregation who regarded that book as still partially tainted with compromise Eventually in the civil authorities expelled Knox and his supporters to Geneva where they adopted a new prayer book The Form of Prayers which derived principally from Calvin's French language La Forme des Prières Consequently when the accession of Elizabeth I re asserted the dominance of the Reformed Church of England there remained a significant body of more Protestant believers who were nevertheless hostile to the Book of Common Prayer John Knox took The Form of Prayers with him to Scotland where it formed the basis of the Scottish Book of Common Order
Under Elizabeth I a more permanent enforcement of the reformed Church of England was undertaken and the book was republished scarcely altered in The Prayer Book of was a masterpiece of theological engineering The doctrines in the Prayer Book and the Thirty Nine Articles of Religion as set forth in would set the tone of Anglicanism which preferred to steer a via media middle way between Lutheranism and Calvinism The conservative nature of these changes underlines the fact that Reformed principles were by no means universally popular a fact that the Queen recognised Her revived Act of Supremacy giving her the ambiguous title of supreme governor passed without difficulty but the Act of Uniformity giving statutory force to the Prayer Book passed through the House of Lords by only three votes It made constitutional history in being imposed by the laity alone as all the bishops except those imprisoned by the Queen and unable to attend voted against it Convocation had made its position clear by affirming the traditional doctrine of the Eucharist the authority of the Pope and the reservation by divine law to clergy of handling and defining concerning the things belonging to faith sacraments and discipline ecclesiastical After these innovations and reversals the new forms of Anglican worship took several decades to gain acceptance but by the end of her reign in of the English population were on board
The alterations though minor were however to cast a long shadow over the development of the Church of England It would be a long road back for the Church with no clear indication that it would retreat from the Settlement except for minor official changes In one of the first moves to undo Cranmer's liturgy the Queen insisted that the Words of Administration of Communion from the Book be placed before the Words of Administration in the Book thereby re opening the issue of the Real Presence At the administration of the Holy Communion the words from the book the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ were combined with the words of Edward VI's second Prayer Book of Take eat in remembrance suggesting on the one hand a real presence to those who wished to find it and on the other the communion as memorial only ie an objective presence and subjective reception The Prayer Book however retained the truncated Prayer of Consecration of the Communion elements which omitted any notion of objective sacrifice It was preceded by the Proper Preface and Prayer of Humble Access placed there to remove any implication that the Communion was a sacrifice to God The Prayer of Consecration was followed by Communion the Lord's Prayer and a Prayer of Thanksgiving or an optional Prayer of Oblation whose first line included a petition that God would accepte this our Sacrifice of prayse and thankes geuing The latter prayer was removed a longer version followed the Words of the Institution in the Rite to avoid any suggestion of the sacrifice of the Mass The Marian Bishop Scot opposed the Book on the grounds it never makes any connection between the bread and the Body of Christ Untrue though his accusation was the restoration of the Words of Distribution emphasized its falsity
However beginning in the th century some prominent Anglican theologians tried to cast a more traditional Catholic interpretation onto the text as a Commemorative Sacrifice and Heavenly Offering even though the words of the Rite did not support such interpretations Cranmer a good liturgist was aware that the Eucharist from the mid second century on had been regarded as the Church's offering to God but he removed the sacrificial language anyway whether under pressure or conviction It was not until the Anglican Oxford Movement of the mid th century and later th century revisions that the Church of England would attempt to deal with the eucharistic doctrines of Cranmer by bringing the Church back to pre Reformation doctrine In the meantime the Scottish and American Prayer Books not only reverted to the text but even to the older Roman and Eastern Orthodox pattern by adding the Oblation and an Epiclesis ie the congregation offers itself in union with Christ at the Consecration and receives Him in Communion while retaining the Calvinist notions of may be for us rather than become and the emphasis on bless and sanctify us the tension between the Catholic stress on objective Real Presence and Protestant subjective worthiness of the communicant However these Rites asserted a kind of Virtualism in regard to the Real Presence while making the Eucharist a material sacrifice because of the oblation and the retention of may be for us the Body and Blood of thy Savior rather than become thus eschewing any suggestion of a change in the natural substance of bread and wine
Another move the Ornaments Rubric related to what clergy were to wear while conducting services Instead of the banning of all vestments except the rochet for bishops and the surplice for parish clergy it permitted such ornamentsas were in usein the second year of King Edward VI This allowed substantial leeway for more traditionalist clergy to retain the vestments which they felt were appropriate to liturgical celebration namely Mass vestments such as albs chasubles dalmatics copes stoles maniples etc at least until the Queen gave further instructions as per the text of the Act of Uniformity of The rubric also stated that the Communion service should be conducted in the 'accustomed place' namely facing a Table against the wall with the priest facing it The rubric was placed at the section regarding Morning and Evening Prayer in this Prayer Book and in the and Books It was to be the basis of claims in the th century that vestments such as chasubles albs and stoles were canonically permitted
The instruction to the congregation to kneel when receiving communion was retained but the Black Rubric in the Forty Two Articles of Faith which were later reduced to which denied any real and essential presence of Christ's flesh and blood was removed to conciliate traditionalists and aligned with the Queen's sensibilities The removal of the Black Rubric complements the double set of Words of Administration at the time of communion and permits an action — kneeling to receive — which people were used to doing Therefore nothing at all was stated in the Prayer Book about a theory of the Presence or forbidding reverence or adoration of Christ via the bread and wine in the Sacrament On this issue however the Prayer Book was at odds with the repudiation of transubstantiation and the forbidden carrying about of the Blessed Sacrament in the Thirty Nine Articles As long as one did not subscribe publicly to or assert the latter one was left to hold whatever opinion one wanted on the former The Queen herself was famous for saying she was not interested in looking in the windows of men's souls
Among Cranmer's innovations retained in the new Prayer Book was the requirement of weekly Holy Communion services In practice as before the English Reformation many received communion rarely as little as once a year in some cases George Herbert estimated it at no more than six times per year Practice however varied from place to place Very high attendance at festivals was the order of the day in many parishes and in some regular communion was very popular in other places families stayed away or sent a servant to be the liturgical representative of their household Few parish clergy were initially licensed by the bishops to preach in the absence of a licensed preacher Sunday services were required to be accompanied by reading one of the homilies written by Cranmer George Herbert was however not alone in his enthusiasm for preaching which he regarded as one of the prime functions of a parish priest Music was much simplified and a radical distinction developed between on the one hand parish worship where only the metrical psalms of Sternhold and Hopkins might be sung and on the other hand worship in churches with organs and surviving choral foundations where the music of John Marbeck and others was developed into a rich choral tradition The whole act of parish worship might take well over two hours and accordingly churches were equipped with pews in which households could sit together whereas in the medieval church men and women had worshipped separately Diarmaid MacCulloch describes the new act of worship as a morning marathon of prayer scripture reading and praise consisting of mattins litany and ante communion preferably as the matrix for a sermon to proclaim the message of scripture anew week by week
Many ordinary churchgoers — that is those who could afford one as it was expensive — would own a copy of the Prayer Book Judith Maltby cites a story of parishioners at Flixton in Suffolk who brought their own Prayer Books to church in order to shame their vicar into conforming with it They eventually ousted him Between and roughly editions of the Prayer Book were produced Before the end of the English Civil War and the introduction of the prayer book something like a half a million prayer books are estimated to have been in circulation
The Book of Common Prayer was also translated into other languages within the English sphere of influence A retranslation into Latin was made in the form of Walter Haddon's Liber Precum Publicarum of It was destined for use in the English universities The Welsh edition of the Book of Common Prayer for use in the Church in Wales was published in It was translated by William Salesbury assisted by Richard Davies
On Elizabeth's death in the book substantially that of which had been regarded as offensive by some such as Bishop Stephen Gardiner as being a break with the tradition of the Western Church had come to be regarded in some quarters as unduly Catholic On his accession and following the so called Millenary Petition James I called the Hampton Court Conference in —the same meeting of bishops and Puritan divines that initiated the Authorized King James Version of the Bible This was in effect a series of two conferences i between James and the bishops ii between James and the Puritans on the following day The Puritans raised four areas of concern purity of doctrine the means of maintaining it church government and the Book of Common Prayer Confirmation the cross in baptism private baptism the use of the surplice kneeling for communion reading the Apocrypha and subscription to the BCP and Articles were all touched on On the third day after James had received a report back from the bishops and made final modifications he announced his decisions to the Puritans and bishops
The business of making the changes was then entrusted to a small committee of bishops and the Privy Council and apart from tidying up details this committee introduced into Morning and Evening Prayer a prayer for the Royal Family added several thanksgivings to the Occasional Prayers at the end of the Litany altered the rubrics of Private Baptism limiting it to the minister of the parish or some other lawful minister but still allowing it in private houses the Puritans had wanted it only in the church and added to the Catechism the section on the sacraments The changes were put into effect by means of an explanation issued by James in the exercise of his prerogative under the terms of the Act of Uniformity and Act of Supremacy
The accession of Charles I brought about a complete change in the religious scene in that the new king used his supremacy over the established church to promote his own idiosyncratic style of sacramental Kingship which was a very weird aberration from the first hundred years of the early reformed Church of England He questioned the populist and parliamentary basis of the Reformation Church and unsettled to a great extent the consensual accommodation of Anglicanism and this led to the Civil War and republican Commonwealthref
With the defeat of Charles I in the Civil War the Puritan pressure exercised through a much changed Parliament had increased Puritan inspired petitions for the removal of the prayer book and episcopacy root and branch resulted in local disquiet in many places and eventually the production of locally organised counter petitions The parliamentary government had its way but it became clear that the division was not between Catholics and Protestants but between Puritans and those who valued the Elizabethan settlement The book was finally outlawed by Parliament in to be replaced by the Directory of Public Worship which was more a set of instructions than a prayer book How widely the Directory was used is not certain there is some evidence of its having been purchased in churchwardens' accounts but not widely The Prayer Book certainly was used clandestinely in some places not least because the Directory made no provision at all for burial services Following the execution of Charles I in and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Lord Protector Cromwell it would not be reinstated until shortly after the restoration of the monarchy to England
John Evelyn records in Diary receiving communion according to the Prayer Book rite
Christmas Day I went to London with my wife to celebrate Christmas Day Sermon ended as the minister was giving us the holy sacrament the chapel was surrounded with soldiers and all the communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them some in the house others carried away These wretched miscreants held their muskets against us as we came up to receive the sacred elements as if they would have shot us at the altarIn the Scots Protestant lords had adopted the English Prayer Book of for reformed worship in Scotland However when John Knox returned to Scotland in he continued to use the Form of Prayer he had created for the English exiles in Geneva and in this supplanted the Book of Common Prayer under the title of the Book of Common Order
Following the accession of King James VI of Scotland to the throne of England his son King Charles I with the assistance of Archbishop Laud sought to impose the prayer book on Scotland The book concerned was not however the book but one much closer to that of the first book of Edward VI First used in it was never accepted having been violently rejected by the Scots During one reading of the book at the Holy Communion in St Giles' Cathedral the Bishop of Brechin was forced to protect himself while reading from the book by pointing loaded pistols at the congregation Following the Wars of the Three Kingdoms including the English Civil War the Church of Scotland was re established on a presbyterian basis but by the Act of Comprehension the rump of Episcopalians were allowed to hold onto their benefices For liturgy they looked to Laud's book and in the first of the wee bookies was published containing for the sake of economy the central part of the Communion liturgy beginning with the offertory
Between then and when a more formal revised version was published a number of things happened which were to separate the Scottish Episcopal liturgy more firmly from either the English books of or First informal changes were made to the order of the various parts of the service and inserting words indicating a sacrificial intent to the Eucharist clearly evident in the words we thy humble servants do celebrate and make before thy Divine Majesty with these thy holy gifts which we now OFFER unto thee the memorial thy Son has commandeth us to make secondly as a result of Bishop Rattray's researches into the liturgies of St James and St Clement published in the form of the invocation was changed These changes were incorporated into the book which was to be the liturgy of the Scottish Episcopal Church until when it was revised but it was to influence the liturgy of the Episcopal Church in the United States A new revision was finished in the Scottish Prayer Book and several alternative orders of the Communion service and other services have been prepared since then
The Prayer Book was printed two years after the restoration of the monarchy following the Savoy Conference between representative Presbyterians and twelve bishops which was convened by Royal Warrant to advise upon and review the Book of Common Prayer Attempts by the Presbyterians led by Richard Baxter to gain approval for an alternative service book failed Their major objections exceptions were firstly that it was improper for lay people to take any vocal part in prayer as in the Litany or Lord's Prayer other than to say amen secondly that no set prayer should exclude the option of an extempore alternative from the minister thirdly that the minister should have the option to omit part of the set liturgy at his discretion fourthly that short collects should be replaced by longer prayers and exhortations and fifthly that all surviving Catholic ceremonial should be removed The intent behind these suggested changes was to achieve a greater correspondence between liturgy and Scripture The bishops gave a frosty reply They declared that liturgy could not be circumscribed by Scripture but rightfully included those matters which were generally received in the Catholic church They rejected extempore prayer as apt to be filled with idle impertinent ridiculous sometimes seditious impious and blasphemous expressions The notion that the Prayer Book was defective because it dealt in generalisations brought the crisp response that such expressions were the perfection of the liturgy
The Savoy Conference ended in disagreement late in July but the initiative in prayer book revision had already passed to the Convocations and from there to Parliament The Convocations made some changes mostly of details which were far from partisan or extreme However Edwards states that more of the changes suggested by high Anglicans were implemented though by no means all and Spurr comments that except in the case of the Ordinal the suggestions of the Laudians Cosin and Matthew Wren were not taken up possibly due to the influence of moderates such as Sanderson and Reynolds For example the inclusion in the intercessions of the Communion rite of prayer for the dead was proposed and rejected The introduction of Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here in earth remained unaltered and only a thanksgiving for those departed this life in thy faith and fear was inserted to introduce the petition that the congregation might be given grace so to follow their good examples that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly kingdom Griffith Thomas commented that the retention of the words militant here in earth defines the scope of this petition we pray for ourselves we thank God for them and adduces collateral evidence to this end Secondly an attempt was made to restore the Offertory This was achieved by the insertion of the words and oblations into the prayer for the Church and the revision of the rubric so as to require the monetary offerings to be brought to the table instead of being put in the poor box and the bread and wine placed upon the table Previously it had not been clear when and how bread and wine got onto the altar The so called manual acts whereby the priest took the bread and the cup during the prayer of consecration which had been deleted in were restored and an amen was inserted after the words of institution and before communion hence separating the connections between consecration and communion which Cranmer had tried to make After communion the unused but consecrated bread and wine were to be reverently consumed in church rather than being taken away for the priest's own use By such subtle means were Cranmer's purposes further confused leaving it for generations to argue over the precise theology of the rite One change made that constituted a concession to the Presbyterian Exceptions was the updating and re insertion of the so called Black Rubric which had been removed in This now declared that kneeling in order to receive communion did not imply adoration of the species of the Eucharist nor to any Corporal Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood—which according to the rubric were in heaven not here
While intended to create unity the division established under the Commonwealth and the licence given by the Directory for Public Worship were not easily passed by Unable to accept the new book ministers were deprived The actual language of the revision was little changed from that of Cranmer With two exceptions some words and phrases which had become archaic were modernised secondly the readings for the epistle and gospel at Holy Communion which had been set out in full since were now set to the text of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible The Psalter which had not been printed in the or books—was in provided in Miles Coverdale's translation from the Great Bible of
It was this edition which was to be the official Book of Common Prayer during the growth of the British Empire and as a result has been a great influence on the prayer books of Anglican churches worldwide liturgies of other denominations in English and of the English people and language as a whole
Between and the th century further attempts to revise the Book in England stalled On the death of Charles II his brother James a Roman Catholic became James II James wished to achieve toleration for those of his own Roman Catholic faith whose practices were still banned This however drew the Presbyterians closer to the Church of England in their common desire to resist 'popery' talk of reconciliation and liturgical compromise was thus in the air But with the flight of James in and the arrival of the Calvinist William of Orange the position of the parties changed The Presbyterians could achieve toleration of their practices without such a right being given to Roman Catholics and without therefore their having to submit to the Church of England even with a liturgy more acceptable to them They were now in a much stronger position to demand changes that were ever more radical John Tillotson Dean of Canterbury pressed the king to set up a commission to produce such a revision The so called Liturgy of Comprehension of which was the result conceded two thirds of the Presbyterian demands of but when it came to convocation the members now more fearful of William's perceived agenda did not even discuss it and its contents were for a long time not even accessible This work however did go on to influence the prayer books of many British colonies
By the th century pressures to revise the book were increasing Adherents of the Oxford Movement begun in raised questions about the relationship of the Church of England to the apostolic church and thus about its forms of worship Known as Tractarians after their production of Tracts for the Times on theological issues they advanced the case for the Church of England being essentially a part of the Western Church of which the Roman Catholic Church was the chief representative The illegal use of elements of the Roman rite the use of candles vestments and incense practices collectively known as Ritualism had become widespread and led to the establishment of a new system of discipline intending to bring the Romanisers into conformity through the Public Worship Regulation Act The Act had no effect on illegal practices five clergy were imprisoned for contempt of court and after the trial of the much loved Bishop Edward King of Lincoln it became clear that some revision of the liturgy had to be embarked upon
One branch of the Ritualism movement argued that both Romanisers and their Evangelical opponents by imitating respectively the Church of Rome and Reformed churches transgressed the Ornaments Rubric of that such Ornaments of the Church and of the Ministers thereof at all Times of their Ministration shall be retained and be in use as were in this Church of England by the Authority of Parliament in the Second Year of the Reign of King Edward the Sixth These adherents of ritualism among whom were Percy Dearmer and others claimed that the Ornaments Rubric prescribed the ritual usages of the Sarum Rite with the exception of a few minor things already abolished by the early reformation
Following a Royal Commission report in work began on a new prayer book It took twenty years to complete prolonged partly due to the demands of the First World War and partly in the light of the constitution of the Church Assembly which perhaps not unnaturally wished to do the work all over again for itself
In the work on a new version of the prayer book reached its final form In order to reduce conflict with traditionalists it was decided that the form of service to be used would be determined by each congregation With these open guidelines the book was granted approval by the Church of England Convocations and Church Assembly in July However it was defeated by the House of Commons in
The effect of the failure of the book was salutary no further attempts were made to revise the Book of Common Prayer Instead a different process that of producing an alternative book led to the publication of Series and in the s the Alternative Service Book and subsequently to the Common Worship series of books Both differ substantially from the Book of Common Prayer though the latter includes in the Order Two form of the Holy Communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service largely along the lines proposed for the Prayer Book Order One follows the pattern of the modern Liturgical Movement
With British colonial expansion from the th century onwards Anglicanism spread across the globe The new Anglican churches used and revised the use of the Book of Common Prayer until they like the English church produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the th and th centuries which come under the general heading of the Liturgical Movement
In South Africa a Book of Common Prayer was Set Forth by Authority for Use in the Church of the Province of South Africa in The prayer book is still in use in some churches in southern Africa however it has been largely replaced by An Anglican Prayerbook and its translations to the other languages in use in southern Africa
The Book of Common Prayer is translated literally as in Chinese Mandarin Gōng dǎo shū Cantonese Gūng tóu syū The former dioceses in the now defunct Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui had their own Book of Common Prayer The General Synod and the College of Bishops of Chung Hwa Sheng Kung Hui planned to publish a unified version for the use of all Anglican churches in China in which was the th anniversary of the first publishing of the Book of Common Prayer After the communists took over mainland China the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao became independent of the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui and continued to use the edition issued in Shanghai in with a revision in This edition also called the Black Cover Book of Common Prayer for its cover still remains in use after the establishment of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Anglican province in Hong Kong The language style of Black Cover Book of Common Prayer is closer to Classical Chinese than contemporary Chinese
The Church of South India was the first modern Episcopal uniting church consisting as it did from its foundation in at the time of Indian independence of Anglicans Methodists Congregationalists Presbyterians and Reformed Christians Its liturgy from the first combined the free use of Cranmer's language with an adherence to the principles of congregational participation and the centrality of the Eucharist much in line with the Liturgical Movement Because it was a minority church of widely differing traditions in a non Christian culture except in Kerala where Christianity has a long history practice varied wildly
The BCP is called Kitōsho Japanese in Japanese The initial effort to compile such a book in Japanese goes back to when the missionary societies of the Church of England and of the Episcopal Church of the United States started their work in Japan later joined by the Anglican Church of Canada in In the Seikōkai Tō Bun Japanese Anglican Prayer Texts were prepared in Japanese As the Anglican Church in Japan was established in the Romanized Nippon Seikōkai Kitō Bun Japanese were compiled in There was a major revision of these texts and the first Kitōsho was born in which had the Eucharistic part in both English and American traditions There were further revisions and the Kitōsho published in was the last revision that was done before the World War II still using the Historical kana orthography

As for other parts of the British Empire the Book of Common Prayer was initially the standard of worship for Anglicans in New Zealand The Book was first translated into Maori in and has gone through several translations and a number of different editions since then The translated BCP has commonly been called Te Rawiri the David reflecting the prominence of the Psalter in the services of Morning and Evening Prayer as the Maori often looked for words to be attributed to a person of authority The Maori translation of the BCP is still used in New Zealand particularly among older Maori living in rural areas
After earlier trial services in the mid twentieth century in the Anglican Church of Aotearoa New Zealand and Polynesia authorised through its general synod A New Zealand Prayer Book He Karakia Mihinare o Aotearoa intended to serve the needs of New Zealand Fiji Tonga Samoa and the Cook Island Anglicans This book is unusual for its cultural diversity it includes passages in the Maori Fijian Tongan and English languages In other respects it reflects the same ecumenical influence of the Liturgical Movement as in other new Anglican books of the period and borrows freely from a variety of international sources The book is not presented as a definitive or final liturgical authority such as the use of the definite article in the title might have implied While the preface is ambiguous regarding the status of older forms and books the implication however is that this book is now the norm of worship for Anglicans in AotearoaNew Zealand The book has also been revised in a number of minor ways since the initial publication such as by the inclusion of the Revised Common Lectionary and an online edition is offered freely as the standard for reference
The Anglican Church of Australia known officially until as the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania became self governing in Its general synod agreed that the Book of Common Prayer was to be regarded as the authorised standard of worship and doctrine in this Church After a series of experimental services offered in many dioceses during the s and s in An Australian Prayer Book was produced formally as a supplement to the book of although in fact it was widely taken up in place of the old book The AAPB sought to adhere to the principle that where the liturgical committee could not agree on a formulation the words or expressions of the Book of Common Prayer were to be used if in a modern idiom The result was a conservative revision including two forms of eucharistic rite a First Order that was essentially the rite in more contemporary language and a Second Order that reflected the Liturgical Movement norms but without elements such as a eucharistic epiclesis or other features that would have represented a departure from the doctrine of the old book An Australian Prayer Book has been formally accepted for usage in other churches including the Reformed Episcopal Church in the United States
A Prayer Book for Australia produced in and again not technically a substitute for the prayer book nevertheless departed from both the structure and wording of the Book of Common Prayer prompting conservative reaction Numerous objections were made and the notably conservative evangelical Diocese of Sydney drew attention both to the loss of BCP wording and of an explicit biblical doctrine of substitutionary atonement Sydney delegates to the general synod sought and obtained various concessions but that diocese never adopted the book The Diocese of Sydney has instead developed its own prayer book called Sunday Services to supplement the prayer book which as elsewhere in Australia is rarely used and preserve the original theology which the Sydney diocese asserts has been changed In the diocese published Better Gatherings which includes the book Common Prayer published an updated revision of Sunday Services
The Anglican Church of Canada which until was known as the Church of England in the Dominion of Canada or simply the Church of England in Canada developed its first Book of Common Prayer separately from the English version in which received final authorisation from General Synod on April The revision of was much more substantial bearing a family relationship to that of the abortive book in England The language was conservatively modernised and additional seasonal material was added As in England while many prayers were retained though the structure of the Communion service was altered a prayer of oblation was added to the eucharistic prayer after the words of institution thus reflecting the rejection of Cranmer's theology in liturgical developments across the Anglican Communion More controversially the Psalter omitted certain sections including the entirety of Psalm General Synod gave final authorisation to the revision in to coincide with the th anniversary of the Book of Common Prayer A French translation Le Recueil des Prières de la Communauté Chrétienne was published in

The Episcopal Church separated itself from the Church of England in the first church in the American colonies having been founded in The first Book of Common Prayer of the new body approved in had as its main source the English book with significant influence also from the Scottish Liturgy see above which Bishop Seabury of Connecticut brought to the USA following his consecration in Aberdeen in
The preface to the Book of Common Prayer says this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine discipline or worshipfurther than local circumstances require There were some notable differences For example in the Communion service the prayer of consecration follows mainly the Scottish orders derived from and found in the Book of Common Prayer The compilers also used other materials derived from ancient liturgies especially Eastern Orthodox ones such as the Liturgy of St James An epiclesis or invocation of the Holy Spirit in the eucharistic prayer was included as in the Scottish book though modified to meet reformist objections Overall however the book was modelled on the English Prayer Book the Convention having resisted attempts at more radical deletion and revision

Under Pope John Paul II's Pastoral Provision of the early s former Anglicans began to be admitted into new Anglican Use parishes in the US The Book of Divine Worship was published in the United States in as a liturgical book for their use composed of material drawn from the and Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and the Roman Missal It was mandated for use in all personal ordinariates for former Anglicans in the US from Advent Following the adoption of the ordinariates' Divine Worship The Missal in Advent the Book of Divine Worship was suppressed
To complement the upcoming Divine Worship missal the newly erected Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham in the UK authorised the usage of an interim Anglican Use Divine Office in The Customary of Our Lady of Walsingham followed from both the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer tradition and that of the Catholic Church's Liturgy of the Hours introducing hours Terce Sext and None not found in any standard Book of Common Prayer Unlike other contemporary forms of the Catholic Divine Office the Customary contained the full Psalm psalter
In the St Gregory's Prayer Book was published by Ignatius Press as a resource for all Catholic laity combining selections from the Divine Worship missal with devotions drawn from various Anglican prayer books and other Anglican sources approved for Catholic use in a format that somewhat mimics the form and content of the Book of Common Prayer
In the first of two editions of Divine Worship Daily Office was published While the North American Edition was the first Divine Office introduced in the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter the Commonwealth Edition succeeded the previous Customary for the Personal Ordinariates of Our Lady of Walsingham and Our Lady of the Southern Cross The North American Edition more closely follows the American American and Canadian prayer books while the Commonwealth Edition more closely follows the precedents set by the Church of England's and Book of Common Prayer
The Book of Common Prayer has had a great influence on a number of other denominations While theologically different the language and flow of the service of many other churches owe a great debt to the prayer book In particular many Christian prayer books have drawn on the Collects for the Sundays of the Church Year—mostly freely translated or even rethought by Cranmer from a wide range of Christian traditions but including a number of original compositions—which are widely recognised as masterpieces of compressed liturgical construction
John Wesley an Anglican priest whose revivalist preaching led to the creation of Methodism wrote in his preface to The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America I believe there is no Liturgy in the world either in ancient or modern language which breathes more of a solid scriptural rational piety than the Common Prayer of the Church of England Many Methodist churches in England and the United States continued to use a slightly revised version of the book for communion services well into the th century In the United Methodist Church the liturgy for eucharistic celebrations is almost identical to what is found in the Book of Common Prayer as are some of the other liturgies and services
A unique variant was developed in in Boston Massachusetts when the historic King's Chapel founded left the Episcopal Church and became an independent Unitarian church To this day King's Chapel uniquely uses The Book of Common Prayer According to the Use in King's Chapel in its worship the book eliminates trinitarian references and statements
Together with the King James Version of the Bible and the works of Shakespeare the Book of Common Prayer has been one of the three fundamental underpinnings of modern English As it has been in regular use for centuries many phrases from its services have passed into everyday English either as deliberate quotations or as unconscious borrowings They have often been used metaphorically in non religious contexts and authors have used phrases from the prayer book as titles for their books
Some examples of well known phrases from the Book of Common Prayer are
Speak now or forever hold your peace from the marriage liturgy
Till death us do part from the marriage liturgy
Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust from the funeral service
In the midst of life we are in death from the committal in the service for the burial of the dead first rite
From all the deceits of the world the flesh and the devil from the litany
Read mark learn and inwardly digest from the collect for the second Sunday of Advent
Evil liver from the rubrics for Holy Communion
All sorts and conditions of men from the Order for Morning Prayer
Peace in our time from Morning Prayer VersiclesReferences and allusions to Prayer Book services in the works of Shakespeare were tracked down and identified by Richmond Noble Derision of the Prayer Book or its contents in any interludes plays songs rhymes or by other open words was a criminal offence under the Act of Uniformity and consequently Shakespeare avoids too direct reference but Noble particularly identifies the reading of the Psalter according to the Great Bible version specified in the Prayer Book as the biblical book generating the largest number of Biblical references in Shakespeare's plays Noble found a total of allusions to the Psalms in the plays of the First Folio relating to separate Psalms—all save one of which he linked to the version in the Psalter rather than those in the Geneva Bible or Bishops' Bible In addition there are a small number of direct allusions to liturgical texts in the Prayer Book eg Henry VIII where Wolsey states Vain Pomp and Glory of this World I hate ye a clear reference to the rite of Public Baptism where the Godparents are asked Doest thou forsake the vaine pompe and glory of the worlde
As novelist P D James observed We can recognize the Prayer Book's cadences in the works of Isaac Walton and John Bunyan in the majestic phrases of John Milton Sir Thomas Browne and Edward Gibbon We can see its echo in the works of such very different writers as Daniel Defoe Thackeray the Brontës Coleridge T S Eliot and even Dorothy L Sayers James herself used phrases from the Book of Common Prayer and made them into best selling titles Devices and Desires and The Children of Men while Alfonso Cuarón's film Children of Men placed the phrase onto cinema marquees worldwide
In England there are only three bodies entitled to print the Book of Common Prayer the two privileged presses Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press and The Queen's Printer Cambridge University Press holds letters patent as The Queen's Printer and so two of these three bodies are the same The Latin term cum privilegio with privilege is printed on the title pages of Cambridge editions of the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible to denote the charter authority or privilege under which they are published
The primary function for Cambridge University Press in its role as Queen's Printer is preserving the integrity of the text continuing a long standing tradition and reputation for textual scholarship and accuracy of printing Cambridge University Press has stated that as a university press a charitable enterprise devoted to the advancement of learning it has no desire to restrict artificially that advancement and that commercial restrictiveness through a partial monopoly is not part of its purpose It therefore grants permission to use the text and licence printing or the importation for sale within the UK as long as it is assured of acceptable quality and accuracy
