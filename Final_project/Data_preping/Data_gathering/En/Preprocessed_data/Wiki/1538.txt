the book of common prayer bcp is the name given to a number of related prayer books used in the anglican communion and by other christian churches historically related to anglicanism
the original book published in in the reign of king edward vi of england was a product of the english reformation following the break with rome
the work of was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and sunday worship in english
it contained morning prayer evening prayer the litany and holy communion and also the occasional services in full the orders for baptism confirmation marriage prayers to be said with the sick and a funeral service
it also set out in full the propers that is the parts of the service which varied week by week or at times daily throughout the church s year the introits collects and epistle and gospel readings for the sunday service of holy communion
old testament and new testament readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the psalms and canticles mostly biblical that were provided to be said or sung between the readings
the book was soon succeeded by a more reformed revision in under the same editorial hand that of thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury
it was used only for a few months as after edward vi s death in his half sister mary i restored roman catholic worship
mary died in and in elizabeth i reintroduced the book with modifications to make it acceptable to more traditionally minded worshippers and clergy
in james i ordered some further changes the most significant being the addition to the catechism of a section on the sacraments
following the tumultuous events surrounding the english civil war when the prayer book was again abolished another modest revision was published in
that edition remains the official prayer book of the church of england although through the later twentieth century alternative forms which were technically supplements have largely displaced the book of common prayer for the main sunday worship of most english parish churches
various permutations of the book of common prayer with local variations are used in churches within and exterior to the anglican communion in over countries and over different languages
in many of these churches the prayer book remains authoritative even if other books or patterns have replaced it in regular worship
traditional english language lutheran methodist and presbyterian prayer books have borrowed from the book of common prayer and the marriage and burial rites have found their way into those of other denominations and into the english language
like the king james version of the bible and the works of shakespeare many words and phrases from the book of common prayer have entered common parlance
the full name of the book of common prayer is the book of common prayer and administration of the sacraments and other rites and ceremonies of the church according to the use of the church of england together with the psalter or psalms of david pointed as they are to be sung or said in churches and the form and manner of making ordaining and consecrating of bishops priests and deacons
the forms of parish worship in the late medieval church in england which followed the latin roman rite varied according to local practice
by far the most common form or use found in southern england was that of sarum salisbury
however there was no single book the services that would be provided by the book of common prayer were to be found in the missal the eucharist the breviary daily offices manual the occasional services of baptism marriage burial etc and pontifical services appropriate to a bishop confirmation ordination
the chant plainsong plainchant for worship was contained in the roman gradual for the mass the antiphonale for the offices and the processionale for the litanies
the book of common prayer has never contained prescribed music or chant however john merbecke produced his booke of common praier noted in which set what would have been the ordinary of the mass kyrie gloria creed etc in the new bcp to simple plainchant inspired by sarum use
the work of producing a liturgy in the english language was largely done by thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury starting cautiously in the reign of henry viii and then more radically under his son edward vi
in his early days cranmer was a conservative humanist and an admirer of erasmus
after cranmer s contacts with reformers from continental europe helped to change his outlook
the exhortation and litany the earliest english language service of the church of england was the first overt manifestation of his changing views
it was no mere translation from the latin instead making its protestant character clear by the drastic reduction of the place of saints compressing what had been the major part into three petitions
published in the exhortation and litany borrowed greatly from martin luther s litany and myles coverdale s new testament and was the only service that might be considered protestant to have been finished within the lifetime of henry viii
only after the death of henry viii and the accession of edward vi in could revision of prayer books proceed faster
despite conservative opposition parliament passed the act of uniformity on january and the newly authorised book of common prayer bcp was required to be in use by whitsunday pentecost june
cranmer is credited with the overall job of editorship and the overarching structure of the book though he borrowed and adapted material from other sources
the prayer book had provisions for the daily offices morning and evening prayer scripture readings for sundays and holy days and services for communion public baptism confirmation matrimony visitation of the sick burial purification of women upon the birth of a child and ash wednesday
an ordinal for ordination services of bishops priests and deacons was added in
there was also a calendar and lectionary which meant a bible and a psalter were the only other books required by a priest
the bcp represented a major theological shift in england towards protestantism
cranmer s doctrinal concerns can be seen in the systematic amendment of source material to remove any idea that human merit contributed to an individual s salvation
the doctrines of justification by faith and predestination are central to cranmer s theology
these doctrines are implicit throughout the prayer book and had important implications for his understanding of the sacraments
cranmer believed that someone who was not one of god s elect received only the outward form of the sacrament washing in baptism or eating bread in communion but did not receive actual grace with only the elect receiving the sacramental sign and the grace
cranmer held the position that faith a gift given only to the elect united the outward sign of sacrament and its inward grace with only the unity of the two making the sacrament effective
this position was in agreement with the reformed churches but was in opposition to roman catholic and lutheran views
as a compromise with conservatives the word mass was kept with the service titled the supper of the lord and the holy communion commonly called the mass
the service also preserved much of the medieval structure of the mass stone altars remained the clergy wore traditional vestments much of the service was sung and the priest was instructed to put the communion wafer into communicants mouths instead of in their hands
nevertheless the first bcp was a radical departure from traditional worship in that it eliminated almost everything that had till then been central to lay eucharistic piety
a priority for protestants was to replace the roman catholic teaching that the mass was a sacrifice to god the very same sacrifice as that of the cross with the protestant teaching that it was a service of thanksgiving and spiritual communion with christ
cranmer s intention was to suppress catholic notions of sacrifice and transubstantiation in the mass
to stress this there was no elevation of the consecrated bread and wine and eucharistic adoration was prohibited
the elevation had been the central moment of the medieval mass attached as it was to the idea of real presence
cranmer s eucharistic theology was close to the calvinist spiritual presence view and can be described as receptionism and virtualism i e
the real presence of jesus by the power of the holy spirit
the words of administration in the rite were deliberately ambiguous they could be understood as identifying the bread with the body of christ or following cranmer s theology as a prayer that the communicant might spiritually receive the body of christ by faith
many of the other services were little changed
cranmer based his baptism service on martin luther s service which was a simplification of the long and complex medieval rite
like communion the baptism service maintained a traditional form
the confirmation and marriage services followed the sarum rite
there were also remnants of prayer for the dead and the requiem mass such as the provision for celebrating holy communion at a funeral
cranmer s work of simplification and revision was also applied to the daily offices which were reduced to morning and evening prayer
cranmer hoped these would also serve as a daily form of prayer to be used by the laity thus replacing both the late medieval lay observation of the latin hours of the virgin and its english equivalent the primer
the book was from the outset intended only as a temporary expedient as german reformer bucer was assured on meeting cranmer for the first time in april concessions made both as a respect for antiquity and to the infirmity of the present age as he wrote
according to historian christopher haigh the prayer book broke decisively with the past
the services for baptism confirmation communion and burial were rewritten and ceremonies hated by protestants were removed
unlike the version the prayer book removed many traditional sacramentals and observances that reflected belief in the blessing and exorcism of people and objects
in the baptism service infants no longer received minor exorcism
anointing was no longer included in the services for baptism ordination and visitation of the sick
these ceremonies were altered to emphasise the importance of faith rather than trusting in rituals or objects
many of the traditional elements of the communion service were removed in the version
the name of the service was changed to the order for the administration of the lord s supper or holy communion removing the word mass
stone altars were replaced with communion tables positioned in the chancel or nave with the priest standing on the north side
the priest was to wear the surplice instead of traditional mass vestments
the service appears to promote a spiritual presence view of the eucharist meaning that christ is spiritually but not corporally present
there was controversy over how people should receive communion kneeling or seated
john knox protested against kneeling
ultimately it was decided that communicants should continue to kneel but the privy council ordered that the black rubric be added to the prayer book to clarify the purpose of kneeling
the rubric denied any real and essential presence
of christ s natural flesh and blood in the eucharist and was the clearest statement of eucharistic theology in the prayer book
the service removed any reference to the body of christ in the words of administration to reinforce the teaching that christ s presence in the eucharist was a spiritual presence and in the words of historian peter marshall limited to the subjective experience of the communicant
instead of communion wafers the prayer book instructed that ordinary bread was to be used to take away the superstition which any person hath or might have
to further emphasise there was no holiness in the bread and wine any leftovers were to be taken home by the curate for ordinary consumption
this prevented eucharistic adoration of the reserved sacrament above the high altar
the burial service was removed from the church
it was to now take place at the graveside
in there had been provision for a requiem not so called and prayers of commendation and committal the first addressed to the deceased
all that remained was a single reference to the deceased giving thanks for their delivery from the myseryes of this sinneful world this new order for the burial of the dead was a drastically stripped down memorial service designed to undermine definitively the whole complex of traditional catholic beliefs about purgatory and intercessory prayer for the dead
the orders of morning and evening prayer were extended by the inclusion of a penitential section at the beginning including a corporate confession of sin and a general absolution although the text was printed only in morning prayer with rubrical directions to use it in the evening as well
the general pattern of bible reading in the edition was retained as it was in except that distinct old and new testament readings were now specified for morning and evening prayer on certain feast days
following the publication of the prayer book a revised english primer was published in adapting the offices morning and evening prayer and other prayers for lay domestic piety
the book however was used only for a short period as edward vi had died in the summer of and as soon as she could do so mary i restored union with rome
the latin mass was re established altars roods and statues of saints were reinstated in an attempt to restore the english church to its roman affiliation
cranmer was punished for his work in the english reformation by being burned at the stake on march
nevertheless the book was to survive
after mary s death in it became the primary source for the elizabethan book of common prayer with subtle if significant changes only
hundreds of english protestants fled into exile establishing an english church in frankfurt am main
a bitter and very public dispute ensued between those such as edmund grindal and richard cox who wished to preserve in exile the exact form of worship of the prayer book and those such as john knox the minister of the congregation who regarded that book as still partially tainted with compromise
eventually in the civil authorities expelled knox and his supporters to geneva where they adopted a new prayer book the form of prayers which derived principally from calvin s french language la forme des pri res
consequently when the accession of elizabeth i re asserted the dominance of the reformed church of england there remained a significant body of more protestant believers who were nevertheless hostile to the book of common prayer
john knox took the form of prayers with him to scotland where it formed the basis of the scottish book of common order
under elizabeth i a more permanent enforcement of the reformed church of england was undertaken and the book was republished scarcely altered in
the prayer book of was a masterpiece of theological engineering the doctrines in the prayer book and the thirty nine articles of religion as set forth in would set the tone of anglicanism which preferred to steer a via media middle way between lutheranism and calvinism
the conservative nature of these changes underlines the fact that reformed principles were by no means universally popular a fact that the queen recognised
her revived act of supremacy giving her the ambiguous title of supreme governor passed without difficulty but the act of uniformity giving statutory force to the prayer book passed through the house of lords by only three votes
it made constitutional history in being imposed by the laity alone as all the bishops except those imprisoned by the queen and unable to attend voted against it
convocation had made its position clear by affirming the traditional doctrine of the eucharist the authority of the pope and the reservation by divine law to clergy of handling and defining concerning the things belonging to faith sacraments and discipline ecclesiastical after these innovations and reversals the new forms of anglican worship took several decades to gain acceptance but by the end of her reign in of the english population were on board
the alterations though minor were however to cast a long shadow over the development of the church of england
it would be a long road back for the church with no clear indication that it would retreat from the settlement except for minor official changes
in one of the first moves to undo cranmer s liturgy the queen insisted that the words of administration of communion from the book be placed before the words of administration in the book thereby re opening the issue of the real presence
at the administration of the holy communion the words from the book the body of our lord jesus christ were combined with the words of edward vi s second prayer book of take eat in remembrance suggesting on the one hand a real presence to those who wished to find it and on the other the communion as memorial only i e
an objective presence and subjective reception
the prayer book however retained the truncated prayer of consecration of the communion elements which omitted any notion of objective sacrifice
it was preceded by the proper preface and prayer of humble access placed there to remove any implication that the communion was a sacrifice to god
the prayer of consecration was followed by communion the lord s prayer and a prayer of thanksgiving or an optional prayer of oblation whose first line included a petition that god would accepte this our sacrifice of prayse and thankes geuing the latter prayer was removed a longer version followed the words of the institution in the rite to avoid any suggestion of the sacrifice of the mass the marian bishop scot opposed the book on the grounds it never makes any connection between the bread and the body of christ
untrue though his accusation was the restoration of the words of distribution emphasized its falsity
however beginning in the th century some prominent anglican theologians tried to cast a more traditional catholic interpretation onto the text as a commemorative sacrifice and heavenly offering even though the words of the rite did not support such interpretations
cranmer a good liturgist was aware that the eucharist from the mid second century on had been regarded as the church s offering to god but he removed the sacrificial language anyway whether under pressure or conviction
it was not until the anglican oxford movement of the mid th century and later th century revisions that the church of england would attempt to deal with the eucharistic doctrines of cranmer by bringing the church back to pre reformation doctrine in the meantime the scottish and american prayer books not only reverted to the text but even to the older roman and eastern orthodox pattern by adding the oblation and an epiclesis i e
the congregation offers itself in union with christ at the consecration and receives him in communion while retaining the calvinist notions of may be for us rather than become and the emphasis on bless and sanctify us the tension between the catholic stress on objective real presence and protestant subjective worthiness of the communicant
however these rites asserted a kind of virtualism in regard to the real presence while making the eucharist a material sacrifice because of the oblation and the retention of may be for us the body and blood of thy savior rather than become thus eschewing any suggestion of a change in the natural substance of bread and wine
another move the ornaments rubric related to what clergy were to wear while conducting services
instead of the banning of all vestments except the rochet for bishops and the surplice for parish clergy it permitted such ornaments as were in use in the second year of king edward vi this allowed substantial leeway for more traditionalist clergy to retain the vestments which they felt were appropriate to liturgical celebration namely mass vestments such as albs chasubles dalmatics copes stoles maniples etc
at least until the queen gave further instructions as per the text of the act of uniformity of
the rubric also stated that the communion service should be conducted in the accustomed place namely facing a table against the wall with the priest facing it
the rubric was placed at the section regarding morning and evening prayer in this prayer book and in the and books
it was to be the basis of claims in the th century that vestments such as chasubles albs and stoles were canonically permitted
the instruction to the congregation to kneel when receiving communion was retained but the black rubric in the forty two articles of faith which were later reduced to which denied any real and essential presence of christ s flesh and blood was removed to conciliate traditionalists and aligned with the queen s sensibilities
the removal of the black rubric complements the double set of words of administration at the time of communion and permits an action kneeling to receive which people were used to doing
therefore nothing at all was stated in the prayer book about a theory of the presence or forbidding reverence or adoration of christ via the bread and wine in the sacrament
on this issue however the prayer book was at odds with the repudiation of transubstantiation and the forbidden carrying about of the blessed sacrament in the thirty nine articles
as long as one did not subscribe publicly to or assert the latter one was left to hold whatever opinion one wanted on the former
the queen herself was famous for saying she was not interested in looking in the windows of men s souls
among cranmer s innovations retained in the new prayer book was the requirement of weekly holy communion services
in practice as before the english reformation many received communion rarely as little as once a year in some cases george herbert estimated it at no more than six times per year
practice however varied from place to place
very high attendance at festivals was the order of the day in many parishes and in some regular communion was very popular in other places families stayed away or sent a servant to be the liturgical representative of their household few parish clergy were initially licensed by the bishops to preach in the absence of a licensed preacher sunday services were required to be accompanied by reading one of the homilies written by cranmer
george herbert was however not alone in his enthusiasm for preaching which he regarded as one of the prime functions of a parish priest
music was much simplified and a radical distinction developed between on the one hand parish worship where only the metrical psalms of sternhold and hopkins might be sung and on the other hand worship in churches with organs and surviving choral foundations where the music of john marbeck and others was developed into a rich choral tradition
the whole act of parish worship might take well over two hours and accordingly churches were equipped with pews in which households could sit together whereas in the medieval church men and women had worshipped separately
diarmaid macculloch describes the new act of worship as a morning marathon of prayer scripture reading and praise consisting of mattins litany and ante communion preferably as the matrix for a sermon to proclaim the message of scripture anew week by week
many ordinary churchgoers that is those who could afford one as it was expensive would own a copy of the prayer book
judith maltby cites a story of parishioners at flixton in suffolk who brought their own prayer books to church in order to shame their vicar into conforming with it
they eventually ousted him
between and roughly editions of the prayer book were produced
before the end of the english civil war and the introduction of the prayer book something like a half a million prayer books are estimated to have been in circulation
the book of common prayer was also translated into other languages within the english sphere of influence
a re translation into latin was made in the form of walter haddon s liber precum publicarum of
it was destined for use in the english universities
the welsh edition of the book of common prayer for use in the church in wales was published in
it was translated by william salesbury assisted by richard davies
on elizabeth s death in the book substantially that of which had been regarded as offensive by some such as bishop stephen gardiner as being a break with the tradition of the western church had come to be regarded in some quarters as unduly catholic
on his accession and following the so called millenary petition james i called the hampton court conference in the same meeting of bishops and puritan divines that initiated the authorized king james version of the bible
this was in effect a series of two conferences i between james and the bishops ii between james and the puritans on the following day
the puritans raised four areas of concern purity of doctrine the means of maintaining it church government and the book of common prayer
confirmation the cross in baptism private baptism the use of the surplice kneeling for communion reading the apocrypha and subscription to the bcp and articles were all touched on
on the third day after james had received a report back from the bishops and made final modifications he announced his decisions to the puritans and bishops
the business of making the changes was then entrusted to a small committee of bishops and the privy council and apart from tidying up details this committee introduced into morning and evening prayer a prayer for the royal family added several thanksgivings to the occasional prayers at the end of the litany altered the rubrics of private baptism limiting it to the minister of the parish or some other lawful minister but still allowing it in private houses the puritans had wanted it only in the church and added to the catechism the section on the sacraments
the changes were put into effect by means of an explanation issued by james in the exercise of his prerogative under the terms of the act of uniformity and act of supremacy
the accession of charles i brought about a complete change in the religious scene in that the new king used his supremacy over the established church to promote his own idiosyncratic style of sacramental kingship which was a very weird aberration from the first hundred years of the early reformed church of england
he questioned the populist and parliamentary basis of the reformation church and unsettled to a great extent the consensual accommodation of anglicanism
and this led to the civil war and republican commonwealth ref
with the defeat of charles i in the civil war the puritan pressure exercised through a much changed parliament had increased
puritan inspired petitions for the removal of the prayer book and episcopacy root and branch resulted in local disquiet in many places and eventually the production of locally organised counter petitions
the parliamentary government had its way but it became clear that the division was not between catholics and protestants but between puritans and those who valued the elizabethan settlement
the book was finally outlawed by parliament in to be replaced by the directory of public worship which was more a set of instructions than a prayer book
how widely the directory was used is not certain there is some evidence of its having been purchased in churchwardens accounts but not widely
the prayer book certainly was used clandestinely in some places not least because the directory made no provision at all for burial services
following the execution of charles i in and the establishment of the commonwealth under lord protector cromwell it would not be reinstated until shortly after the restoration of the monarchy to england
john evelyn records in diary receiving communion according to the prayer book rite
christmas day
i went to london with my wife to celebrate christmas day
sermon ended as the minister was giving us the holy sacrament the chapel was surrounded with soldiers and all the communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them some in the house others carried away
these wretched miscreants held their muskets against us as we came up to receive the sacred elements as if they would have shot us at the altar in the scots protestant lords had adopted the english prayer book of for reformed worship in scotland
however when john knox returned to scotland in he continued to use the form of prayer he had created for the english exiles in geneva and in this supplanted the book of common prayer under the title of the book of common order
following the accession of king james vi of scotland to the throne of england his son king charles i with the assistance of archbishop laud sought to impose the prayer book on scotland
the book concerned was not however the book but one much closer to that of the first book of edward vi
first used in it was never accepted having been violently rejected by the scots
during one reading of the book at the holy communion in st giles cathedral the bishop of brechin was forced to protect himself while reading from the book by pointing loaded pistols at the congregation
following the wars of the three kingdoms including the english civil war the church of scotland was re established on a presbyterian basis but by the act of comprehension the rump of episcopalians were allowed to hold onto their benefices
for liturgy they looked to laud s book and in the first of the wee bookies was published containing for the sake of economy the central part of the communion liturgy beginning with the offertory
between then and when a more formal revised version was published a number of things happened which were to separate the scottish episcopal liturgy more firmly from either the english books of or
first informal changes were made to the order of the various parts of the service and inserting words indicating a sacrificial intent to the eucharist clearly evident in the words we thy humble servants do celebrate and make before thy divine majesty with these thy holy gifts which we now offer unto thee the memorial thy son has commandeth us to make secondly as a result of bishop rattray s researches into the liturgies of st james and st clement published in the form of the invocation was changed
these changes were incorporated into the book which was to be the liturgy of the scottish episcopal church until when it was revised but it was to influence the liturgy of the episcopal church in the united states
a new revision was finished in the scottish prayer book and several alternative orders of the communion service and other services have been prepared since then
the prayer book was printed two years after the restoration of the monarchy following the savoy conference between representative presbyterians and twelve bishops which was convened by royal warrant to advise upon and review the book of common prayer
attempts by the presbyterians led by richard baxter to gain approval for an alternative service book failed
their major objections exceptions were firstly that it was improper for lay people to take any vocal part in prayer as in the litany or lord s prayer other than to say amen secondly that no set prayer should exclude the option of an extempore alternative from the minister thirdly that the minister should have the option to omit part of the set liturgy at his discretion fourthly that short collects should be replaced by longer prayers and exhortations and fifthly that all surviving catholic ceremonial should be removed
the intent behind these suggested changes was to achieve a greater correspondence between liturgy and scripture
the bishops gave a frosty reply
they declared that liturgy could not be circumscribed by scripture but rightfully included those matters which were generally received in the catholic church they rejected extempore prayer as apt to be filled with idle impertinent ridiculous sometimes seditious impious and blasphemous expressions the notion that the prayer book was defective because it dealt in generalisations brought the crisp response that such expressions were the perfection of the liturgy
the savoy conference ended in disagreement late in july but the initiative in prayer book revision had already passed to the convocations and from there to parliament
the convocations made some changes mostly of details which were far from partisan or extreme
however edwards states that more of the changes suggested by high anglicans were implemented though by no means all and spurr comments that except in the case of the ordinal the suggestions of the laudians cosin and matthew wren were not taken up possibly due to the influence of moderates such as sanderson and reynolds
for example the inclusion in the intercessions of the communion rite of prayer for the dead was proposed and rejected
the introduction of let us pray for the whole state of christ s church militant here in earth remained unaltered and only a thanksgiving for those departed this life in thy faith and fear was inserted to introduce the petition that the congregation might be given grace so to follow their good examples that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly kingdom
griffith thomas commented that the retention of the words militant here in earth defines the scope of this petition we pray for ourselves we thank god for them and adduces collateral evidence to this end
secondly an attempt was made to restore the offertory
this was achieved by the insertion of the words and oblations into the prayer for the church and the revision of the rubric so as to require the monetary offerings to be brought to the table instead of being put in the poor box and the bread and wine placed upon the table
previously it had not been clear when and how bread and wine got onto the altar
the so called manual acts whereby the priest took the bread and the cup during the prayer of consecration which had been deleted in were restored and an amen was inserted after the words of institution and before communion hence separating the connections between consecration and communion which cranmer had tried to make
after communion the unused but consecrated bread and wine were to be reverently consumed in church rather than being taken away for the priest s own use
by such subtle means were cranmer s purposes further confused leaving it for generations to argue over the precise theology of the rite
one change made that constituted a concession to the presbyterian exceptions was the updating and re insertion of the so called black rubric which had been removed in
this now declared that kneeling in order to receive communion did not imply adoration of the species of the eucharist nor to any corporal presence of christ s natural flesh and blood which according to the rubric were in heaven not here
while intended to create unity the division established under the commonwealth and the licence given by the directory for public worship were not easily passed by
unable to accept the new book ministers were deprived
the actual language of the revision was little changed from that of cranmer
with two exceptions some words and phrases which had become archaic were modernised secondly the readings for the epistle and gospel at holy communion which had been set out in full since were now set to the text of the authorized king james version of the bible
the psalter which had not been printed in the or books was in provided in miles coverdale s translation from the great bible of
it was this edition which was to be the official book of common prayer during the growth of the british empire and as a result has been a great influence on the prayer books of anglican churches worldwide liturgies of other denominations in english and of the english people and language as a whole
between and the th century further attempts to revise the book in england stalled
on the death of charles ii his brother james a roman catholic became james ii
james wished to achieve toleration for those of his own roman catholic faith whose practices were still banned
this however drew the presbyterians closer to the church of england in their common desire to resist popery talk of reconciliation and liturgical compromise was thus in the air
but with the flight of james in and the arrival of the calvinist william of orange the position of the parties changed
the presbyterians could achieve toleration of their practices without such a right being given to roman catholics and without therefore their having to submit to the church of england even with a liturgy more acceptable to them
they were now in a much stronger position to demand changes that were ever more radical
john tillotson dean of canterbury pressed the king to set up a commission to produce such a revision
the so called liturgy of comprehension of which was the result conceded two thirds of the presbyterian demands of but when it came to convocation the members now more fearful of william s perceived agenda did not even discuss it and its contents were for a long time not even accessible
this work however did go on to influence the prayer books of many british colonies
by the th century pressures to revise the book were increasing
adherents of the oxford movement begun in raised questions about the relationship of the church of england to the apostolic church and thus about its forms of worship
known as tractarians after their production of tracts for the times on theological issues they advanced the case for the church of england being essentially a part of the western church of which the roman catholic church was the chief representative
the illegal use of elements of the roman rite the use of candles vestments and incense practices collectively known as ritualism had become widespread and led to the establishment of a new system of discipline intending to bring the romanisers into conformity through the public worship regulation act
the act had no effect on illegal practices five clergy were imprisoned for contempt of court and after the trial of the much loved bishop edward king of lincoln it became clear that some revision of the liturgy had to be embarked upon
one branch of the ritualism movement argued that both romanisers and their evangelical opponents by imitating respectively the church of rome and reformed churches transgressed the ornaments rubric of that such ornaments of the church and of the ministers thereof at all times of their ministration shall be retained and be in use as were in this church of england by the authority of parliament in the second year of the reign of king edward the sixth
these adherents of ritualism among whom were percy dearmer and others claimed that the ornaments rubric prescribed the ritual usages of the sarum rite with the exception of a few minor things already abolished by the early reformation
following a royal commission report in work began on a new prayer book
it took twenty years to complete prolonged partly due to the demands of the first world war and partly in the light of the constitution of the church assembly which perhaps not unnaturally wished to do the work all over again for itself
in the work on a new version of the prayer book reached its final form
in order to reduce conflict with traditionalists it was decided that the form of service to be used would be determined by each congregation
with these open guidelines the book was granted approval by the church of england convocations and church assembly in july
however it was defeated by the house of commons in
the effect of the failure of the book was salutary no further attempts were made to revise the book of common prayer
instead a different process that of producing an alternative book led to the publication of series and in the s the alternative service book and subsequently to the common worship series of books
both differ substantially from the book of common prayer though the latter includes in the order two form of the holy communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service largely along the lines proposed for the prayer book
order one follows the pattern of the modern liturgical movement
with british colonial expansion from the th century onwards anglicanism spread across the globe
the new anglican churches used and revised the use of the book of common prayer until they like the english church produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the th and th centuries which come under the general heading of the liturgical movement
in south africa a book of common prayer was set forth by authority for use in the church of the province of south africa in
the prayer book is still in use in some churches in southern africa however it has been largely replaced by an anglican prayerbook and its translations to the other languages in use in southern africa
the book of common prayer is translated literally as in chinese mandarin g ng d o sh cantonese g ng t u sy
the former dioceses in the now defunct chung hua sheng kung hui had their own book of common prayer
the general synod and the college of bishops of chung hwa sheng kung hui planned to publish a unified version for the use of all anglican churches in china in which was the th anniversary of the first publishing of the book of common prayer
after the communists took over mainland china the diocese of hong kong and macao became independent of the chung hua sheng kung hui and continued to use the edition issued in shanghai in with a revision in
this edition also called the black cover book of common prayer for its cover still remains in use after the establishment of the hong kong sheng kung hui anglican province in hong kong
the language style of black cover book of common prayer is closer to classical chinese than contemporary chinese
the church of south india was the first modern episcopal uniting church consisting as it did from its foundation in at the time of indian independence of anglicans methodists congregationalists presbyterians and reformed christians
its liturgy from the first combined the free use of cranmer s language with an adherence to the principles of congregational participation and the centrality of the eucharist much in line with the liturgical movement
because it was a minority church of widely differing traditions in a non christian culture except in kerala where christianity has a long history practice varied wildly

the initial effort to compile such a book in japanese goes back to when the missionary societies of the church of england and of the episcopal church of the united states started their work in japan later joined by the anglican church of canada in
in the seik kai t bun japanese anglican prayer texts were prepared in japanese as the anglican church in japan was established in the romanized nippon seik kai kit bun japanese were compiled in
there was a major revision of these texts and the first kit sho was born in which had the eucharistic part in both english and american traditions
there were further revisions and the kit sho published in was the last revision that was done before the world war ii still using the historical kana orthography
after the end of the war the kit sho of became available using post war japanese orthography but still in traditional classical japanese language and vertical writing
in the fifty years after world war ii there were several efforts to translate the bible into modern colloquial japanese the most recent of which was the publication in of the japanese new interconfessional translation bible
the kit sho using the colloquial japanese language and horizontal writing was published in the same year
it also used the revised common lectionary
this latest kit sho since went through several minor revisions such as employing the lord s prayer in japanese common with the catholic church in
in the anglican church of korea first published a translation of the bcp into korean and called it gong dong gi do mun meaning common prayers
in the prayers announced allowed by the bishops council of the anglican church of korea was published in a second version of the book of common prayers in the national anglican council published the third and the current book of common prayers known as seong gong hwe gi do seo or the anglican prayers including the calendar of the church year daily offices collects proper liturgies for special days baptism holy eucharist pastoral offices episcopal services lectionary psalms and all of the other events the anglican church of korea celebrates
the diction of the books has changed from the version to the version
for example the word god has changed from classical chinese term cheon ju to native korean word ha neu nim in accordance with to the public christian translation and as used in common translation bible gong dong beon yeok seong seo that the anglican church of korea currently uses
as the philippines is connected to the worldwide anglican communion through the episcopal church in the philippines the main edition of the book of common prayer in use throughout the islands is the same as that of the united states
aside from the american version and the newly published philippine book of common prayer filipino chinese congregants of saint stephen s pro cathedral in the diocese of the central philippines uses the english chinese diglot book of common prayer published by the episcopal church of southeast asia
the ecp has since published its own book of common prayer upon gaining full autonomy on may
this version is notable for the inclusion of the misa de gallo a popular christmastide devotion amongst filipinos that is of catholic origin
the first printed book in ireland was in english the book of common prayer
william bedell had undertaken an irish translation of the book of common prayer in
an irish translation of the revised prayer book of was effected by john richardson and published in as leabhar na nornaightheadh ccomhchoitchionn
until the s the book of common prayer derived from with only mild tinkering was quite simply the worship of the church of ireland the edition had parallel columns in english and irish languages
it has been revised several times and the present edition has been used since
the first manx translation of the book of common prayer was made by john phillips bishop of sodor and man in
a more successful new version by his successor mark hiddesley was in use until when english liturgy became universal on the island
the lusitanian catholic apostolic evangelical church formed in
a portuguese language prayer book is the basis of the church s liturgy
in the early days of the church a translation into portuguese from of the edition of the book of common prayer was used
in the church published its own prayer book based on the anglican roman and mozarabic liturgies
the intent was to emulate the customs of the primitive apostolic church
newer editions of their prayer book are available in portuguese and with an english translation
the spanish reformed episcopal church spanish iglesia espa ola reformada episcopal iere is the church of the anglican communion in spain
it was founded in and since has been an extra provincial church under the metropolitan authority of the archbishop of canterbury
previous to its organisation there were several translations of the book of common prayer into spanish in and in
in the church combined a spanish translation of the edition of the book of common prayer with the mozarabic rite liturgy which had recently been translated
this is apparently the first time the spanish speaking anglicans inserted their own historic national tradition of liturgical worship within an anglican prayer book a second edition was released in and a revision in
this attempt combined the anglican structure of worship with indigenous prayer traditions
an act of parliament passed in entitled an act for the translating of the bible and the divine service into the welsh tongue ordered that both the old and new testament be translated into welsh alongside the book of common prayer
this translation completed by the then bishop of st david s richard davies and the scholar william salesbury was published in as y llyfr gweddi gyffredin
a further revision based on the english revision was published in
the church in wales began a revision of the book of common prayer in the s
various sections of authorised material were published throughout the s and s however common usage of these revised versions only began with the introduction of a revised order for the holy eucharist
revision continued throughout the s and s with definitive orders being confirmed throughout the s for most orders
a finished fully revised book of common prayer for use in the church in wales was authorised in written in traditional english after a suggestion for a modern language eucharist received a lukewarm reception
in the s new initiation services were authorised followed by alternative orders for morning and evening prayer in alongside an alternative order for the holy eucharist also in
revisions of various orders in the book of common prayer continued throughout the s and into the s
as for other parts of the british empire the book of common prayer was initially the standard of worship for anglicans in new zealand
the book was first translated into maori in and has gone through several translations and a number of different editions since then
the translated bcp has commonly been called te rawiri the david reflecting the prominence of the psalter in the services of morning and evening prayer as the maori often looked for words to be attributed to a person of authority
the maori translation of the bcp is still used in new zealand particularly among older maori living in rural areas
after earlier trial services in the mid twentieth century in the anglican church of aotearoa new zealand and polynesia authorised through its general synod a new zealand prayer book he karakia mihinare o aotearoa intended to serve the needs of new zealand fiji tonga samoa and the cook island anglicans
this book is unusual for its cultural diversity it includes passages in the maori fijian tongan and english languages
in other respects it reflects the same ecumenical influence of the liturgical movement as in other new anglican books of the period and borrows freely from a variety of international sources
the book is not presented as a definitive or final liturgical authority such as the use of the definite article in the title might have implied
while the preface is ambiguous regarding the status of older forms and books the implication however is that this book is now the norm of worship for anglicans in aotearoa new zealand
the book has also been revised in a number of minor ways since the initial publication such as by the inclusion of the revised common lectionary and an online edition is offered freely as the standard for reference
the anglican church of australia known officially until as the church of england in australia and tasmania became self governing in
its general synod agreed that the book of common prayer was to be regarded as the authorised standard of worship and doctrine in this church
after a series of experimental services offered in many dioceses during the s and s in an australian prayer book was produced formally as a supplement to the book of although in fact it was widely taken up in place of the old book
the aapb sought to adhere to the principle that where the liturgical committee could not agree on a formulation the words or expressions of the book of common prayer were to be used if in a modern idiom
the result was a conservative revision including two forms of eucharistic rite a first order that was essentially the rite in more contemporary language and a second order that reflected the liturgical movement norms but without elements such as a eucharistic epiclesis or other features that would have represented a departure from the doctrine of the old book
an australian prayer book has been formally accepted for usage in other churches including the reformed episcopal church in the united states
a prayer book for australia produced in and again not technically a substitute for the prayer book nevertheless departed from both the structure and wording of the book of common prayer prompting conservative reaction
numerous objections were made and the notably conservative evangelical diocese of sydney drew attention both to the loss of bcp wording and of an explicit biblical doctrine of substitutionary atonement
sydney delegates to the general synod sought and obtained various concessions but that diocese never adopted the book
the diocese of sydney has instead developed its own prayer book called sunday services to supplement the prayer book which as elsewhere in australia is rarely used and preserve the original theology which the sydney diocese asserts has been changed
in the diocese published better gatherings which includes the book common prayer published an updated revision of sunday services
the anglican church of canada which until was known as the church of england in the dominion of canada or simply the church of england in canada developed its first book of common prayer separately from the english version in which received final authorisation from general synod on april
the revision of was much more substantial bearing a family relationship to that of the abortive book in england
the language was conservatively modernised and additional seasonal material was added
as in england while many prayers were retained though the structure of the communion service was altered a prayer of oblation was added to the eucharistic prayer after the words of institution thus reflecting the rejection of cranmer s theology in liturgical developments across the anglican communion
more controversially the psalter omitted certain sections including the entirety of psalm
general synod gave final authorisation to the revision in to coincide with the th anniversary of the book of common prayer
a french translation le recueil des pri res de la communaut chr tienne was published in
after a period of experimentation with the publication of various supplements the book of alternative services was published in
the book of common prayer has also been translated into these north american indigenous languages cowitchan cree haida ntlakyapamuk slavey eskimo aleut dakota delaware mohawk ojibwe
joseph gilfillan was the chief editor of the ojibwa edition of the book of common prayer entitled iu wejibuewisi mamawi anamiawini mazinaigun iw wejibwewizi maamawi anami aawini mazina igan
the episcopal church separated itself from the church of england in the first church in the american colonies having been founded in
the first book of common prayer of the new body approved in had as its main source the english book with significant influence also from the scottish liturgy see above which bishop seabury of connecticut brought to the usa following his consecration in aberdeen in
the preface to the book of common prayer says this church is far from intending to depart from the church of england in any essential point of doctrine discipline or worship further than local circumstances require there were some notable differences
for example in the communion service the prayer of consecration follows mainly the scottish orders derived from and found in the book of common prayer
the compilers also used other materials derived from ancient liturgies especially eastern orthodox ones such as the liturgy of st
james
an epiclesis or invocation of the holy spirit in the eucharistic prayer was included as in the scottish book though modified to meet reformist objections
overall however the book was modelled on the english prayer book the convention having resisted attempts at more radical deletion and revision
article x of the canons of the episcopal church provides that t he book of common prayer as now established or hereafter amended by the authority of this church shall be in use in all the dioceses of this church which is a reference to the book of common prayer
the prayer book cross was erected in san francisco s golden gate park in as a gift from the church of england
created by ernest coxhead it stands on one of the higher points in golden gate park
it is located between john f
kennedy drive and park presidio drive near cross over drive
this ft m sandstone cross commemorates the first use of the book of common prayer in california by sir francis drake s chaplain on june
in the anglican church in north america released its own revised edition of the bcp
it included a modernised rendering of the coverdale psalter renewed for contemporary use through efforts that included the labors of th century anglicans t s
eliot and c s
lewis according to robert duncan the first archbishop of the acna the edition takes what was good from the modern liturgical renewal movement and also recovers what had been lost from the tradition
the edition does not contain a catechism but is accompanied by an extensive acna catechism in a separate publication to be a christian an anglican catechism
under pope john paul ii s pastoral provision of the early s former anglicans began to be admitted into new anglican use parishes in the us
the book of divine worship was published in the united states in as a liturgical book for their use composed of material drawn from the and book of common prayer of the episcopal church in the united states of america and the roman missal
it was mandated for use in all personal ordinariates for former anglicans in the us from advent
following the adoption of the ordinariates divine worship the missal in advent the book of divine worship was suppressed
to complement the upcoming divine worship missal the newly erected personal ordinariate of our lady of walsingham in the uk authorised the usage of an interim anglican use divine office in
the customary of our lady of walsingham followed from both the church of england s book of common prayer tradition and that of the catholic church s liturgy of the hours introducing hours terce sext and none not found in any standard book of common prayer
unlike other contemporary forms of the catholic divine office the customary contained the full psalm psalter
in the st
gregory s prayer book was published by ignatius press as a resource for all catholic laity combining selections from the divine worship missal with devotions drawn from various anglican prayer books and other anglican sources approved for catholic use in a format that somewhat mimics the form and content of the book of common prayer
in the first of two editions of divine worship daily office was published
while the north american edition was the first divine office introduced in the personal ordinariate of the chair of saint peter the commonwealth edition succeeded the previous customary for the personal ordinariates of our lady of walsingham and our lady of the southern cross
the north american edition more closely follows the american american and canadian prayer books while the commonwealth edition more closely follows the precedents set by the church of england s and book of common prayer
the book of common prayer has had a great influence on a number of other denominations
while theologically different the language and flow of the service of many other churches owe a great debt to the prayer book
in particular many christian prayer books have drawn on the collects for the sundays of the church year mostly freely translated or even rethought by cranmer from a wide range of christian traditions but including a number of original compositions which are widely recognised as masterpieces of compressed liturgical construction
john wesley an anglican priest whose revivalist preaching led to the creation of methodism wrote in his preface to the sunday service of the methodists in north america i believe there is no liturgy in the world either in ancient or modern language which breathes more of a solid scriptural rational piety than the common prayer of the church of england many methodist churches in england and the united states continued to use a slightly revised version of the book for communion services well into the th century
in the united methodist church the liturgy for eucharistic celebrations is almost identical to what is found in the book of common prayer as are some of the other liturgies and services
a unique variant was developed in in boston massachusetts when the historic king s chapel founded left the episcopal church and became an independent unitarian church
to this day king s chapel uniquely uses the book of common prayer according to the use in king s chapel in its worship the book eliminates trinitarian references and statements
together with the king james version of the bible and the works of shakespeare the book of common prayer has been one of the three fundamental underpinnings of modern english
as it has been in regular use for centuries many phrases from its services have passed into everyday english either as deliberate quotations or as unconscious borrowings
they have often been used metaphorically in non religious contexts and authors have used phrases from the prayer book as titles for their books
some examples of well known phrases from the book of common prayer are
speak now or forever hold your peace from the marriage liturgy
till death us do part from the marriage liturgy
earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust from the funeral service
in the midst of life we are in death from the committal in the service for the burial of the dead first rite
from all the deceits of the world the flesh and the devil from the litany
read mark learn and inwardly digest from the collect for the second sunday of advent
evil liver from the rubrics for holy communion
all sorts and conditions of men from the order for morning prayer
peace in our time from morning prayer versicles references and allusions to prayer book services in the works of shakespeare were tracked down and identified by richmond noble
derision of the prayer book or its contents in any interludes plays songs rhymes or by other open words was a criminal offence under the act of uniformity and consequently shakespeare avoids too direct reference but noble particularly identifies the reading of the psalter according to the great bible version specified in the prayer book as the biblical book generating the largest number of biblical references in shakespeare s plays
noble found a total of allusions to the psalms in the plays of the first folio relating to separate psalms all save one of which he linked to the version in the psalter rather than those in the geneva bible or bishops bible
in addition there are a small number of direct allusions to liturgical texts in the prayer book e g
henry viii where wolsey states vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye a clear reference to the rite of public baptism where the godparents are asked doest thou forsake the vaine pompe and glory of the worlde
as novelist p
james observed we can recognize the prayer book s cadences in the works of isaac walton and john bunyan in the majestic phrases of john milton sir thomas browne and edward gibbon
we can see its echo in the works of such very different writers as daniel defoe thackeray the bront s coleridge t
eliot and even dorothy l
sayers james herself used phrases from the book of common prayer and made them into best selling titles devices and desires and the children of men while alfonso cuar n s film children of men placed the phrase onto cinema marquees worldwide
in england there are only three bodies entitled to print the book of common prayer the two privileged presses cambridge university press and oxford university press and the queen s printer
cambridge university press holds letters patent as the queen s printer and so two of these three bodies are the same
the latin term cum privilegio with privilege is printed on the title pages of cambridge editions of the book of common prayer and the king james version of the bible to denote the charter authority or privilege under which they are published
the primary function for cambridge university press in its role as queen s printer is preserving the integrity of the text continuing a long standing tradition and reputation for textual scholarship and accuracy of printing
cambridge university press has stated that as a university press a charitable enterprise devoted to the advancement of learning it has no desire to restrict artificially that advancement and that commercial restrictiveness through a partial monopoly is not part of its purpose
it therefore grants permission to use the text and licence printing or the importation for sale within the uk as long as it is assured of acceptable quality and accuracy
the church of england supported by the prayer book society publishes an online edition of the book of common prayer with permission of cambridge university press
