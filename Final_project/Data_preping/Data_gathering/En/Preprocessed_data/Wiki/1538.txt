work producing liturgy english language wa largely done thomas cranmer archbishop canterbury starting cautiously reign henry viii radically son edward vi

cranmer's contact reformer continental europe helped change outlook
exhortation litany earliest english-language service church england wa first overt manifestation changing views
wa mere translation latin instead making protestant character clear drastic reduction place saint compressing major part three petitions

wa also calendar lectionary meant bible psalter book required priest
bcp represented major theological shift england towards protestantism
cranmer's doctrinal concern seen systematic amendment source material remove idea human merit contributed individual's salvation
doctrine implicit throughout prayer book important implication understanding sacraments
cranmer believed someone wa one god's elect received outward form sacrament washing baptism eating bread communion receive actual grace elect receiving sacramental sign grace
cranmer held position faith gift given elect united outward sign sacrament inward grace unity two making sacrament effective
position wa agreement reformed church wa opposition roman catholic lutheran views
compromise conservative word mass wa kept service titled supper lord holy communion commonly called mass
service also preserved much medieval structure massstone altar remained clergy wore traditional vestment much service wa sung priest wa instructed put communion wafer communicants' mouth instead hands
nevertheless first bcp wa radical departure traditional worship eliminated almost everything till central lay eucharistic piety
priority protestant wa replace roman catholic teaching mass wa sacrifice god sacrifice cross protestant teaching wa service thanksgiving spiritual communion christ
cranmer's intention wa suppress catholic notion sacrifice transubstantiation mass
stress wa elevation consecrated bread wine eucharistic adoration wa prohibited
elevation central moment medieval mass attached wa idea real presence
cranmer's eucharistic theology wa close calvinist spiritual presence view described receptionism virtualism ie
word administration rite deliberately ambiguous could understood identifying bread body christ following cranmer's theology prayer communicant might spiritually receive body christ faith
cranmer based baptism service martin luther's service wa simplification long complex medieval rite
also remnant prayer dead requiem mass provision celebrating holy communion funeral
cranmer's work simplification revision wa also applied daily office reduced morning evening prayer
cranmer hoped would also serve daily form prayer used laity thus replacing late medieval lay observation latin hour virgin english equivalent primer
book wa outset intended temporary expedient german reformer bucer wa assured meeting cranmer first time april concessionsmade respect antiquity infirmity present age wrote
according historian christopher haigh prayer book broke decisively past
service baptism confirmation communion burial rewritten ceremony hated protestant removed
unlike version prayer book removed many traditional sacramentals observance reflected belief blessing exorcism people objects
anointing wa longer included service baptism ordination visitation sick
ceremony altered emphasise importance faith rather trusting ritual objects
name service wa changed order administration lord's supper holy communion removing word mass
stone altar replaced communion table positioned chancel nave priest standing north side
priest wa wear surplice instead traditional mass vestments
service appears promote spiritual presence view eucharist meaning christ spiritually corporally present
ultimately wa decided communicant continue kneel privy council ordered black rubric added prayer book clarify purpose kneeling
christ's natural flesh blood eucharist wa clearest statement eucharistic theology prayer book
service removed reference body christ word administration reinforce teaching christ's presence eucharist wa spiritual presence word historian peter marshall limited subjective experience communicant
instead communion wafer prayer book instructed ordinary bread wa used take away superstition person hath might have
emphasise wa holiness bread wine leftover taken home curate ordinary consumption
provision requiem called prayer commendation committal first addressed deceased
remained wa single reference deceased giving thanks delivery 'the myseryes sinneful world' new order burial dead wa drastically stripped-down memorial service designed undermine definitively whole complex traditional catholic belief purgatory intercessory prayer dead
order morning evening prayer extended inclusion penitential section beginning including corporate confession sin general absolution although text wa printed morning prayer rubrical direction use evening well
general pattern bible reading edition wa retained wa except distinct old new testament reading specified morning evening prayer certain feast days
following publication prayer book revised english primer wa published adapting office morning evening prayer prayer lay domestic piety
book however wa used short period edward vi died summer soon could mary restored union rome
latin mass wa re-established altar rood statue saint reinstated attempt restore english church roman affiliation
cranmer wa punished work english reformation burned stake march
mary's death became primary source elizabethan book common prayer subtle significant change only
hundred english protestant fled exile establishing english church frankfurt main
bitter public dispute ensued edmund grindal richard cox wished preserve exile exact form worship prayer book john knox minister congregation regarded book still partially tainted compromise
eventually civil authority expelled knox supporter geneva adopted new prayer book form prayer derived principally calvin's french-language la forme de prires
consequently accession elizabeth re-asserted dominance reformed church england remained significant body protestant believer nevertheless hostile book common prayer
john knox took form prayer scotland formed basis scottish book common order
elizabeth permanent enforcement reformed church england wa undertaken book wa republished scarcely altered in
prayer book wa masterpiece theological engineering doctrine prayer book thirty-nine article religion set forth would set tone anglicanism preferred steer via medium middle way lutheranism calvinism
conservative nature change underline fact reformed principle mean universally popular fact queen recognised
revived act supremacy giving ambiguous title supreme governor passed without difficulty act uniformity giving statutory force prayer book passed house lord three votes
made constitutional history imposed laity alone bishop except imprisoned queen unable attend voted it
convocation made position clear affirming traditional doctrine eucharist authority pope reservation divine law clergy handling defining concerning thing belonging faith sacrament discipline ecclesiastical innovation reversal new form anglican worship took several decade gain acceptance end reign english population board
alteration though minor however cast long shadow development church england
would long road back church clear indication would retreat settlement except minor official changes
one first move undo cranmer's liturgy queen insisted word administration communion book placed word administration book thereby re-opening issue real presence
administration holy communion word book body lord jesus christ combined word edward vi's second prayer book take eat remembrance suggesting one hand real presence wished find communion memorial ie
prayer book however retained truncated prayer consecration communion element omitted notion objective sacrifice
wa preceded proper preface prayer humble access placed remove implication communion wa sacrifice god
prayer consecration wa followed communion lord's prayer prayer thanksgiving optional prayer oblation whose first line included petition god would accepte sacrifice prayse thankes geuing latter prayer wa removed longer version followed word institution rite avoid suggestion sacrifice mass marian bishop
untrue though accusation wa restoration word distribution emphasized falsity
however beginning century prominent anglican theologian tried cast traditional catholic interpretation onto text commemorative sacrifice heavenly offering even though word rite support interpretations
cranmer good liturgist wa aware eucharist mid-second century regarded church's offering god removed sacrificial language anyway whether pressure conviction
wa anglican oxford movement mid- century later -century revision church england would attempt deal eucharistic doctrine cranmer bringing church back pre-reformation doctrine meantime scottish american prayer book reverted text even older roman eastern orthodox pattern adding oblation epiclesis ie
congregation offer union christ consecration receives communion retaining calvinist notion may u rather become emphasis bless sanctify u tension catholic stress objective real presence protestant subjective worthiness communicant
however rite asserted kind virtualism regard real presence making eucharist material sacrifice oblation retention may u body blood thy savior rather become thus eschewing suggestion change natural substance bread wine
another move ornament rubric related clergy wear conducting services
instead banning vestment except rochet bishop surplice parish clergy permitted ornamentsas usein second year king edward vi allowed substantial leeway traditionalist clergy retain vestment felt appropriate liturgical celebration namely mass vestment alb chasuble dalmatics cope stole maniples etc
least queen gave instruction per text act uniformity of
rubric also stated communion service conducted 'accustomed place' namely facing table wall priest facing it
rubric wa placed section regarding morning evening prayer prayer book books
wa basis claim century vestment chasuble alb stole canonically permitted
instruction congregation kneel receiving communion wa retained black rubric forty-two article faith later reduced denied real essential presence christ's flesh blood wa removed conciliate traditionalist aligned queen's sensibilities
removal black rubric complement double set word administration time communion permit action kneeling receive people used doing
therefore nothing wa stated prayer book theory presence forbidding reverence adoration christ via bread wine sacrament
issue however prayer book wa odds repudiation transubstantiation forbidden carrying blessed sacrament thirty-nine articles
long one subscribe publicly assert latter one wa left hold whatever opinion one wanted former
queen wa famous saying wa interested looking window men's souls
among cranmer's innovation retained new prayer book wa requirement weekly holy communion services
practice english reformation many received communion rarely little year case george herbert estimated six time per year
high attendance festival wa order day many parish regular communion wa popular place family stayed away sent servant liturgical representative household parish clergy initially licensed bishop preach absence licensed preacher sunday service required accompanied reading one homily written cranmer
george herbert wa however alone enthusiasm preaching regarded one prime function parish priest
music wa much simplified radical distinction developed one hand parish worship metrical psalm sternhold hopkins might sung hand worship church organ surviving choral foundation music john marbeck others wa developed rich choral tradition
whole act parish worship might take well two hour accordingly church equipped pew household could sit together whereas medieval church men woman worshipped separately
