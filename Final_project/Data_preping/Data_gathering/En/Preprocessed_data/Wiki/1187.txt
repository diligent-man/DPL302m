ITV is a British free to air television network It was launched in as Independent Television to provide competition to BBC Television established in ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act its legal name has been Channel to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time BBC BBC and Channel
ITV was for four decades a network of separate companies which provided regional television services and also shared programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network Each franchise was originally owned by a different company After several mergers the fifteen regional franchises are now held by two companies ITV plc which runs the ITV channel and STV Group which runs the STV channel
The ITV network is a separate entity from ITV plc the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in ITV plc holds the Channel broadcasting licences for every region except for central and northern Scotland which are held by STV Group
Today ITV plc simply commissions the network schedule centrally programmes are made by its own subsidiary ITV Studios and independent production companies Regional programming remains in news and some current affairs series
In Northern Ireland ITV plc used the brand name UTV as the name of the channel until April This was the name used by former owner UTV Media now known as Wireless Group ITV plc bought UTV in
Although the ITV network's history goes back to many regional franchisees changed over the years Some of the most important names in the network's past notably Thames ABC and ATV have no connection with the modern network
The origins of ITV lie in the passing of the Television Act designed to break the monopoly on television held by the BBC Television Service The act created the Independent Television Authority ITA then IBA after the Sound Broadcasting Act to heavily regulate the industry and to award franchises The first six franchises were awarded in for London the Midlands and the North of England with separate franchises for Weekdays and Weekends The first ITV service to launch was London's Associated Rediffusion on September with the Midlands and North services launching in February and May respectively Following these launches the ITA awarded more franchises until the whole country was covered by fourteen regional stations all launched by
The network has been modified several times through franchise reviews that have taken place in and during which broadcast regions have changed and service operators have been replaced Only one service operator has ever been declared bankrupt WWN in with all other operators leaving the network as a result of a franchise review Separate weekend franchises were removed in with the exception of London and over the years more services were added these included a national breakfast franchise from onward—operating between am and am—and a teletext service The Broadcasting Act changed the nature of ITV the then regulator the IBA was replaced with a light touch regulator the ITC companies became able to purchase other ITV regional companies and franchises were now being awarded based upon a highest bidder auction with few safeguards in place This heavily criticised part of the review saw four operators replaced and the operators facing different annual payments to the Treasury Central Television for example paid only £—despite holding a lucrative and large region—because it was unopposed while Yorkshire Television paid £ million for a region of the same size and status owing to heavy competition
Following the changes ITV as a network began to consolidate with several companies doing so to save money by ceasing the duplication of services present when they were all separate companies By the ITV network was owned by five companies of which two Carlton and Granada had become major players by owning between them all the franchises in England Wales the Scottish borders and the Isle of Man That same year the two merged to form ITV plc with the only subsequent acquisitions being the takeover of Channel Television the Channel Islands franchise in and UTV the franchise for Northern Ireland in
The ITV network is not owned or operated by one company but by a number of licensees which provide regional services while also broadcasting programmes across the network Since the fifteen licences are held by two companies with the majority held by ITV Broadcasting Limited part of ITV plc
The network is regulated by the media regulator Ofcom who is responsible for awarding the broadcast licences The last major review of the Channel franchises was in with all operators' licences having been renewed between and and again from without a further contest While this has been the longest period that the ITV network has gone without a major review of its licence holders Ofcom announced following consultation that it would split the Wales and West licence from January creating a national licence for Wales and joining the newly separated West region to Westcountry Television to form a new licence for the enlarged South West of England region
All companies holding a licence were part of the non profit body ITV Network Limited which commissioned and scheduled network programming with compliance previously handled by ITV plc and Channel Television However due to amalgamation of several of these companies since the creation of ITV Network Limited and given Channel Television is now owned by ITV plc it has been replaced by an affiliation system Approved by Ofcom this results in ITV plc commissioning and funding the network schedule with STV and UTV paying a fee to broadcast it All licensees have the right to opt out of network programming except for the national news bulletins however many do not due to pressures from the parent company or because of limited resources Prior to the affiliate system being introduced STV would frequently and sometimes controversially opt out of several popular network programmes such as the original run of the first series of Downton Abbey citing the need to provide more Scottish content to its viewers
As a public service broadcaster the ITV network is obliged to broadcast programming of public importance including news current affairs children's and religious programming as well as party election broadcasts on behalf of the major political parties and political events such as the Budget The network also needs to produce accessible output containing subtitles signing and audio description In exchange for this programming the ITV network is available on all platforms free to air and can be found at the top of the EPG of all providers
Since the launch of the platform in all of the ITV licensees have received gifted capacity on the digital terrestrial television platform At present the companies are able to broadcast additional channels and all choose to broadcast the ITV plc owned ITV ITV ITV and CITV in their region UTV and STV formerly Scottish Television and Grampian Television previously broadcast their own services UTV in Northern Ireland and S in central and northern Scotland until when they adopted the ITV plc channels Despite this STV was given a broadcasting licence for what would become the STV channel in however this was short lived and the channel closed in The broadcasters all make use of the Digital multiplex shared with Channel ITV Encore launched in June and ITVBe launched in October ITV Box Office launched in February
ITV plc owns thirteen of the fifteen franchises and broadcasts to England Wales southern Scotland the Isle of Man the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland through its subsidiary company ITV Broadcasting Limited The company also owns the breakfast television licence which as of January broadcasts across the network between and am each morning using the Good Morning Britain previously Daybreak and Lorraine names The company broadcasts a centralised service under the ITV brand In Northern Ireland ITV used the UTV brand name as the name of the channel until April
The group also owns ITV Studios the production arm of the company and formed from an amalgamation of all the production departments of the regional licences they own The company produces a large proportion of ITV's networked programming around but previously as high as according to some reports with the rest coming primarily from independent suppliers under the Broadcasting Act at least of ITV's total output must be from independent companies ITV plc hopes to increase the amount of in house programming to as close to the limit as possible
The group cut the number of regional news programmes offered from in to by resulting several regions being merged to form one programme including the Border and Tyne Tees regions the Westcountry and West regions and the removal of sub regional programming with some regions only represented by pre recorded segments
STV Group plc owns two franchises covering central and northern Scotland through subsidiary companies STV Central and STV North broadcasting a central service under the STV brand
The company has had several disputes with ITV plc in recent years over network programming STV aims to broadcast more Scottish programmes at peak times and so removed several key ITV plc programmes from their schedule in July including The Bill Midsomer Murders and Lewis Despite STV's explanation of expense ITV plc were angered by the decision as a recent schedule change had made The Bill central to their programming and broadcast the programmes on ITV as well to ensure Scottish viewers could see the programmes On September ITV plc was reported to be in the process of suing STV for £ million as ITV felt dropping the shows constituted a breach of network agreements STV subsequently counter sued ITV plc for £ million
The dispute was ended in with STV agreeing to pay ITV plc £ million The signing of the new affiliation deal has resulted in STV paying a flat fee for all networked programming and so to drop any programmes is unlikely due to the large costs involved
There are fifteen regional licences covering fourteen regions there are separate weekday and weekend licences for the London region and one national licence for the breakfast service All licences listed here were renewed until the end of Licences in England and Wales were held by the individual regional ITV plc owned companies prior to November
The appointment to provide national news for Channel is also subject to approval by Ofcom This appointment has been held by ITN since the channel's inception and has also been approved through the end of
For over years of ITV its homegrown programmes have become among the best remembered as well as being extremely successful Before the s nearly all of the content for the channel was produced by the fifteen franchise licensees the regional companies
However following legislation in the Broadcasting Act imposing a quota for commissioning of independent productions the number of programmes from independent production companies not connected to the traditional ITV network has increased rapidly Notable examples include Talkback Thames one half of which Thames Television was itself a former ITV franchisee producers of The Bill and co producers of The X Factor and waytraffic previously Celador producers of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
From the late s ITV's long standing commitment to strong current affairs and documentary programming began to diminish with the ending of productions such as World in Action Granada Television This Week Rediffusion LondonThames Television First Tuesday Yorkshire Television Network First Survival Anglia Television and Weekend World LWT and their replacement with populist shows such as Tonight News at Ten was also axed in although it was reinstated in In December the final edition of ITV's long running arts programme The South Bank Show was broadcast
ITV's primetime schedules are dominated by its soap operas such as the flagship Coronation Street and Emmerdale At the start of the st century Independent Television faced criticism for including a large amount of reality TV programmes in the schedule such as Celebrity Fit Club Celebrity Wrestling and Celebrity Love Island In its defence ITV does continue to show its major strengths in the fields of sports coverage and drama productions and it continues to schedule national news in primetime
Television has been broadcast on ITV at breakfast since February It was initially run by an independent contractor TV am and later GMTV until GMTV Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of ITV plc in November
Historically ITV aired breakfast programmes from am until am but ITV extended this to am on weekdays on January and now broadcasts two breakfast programmes on weekdays Good Morning Britain and Lorraine Good Morning Britain keeps viewers up to date with all the latest news sports features and weather whilst Lorraine predominantly focuses on celebrity interviews recipes fashion and showbiz At weekends ITV Breakfast airs children's programming a simulcast of CITV Breakfast under the CITV brand
ITV's strong daytime line up helped by programmes such as This Morning Loose Women Dickinson's Real Deal and game shows Tipping Point and The Chase are very popular achieving the highest audience share during the daytime slot
In recent years the network has tried to use formats that ITV Studios own out right whether they have originated in the UK with their Lifted Entertainment company or have come from production companies they own abroad though some popular programme formats like The Masked Singer have still been acquired from other companies abroad Currently ITV are behind the formats for Dancing on Ice The Voice UK the format originally coming from their Dutch production company and I'm a CelebrityGet Me Out of Here while forthcoming music game show Walk The Line has been co developed by Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment and ITV
Since the network started Independent Television News Limited ITN has held the contract to produce news for the ITV network with minute national news bulletins currently broadcast at pm and pm and an hour long bulletin at pm These bulletins were broadcast under the ITN brand from until when a new network identity reinforced the ITV brand resulting in the new bulletins being broadcast under the ITV News brand
ITN has long been respected in the news industry as a source of reliable information and news and as a result the service has won many awards for their programmes the latest being in May when News at Ten was named best news programme by the Royal Television Society and BAFTA
The ITV National Weather forecast was first broadcast in using data supplied by the Met Office and was presented by a number of weather forecasters The forecasts are sponsored in which the sponsors message would appear prior to and following the forecast The forecasts are made immediately after the main national news bulletins
Prior to the creation of the national forecast each regional company provided its own regional forecast The regional forecasts today are incorporated into the main regional news bulletins and in the summer months includes a pollen count
Currently only new episodes of long form news and current affairs programmes like Exposure Peston and On Assignment are being scheduled after News at Ten with the latter title currently only appearing on a month by month basis As the channel carries a simulcast of the Ideal World shopping network for a couple of hours after midnight the time between the news and the shopping is usually kept for re runs with ITV repeating its primetime entertainment shows or sports programming from ITV
