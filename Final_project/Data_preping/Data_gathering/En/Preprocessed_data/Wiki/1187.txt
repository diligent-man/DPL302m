itv is a british free to air television network
it was launched in as independent television to provide competition to bbc television established in
itv is the oldest commercial network in the uk
since the passing of the broadcasting act its legal name has been channel to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time bbc bbc and channel
itv was for four decades a network of separate companies which provided regional television services and also shared programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network
each franchise was originally owned by a different company
after several mergers the fifteen regional franchises are now held by two companies itv plc which runs the itv channel and stv group which runs the stv channel
the itv network is a separate entity from itv plc the company that resulted from the merger of granada plc and carlton communications in
itv plc holds the channel broadcasting licences for every region except for central and northern scotland which are held by stv group
today itv plc simply commissions the network schedule centrally programmes are made by its own subsidiary itv studios and independent production companies
regional programming remains in news and some current affairs series
in northern ireland itv plc used the brand name utv as the name of the channel until april
this was the name used by former owner utv media now known as wireless group
itv plc bought utv in
although the itv network s history goes back to many regional franchisees changed over the years
some of the most important names in the network s past notably thames abc and atv have no connection with the modern network
the origins of itv lie in the passing of the television act designed to break the monopoly on television held by the bbc television service
the act created the independent television authority ita then iba after the sound broadcasting act to heavily regulate the industry and to award franchises
the first six franchises were awarded in for london the midlands and the north of england with separate franchises for weekdays and weekends
the first itv service to launch was london s associated rediffusion on september with the midlands and north services launching in february and may respectively
following these launches the ita awarded more franchises until the whole country was covered by fourteen regional stations all launched by
the network has been modified several times through franchise reviews that have taken place in and during which broadcast regions have changed and service operators have been replaced
only one service operator has ever been declared bankrupt wwn in with all other operators leaving the network as a result of a franchise review
separate weekend franchises were removed in with the exception of london and over the years more services were added these included a national breakfast franchise from onward operating between am and am and a teletext service
the broadcasting act changed the nature of itv the then regulator the iba was replaced with a light touch regulator the itc companies became able to purchase other itv regional companies and franchises were now being awarded based upon a highest bidder auction with few safeguards in place
this heavily criticised part of the review saw four operators replaced and the operators facing different annual payments to the treasury central television for example paid only despite holding a lucrative and large region because it was unopposed while yorkshire television paid million for a region of the same size and status owing to heavy competition
following the changes itv as a network began to consolidate with several companies doing so to save money by ceasing the duplication of services present when they were all separate companies
by the itv network was owned by five companies of which two carlton and granada had become major players by owning between them all the franchises in england wales the scottish borders and the isle of man
that same year the two merged to form itv plc with the only subsequent acquisitions being the takeover of channel television the channel islands franchise in and utv the franchise for northern ireland in
the itv network is not owned or operated by one company but by a number of licensees which provide regional services while also broadcasting programmes across the network
since the fifteen licences are held by two companies with the majority held by itv broadcasting limited part of itv plc
the network is regulated by the media regulator ofcom who is responsible for awarding the broadcast licences
the last major review of the channel franchises was in with all operators licences having been renewed between and and again from without a further contest
while this has been the longest period that the itv network has gone without a major review of its licence holders ofcom announced following consultation that it would split the wales and west licence from january creating a national licence for wales and joining the newly separated west region to westcountry television to form a new licence for the enlarged south west of england region
all companies holding a licence were part of the non profit body itv network limited which commissioned and scheduled network programming with compliance previously handled by itv plc and channel television
however due to amalgamation of several of these companies since the creation of itv network limited and given channel television is now owned by itv plc it has been replaced by an affiliation system
approved by ofcom this results in itv plc commissioning and funding the network schedule with stv and utv paying a fee to broadcast it
all licensees have the right to opt out of network programming except for the national news bulletins however many do not due to pressures from the parent company or because of limited resources
prior to the affiliate system being introduced stv would frequently and sometimes controversially opt out of several popular network programmes such as the original run of the first series of downton abbey citing the need to provide more scottish content to its viewers
as a public service broadcaster the itv network is obliged to broadcast programming of public importance including news current affairs children s and religious programming as well as party election broadcasts on behalf of the major political parties and political events such as the budget
the network also needs to produce accessible output containing subtitles signing and audio description
in exchange for this programming the itv network is available on all platforms free to air and can be found at the top of the epg of all providers
since the launch of the platform in all of the itv licensees have received gifted capacity on the digital terrestrial television platform
at present the companies are able to broadcast additional channels and all choose to broadcast the itv plc owned itv itv itv and citv in their region
utv and stv formerly scottish television and grampian television previously broadcast their own services utv in northern ireland and s in central and northern scotland until when they adopted the itv plc channels
despite this stv was given a broadcasting licence for what would become the stv channel in however this was short lived and the channel closed in
the broadcasters all make use of the digital multiplex shared with channel
itv encore launched in june and itvbe launched in october
itv box office launched in february
itv plc owns thirteen of the fifteen franchises and broadcasts to england wales southern scotland the isle of man the channel islands and northern ireland through its subsidiary company itv broadcasting limited
the company also owns the breakfast television licence which as of january broadcasts across the network between and am each morning using the good morning britain previously daybreak and lorraine names
the company broadcasts a centralised service under the itv brand
in northern ireland itv used the utv brand name as the name of the channel until april
the group also owns itv studios the production arm of the company and formed from an amalgamation of all the production departments of the regional licences they own
the company produces a large proportion of itv s networked programming around but previously as high as according to some reports with the rest coming primarily from independent suppliers under the broadcasting act at least of itv s total output must be from independent companies
itv plc hopes to increase the amount of in house programming to as close to the limit as possible
the group cut the number of regional news programmes offered from in to by resulting several regions being merged to form one programme including the border and tyne tees regions the westcountry and west regions and the removal of sub regional programming with some regions only represented by pre recorded segments
stv group plc owns two franchises covering central and northern scotland through subsidiary companies stv central and stv north broadcasting a central service under the stv brand
the company has had several disputes with itv plc in recent years over network programming
stv aims to broadcast more scottish programmes at peak times and so removed several key itv plc programmes from their schedule in july including the bill midsomer murders and lewis
despite stv s explanation of expense itv plc were angered by the decision as a recent schedule change had made the bill central to their programming and broadcast the programmes on itv as well to ensure scottish viewers could see the programmes
on september itv plc was reported to be in the process of suing stv for million as itv felt dropping the shows constituted a breach of network agreements stv subsequently counter sued itv plc for million
the dispute was ended in with stv agreeing to pay itv plc million
the signing of the new affiliation deal has resulted in stv paying a flat fee for all networked programming and so to drop any programmes is unlikely due to the large costs involved
there are fifteen regional licences covering fourteen regions there are separate weekday and weekend licences for the london region and one national licence for the breakfast service
all licences listed here were renewed until the end of
licences in england and wales were held by the individual regional itv plc owned companies prior to november
the appointment to provide national news for channel is also subject to approval by ofcom
this appointment has been held by itn since the channel s inception and has also been approved through the end of
for over years of itv its homegrown programmes have become among the best remembered as well as being extremely successful
before the s nearly all of the content for the channel was produced by the fifteen franchise licensees the regional companies
however following legislation in the broadcasting act imposing a quota for commissioning of independent productions the number of programmes from independent production companies not connected to the traditional itv network has increased rapidly
notable examples include talkback thames one half of which thames television was itself a former itv franchisee producers of the bill and co producers of the x factor and waytraffic previously celador producers of who wants to be a millionaire
from the late s itv s long standing commitment to strong current affairs and documentary programming began to diminish with the ending of productions such as world in action granada television this week rediffusion london thames television first tuesday yorkshire television network first survival anglia television and weekend world lwt and their replacement with populist shows such as tonight
news at ten was also axed in although it was reinstated in
in december the final edition of itv s long running arts programme the south bank show was broadcast
itv s primetime schedules are dominated by its soap operas such as the flagship coronation street and emmerdale
at the start of the st century independent television faced criticism for including a large amount of reality tv programmes in the schedule such as celebrity fit club celebrity wrestling and celebrity love island
in its defence itv does continue to show its major strengths in the fields of sports coverage and drama productions and it continues to schedule national news in primetime
television has been broadcast on itv at breakfast since february
it was initially run by an independent contractor tv am and later gmtv until gmtv limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of itv plc in november
historically itv aired breakfast programmes from am until am but itv extended this to am on weekdays on january
and now broadcasts two breakfast programmes on weekdays good morning britain and lorraine
good morning britain keeps viewers up to date with all the latest news sports features and weather whilst lorraine predominantly focuses on celebrity interviews recipes fashion and showbiz
at weekends itv breakfast airs children s programming a simulcast of citv breakfast under the citv brand
itv s strong daytime line up helped by programmes such as this morning loose women dickinson s real deal and game shows tipping point and the chase are very popular achieving the highest audience share during the daytime slot
in recent years the network has tried to use formats that itv studios own out right whether they have originated in the uk with their lifted entertainment company or have come from production companies they own abroad though some popular programme formats like the masked singer have still been acquired from other companies abroad
currently itv are behind the formats for dancing on ice the voice uk the format originally coming from their dutch production company and i m a celebrity get me out of here while forthcoming music game show walk the line has been co developed by simon cowell s syco entertainment and itv
since the network started independent television news limited itn has held the contract to produce news for the itv network with minute national news bulletins currently broadcast at pm and pm and an hour long bulletin at pm
these bulletins were broadcast under the itn brand from until when a new network identity reinforced the itv brand resulting in the new bulletins being broadcast under the itv news brand
itn has long been respected in the news industry as a source of reliable information and news and as a result the service has won many awards for their programmes the latest being in may when news at ten was named best news programme by the royal television society and bafta
the itv national weather forecast was first broadcast in using data supplied by the met office and was presented by a number of weather forecasters
the forecasts are sponsored in which the sponsors message would appear prior to and following the forecast
the forecasts are made immediately after the main national news bulletins
prior to the creation of the national forecast each regional company provided its own regional forecast
the regional forecasts today are incorporated into the main regional news bulletins and in the summer months includes a pollen count
currently only new episodes of long form news and current affairs programmes like exposure peston and on assignment are being scheduled after news at ten with the latter title currently only appearing on a month by month basis
as the channel carries a simulcast of the ideal world shopping network for a couple of hours after midnight the time between the news and the shopping is usually kept for re runs with itv repeating its primetime entertainment shows or sports programming from itv
itv continues with its regularly scheduled programming after ideal world at around am with showbiz news bulletin fyi extra and repeats many of which have on screen bsl signing for the deaf community
replacing the information based itv nightscreen slot in was unwind with itv programming produced in association with the campaign against living miserably
at around am each night this mindfulness programme shows calming shots of natural landscapes and relaxing animations for around an hour with versions of the footage also seen on itv itv and itv
the regional itv companies are required to provide local news as part of their franchise agreement together with local weather forecasts with the main local bulletin at pm and regional bulletins located after each national news programme
in addition to this traditionally itv companies would provide other regional programming based on current affairs entertainment or drama
however apart from a monthly political programme most non news regional programming in the english regions was dropped by itv plc in although it continues in wales and the channel islands as well as on stv and utv and itv border in scotland from to cover mainly scottish politics whilst itv border in england broadcast network programming
on january itv plc regional news programmes titles were discontinued in favour of more generic branding under the itv news title with the region listed as the subheading
however some heritage brand names were retained including calendar granada reports and lookaround

since the launch of itv there have been concerns from politicians and the press that itv faced a conflict concerning programme audiences and advertisers
as advertisers are reluctant to buy advertising space around low viewing programmes there is a pressure on itv to broadcast more popular programmes in peak times
this has become more profound in recent years following a relaxation in regulation and significantly more competition in the advertising market following the huge increase in commercial channels
in recent years programmes have started to dominate from the reality television genre including the celebrity and talent show subgenres
this has led to accusations of itv dumbing down their programmes and appealing to the lowest common denominator accusations that are at odds with the network s status as a public service broadcaster
itv was is also heavily criticised for scaling back its regional programmes including regional news also itv has been criticised since for showing emmerdale and coronation street at the weekday slot except tuesdays
there has never been an identity for itv as a whole that was adopted uniformly by all broadcasters within the itv network
before each regional company used its own name for identification and the name itv was rarely seen on screen except for some sub brands such as itv schools or itv sport
from a national itv corporate identity was established which saw regional brands combined with the national itv brand although the balance between regional and national brands varied from company to company and some companies never used the itv brand at all
it was not until that national itv branded continuity was adopted across all the regions in england see itv tv channel although regional continuity before local programmes continued until
on screen branding in the regions that chose to use it
