Render unto Caesar is the beginning of a phrase attributed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels which reads in full Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's
This phrase has become a widely quoted summary of the relationship between Christianity secular government and society The original message coming in response to a question of whether it was lawful for Jews to pay taxes to Caesar gives rise to multiple possible interpretations about the circumstances under which it is desirable for Christians to submit to earthly authority
All three synoptic gospels state that hostile questioners tried to trap Jesus into taking an explicit and dangerous stand on whether Jews should or should not pay taxes to the Roman authorities The accounts in Matthew and Mark say that the questioners were Pharisees and Herodians while Luke says only that they were spies sent by teachers of the law and the chief priests
They anticipated that Jesus would oppose the tax as their purpose was to hand him over to the power and authority of the governor The governor was Pilate and he was the man responsible for the collecting of taxes in Roman Judea Initially the questioners flattered Jesus by praising his integrity impartiality and devotion to truth Then they asked him whether or not it is right for Jews to pay the taxes demanded by Caesar In the Gospel of Mark the additional provocative question is asked Should we pay or shouldn't we
Jesus first called them hypocrites and then asked one of them to produce a Roman coin that would be suitable for paying Caesar's tax One of them showed him a Roman coin and he asked them whose head and inscription were on it They answered Caesar's and he responded Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's
The questioners were impressed Matthew states that they marvelled unable to trap him any further and being satisfied with the answer they went away
A similar episode occurs in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas verse but there the coin in question is gold Importantly in this non canon gospel Jesus adds and give me what is mine The same episode occurs in a fragment of the also apocryphal Egerton Gospel Jesus is asked whether it is right to pay taxes to the rulers i e the Romans to which he becomes indignant and criticizes the questioners by quoting the Book of Isaiah the fragment interrupts immediately after that
The text identifies the coin as a d narion and it is usually thought that the coin was a Roman denarius with the head of Tiberius The coin is also called the tribute penny The inscription reads Ti berivs Caesar Divi Avg vsti F ilivs Avgvstvs Caesar Augustus Tiberius son of the Divine Augustus The reverse shows a seated female usually identified as Livia depicted as Pax
However it has been suggested that denarii were not in common circulation in Judaea during Jesus' lifetime and that the coin may have instead been an Antiochan tetradrachm bearing the head of Tiberius with Augustus on the reverse Another suggestion often made is the denarius of Augustus with Caius and Lucius on the reverse while coins of Julius Caesar Mark Antony and Germanicus are all considered possibilities
A similar episode occurs in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas verse but there the coin in question is gold The taxes imposed on Judaea by Rome had led to riots New Testament scholar Willard Swartley writes
The tax denoted in the text was a specific tax It was a poll tax a tax instituted in A D A census taken at that time cf Lk to determine the resources of the Jews provoked the wrath of the country Judas of Galilee led a revolt Acts which was suppressed only with some difficulty Many scholars date the origin of the Zealot party and movement to this incident The Jewish Encyclopedia says of the Zealots
When in the year Judas of Gamala in Galilee started his organized opposition to Rome he was joined by one of the leaders of the Pharisees R Zadok a disciple of Shammai and one of the fiery patriots and popular heroes who lived to witness the tragic end of Jerusalem The taking of the census by Quirinus the Roman procurator for the purpose of taxation was regarded as a sign of Roman enslavement and the Zealots' call for stubborn resistance to the oppressor was responded to enthusiastically At his trial before Pontius Pilate Jesus was accused of promoting resistance to Caesar's tax
Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate And they began to accuse him saying We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king Luke The passage has been much discussed in the modern context of Christianity and politics especially
on the questions of separation of church and state and tax resistance
When Jesus later was crucified he was in a sense rendering unto Caesar the body that belonged to Caesar's human earthly realm while devoting his soul to God Augustine of Hippo suggested this interpretation in his Confessions where he writes
He himself the only begotten was created to be wisdom and justice and holiness for us and he was counted among us and he paid the reckoning the tribute to Caesar Jesus responds to Pontius Pilate about the nature of his kingdom My kingdom is not of this world If my kingdom were of this world my servants would have been fighting that I might not be delivered over to the Jews But now or 'as it is' my kingdom is not from the world John i e his religious teachings were separate from earthly political activity This reflects a traditional division in Christian thought by which state and church have separate spheres of influence This can be interpreted either a Catholic or Thomist way Gelasian doctrine or a Protestant or Lockean way separation of church and state
Tertullian in De Idololatria interprets Jesus as saying to render the image of Caesar which is on the coin to Caesar and the image of God which is on man to God so as to render to Caesar indeed money to God yourself Otherwise what will be God's if all things are Caesar's
H B Clark writes It is a doctrine of both Mosaic and Christian law that governments are divinely ordained and derive their powers from God In the Old Testament it is asserted that Power belongs unto God Ps that God removes kings and sets up kings Dan and that The Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He will Dan Similarly in the New Testament it is stated that there is no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God Rom
R J Rushdoony expands In early America there was no question whatever the form of civil government that all legitimate authority is derived from God Under a biblical doctrine of authority because the powers that be are ordained of God Rom all authority whether in the home school state church or any other sphere is subordinate authority and is under God and subject to His word This means first that all obedience is subject to the prior obedience to God and his Word for We ought to obey God rather than men Acts Although civil obedience is commanded it is equally apparent that the prior requirement of obedience to God must prevail
Some read the phrase Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's as unambiguous at least to the extent that it commands people to respect state authority and to pay the taxes it demands of them Paul the Apostle also states in Romans that Christians are obliged to obey all earthly authorities stating that as they were introduced by God disobedience to them equates to disobedience to God
In this interpretation Jesus asked his interrogators to produce a coin in order to demonstrate to them that by using his coinage they had already admitted the de facto rule of the emperor and that therefore they should submit to that rule
Some see the parable as being Jesus' message to people that if they enjoy the advantages of a state such as Caesar's as distinct from God's authority for instance by using its legal tender they can't subsequently choose to ignore the laws of such a state Henry David Thoreau writes in Civil Disobedience
Christ answered the Herodians according to their condition Show me the tribute money said he and one took a penny out of his pocket If you use money which has the image of Caesar on it and which he has made current and valuable that is if you are men of the State and gladly enjoy the advantages of Caesar's government then pay him back some of his own when he demands it Render therefore to Caesar that which is Caesar's and to God those things which are God's leaving them no wiser than before as to which was which for they did not wish to know Mennonite Dale Glass Hess wrote
It is inconceivable to me that Jesus would teach that some spheres of human activity lie outside the authority of God Are we to heed Caesar when he says to go to war or support war making when Jesus says in other places that we shall not kill No My perception of this incident is that Jesus does not answer the question about the morality of paying taxes to Caesar but that he throws it back on the people to decide When the Jews produce a denarius at Jesus' request they demonstrate that they are already doing business with Caesar on Caesar's terms I read Jesus' statement Give to Caesar as meaning Have you incurred a debt in regard to Caesar Then you better pay it off The Jews had already compromised themselves Likewise for us we may refuse to serve Caesar as soldiers and even try to resist paying for Caesar's army But the fact is that by our lifestyles we've run up a debt with Caesar who has felt constrained to defend the interests that support our lifestyles Now he wants paid back and it's a little late to say that we don't owe anything We've already compromised ourselves If we're going to play Caesar's games then we should expect to have to pay for the pleasure of their enjoyment But if we are determined to avoid those games then we should be able to avoid paying for them Mohandas K Gandhi shared this perspective He wrote
Jesus evaded the direct question put to him because it was a trap He was in no way bound to answer it He therefore asked to see the coin for taxes And then said with withering scorn How can you who traffic in Caesar's coins and thus receive what to you are benefits of Caesar's rule refuse to pay taxes Jesus' whole preaching and practice point unmistakably to noncooperation which necessarily includes nonpayment of taxes Mennonite pastor John K Stoner spoke for those who interpret the parable as permitting or even encouraging tax resistance We are war tax resisters because we have discovered some doubt as to what belongs to Caesar and what belongs to God and have decided to give the benefit of the doubt to God
The German theologian Justus Knecht gives the typical pro government Roman Catholic interpretation
Obedience to temporal authority We are not only allowed but commanded to obey the authority of the state and to pay such taxes c as are a due for the authority of the state is ordained by God to protect the lives and property of subjects If there were no temporal authority disorder robbery murder c would be rampant and therefore as the authority of the state exists for the good of subjects it is the duty of these last to pay those taxes c without which it cannot be kept up
As American Quaker war tax resistance developed during the th through th centuries the resisters had to find a way to reconcile their tax resistance with the Render unto Caesar verse and other verses from the New Testament that encourage submission to the government Here are a few examples
Around a pseudonymous author Philalethes published a pamphlet entitled Tribute to C sar How paid by the Best Christians in which he argued that while Christians must pay general taxes a tax that is explicitly for war purposes is the equivalent to an offering on an altar to a pagan god and this is forbidden
In Joshua Evans put it this way
Others would term it stubbornness in me or contrary to the doctrine of Christ concerning rendering to Caesar his due But as I endeavored to keep my mind in a state of humble quietude I was favored to see through such groundless arguments there being nothing on the subject of war or favorable to it to be found in that text Although I have been willing to pay my money for the use of civil government when legally called for yet have I felt restrained by a conscientious motive from paying towards the expense of killing men women and children or laying towns and countries waste In Samuel Allinson circulated a letter on the subject of tax resistance in which he insisted that what was due to Caesar was only what Caesar would not use for antichristian purposes
the question put to our Savior on the point was with evil intention to ensnare and render him culpable to one of the great parties or sects then existing who differed about the payment of taxes his answer though conclusive was so wisely framed that it left them still in doubt what things belonged to C sar and what to God thus he avoided giving either of them offence which he must inevitably have done by a determination that tribute indefinitely was due to C sar Our first and principle obedience is due to the Almighty even in contradiction to man We ought to obey God rather than men Acts Hence if tribute is demanded for a use that is antichristian it seems right for every Christian to deny it for C sar can have no title to that which opposes the Lord's command In Joshua Maule wrote that he felt that the Render unto Caesar instruction was compatible with war tax resistance as there was no reason to believe for certain that the tax referred to in that episode had any connection to war
The words of Christ Render to C sar the things that are C sar's and to God the things that are God's have often been brought forward as evidence that He approved of paying all taxes it being said in connection that C sar was then engaged in war The distinction however is sufficiently clear the things that were C sar's were doubtless those which appertain to the civil government the things which belong to God are surely a clear and full obedience to His commands and to His laws We know that all the precepts and commands of Christ which can be applied in reference to this subject are of one tendency enjoining peace on earth and good will to men We do not know after all however what was the exact nature and use of the tribute collected in those days nor what were the situation and circumstances in which Christians or others were then placed in regard to such things Christian anarchists do not interpret Matthew as advocating support for taxes but as further advice to free oneself from material attachment Jacques Ellul believes the passage shows that Caesar may have rights over the money that he produces but not things that are made by God as he explains
Ammon Hennacy interpreted Matthew slightly differently He was on trial for civil disobedience and was asked by the judge to reconcile his tax resistance with Jesus' instructions I told him Caesar was getting too much around here and some one had to stand up for God Elsewhere he interpreted the story in this way
The extracanonical Gospel of Thomas also has a version which reads in the Stephen Patterson and Marvin Meyer Version
They showed Jesus a gold coin and said to him The Roman emperor's people demand taxes from us He said to them Give the emperor what belongs to the emperor give God what belongs to God and give me what is mine The fragmentary Egerton Gospel in the Scholar's Version translation found in The Complete Gospels reads
They come to him and interrogate him as a way of putting him to the test They ask Teacher Jesus we know that you are from God since the things you do put you above all the prophets Tell us then is it permissible to pay to rulers what is due them Should we pay them or not Jesus knew what they were up to and became indignant Then he said to them Why do you pay me lip service as a teacher but not do what I say How accurately Isaiah prophesied about you when he said 'This people honors me with their lips but their heart stays far away from me their worship of me is empty because they insist on teachings that are human commandments 'Caesaropapism
