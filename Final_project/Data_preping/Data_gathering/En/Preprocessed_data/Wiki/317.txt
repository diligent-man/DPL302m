second demographic transition occurred due significant cultural shift leading decline desire children
demographic transition population shift one high child mortality rate high fertility rate one low both
initially child mortality rate dropped significantly due improved healthcare sanitation better nutrition yet fertility rate remained high leading population boom
gradually fertility rate fell people became affluent better access contraception

century marriage rate increased people getting married young age end century average age marriage started increase slowly
one theory greater prosperity allowed people finance marriage new household earlier previously possible
birth within marriage seems inevitable marriage rate birth rate would rise together
birth rate originally measured 'crude birth rate' birth per year divided total population

net reproduction rate wa introduced alternative measure measure average fertility rate woman child-bearing ages

olden day people typically many child could afford order ensure least would survive adulthood child due high child mortality rates
moreover wa poor incentive curb fertility whereas rich lacked need due greater wealth lower child mortality rates
people longer needed many child ensure propagation genes

factor linked general intelligence socioeconomic status educational attainment also found negatively correlated fertility starting nineteenth century

stokes showed light polarisation described term known stokes parameters
founded eighteenth century calculus variation grew much favored mathematical tool among physicists
william rowan hamilton advanced course construct deductive framework optic applied idea mechanics
appropriate variational principle one could deduce equation motion given mechanical optical system
soon scientist worked variational principle theory elasticity electromagnetism fluid mechanic future relativity quantum theory
whilst variational principle necessarily provide simpler way solve problem interest philosophical aesthetic reason though scientist time motivated religion work predecessors
hamilton's work physic wa great achievement wa able provide unifying mathematical framework wave propagation particle motion
light description becomes clear wave corpuscle theory light equally able account phenomenon reflection refraction
hamilton's equation also proved useful calculating planetary orbits
john james waterson submitted royal society paper kinetic theory gas included statement equipartition theorem calculation ratio specific heat gases
although paper wa read society abstract published waterson's paper faced antipathy
time kinetic theory gas wa considered highly speculative wa based not-accepted atomic hypothesis
unlike predecessor using average maxwell's paper explicitly statistical nature
although speed would cluster around average molecule moving faster slower average
showed distribution function temperature mathematically described various property gas diffusion viscosity
wa verified series experiment maxwell conducted wife katherine
experimental verification maxwell distribution wa obtained till year later however
meantime austrian ludwig boltzmann developed maxwell's statistic proved using the
-function maxwellian distribution stable non-maxwellian distribution would morph it
dynamic rigid body edward john routh noted importance called absent coordinate also known cyclic coordinate ignorable coordinate following terminology e
routh also devised new method solving problem mechanics
although routh's procedure doe add new insight allows systematic convenient analysis especially problem many degree freedom least cyclic coordinates
request british association advancement science year edmund taylor whittaker submitted report progress solution problem three bodies
time classical mechanic general three-body problem particular captured imagination many talented mathematician whose contribution whittaker covered report
whittaker later incorporated report textbook titled analytical dynamic particle rigid body first edition
helped provide scientific basis aerospace industry twentieth century
traditional caloric theory heat began losing favour dynamical alternative posit heat kind motion
brewer amateur scientist james prescott joule wa one proponent latter
joule's intricate experimentsthe successful involved heating water paddle wheelsmaking full use skill temperature control brewer demonstrated decisively reality mechanical equivalent heat would later become known conservation energy wa pursued many worker approaching subject variety background medicine physiology physic engineering
another notable contributor development wa german researcher hermann von helmholtz gave essentially newtonian mechanical account
william thomson later lord kelvin received work joule helmholtz positively embracing providing support emerging science energy late kelvin friend william john macquorn rankine german rudolf clausius published steady stream paper concerning heat engine absolute temperature scale
indeed commercial value new science already become apparent time businessmen quite willing offer generous financial support researchers
rankine spoke confidently new science thermodynamics term kelvin coined whose fundamental principle came known first second law whose core concept energy entropy kelvin peter guthrie tait's treatise natural philosophy wa attempt reformulate physic term energy
kelvin tait introduced phrase kinetic energy instead 'actual' standard usage
practical side food-preserving effect low temperature long recognised
natural ice wa vigorously traded early nineteenth century wa inevitably short supply especially australia
eighteenth nineteenth century wa considerable commercial incentive develop ever effective refrigerator thanks expansion agriculture america australia new zealand rapid urbanization western europe
onward refrigerator relied expansion compressed air evaporation volatile liquid evaporation became basis modern refrigerator designs
long-distance shipping perishable food meat boomed late s
theoretical side new refrigeration technique also great value
absolute temperature scale lord kelvin deduced existence absolute zero occurring c
scientist began trying reach ever lower temperature liquefy every gas encountered
paved way development low-temperature physic third law thermodynamics
study natural history wa powerfully advanced charles darwin theory evolution first published book origin specie in
research geology evolutionary biology naturally led question old earth was
indeed mid-s mid-s wa topic increasingly sophisticated intellectual discussions
advent thermodynamics became clear earth sun must old finite age
whatever energy source sun must finite since constantly dissipating must day sun run energy
lord kelvin wrote within finite period time past earth must within finite period time come earth must unfit habitation man present constituted unless operation performed impossible law known operation going subject kelvin employed mathematical model von helmholtz suggesting energy sun
missing ingredient wa radioactivity wa known science till end nineteenth century
dane han christian rsted demonstrated wa possible deflect magnetic needle closing opening electric circuit nearby deluge paper attempting explain phenomenon wa published
michael faraday set task clarifying nature electricity magnetism experiments
devised could described first electric motor though doe resemble modern one transformer used step voltage step current vice versa dynamo contains basic electric turbine generators
practical value faraday's research electricity magnetism wa nothing short revolutionary
dynamo convert mechanical energy electrical current whilst motor doe reverse
world's first power plant entered service following year people realized possibility using electricity power variety household appliances
inventor engineer soon raced develop item starting affordable durable incandescent light bulb perhaps important early application electricity
foremost expert electricity magnetism time lord kelvin oversaw laying trans-atlantic telegraphic cable became successful in
drawing work predecessor especially experimental research michael faraday analogy heat flow lord kelvin mathematical analysis george green james clerk maxwell synthesized wa known electricity magnetism single mathematical framework maxwell's equations
maxwell used equation predict existence electromagnetic wave travel speed light
ingenious experiment maxwell's prediction wa confirmed german physicist heinrich hertz
process hertz generated detected called radio wave built crude radio antenna predecessor satellite dishes
dutch physicist hendrik lorentz derived using suitable boundary condition fresnel's equation reflection transmission light different medium maxwell's equations
also showed maxwell's theory succeeded illuminating phenomenon light dispersion model failed
john william strutt lord rayleigh american josiah willard gibbs proved optical equation derived maxwell's theory self-consistent description reflection refraction dispersion light consistent experimental results
wa oliver heaviside enthusiastic supporter maxwell's electromagnetic theory deserves credit shaping people understood applied maxwell's work decade come
maxwell originally wrote grand total equation electromagnetic field later reduced eight
heaviside rewrote form commonly used today four expressions
addition heaviside wa responsible considerable progress electrical telegraphy telephony study propagation electromagnetic waves
independent gibbs heaviside assembled set mathematical tool known vector calculus replace quaternion vogue time heaviside dismissed antiphysical unnatural
faraday also investigated electrical current affected chemical solutions
together whewell faraday introduced basic vocabulary subject word electrode anode cathode electrolysis electrolyte ion anion cation
faraday memorial lecture german hermann von helmholtz asserted faraday's law electrochemistry hinted atomic structure matter
chemical element distinguishable one another simple ratio mass amount electricity deposited amount element upon pole ratio electricity must also come discrete unit later named electrons
late nineteenth century nature energy emitted discharge high-voltage electrode inside evacuated tubecathode raysattracted attention many physicists
german thought cathode ray wave british french believed particles
thompson directed dedicate experiment demonstrating cathode ray fact negatively charged particle called electrons
experiment enabled thompson calculate ratio magnitude charge mass particle
addition ratio wa regardless metal used thompson concluded electron must constituent atoms
although atom chemical element different number electron electron identical
inspired exploration abstract algebra george peacock augustus de morgan george boole published book titled investigation law thought brought study logic philosophy metaphysics mathematics
stated goal wa investigate fundamental law operation mind reasoning performed give expression symbolical language calculus upon foundation establish science logical construct method although ignored first boolean algebra known became central design circuit computer following century
people devised machine century mathematician continued perform calculation hand machine offered little advantage speed
complicated calculation employed table especially logarithmic trigonometric function computed hand
right middle industrial revolution england charles babbage thought using all-important steam engine power mechanical computer difference engine
unfortunately whilst babbage managed secure government fund construction machine government subsequently lost interest babbage faced considerable trouble developing necessary machine components
like modern computer consisted two basic part one store number processed store one performed operation mill
babbage adopted concept punch card french engineer joseph jacquard used automate textile industry france control operation analytical engine
unfortunately lacked financial resource build remained theoretical construct
leave behind detailed note engineering drawing modern expert conclude technology time wa advanced enough actually build even never enough money so
babbage went turin give lecture work designing analytical engine italian scientists
ada lovelace translated note published one attendee english heavily annotated it
wrote first computer program case one computing bernoulli numbers
employed modern computer programmer would recognise loop decision step gave detailed diagram possibly first flowchart ever created
noted calculating machine could perform arithmetic operation also symbolic manipulations
steam ship one key britain's prosperity nineteenth century
starting late people begun building steam-powered ship ever increasing size operational range speed first cross english channel atlantic finally reach place far away india australia without refuel mid-route
international trade travel boosted demand wa intense competition among shipping companies
steam ship great britain great western made international travel common also advanced trade britain wa luxury good earlier time imported country essential raw material corn cotton united state meat wool australia
foot long foot wide weighing ton great eastern wa largest ship built time capable transporting passenger britain australia without refuel along way
even wa finally broken scrap wa still largest ship world
record wa broken till edwardian era super liner like lusitania titanic in
yet despite remarkable feat engineering great eastern became white elephant smaller faster ship greater demand
nevertheless gained new lease life wa chartered lay telegraphic cable across atlantic india
british government long realised national prosperity depended trade
reason deployed royal navy protect maritime trade route financed construction many steam ships
although idea transmitting message via electrical signal dated back eighteenth century wa advance study electricity magnetism made practical reality
william fothergill cooke charles wheatstone invented telegraphic system used electrical current deflect magnetic needle thus transmitting coded messages
design soon made way across britain appearing every town post office
mid-s telegraphic cable wa laid across english channel irish sea north sea
little decade later telephone service britain america telephones
hertz's experimental work electromagnetism stimulated interest possibility wireless communication require long expensive cable wa faster even telegraph
receiving little support native italy guglielmo marconi moved england adapted hertz's equipment purpose s
achieved first international wireless transmission england france following year succeeded sending message morse code across atlantic
radio broadcasting became extremely popular twentieth century remains common use early twenty-first
fact global communication network twenty-first century ha root victorian era
photography wa realised louis daguerre france william fox talbot britain
another important innovation communication wa penny black first postage stamp standardised postage flat price regardless distance sent
central development victorian era wa rise rail transport
new railway allowed good raw material people moved rapidly facilitating trade industry
retained ownership share even turning management local ownership wa largely liquidated pay world war
railroad originated england industrialist already discovered need inexpensive transportation haul coal new steam engine supply part specialized factory take product market
existing system canal wa inexpensive wa slow limited geography
railway system led reorganisation society generally railway time standard clock set throughout britain complex railway system setting standard technological advance efficiency
engineer businessmen needed create finance railway system available knew invent build finance large complex system
first quarter century involved numerous experiment locomotive rail technology
railway commercially feasible demonstrated george stephenson built stockton darlington
first run locomotive pulled freight passenger car speed high mile per hour
stephenson went design many railway best known standardizing design standard gauge rail spacing foot inches
thomas brassey wa even prominent operating construction crew one point totalled men throughout europe british empire latin america
brassey took thousand british engineer mechanic across globe build new lines
invented improved thousand mechanical device developed science civil engineering build roadway tunnel bridges
britain superior financial system based london funded railway britain also many part world including united state until
boom year parliament authorised mile line projected cost million wa value country's annual gross domestic product gdp time
new railway needed charter typically cost million obtain parliament opposition could effectively prevent construction
canal company unable unwilling upgrade facility compete railway used political power try stop them
railway responded purchasing fourth canal system part get right way part buy critics
charter wa obtained wa little government regulation laissez-faire private ownership become accepted practices
different line typically exclusive territory given compact size britain meant multiple competing line could provide service major cities
merged various independent line set clearing house rationalized interconnection establishing uniform paperwork standard method transferring passenger freight line rate one system used freight car owned another
rate fallen penny ton mile coal speed fifty mile hour
britain model world well integrated well-engineered system allowed fast cheap movement freight people could replicated major nations
railway directly indirectly employed ten thousand engineer mechanic repairman technician well statistician financial planners
important created mindset technology could used many different form business
lowering transportation cost reduced cost industry moving supply finished good increased demand production input needed railroad system itself
member parliament solicitor city london charles pearson campaigned underground rail service london
part first railway metropolitan line opened public thereby becoming first subway line world
train originally steam-powered first electric train entered service
year whole system became officially known tube shape rail tunnels
india provides example london-based financier pouring money expertise well built system designed military reason mutiny hope would stimulate industry
system wa overbuilt much elaborate expensive small amount freight traffic carried
however capture imagination indian saw railway symbol industrial modernitybut one wa realised century later
model town saltaire wa founded along others planned environment good sanitation many civic educational recreational facility although lacked pub wa regarded focus dissent
although initially developed early year century gas lighting became widespread victorian era industry home public building streets
invention incandescent gas mantle greatly improved light output ensured survival late s
incandescent electric light introduced london street although took many year installed everywhere
fact medicine start nineteenth century wa little different medieval era whereas end century became lot closer twenty-first century practice thanks advance science especially microbiology paving way germ theory disease
wa height industrial revolution urbanisation occurred frantic pace
population density city grew epidemic cholera smallpox tuberculosis typhus commonplace
studying previous outbreak physician john snow drew conclusion cholera wa water-borne disease
broke snow mapped location case soho london found centered around well deemed contaminated
snow also discovered household whose water supply came company used thames downstream many sewer flown river fourteen time likely die cholera
sanitation reform prompted public health act made crowded dirty street existing city soap wa main product shown relatively new phenomenon advertising
great engineering feat victorian era wa sewage system london
proposed build mi km sewer system linked mi km street sewers
bazalgette designed thames embankment housed sewer water pipe london underground
period london's water supply network wa expanded improved
john simon chief medical officer general board health secured fund research various common infectious disease time including cholera diphtheria smallpox typhus
using political influence garnered support public health act focused preventative measure housing water supply sewage drainage providing britain extensive public health system
mid-century stethoscope became oft-used device design microscope advanced enough scientist closely examine pathogens
pioneering work french microbiologist louis pasteur earned widespread acceptance germ theory disease
led introduction antiseptic joseph lister form carbolic acid phenol
instructed hospital staff wear glove wash hand instrument dressing phenol solution invented machine would spray carbolic acid operating theatre surgery
british empire expanded briton found facing novel climate contagion wa active research tropical diseases
ronald ross proved mosquito wa responsible spreading malaria
although nitrous oxide laughing gas proposed anaesthetic far back humphry davy wa american dentist named william morton started using ether patient anaesthetic became common medical profession
chloroform wa favoured doctor hospital staff much le flammable ether critic complained could cause patient heart attack
chloroform gained popularity england germany john snow gave queen victoria chloroform birth eighth child prince leopold
chloroform wa used narcoses performed uk german-speaking countries
combination antiseptic anaesthetic helped surgeon operate carefully comfortably patients
time sugar consumption british diet increased greatly increasing instance tooth decay
gave rise waterloo teeth real human teeth set hand-carved piece ivory hippopotamus walrus jaws
teeth obtained executed criminal victim battlefield grave-robbers even bought directly desperately impoverished
increase tooth decay also brought first prominent recommendation fluoride nutrient particularly pregnancy childhood in
medical value wa realised immediately within year doctor prescribing x-ray diagnosis particular locate bone fracture foreign object inside patient's body
radioactivity wa discovered wa later used treat cancer
second half nineteenth century british medical doctor became increasingly specialised following footstep german counterpart hospital built
surgeon began wearing gown operating room doctor white coat stethoscope sight common early twenty-first century
yet despite aforementioned medical advance mortality rate fell marginally per thousand end century
urbanisation aided spread disease squalid living condition many place exacerbated problem
moreover disease cholera driven others sexually transmitted disease made felt
