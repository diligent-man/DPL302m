in the history of the united kingdom the victorian era was the period of queen victoria s reign from june until her death on january
the era followed the georgian period and preceded the edwardian period and its later half overlaps with the first part of the belle poque era of continental europe
there was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches such as the methodists and the evangelical wing of the established church of england
ideologically the victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism in religion social values and arts
this era saw a staggering amount of technological innovations that proved key to britain s power and prosperity
doctors started moving away from tradition and mysticism towards a science based approach medicine advanced thanks to the adoption of the germ theory of disease and pioneering research in epidemiology
domestically the political agenda was increasingly liberal with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform improved social reform and the widening of the franchise
there were unprecedented demographic changes the population of england and wales almost doubled from million in to million in and scotland s population also rose rapidly from million in to million in
however ireland s population decreased sharply from million in to less than million in mostly due to emigration and the great famine
between and about million emigrated from great britain mostly to the united states as well as to imperial outposts in canada south africa new zealand and australia
thanks to educational reforms the british population not only approached universal literacy towards the end of the era but also became increasingly well educated the market for reading materials of all kinds boomed
britain s relations with the other great powers were driven by antagonism with russia including the crimean war and the great game
a pax britannica of peaceful trade was maintained by the country s naval and industrial supremacy
britain embarked on global imperial expansion particularly in asia and africa which made the british empire the largest empire in history
national self confidence peaked
britain granted political autonomy to the more advanced colonies of australia canada and new zealand
apart from the crimean war britain was not involved in any armed conflict with another major power
the two main political parties during the era remained the whigs liberals and the conservatives by its end the labour party had formed as a distinct political entity
these parties were led by such prominent statesmen as lord melbourne sir robert peel lord derby lord palmerston benjamin disraeli william gladstone and lord salisbury
the unsolved problems relating to irish home rule played a great part in politics in the later victorian era particularly in view of gladstone s determination to achieve a political settlement in ireland
in the strictest sense the victorian era covers the duration of victoria s reign as queen of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland from her accession on june after the death of her uncle william iv until her death on january after which she was succeeded by her eldest son edward vii
her reign lasted for years and seven months a longer period than any of her predecessors
the term victorian was in contemporaneous usage to describe the era
the era has also been understood in a more extensive sense as a period that possessed sensibilities and characteristics distinct from the periods adjacent to it in which case it is sometimes dated to begin before victoria s accession typically from the passage of or agitation for during the s the reform act which introduced a wide ranging change to the electoral system of england and wales
definitions that purport a distinct sensibility or politics to the era have also created scepticism about the worth of the label victorian though there have also been defences of it
michael sadleir was insistent that in truth the victorian period is three periods and not one
he distinguished early victorianism the socially and politically unsettled period from to and late victorianism from onwards with its new waves of aestheticism and imperialism from the victorian heyday mid victorianism to
he saw the latter period as characterized by a distinctive mixture of prosperity domestic prudery and complacency what g
trevelyan similarly called the mid victorian decades of quiet politics and roaring prosperity
in after much political agitation the reform act was passed on the third attempt
the act abolished many borough seats and created others in their place as well as expanding the franchise in england and wales a scottish reform act and irish reform act were passed separately
minor reforms followed in and
on june victoria became queen of the united kingdom on the death of her uncle william iv just weeks after reaching the age of eighteen
her government was led by the whig prime minister lord melbourne to whom she was close
but within two years he had resigned and the tory politician sir robert peel attempted to form a new ministry
peel said he was willing to become prime minister provided the queen replaced her whig ladies in waiting with tory ones
she refused and re appointed lord melbourne a decision criticised as unconstitutional
britain sent lord durham to resolve the issue and his report opened the way for responsible government that is self government
in the same year a seizure of british opium exports to china prompted the first opium war against the qing dynasty
british defense of india initiated the first anglo afghan war one of the first major conflicts of the great game between britain and russia
in south africa the dutch boers made their great trek to found natal the transvaal and the orange free state defeating the zulus in the process britain annexed natal in but recognized the independence of the transvaal in in the orange free state in
in queen victoria married her german cousin prince albert of saxe coburg saalfield
it proved a passionate marriage whose children were much sought after by royal families across europe
an astute diplomat the queen was only too willing to arrange such marriages
indeed she became the grandmother of europe thanks to the nine children she had with prince albert in just sixteen years despite suffering from postnatal depression and her dislike of childbirth
unfortunately she carried the gene for haemophilia which affected ten of her male descendants incuding the heir apparent of tsar nicholas ii
in australia new provinces were founded with victoria in and south australia in
the focus shifted from transportation of criminals to voluntary immigration
new zealand became a british colony in in maori chiefs ceded sovereignty to britain in treaty of waitangi
in new zealand became an autonomous colony
the signing of the treaty of nanking in ended the first opium war and gave britain control over hong kong island
however a disastrous retreat from kabul in the same year led to the annihilation of a british army column in afghanistan
in the great famine began to cause mass starvation disease and death in ireland sparking large scale emigration
to allow more cheap food into ireland the peel government repealed the corn laws
peel was replaced by the whig ministry of lord john russell
in britain fought alongside france in the crimean war against russia
the goal was to ensure that russia could not benefit from the declining status of the ottoman empire a strategic consideration known as the eastern question
the conflict marked a rare breach in the pax britannica the period of relative peace that existed among the great powers of the time and especially in britain s interaction with them
on its conclusion in with the treaty of paris russia was prohibited from hosting a military presence in crimea
in october of the same year the second opium war saw britain overpower the qing dynasty in china
along with other major powers britain took steps in obtaining special trading and legal rights in a limited number of treaty ports
it was during the crimean war that the queen introduced the victoria cross awarded on the basis of valour and merit regardless of rank
the first crosses were handed out to men in a ceremony at hyde park in the first time officers and men were decorated together
during an uprising by sepoys against the east india company was suppressed an event that led to the end of company rule in india and the transferral of administration to direct rule by the british government
the princely states were not affected and remained under british guidance
english was imposed as the medium of education
in prince albert died
queen victoria went into mourning and withdrew from public life for ten years
whilst the cabinet leaned toward recognition of the confederacy during the american civil war public opinion was split
confederate foreign policy planners had hoped that the value of their cotton exports would encourage european powers to intervene in their favour
it was not to be and the british attitude might have been decisive
being cut off from cotton did not affect the british economy as much as the confederates had expected
a considerable supply was available to great britain when the american civil war erupted and she was able to turn to india and egypt as alternatives when that ran out
in the end the government decided to remain neutral upon realising that war with the united states would be highly dangerous for that country provided much of britain s food supply especially wheat and its navy could sink much of the merchant fleet
ambassador to britain charles francis adams sr
succeeded in resolving thorny problems that could have driven the two powers into war
but once it was clear that the united states had the upper hand on the battlefield the possibility of an anglo american war vanished her diary entries suggest the queen had contemplated the possibility of a union of her north american colonies as early as february
she wrote we must struggle for it and far the best it would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an english prince she also mentioned how her late husband prince albert had hoped that one day their sons would rule over the british colonies
in february the queen received a copy of the british north america act also known as the constitution act
a fortnight later she hosted delegates coming to discuss the question of confederation under the name of canada including the future prime minister john a
macdonald
on march the queen granted royal assent to the act which became effective on july
canada maintained strong ties with the queen
victoria in british columbia and victoria county in nova scotia were named after her regina in saskatchewan in her honour prince edward island her father and alberta her daughter
her birthday victoria day is an official public holiday in canada
in addition her daughter princess louise was chatelaine of rideau hall from to and her son the duke of connaught served as governor general of canada between and
in the second reform act was passed expanding the franchise
in just a year after the france expelled its emperor republican sentiments grew in britain
after prince edward recovered from typhoid the queen decided to give a public thanksgiving service and appear on the balcony of buckingham palace
this was the start of her return to public life
key leaders included conservatives benjamin disraeli and robert gascoyne cecil rd marquess of salisbury and liberals william ewart gladstone the earl of rosebery and william harcourt
they introduced various reforms aimed at strengthening the political autonomy of large industrial cities and increasing british involvement in the international stage
labour movements were recognised and integrated in order to combat extremism
both queen victoria and prince albert favoured moderate improvements to conditions of workers
queen victoria found in disraeli a trustworthy adviser
she approved of his policies which helped elevated britain s status to global superpower
in her later years her popularity soared as she became a symbol of the british empire
the major new policies included rapid succession the complete abolition of slavery in the african possessions the end of transportation of convicts to australia loosening restrictions on colonial trade and introducing responsible government
david livingstone led famous expeditions in central africa positioning britain for favourable expansion of its colonial system in the scramble for africa during the s
there were numerous revolts and violent conflicts in the british empire but there were no wars with other major nations
in south africa tensions escalated especially with the discovery of gold
the result was the first boer war in and the intensely bitter second boer war in
the british finally prevailed but lost prestige at home and abroad
after weeks of illness queen victoria died on january
by her bedside were her son and heir edward vii and grandson kaiser wilhelm ii
despite their difficult relations edward vii never severed ties with the queen
like her he modernised the british monarchy and ensured its survival when so many european royal families collapsed as a result of the first world war
the rise of the middle class during the era had a formative effect on its character the historian walter e
houghton reflects that once the middle class attained political as well as financial eminence their social influence became decisive
the victorian frame of mind is largely composed of their characteristic modes of thought and feeling
industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class whose increase in numbers had a significant effect on the social strata itself cultural norms lifestyle values and morality
identifiable characteristics came to define the middle class home and lifestyle
previously in town and city residential space was adjacent to or incorporated into the work site virtually occupying the same geographical space
the difference between private life and commerce was a fluid one distinguished by an informal demarcation of function
in the victorian era english family life increasingly became compartmentalised the home a self contained structure housing a nuclear family extended according to need and circumstance to include blood relations
the concept of privacy became a hallmark of the middle class life
the central feature of victorian era politics is the search for reform and improvement including both the individual personality and society
three powerful forces were at work
first was the rapid rise of the middle class in large part displacing the complete control long exercised by the aristocracy
respectability was their code a businessman had to be trusted and must avoid reckless gambling and heavy drinking
second the spiritual reform closely linked to evangelical christianity including both the nonconformist sects such as the methodists and especially the evangelical or low church element in the established church of england typified by lord shaftesbury
it imposed fresh moralistic values on society such as sabbath observance responsibility widespread charity discipline in the home and self examination for the smallest faults and needs of improvement
starting with the anti slavery movement of the s the evangelical moralizers developed highly effective techniques of enhancing the moral sensibilities of all family members and reaching the public at large through intense very well organized agitation and propaganda
they focused on exciting a personal revulsion against social evils and personal misbehaviour
asa briggs points out there were as many treatises on domestic economy in mid victorian england as on political economy
the third effect came from the liberalism of philosophical utilitarians led by intellectuals jeremy bentham james mill and his son john stuart mill
they were not moralistic but scientific
their movement often called philosophic radicalism fashioned a formula for promoting the goal of progress using scientific rationality and business like efficiency to identify measure and discover solutions to social problems
the formula was an inquiry legislation execution inspection and report
in public affairs their leading exponent was edwin chadwick
evangelicals and utilitarians shared a basic middle class ethic of responsibility and formed a political alliance
the result was an irresistible force for reform
social reforms focused on ending slavery removing the slavery like burdens on women and children and reforming the police to prevent crime rather than emphasizing the very harsh punishment of criminals
even more important were political reforms especially the lifting of disabilities on nonconformists and roman catholics and above all the reform of parliament and elections to introduce democracy and replace the old system whereby senior aristocrats controlled dozens of seats in parliament
the long term effect of the reform movements was to tightly link the nonconformist element with the liberal party
the dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues such as temperance and sabbath enforcement
the nonconformist conscience as it was called was repeatedly called upon by gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy
in election after election protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the liberal ticket
in scotland the presbyterians played a similar role to the nonconformist methodists baptists and other groups in england and wales
the political strength of dissent faded sharply after with the secularization of british society in the th century
religion was a battleground during this era with the nonconformists fighting bitterly against the established status of the church of england especially regarding education and access to universities and public office
penalties on roman catholics were mostly removed
the vatican restored the english catholic bishoprics in and numbers grew through conversions and immigration from ireland
the oxford movement was also occurring around this time which would draw in new converts to the catholic church among these was john henry newman
secularism and doubts about the accuracy of the old testament grew as the scientific outlooked rapidly gained ground among the better educated
walter e
houghton argues perhaps the most important development in th century intellectual history was the extension of scientific assumptions and methods from the physical world to the whole life of man
during the mid nineteenth century there were two distinct religious mentalities among british academics
the north british school was religiously conservative and commercially engaged thanks to the influence of presbyterianism and calvinism
northern english and scottish researchers played a key role in the development of thermodynamics which was motivated by the desire to design ever more efficient engines
by contrast in the south mentalities of anglicanism agnosticism and even atheism were more common
academics such as the biologist thomas huxley promoted scientific naturalism
nonconformist conscience describes the moral sensibility of the nonconformist churches those which dissent from the established church of england that influenced british politics in the th and early th centuries
in the census of church attendance non conformists who went to chapel comprised half the attendance of sunday services
nonconformists were focused in the fast growing urban middle class
the two categories of this group were in addition to the evangelicals or low church element in the church of england old dissenters dating from the th and th centuries included baptists congregationalists quakers unitarians and presbyterians outside scotland new dissenters emerged in the th century and were mainly methodists
the nonconformist conscience of the old group emphasized religious freedom and equality the pursuit of justice and opposition to discrimination compulsion and coercion
the new dissenters and also the anglican evangelicals stressed personal morality issues including sexuality temperance family values and sabbath keeping
both factions were politically active but until the mid th century the old group supported mostly whigs and liberals in politics while the new like most anglicans generally supported conservatives
in the late th century the new dissenters mostly switched to the liberal party
the result was a merging of the two groups strengthening their great weight as a political pressure group
they joined on new issues especially regarding schools and temperance with the latter of special interest to methodists
by the linkage was weakening and by the s it was virtually dead
parliament had long imposed a series of political disabilities on nonconformists outside scotland
they could not hold most public offices they had to pay local taxes to the anglican church be married by anglican ministers and be denied attendance at oxford or degrees at cambridge
dissenters demanded the removal of political and civil disabilities that applied to them especially those in the test and corporation acts
the anglican establishment strongly resisted until
dissenters organized into a political pressure group and succeeded in in the repeal of some restrictions
it was a major achievement for an outside group but the dissenters were not finished and the early victorian period saw them even more active and successful in eliminating their grievances
next on the agenda was the matter of church rates which were local taxes at the parish level for the support of the parish church building in england and wales
only buildings of the established church received the tax money
civil disobedience was attempted but was met with the seizure of personal property and even imprisonment
the compulsory factor was finally abolished in by william ewart gladstone and payment was made voluntary
while gladstone was a moralistic evangelical inside the church of england he had strong support in the nonconformist community
the marriage act allowed local government registrars to handle marriages
nonconformist ministers in their chapels were allowed to marry couples if a registrar was present
also in civil registration of births deaths and marriages was taken from the hands of local parish officials and given to local government registrars
burial of the dead was a more troubling problem for urban chapels had no graveyards and nonconformists sought to use the traditional graveyards controlled by the established church
the burial laws amendment act finally allowed that
oxford university required students seeking admission to subscribe to the articles of the church of england
cambridge required that for a diploma
the two ancient universities opposed giving a charter to the new university of london in the s because it had no such restriction
the university nevertheless was established in and by the s oxford dropped its restrictions
in gladstone sponsored the universities tests act that provided full access to degrees and fellowships
nonconformists especially unitarians and presbyterians played major roles in founding new universities in the late th century at manchester as well as birmingham liverpool and leeds
the abstract theological or philosophical doctrine of agnosticism whereby it is theoretically impossible to prove whether or not god exists suddenly became a popular issue around when t
huxley coined the term
it was much discussed for several decades and had its journal edited by william stewart ross the agnostic journal and eclectic review
interest petered out by the s and when ross died the journal soon closed
ross championed agnosticism in opposition not so much to christianity but to atheism as expounded by charles bradlaugh the term atheism never became popular
blasphemy laws meant that promoting atheism could be a crime and was vigorously prosecuted
charles southwell was among the editors of an explicitly atheistic periodical oracle of reason or philosophy vindicated who were imprisoned for blasphemy in the s
disbelievers call themselves freethinkers or secularists
they included john stuart mill thomas carlyle george eliot and matthew arnold
they were not necessarily hostile to christianity as huxley repeatedly emphasized
the literary figures were caught in something of a trap their business was writing and their theology said there was nothing for certain to write
they instead concentrated on the argument that it was not necessary to believe in god to behave in moral fashion
the scientists on the other hand paid less attention to theology and more attention to the exciting issues raised by charles darwin in terms of evolution
the proof of god s existence that said he had to exist to have a marvellously complex world was no longer satisfactory when biology demonstrated that complexity could arise through evolution
the centrality of the family was a dominant feature for all classes
worriers repeatedly detected threats that had to be dealt with working wives overpaid youths harsh factory conditions bad housing poor sanitation excessive drinking and religious decline
the licentiousness so characteristic of the upper class of the late th and early th centuries dissipated
the home became a refuge from the harsh world middle class wives sheltered their husbands from the tedium of domestic affairs
the number of children shrank allowing much more attention to be paid to each child
extended families were less common as the nuclear family became both the ideal and the reality
the emerging middle class norm for women was separate spheres whereby women avoid the public sphere the domain of politics paid work commerce and public speaking
instead they should dominate in the realm of domestic life focused on the care of the family the husband the children the household religion and moral behaviour
religiosity was in the female sphere and the nonconformist churches offered new roles that women eagerly entered
they taught in sunday schools visited the poor and sick distributed tracts engaged in fundraising supported missionaries led methodist class meetings prayed with other women and a few were allowed to preach to mixed audiences
the long poem the angel in the house by coventry patmore exemplified the idealized victorian woman who is angelically pure and devoted to her family and home
the poem was not a pure invention but reflected the emerging legal economic social cultural religious and moral values of the victorian middle class
legally women had limited rights to their bodies the family property or their children
the recognized identities were those of daughter wife mother and widow
rapid growth and prosperity meant that fewer women had to find paid employment and even when the husband owned a shop or small business the wife s participation was less necessary
meanwhile the home sphere grew dramatically in size women spent the money and decided on the furniture clothing food schooling and outward appearance the family would make
patmore s model was widely copied by charles dickens for example
literary critics of the time suggested that superior feminine qualities of delicacy sensitivity sympathy and sharp observation gave women novelists a superior insight into stories about home family and love
this made their work highly attractive to the middle class women who bought the novels and the serialized versions that appeared in many magazines
however a few early feminists called for aspirations beyond the home
by the end of the century the new woman was riding a bicycle wearing bloomers signing petitions supporting worldwide mission activities and talking about the vote
in great britain elsewhere in europe and in the united states the notion that marriage should be based on romantic love and companionship rather than convenience money or other strategic considerations grew in popularity during the victorian period
cheaper paper and printing technology made it easier for humans to attract mates this way hence the birth of the valentine card
the industrial revolution incentivised people to think more scientifically and to become more educated and informed in order to solve novel problems
as a result cognitive abilities were pushed to their genetic limits making people more intelligent and innovative than their predecessors
formal education thus became vital
according to intelligence researcher james r
flynn these changes echoed down to the twentieth century before leveling off in the early twenty first
the era saw a reform and renaissance of public schools inspired by thomas arnold at rugby
the public school became a model for gentlemen and public service
sunday schools and charity schools helped reduce illiteracy
in fact throughout the course of the nineteenth century there was a clear movement towards universal literacy culminating in the elementary education act of
by attending elementary schools was made compulsory
as a consequence of various education reforms literacy rates steadily rose
one way to determine the literacy rate is to count those who could sign their names on their marriage registers
using this method it was established that literacy in england and wales reached roughly by the late nineteenth century
statistics of literacy from this era are likely underestimates because they were based on the number of people who could write but throughout most of the nineteenth century people were typically taught to read before they were taught to write
literacy rates were higher in urban than rural areas
rising literacy and urbanization provided an expanding market for printed materials from cheap books to magazines
by only around of people in england and wales were illiterate with a similar rate in scotland
a key component of the curriculum at cambridge since the mid eighteenth century had been the mathematical tripos providing not just intensive training for mathematicians and scientists but also general education for future civil servants colonial administrators lawyers and clergymen
named after the three legged stool students had been sitting on since the fifteenth century the tripos included extremely challenging and highly prestigious exams whose most successful candidate for a given year was called the senior wrangler below the senior and second wranglers were the optimes
the exams concerned not just pure but also mixed or applied mathematics
starting from the s under the influence of master of trinity college william whewell the mixed portion included only branches of applied mathematics deemed stable such as mechanics and optics rather those amenable to mathematical analysis but remained unfinished at the time such as electricity and magnetism
following recommendations from the royal commission of science education at oxford and cambridge underwent significant reforms
in a new tripos was introduced providing a broader and less mathematical program in natural philosophy or what science was still commonly called back then
by the tripos had evolved into a rigorous test of not just mathematical ingenuity but also mental stamina
topics ranged widely from number theory to mathematical physics
candidates needed to have a firm grasp of the works of sir isaac newton and euclid of alexandria trigonometric identities conic sections compounded interest eclipses and more
they usually sat for five and a half hours each day for eight days for a total of a dozen papers featuring increasingly difficult questions
in general while the first colleges for women opened in the s it was not until the s that they started to be permitted to study side by side with men and to sit for the same exams as men
the first college for women at the university of cambridge girton opened in
however women were only allowed to take exams it was not until that they were able to receive degrees
they were marked and scored separately however and the results of female candidates were enunciated in comparison to men s for instance between the th and st optimes exam results from the s onward suggested that women broadly did as well as men though with the notable exception of mathematics
at that time it was commonly thought that women were emotional creatures lacking the mental faculty to master mathematics
thus it was big news when philippa fawcett was ranked above the senior wranger in scoring thirteen percent higher than the top male that year geoffrey thomas bennett
she was the first and last woman to score the highest on the tripos
while women were not welcomed in the world of medicine this was not the case in nursing
in fact nursing became even more respected after the brilliant exploits of florence nightingale during the crimean war
her nursing school at st thomas hospital became a model for others
consequently for many middle class young women the prospects of being a nurse one of the few career options open to them at the time became much more appealing
during the nineteenth century the publishing industry found itself catching up with the momentous changes to society brought about by the industrial revolution
it benefited from the introduction of electrical power rail transport and telegraphy
sales of books and periodicals were fuelled by the seemingly insatiable demand for knowledge self improvement and entertainment from the rapidly growing middle class
initially while book prices were too high for the average reader they were sufficient to cover the costs of the publisher and to pay reasonable amounts to the authors
but as free to use libraries sprang up all around the country people started flocking to them
authors and publishers looked for ways to cut prices and increase sales
serialisation in periodicals especially literary magazines though not newspapers became popular
quality illustrations were commissioned from the reputable artists of the time as an incentive to purchase
income from writing increased for some writers and many became professional novelists
in the early s the market for children s literature was dominated by religious groups
stories from this period often included strong a moral message
but it showed signs of growth and some writers decided to seize the opportunity
by the middle of the century commercial publishers came to recognise the great potential of this market and signed deals with gifted authors to provide a plethora of reading materials to children
they also took advantage of innovations such as those that enable the printing of coloured illustrations
as the middle class boomed people had more money to spend on entertaining their children
moral messaging was de emphasised in favor of fun
classics like the tales of the brothers grimm and the fairy tales of hans christian andersen made their way to the printing press
but it was alice s adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll that proved to be the most popular alongside the works of william makepeace thackeray charles kingsley jean ingelow and george macdonald
by the s juvenile fiction packed with action and adventure became commonplace
fantasy did not have a monopoly on the market for children s literature however
tom brown s school days by thomas hughes was a noteworthy example of realistic writing and school stories while black beauty by anna sewell was the start of the blooming of animal tales
as a matter of fact the market grew so large that most of the top writers of the era wrote at least one book for children
children s magazines and poetry for children especially the nonsensical variety blossomed during the victorian age
in prose the novel rose from a position of relative neglect during the s to become the leading literary genre by the end of the era
in the s and s the social novel also condition of england novels responded to the social political and economic upheaval associated with industrialisation
though it remained influential throughout the period there was a notable resurgence of gothic fiction in the fin de si cle such as in robert louis stevenson s novella strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde and oscar wilde s the picture of dorian gray
following the bicentenary of william shakespeare in the popularity of his works steadily grew reaching a peak in the nineteenth century
charles and mary lamb appeared to have anticipated this with their tales from shakespeare
intended as an introduction for apprentice readers to the works of the great playwright the book became one of the best selling titles in literature of the century being republished multiple times
as early as astronomer john herschel had already recognised the need for the genre of popular science
in a letter to philosopher william whewell he wrote that the general public needed digests of what is actually known in each particular branch of science
to give a connected view of what has been done and what remains to be accomplished indeed as the british population became not just increasingly literate but also well educated there was growing demand for science titles
mary somerville became an early and highly successful science writer of the nineteenth century
her on the connexion of the physical sciences intended for the mass audience sold quite well
arguably one of the first books in the genre of popular science it contained few diagrams and very little mathematics
it had ten editions and was translated to multiple languages
as its name suggests it offered readers a broad overview of the physical sciences at a time when these studies were becoming increasingly distinct and specialised
it was the most popular science title from the publisher john murray until charles darwin s on the origin of species
although somerville s rendition of pierre simon de laplace s masterpiece m canique c leste the mechanism of the heavens was intended to inform the masses of the latest advances in newtonian mechanics and gravitation it was also used as a textbook for students at the university of cambridge till the s
the abolition of the newspaper stamp duty in and the advertising tax in paved the way for not only cheaper magazines but also those catering to a variety of interests
during the final three decades of the victorian era women s newspapers and magazines flourished and increasingly covered topics other than domestic issues reflecting the trend among women at the time
the professional police force dedicated to not just the prevention but also the investigation of crime took shape during the mid nineteenth century
this development inspired charles dickens to write the crime novel bleak house creating the first fictional detective mr
bucket based on a real life character by the name of charles field
but it was arthur conan doyle s sherlock holmes who proved to be the most popular fictional detective of the victorian age and indeed of all times
by the s there was strong demand for adventure detective sensational and science fiction novels
indeed the late nineteenth century saw a tremendous amount of technological progress which inspired authors to write in the genre of science fiction
wells the time machine was a commercial success in it he introduced the notion of time travel
in some instances science fiction inspired new technology and scientific research
explorer ernest shackleton acknowledged that the novel twenty thousand leagues under the sea by jules verne was an inspiration
a study investigated the frequency at which difficult vocabulary from the wordsum test were employed in about million english language texts published between and
the researchers found that the more difficult of words were in declining usage and that there was a negative correlation between the use of such words and completed fertility
on the other hand simpler words entered increasingly common use an effect of rising literacy
in another study from researchers employed google s ngram viewer an enormous archive of scanned books periodicals and other printed materials dating back to the sixteenth century
they found that the use of difficult vocabulary increased substantially between the mid s and mid s before declining steadily till the present day
popular forms of entertainment varied by social class
victorian britain like the periods before it was interested in literature theatre and the arts see aesthetic movement and pre raphaelite brotherhood and music drama and opera were widely attended
michael balfe was the most popular british grand opera composer of the period while the most popular musical theatre was a series of fourteen comic operas by gilbert and sullivan although there was also musical burlesque and the beginning of edwardian musical comedy in the s
drama ranged from low comedy to shakespeare see henry irving
melodrama literally musical drama was introduced in revolutionary france and reached great britain from there during the victorian era
it was a particularly widespread and influential theatrical genre thanks to its appeal to the working class and artisans
however its popularity decline in the late nineteenth century
even so it continued to influence the novels of the era
gentlemen went to dining clubs like the beefsteak club or the savage club
gambling at cards in establishments popularly called casinos was wildly popular during the period so much so that evangelical and reform movements specifically targeted such establishments in their efforts to stop gambling drinking and prostitution
brass bands and the bandstand became popular in the victorian era
the bandstand was a simple construction that not only created an ornamental focal point but also served acoustic requirements whilst providing shelter from the changeable british weather
it was common to hear the sound of a brass band whilst strolling through parklands
at this time musical recording was still very much a novelty
the victorian era marked the golden age of the british circus
astley s amphitheatre in lambeth london featuring equestrian acts in a foot wide circus ring was the center of the th century circus
the permanent structure sustained three fires but as an institution lasted a full century with andrew ducrow and william batty managing the theatre in the middle part of the century
william batty would also build his person arena known commonly as batty s hippodrome in kensington gardens and draw crowds from the crystal palace exhibition
traveling circuses like pablo fanque s dominated the british provinces scotland and ireland fanque would enjoy fame again in the th century when john lennon would buy an poster advertising his circus and adapt the lyrics for the beatles song being for the benefit of mr
fanque also stands out as a black man who achieved great success and enjoyed great admiration among the british public only a few decades after britain had abolished slavery
another form of entertainment involved spectacles where paranormal events such as mesmerism communication with the dead by way of mediumship or channeling ghost conjuring and the like were carried out to the delight of crowds and participants
such activities were more popular at this time than in other periods of recent western history
natural history became increasingly an amateur activity
particularly in britain and the united states this grew into specialist hobbies such as the study of birds butterflies seashells malacology conchology beetles and wildflowers
amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the large natural history collections of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
middle class victorians used the train services to visit the seaside helped by the bank holiday act of which created many fixed holidays
large numbers traveling to quiet fishing villages such as worthing morecambe and scarborough began turning them into major tourist centres and people like thomas cook saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses
the victorian era saw the introduction and development of many modern sports
often originating in the public schools they exemplified new ideals of manliness
cricket cycling croquet horse riding and many water activities are examples of some of the popular sports in the victorian era
the modern game of tennis originated in birmingham england between and
the world s oldest tennis tournament the wimbledon championships was first played in london in
britain was an active competitor in all the olympic games starting in
gothic revival architecture became increasingly significant during the period leading to the battle of the styles between gothic and classical ideals
charles barry s architecture for the new palace of westminster which had been badly damaged in an fire was built in the medieval style of westminster hall the surviving part of the building
it constructed a narrative of cultural continuity set in opposition to the violent disjunctions of revolutionary france a comparison common to the period as expressed in thomas carlyle s the french revolution a history and charles dickens great expectations and a tale of two cities
gothic was also supported by critic john ruskin who argued that it epitomised communal and inclusive social values as opposed to classicism which he considered to epitomise mechanical standardisation
the middle of the th century saw the great exhibition of the first world s fair which showcased the greatest innovations of the century
at its centre was the crystal palace a modular glass and iron structure the first of its kind
it was condemned by ruskin as the very model of mechanical dehumanisation in design but later came to be presented as the prototype of modern architecture
the emergence of photography showcased at the great exhibition resulted in significant changes in victorian art with queen victoria being the first british monarch to be photographed
in general various styles of painting were popular during the victorian period classicism neoclassicism romanticism impressionism and post impressionism
in dante rossetti and william holman hunt created the pre raphaelite brotherhood whose stated aim was to produce paintings of photographic quality taking inspiration from a variety of sources from the works of william shakespeare to mother nature herself
the growing popularity of romantic love spilled over into literature and fine arts
in thomas barnes became general editor of the times he was a political radical a sharp critic of parliamentary hypocrisy and a champion of freedom of the press
under barnes and his successor in john thadeus delane the influence of the times rose to great heights especially in politics and in the financial district the city of london
it spoke of reform
the times originated the practice of sending war correspondents to cover particular conflicts
russell wrote immensely influential dispatches on the crimean war of for the first time the public could read about the reality of warfare
russell wrote one dispatch that highlighted the surgeons inhumane barbarity and the lack of ambulance care for wounded troops
shocked and outraged the public reacted in a backlash that led to major reforms especially in the provision of nursing led by florence nightingale

the royal albert hall opened on march
lieutenant colonel henry scott r e who managed the construction estimated there was enough space for people plus performers the theoretical limit was

opportunities for leisure activities increased dramatically as real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline
in urban areas the nine hour workday became increasingly the norm the factory act limited the working week to hours encouraging the movement towards an eventual eight hour workday
furthermore a system of routine annual holidays came into play starting with white collar workers and moving into the working class
some seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares widespread bank holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on sundays
by the late victorian era the leisure industry had emerged in all cities
it provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length at convenient locales at inexpensive prices
these included sporting events music halls and popular theatre
by football was no longer the preserve of the social elite as it attracted large working class audiences
average attendance was in rising to in
that amounted to million paying customers with a weekly turnover of
sports by generated some three percent of the total gross national product
professional sports were the norm although some new activities reached an upscale amateur audience such as lawn tennis and golf
women were now allowed in some sports such as archery tennis badminton and gymnastics
britain had the lead in rapid economic and population growth
at the time thomas malthus believed this lack of growth outside britain was due the carrying capacity of their local environments
that is the tendency of a population to expand geometrically while resources grew more slowly reaching a crisis such as famine war or epidemic which would reduce the population to a more sustainable size
great britain escaped the malthusian trap because the scientific and technological breakthroughs of the industrial revolution dramatically improved living standards reducing mortality and increasing longevity
the victorian era was a time of unprecedented population growth in britain
the population rose from million in to million in
two major contributory factors were fertility rates and mortality rates
britain was the first country to undergo the demographic transition and the agricultural and industrial revolutions
economist gary becker argued that at first falling fertility is due to urbanisation and lower infant mortality rates which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children
in other words it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children
this is known as the first demographic transition
this trend continued till around
the second demographic transition occurred due to the significant cultural shifts of the s leading to the decline in the desire for children
the demographic transition is when a population shifts from being one of high child mortality rates and high fertility rates to one that is low in both
western nations completed this transition by the early s
it occurred in two stages
initially child mortality rates dropped significantly due to improved healthcare and sanitation and better nutrition yet fertility rates remained high leading to a population boom
gradually fertility rates fell as people became more affluent and had better access to contraception
by the infant mortality rate in england was percent down from an estimated percent in the middle ages
there was no catastrophic epidemic or famine in england or scotland in the nineteenth century it was the first century in which a major epidemic did not occur throughout the whole country and deaths per of population per year in england and wales fell from from to to in cf for instance in
social class had a significant effect on mortality rates the upper classes had a lower rate of premature death early in the nineteenth century than poorer classes did
in the victorian era fertility rates increased in every decade until when the rates started evening out
there were several reasons for this
one is biological with improving living standards a higher proportion of women were biologically able to have children
another possible explanation is social
in the th century the marriage rate increased and people were getting married at a very young age until the end of the century when the average age of marriage started to increase again slowly
the reasons why people got married younger and more frequently are uncertain
one theory is that greater prosperity allowed people to finance marriage and new households earlier than previously possible
with more births within marriage it seems inevitable that marriage rates and birth rates would rise together
birth rates were originally measured by the crude birth rate births per year divided by total population
this is indeed a crude measure as key groups and their fertility rates are not clear
it is likely to be affected mainly by changes in the age distribution of the population
the net reproduction rate was then introduced as an alternative measure it measures the average fertility rate of women of child bearing ages
high rates of birth also occurred because of a lack of birth control
mainly because women lacked knowledge of birth control methods and the practice was seen as unrespectable
the evening out of fertility rates at the beginning of the th century was mainly the result of a few big changes availability of forms of birth control and changes in people s attitude towards sex
in the olden days people typically had had as many children as they could afford in order to ensure at least a few of them would survive to adulthood and have children of their own due to high child mortality rates
moreover it was the poor who had had an incentive to curb their fertility whereas the rich had lacked such a need due to greater wealth and lower child mortality rates
this changed due to the industrial revolution
standards of living improved and mortality rates fell
people no longer needed to have as many children as before to ensure the propagation of their genes
the link between poverty and child mortality weakened
in addition societal attitude towards contraception warmed leading to the negative correlation between intelligence and fertility
factors linked to general intelligence such as socioeconomic status and educational attainment were also found to be negatively correlated with fertility starting from the nineteenth century
environmental and health standards rose throughout the victorian era
improvements in nutrition may also have played a role though its importance is still debated
life in the late s had been little different from life in the late middle ages
but the nineteenth century saw dramatic technological development
someone alive in would know about the electric telegraph the steam ship the circular saw the bicycle and the steam powered locomotive
if this person lived to he or she would have heard of the invention of the electric light bulb the typewriter the calculator the rubber tyre the washing machine the internal combustion engine plastic and dynamite
engineering prowess especially in communication and transportation made great britain the leading industrial powerhouse and trading nation of the world at that time
according to historians david brandon and alan brooke the new system of railways after brought into being our modern world
they stimulated demand for building materials coal iron and later steel
excelling in the bulk movement of coal they provided the fuel for the furnaces of industry and for domestic fireplaces
millions of people were able to travel who had scarcely ever travelled before
railways enabled mail newspapers periodicals and cheap literature to be distributed easily quickly and cheaply allowing a much wider and faster dissemination of ideas and information
they had a significant impact on improving diet and enabled a proportionately smaller agricultural industry was able to feed a much larger urban population they employed huge quantities of labour both directly and indirectly
they helped britain to become the workshop of the world by reducing transport costs not only of raw materials but of finished goods large amounts of which were exported t oday s global corporations originated with the great limited liability railway companies by the third quarter of the nineteenth century there was scarcely any person living in britain whose life had not been altered in some way by the coming of the railways
railways contributed to the transformation of britain from a rural to a predominantly urban society historians have characterised the mid victorian era as britain s golden years
it was not till the two to three decades following the second world war that substantial economic growth was seen again
in the long term view the mid victorian boom was one upswing in the kondratiev cycle see figure
there was prosperity as the national income per person grew by half
much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialisation especially in textiles and machinery as well as to the worldwide network of exports that produced profits for british merchants
british entrepreneurs built railways in india and many independent nations
there was peace abroad apart from the short crimean war and social peace at home
opposition to the new order melted away says porter
the chartist movement peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in its leaders moved to other pursuits such as trade unions and cooperative societies
the working class ignored foreign agitators like karl marx in their midst and joined in celebrating the new prosperity
employers typically were paternalistic and generally recognised the trade unions
companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing schools and churches to libraries baths and gymnasia
middle class reformers did their best to assist the working classes aspirations to middle class norms of respectability
there was a spirit of libertarianism says porter as people felt they were free
taxes were very low and government restrictions were minimal
there were still problem areas such as occasional riots especially those motivated by anti catholicism
society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry who controlled high government offices both houses of parliament the church and the military
becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate
literature was doing well but the fine arts languished as the great exhibition of showcased britain s industrial prowess rather than its sculpture painting or music
the educational system was mediocre the main universities outside scotland were likewise mediocre
historian llewellyn woodward has concluded
for leisure or work for getting or for spending england was a better country in than in
the scales were less weighted against the weak against women and children and against the poor
there was greater movement and less of the fatalism of an earlier age
the public conscience was more instructed and the content of liberty was being widened to include something more than freedom from political constraint
yet england in was by no means an earthly paradise
the housing and conditions of life of the working class in town country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty
in december rochdale society of equitable pioneers founded what is considered the first cooperative in the world
the founding members were a group of around half of which were weavers who decided to band together to open a store owned and managed democratically by the members selling food items they could not otherwise afford
ten years later the british co operative movement had grown to nearly co operatives
the movement also spread across the world with the first cooperative financial institution founded in in germany the very rapid growth in population in the th century in the cities included the new industrial and manufacturing cities as well as service centres such as edinburgh and london
the critical factor was financing which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms
private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure
kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants
people moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone so low income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums
clean water sanitation and public health facilities were inadequate the death rate was high especially infant mortality and tuberculosis among young adults
cholera from polluted water and typhoid were endemic
unlike rural areas there were no famines such as the one which devastated ireland in the s
th century britain saw a huge population increase accompanied by rapid urbanisation stimulated by the industrial revolution
wage rates improved steadily real wages after taking inflation into account were percent higher in compared to
much of the money was saved as the number of depositors in savings banks rose from in to million in and their deposits from million to over million
people flooded into industrial areas and commercial cities faster than housing could be built resulting in overcrowding and lagging sanitation facilities such as fresh water and sewage
these problems were magnified in london where the population grew at record rates
large houses were turned into flats and tenements and as landlords failed to maintain these dwellings slum housing developed
kellow chesney described the situation as follows hideous slums some of them acres wide some no more than crannies of obscure misery make up a substantial part of the metropolis
in big once handsome houses thirty or more people of all ages may inhabit a single room significant changes happened in the british poor law system in england and wales scotland and ireland
these included a large expansion in workhouses or poorhouses in scotland although with changing populations during the era
the early victorian era before the reforms of the s became notorious for the employment of young children in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps
child labour played an important role in the industrial revolution from its outset novelist charles dickens for example worked at the age of in a blacking factory with his family in a debtors prison
reformers wanted the children in school in only about percent of the children in london had any schooling
by about half of the children between and were in school including sunday school
the children of the poor were expected to help towards the family budget often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low wages
agile boys were employed by the chimney sweeps small children were employed to scramble under machinery to retrieve cotton bobbins and children were also employed to work in coal mines crawling through tunnels too narrow and low for adults
children also worked as errand boys crossing sweepers shoe blacks or sold matches flowers and other cheap goods
some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades such as building or as domestic servants there were over domestic servants in london in the mid th century
working hours were long builders might work hours a week in summer and in winter while domestic servants were theoretically on duty hours a week
mother bides at home she is troubled with bad breath and is sair weak in her body from early labour
i am wrought with sister and brother it is very sore work cannot say how many rakes or journeys i make from pit s bottom to wall face and back thinks about or on the average the distance varies from to fathom
i carry about cwt
and a quarter on my back have to stoop much and creep through water which is frequently up to the calves of my legs
isabella read years old coal bearer testimony gathered by ashley s mines commission as early as and factory acts were passed to limit the working hours of children in factories and cotton mills to hours per day
these acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation by for example the short time committees in a royal commission recommended in that children aged should work a maximum of hours per day children aged a maximum of eight hours and children under the age of nine should no longer be permitted to work
this act however only applied to the textile industry and further agitation led to another act in limiting both adults and children to hour working days
founded in with the stated purpose of diffusing the knowledge and facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements and for teaching by courses of philosophical lectures and experiments the application of science to the common purposes of life the royal institution was a proper scientific institution with laboratories a lecture hall libraries and offices
in its first years the institution was dedicated to the improvement of agriculture using chemistry prompted by trade restrictions with europe
such practical concerns continued through the next two centuries
however it soon became apparent that additional funding was required in order for the institution to continue
some well known experts were hired as lecturers and researchers
the most successful of them all was sir humphry davy whose lectures concerned a myriad of topics and were so popular that the original practical purpose of the institution faded away
it became increasingly dominated by research in basic science
the professionalisation of science began in the aftermath of the french revolution and soon spread to other parts of the continent including the german lands
it was slow to reach britain however
master of trinity college william whewell coined the term scientist in to describe the new professional breed specialists and experts studying what was still commonly known as natural philosophy
in whewell wrote we need very much a name to describe a cultivator of science in general
i should incline to call him a scientist the new term signalled the recognition of the importance of empiricism and inductive reasoning
but this term was slow to catch on
as biologist thomas huxley indicated in the prospect of earning a decent living as a scientist remained remote despite the prestige of the occupation
it was possible for a scientist to earn praise but not pudding he wrote
since its birth the royal society of london had been a club of gentlemanly amateurs though some of whom were the very best in their fields people like charles darwin and james prescott joule
but the society reformed itself in the s and s
by it only admitted the new breed of professionals
the victorians were impressed by science and progress and felt that they could improve society in the same way as they were improving technology
britain was the leading world centre for advanced engineering and technology
its engineering firms were in worldwide demand for designing and constructing railways
a necessary part of understanding scientific progress is the ease of scientific discovery
in many cases from planetary science to mammalian biology the ease of discovery since the s and s can be fitted to an exponentially decaying curve
but the rate of progress is also dependent on other factors such as the number of researchers the level of funding and advances in technology
thus the number of new species of mammals discovered between the late s and late s followed grew exponentially before leveling off in the s the general shape is known as the logistic curve
in other cases a branch of study reached the point of saturation
for instance the last major internal human organ the paraythyroid gland was discovered in by ivar viktor sandstr m
this does not mean that basic science was coming an end
despite the despondency of many victorian era scientists who thought that all that remained was measuring quantities to the next decimal place and that new discoveries would not change the contemporary scientific paradigm as the nineteenth century became the twentieth science witnessed truly revolutionary discoveries such as radioactivity and basic science continued its advance though a number of twentieth century scientists shared the same pessimism as their late victorian counterparts
in the field of statistics the nineteenth century saw significant innovations in data visualisation
william playfair who created charts of all sorts justified it thus a man who has carefully investigated a printed table finds when done that he has only a very faint and partial idea of what he has read and that like a figure imprinted on sand is soon totally erased and defaced for example in a chart showing the relationship between population and government revenue of some european nations he used the areas of circles to represent the geographical sizes of those nations
in the same graph he used the slopes of lines to indicate the tax burden of a given population
while serving as nurse during the crimean war florence nightingale drew the first pie charts representing the monthly fatality rates of the conflict distinguishing deaths due to battle wounds innermost section those due to infectious disease outer section and to other causes middle section
see figure her charts clearly showed that most deaths resulted from disease which led the general public to demand improved sanitation at field hospitals
although bar charts representing frequencies were first used by the frenchman a
guerry in it was the statistician karl pearson who gave them the name histograms
pearson used them in an article mathematically analyzing biological evolution
one such histogram showed that buttercups with large numbers of petals were rarer
normal distributions expressible in the form
displaystyle y ae kx
arose in various works on probability and the theory of errors
belgian sociologist and statistician adolphe quetelet discovered that its extremely wide applicability in his analysis of vast amounts of statistics of human physical characteristics such as height and other traits such as criminality and alcoholism
quetelet derived the concept of the average man from his studies
sir francis galton employed quetelet s ideas in his research on mathematical biology
in his experiments with sweet peas in the s galton discovered that the spread of the distributions of a particular trait did not change over the generations
he invented what he called the quincunx to demonstrate why mixtures of normal distributions were normal
galton noticed that the means of a particular trait in the offspring generation differed from those of the parent generation a phenomenon now known as regression to the mean
he found that the slopes of the regression lines of two given variables were the same if the two data sets were scaled by units of probable error and introduced the notion of the correlation coefficient but noted that correlation does not imply causation
during the late nineteenth century british statisticians introduced a number of methods to relate and draw conclusions from statistical quantities
francis edgeworth developed a test for statistical significance that estimated the fluctuations twice the variance in modern language from two given means
by modern standards however he was extremely conservative when it comes to drawing conclusions about the significance of an observation
for edgeworth an observation was significant if it was at the level of which is much stricter than the requirement of to commonly used today
pearson defined the standard deviation and introduced the
displaystyle chi
statistic chi squared
pearson s student george udney yule demonstrated that one could compute the regression equation of a given data set using the method of least squares
in miller and autodidactic mathematician george green published an essay on the application of mathematical analysis to the theories of electricity and magnetism making use of the mathematics of potential theory developed by continental mathematicians
but this paper fell on deaf ears until william thomson read it realised its significance and had it re printed in
green s work became a source of inspiration for the cambridge school of mathematical physicists which included thomson himself george gabriel stokes and james clerk maxwell
green s essay contained what became known as green s theorem a basic result in vector calculus green s identities and the notion of green s functions which appears in the study of differential equations
thomson went on to prove stokes theorem which earned that name after stokes asked students to prove in the smith s prize exam in
stokes learned it from thomson in a letter in
stokes theorem generalises green s theorem which itself is a higher dimensional version of the fundamental theorem of calculus
research in physics in particular elasticity heat conduction hydrodynamics and electromagnetism motivated the development of vector calculus in the nineteenth century
arthur cayley is credited with the creation of the theory of matrices rectangular arrays of numbers as distinct objects from determinants studied since the mid eighteenth century
the term matrix was coined by james joseph sylvester a major contributor to the theory of determinants
it is difficult to overestimate the value of matrix theory to modern theoretical physics
peter tait wrote prophetically that cayley was forging the weapons for future generations of physicists
early contributions study of elasticity how objects behave under stresses pressures and loads employed ad hoc hypotheses to solve specific problems
it was during the nineteenth century that scientists began to work out a thorough theory
in using an analogy with elastic bodies french professor of mechanics claude louis navier arrived at the basic equations of motion for viscous fluids
george gabriel stokes re derived them in using continuum mechanics in a paper titled on the theories of internal friction of fluids in motion in it stokes sought to develop a mathematical description for all known fluids that take into account viscosity or internal friction
these are now referred to as the navier stokes equations
in stokes showed that light polarisation can be described in terms of what are now known as the stokes parameters
the stokes parameters for a given wave may be viewed as a vector
founded in the eighteenth century the calculus of variations grew into a much favored mathematical tool among physicists
scientific problems thus became the impetus for the development of the subject
william rowan hamilton advanced it in his course to construct a deductive framework for optics he then applied the same ideas to mechanics
with an appropriate variational principle one could deduce the equations of motion for a given mechanical or optical system
soon scientists worked out the variational principles for the theory of elasticity electromagnetism and fluid mechanics and in the future relativity and quantum theory
whilst variational principles did not necessarily provide a simpler way to solve problems they were of interest for philosophical or aesthetic reasons though scientists at this time were not as motivated by religion in their work as their predecessors
hamilton s work in physics was great achievement he was able to provide a unifying mathematical framework for wave propagation and particle motion
in light of this description it becomes clear why the wave and corpuscle theories of light were equally able to account for the phenomena of reflection and refraction
hamilton s equations also proved useful in calculating planetary orbits
in john james waterson submitted to the royal society a paper on the kinetic theory of gases that included a statement of the equipartition theorem and a calculation of the ratio of the specific heats of gases
although the paper was read before the society and its abstract published waterson s paper faced antipathy
at this time the kinetic theory of gases was considered highly speculative as it was based on the then not accepted atomic hypothesis
but by the mid s interest was revived
in the s james clerk maxwell published a series of papers on the subject
unlike those of his predecessors who were only using averages maxwell s papers were explicitly statistical in nature
he proposed that the speeds of molecules in a gas followed a distribution
although the speeds would cluster around the average some molecules were moving faster or slower than this average
he showed that this distribution is a function of temperature and mathematically described various properties of gases such as diffusion and viscosity
he predicted surprisingly that the viscosity of a gas is independent of its density
this was verified at once by a series of experiments maxwell conducted with his wife katherine
experimental verification of the maxwell distribution was not obtained till years later however
in the meantime the austrian ludwig boltzmann developed maxwell s statistics further and proved in using the
displaystyle h
function that the maxwellian distribution is stable and any non maxwellian distribution would morph into it
in his dynamics of rigid bodies edward john routh noted the importance of what he called absent coordinates also known as cyclic coordinates or ignorable coordinates following the terminology of e
whittaker
such coordinates are associated with conserved momenta and as such are useful in problem solving
routh also devised a new method for solving problems in mechanics
although routh s procedure does not add any new insights it allows for more systematic and convenient analysis especially in problems with many degrees of freedom and at least some cyclic coordinates
in at the request the british association for the advancement of science from the year before edmund taylor whittaker submitted his report on the progress of solution to the problem of three bodies
at that time classical mechanics in general and the three body problem in particular captured the imagination of many talented mathematicians whose contributions whittaker covered in his report
whittaker later incorporated the report into his textbook titled analytical dynamics of particles and rigid bodies first edition
it helped provide the scientific basis for the aerospace industry in the twentieth century
despite its age it remains in print in the early twenty first century
during the s and s traditional caloric theory of heat began losing favour to dynamical alternatives which posit that heat is a kind of motion
brewer and amateur scientist james prescott joule was one of the proponents of the latter
joule s intricate experiments the most successful of which involved heating water with paddle wheels making full use of his skill in temperature control as a brewer demonstrated decisively the reality of the mechanical equivalent of heat what would later become known as the conservation of energy was pursued by many other workers approaching the subject from a variety of backgrounds from medicine and physiology to physics and engineering
another notable contributor to this development was the german researcher hermann von helmholtz who gave an essentially newtonian that is mechanical account
william thomson later lord kelvin received the works of joule and helmholtz positively embracing them as providing support for the emerging science of energy in the late s to the s kelvin his friend william john macquorn rankine and the german rudolf clausius published a steady stream of papers concerning heat engines and an absolute temperature scale
indeed the commercial value of new science had already become apparent by this time some businessmen were quite willing to offer generous financial support for researchers
rankine spoke confidently of the new science of thermodynamics a term kelvin coined in whose fundamental principles came to be known as the first and second laws and whose core concepts were energy and entropy kelvin and peter guthrie tait s treatise on natural philosophy was an attempt to reformulate physics in terms of energy
here kelvin and tait introduced the phrase kinetic energy instead of actual now in standard usage
the phrase potential energy was promoted by rankine
on the practical side the food preserving effect of low temperatures had long been recognised
natural ice was vigorously traded in the early nineteenth century but it was inevitably in short supply especially in australia
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there was considerable commercial incentive to develop ever more effective refrigerators thanks to the expansion of agriculture in the americas australia and new zealand and rapid urbanization in western europe
from the s onward refrigerators relied on the expansion of compressed air or the evaporation of a volatile liquid evaporation became the basis of all modern refrigerator designs
long distance shipping of perishable foods such as meat boomed in the late s
on the theoretical side new refrigeration techniques were also of great value
from his absolute temperature scale lord kelvin deduced the existence of absolute zero occurring at c
scientists began trying to reach ever lower temperatures and to liquefy every gas they encountered
this paved the way for the development of low temperature physics and the third law of thermodynamics
this study of natural history was most powerfully advanced by charles darwin and his theory of evolution first published in his book on the origin of species in
research in geology and evolutionary biology naturally led to the question of how old the earth was
indeed between the mid s to the mid s this was the topic of increasingly sophisticated intellectual discussions
with the advent of thermodynamics it became clear that the earth and the sun must have an old but finite age
whatever the energy source of the sun it must be finite and since it is constantly dissipating there must be a day when the sun runs out of energy
lord kelvin wrote in within a finite period of time past the earth must have been and within a finite period of time to come the earth must again be unfit for the habitation of man as at present constituted unless operations have been or are to be performed which are impossible under the laws to which the known operations going on are subject in the s kelvin employed a mathematical model by von helmholtz suggesting that the energy of the sun is released via gravitational collapse to calculate the age of the sun to be between and million years
he reached comparable figures for the earth
the missing ingredient here was radioactivity which was not known to science till the end of the nineteenth century
after the dane hans christian rsted demonstrated that it was possible to deflect a magnetic needle by closing or opening an electric circuit nearby a deluge of papers attempting explain the phenomenon was published
michael faraday set himself to the task of clarifying the nature of electricity and magnetism by experiments
in doing so he devised what could be described as the first electric motor though it does not resemble a modern one a transformer now used to step up the voltage and step down the current or vice versa and a dynamo which contains the basics of all electric turbine generators
the practical value of faraday s research on electricity and magnetism was nothing short of revolutionary
a dynamo converts mechanical energy into an electrical current whilst a motor does the reverse
the world s first power plants entered service in and by the following year people realized the possibility of using electricity to power a variety of household appliances
inventors and engineers soon raced to develop such items starting with affordable and durable incandescent light bulbs perhaps the most important of the early applications of electricity
as the foremost expert on electricity and magnetism at the time lord kelvin oversaw the laying of the trans atlantic telegraphic cable which became successful in
drawing on the work of his predecessors especially the experimental research of michael faraday the analogy with heat flow by lord kelvin and the mathematical analysis of george green james clerk maxwell synthesized all that was known about electricity and magnetism into a single mathematical framework maxwell s equations
maxwell used his equations to predict the existence of electromagnetic waves which travel at the speed of light
in other words light is but one kind of electromagnetic wave
maxwell s theory predicted there ought to be other types with different frequencies
after some ingenious experiments maxwell s prediction was confirmed by german physicist heinrich hertz
in the process hertz generated and detected what are now called radio waves and built crude radio antennas and the predecessors of satellite dishes
dutch physicist hendrik lorentz derived using suitable boundary conditions fresnel s equations for the reflection and transmission of light in different media from maxwell s equations
he also showed that maxwell s theory succeeded in illuminating the phenomenon of light dispersion where other models failed
john william strutt lord rayleigh and the american josiah willard gibbs then proved that the optical equations derived from maxwell s theory are the only self consistent description of the reflection refraction and dispersion of light consistent with experimental results
optics thus found a new foundation in electromagnetism
but it was oliver heaviside an enthusiastic supporter of maxwell s electromagnetic theory who deserves most of the credit for shaping how people understood and applied maxwell s work for decades to come
maxwell originally wrote down a grand total of equations for the electromagnetic field which he later reduced to eight
heaviside rewrote them in the form commonly used today just four expressions
in addition heaviside was responsible for considerable progress in electrical telegraphy telephony and the study of the propagation of electromagnetic waves
independent of gibbs heaviside assembled a set of mathematical tools known as vector calculus to replace the quaternions which were in vogue at the time but which heaviside dismissed as antiphysical and unnatural
faraday also investigated how electrical currents affected chemical solutions
his experiments led him to the two laws of electrochemistry
together with whewell faraday introduced the basic vocabulary for the subject the words electrode anode cathode electrolysis electrolyte ion anion and cation
they remain in standard usage
but faraday s work was of value to more than just chemists
in his faraday memorial lecture in the german hermann von helmholtz asserted that faraday s laws of electrochemistry hinted at the atomic structure of matter
if the chemical elements were distinguishable from one another by simple ratios of mass and if the same amounts of electricity deposited amounts of these elements upon the poles in ratios then electricity must also come in as discrete units later named electrons
in the late nineteenth century the nature of the energy emitted by the discharge between high voltage electrodes inside an evacuated tube cathode rays attracted the attention of many physicists
while the germans thought cathode rays were waves the british and the french believed they were particles
working at the cavendish laboratory established by maxwell j
thompson directed a dedicate experiment demonstrating that cathode rays were in fact negatively charged particles now called electrons
the experiment enabled thompson to calculate the ratio between the magnitude of the charge and the mass of the particle

in addition because the ratio was the same regardless of the metal used thompson concluded that electrons must be a constituent of all atoms
although the atoms of each chemical elements have different numbers of electrons all electrons are identical
inspired by the explorations in abstract algebra of george peacock and augustus de morgan george boole published a book titled an investigation of the laws of thought in which he brought the study of logic from philosophy and metaphysics to mathematics
his stated goal was to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a calculus and upon this foundation to establish the science of logical and construct its methods although ignored at first boolean algebra as it is now known became central to the design of circuits and computers in the following century
the desire to construct calculating machines is not new
in fact it can be traced all the way back to the hellenistic civilization
while people have devised such machines over the centuries mathematicians continued to perform calculations by hand as machines offered little advantage in speed
for complicated calculations they employed tables especially of logarithmic and trigonometric functions which were computed by hand
but right in the middle of the industrial revolution in england charles babbage thought of using the all important steam engine to power a mechanical computer the difference engine
unfortunately whilst babbage managed to secure government funds for the construction of the machine the government subsequently lost and interest and babbage faced considerable troubles developing the necessary machine components
he abandoned the project to pursue a new one his analytical engine
by he had worked out the basic design
like a modern computer it consisted of two basic parts one that stores the numbers to be processed the store and one that performed the operations the mill
babbage adopted the concept of punch cards from the french engineer joseph jacquard who had used it to automate the textile industry in france to control the operations of his analytical engine
unfortunately he again lacked the financial resources to build it and so it remained a theoretical construct
but he did leave behind detailed notes and engineering drawings from which modern experts conclude that the technology of the time was advanced enough to actually build it even if he never had enough money to do so
in babbage went to turin to give lectures on his work designing the analytical engine to italian scientists
ada lovelace translated the notes published by one of the attendees into english and heavily annotated it
she wrote down the very first computer program in her case one for computing the bernoulli numbers
she employed what modern computer programmers would recognise as loops and decision steps and gave a detailed diagram possibly the first flowchart ever created
she noted that a calculating machine could perform not just arithmetic operations but also symbolic manipulations
on the limitations and implications of the computer she wrote
steam ships were one of the keys to britain s prosperity in the nineteenth century
this technology which predates the victorian era had a long a rich history
starting in the late s people had begun building steam powered ships with ever increasing size operational range and speed first to cross the english channel and then the atlantic and finally to reach places as far away as india and australia without having to refuel mid route
international trade and travel boosted demand and there was intense competition among the shipping companies
steam ships such as the ss great britain and ss great western made international travel more common but also advanced trade so that in britain it was not just the luxury goods of earlier times that were imported into the country but essentials and raw materials such as corn and cotton from the united states and meat and wool from australia
at feet long feet wide and weighing over tons the ss great eastern was the largest ship built at the time capable of transporting passengers from britain to australia without having to refuel along the way
even when she was finally broken up for scraps in she was still the largest ship in the world
her record was not broken till the edwardian era with super liners like the lusitania in the titanic in
yet despite being a remarkable feat of engineering the great eastern became more and more of a white elephant as smaller and faster ships were in greater demand
nevertheless she gained a new lease of life when she was chartered to lay telegraphic cables across the atlantic and then to india
her size and range made her ideally suited for the task
the british government had long realised that national prosperity depended on trade
for that reason it deployed the royal navy to protect maritime trade routes and financed the construction of many steam ships
although the idea of transmitting messages via electrical signals dated back to the eighteenth century it was not until the s that advances in the study of electricity and magnetism made that a practical reality
in william fothergill cooke and charles wheatstone invented a telegraphic system that used electrical currents to deflect magnetic needles thus transmitting coded messages
this design soon made its way all across britain appearing in every town and post office
by the mid s a telegraphic cable was laid across the english channel the irish sea and the north sea
in the ss great eastern successfully laid the transatlantic telegraphic cable
a global network boomed towards the end of the century
in alexander graham bell patented the telephone
like the telegraph the telephone enabled rapid personal communication
a little over a decade later telephones were in service in britain and in america had telephones
multiple switchboards were installed in every major town and city
hertz s experimental work in electromagnetism stimulated interest in the possibility of wireless communication which did not require long and expensive cables and was faster than even the telegraph
receiving little support in his native italy guglielmo marconi moved to england and adapted hertz s equipment for this purpose in the s
he achieved the first international wireless transmission between england and france in and by the following year he succeeded in sending messages in morse code across the atlantic
seeing its value the shipping industry adopted this technology at once
radio broadcasting became extremely popular in the twentieth century and remains in common use in the early twenty first
in fact the global communications network of the twenty first century has its roots in the victorian era
photography was realised in by louis daguerre in france and william fox talbot in britain
by hand held cameras were available
another important innovation in communications was the penny black the first postage stamp which standardised postage to a flat price regardless of distance sent
a central development during the victorian era was the rise of rail transport
the new railways all allowed goods raw materials and people to be moved about rapidly facilitating trade and industry
the financing of railways became an important specialty of london s financiers
they retained an ownership share even while turning over management to locals that ownership was largely liquidated in to pay for the world war
railroads originated in england because industrialists had already discovered the need for inexpensive transportation to haul coal for the new steam engines to supply parts to specialized factories and to take products to market
the existing system of canals was inexpensive but was too slow and too limited in geography
the railway system led to a reorganisation of society more generally with railway time being the standard by which clocks were set throughout britain the complex railway system setting the standard for technological advances and efficiency
the engineers and businessmen needed to create and finance a railway system were available they knew how to invent to build and to finance a large complex system
the first quarter of the th century involved numerous experiments with locomotives and rail technology
by railways were commercially feasible as demonstrated by george stephenson when he built the stockton and darlington
on his first run his locomotive pulled freight and passenger cars at speeds as high as miles per hour
stephenson went on to design many more railways and is best known for standardizing designs such as the standard gauge of rail spacing at feet inches
thomas brassey was even more prominent operating construction crews that at one point in the s totalled men throughout europe the british empire and latin america
brassey took thousands of british engineers and mechanics across the globe to build new lines
they invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways tunnels and bridges
britain had a superior financial system based in london that funded both the railways in britain and also in many other parts of the world including the united states up until
the boom years were and when parliament authorised miles of lines at a projected cost of million which was about the same value as the country s annual gross domestic product gdp at that time
a new railway needed a charter which typically cost over about million to obtain from parliament but opposition could effectively prevent its construction
the canal companies unable or unwilling to upgrade their facilities to compete with railways used political power to try to stop them
the railways responded by purchasing about a fourth of the canal system in part to get the right of way and in part to buy off critics
once a charter was obtained there was little government regulation as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices
the different lines typically had exclusive territory but given the compact size of britain this meant that multiple competing lines could provide service between major cities
george hudson became the railway king of britain
he merged various independent lines and set up a clearing house in which rationalized interconnections by establishing uniform paperwork and standard methods for transferring passengers and freight between lines and rates when one system used freight cars owned by another
by rates had fallen to a penny a ton mile for coal at speeds of up to fifty miles an hour
britain now had had the model for the world in a well integrated well engineered system that allowed fast cheap movement of freight and people and which could be replicated in other major nations
the railways directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers mechanics repairmen and technicians as well as statisticians and financial planners
they developed new and more efficient and less expensive techniques
most important they created a mindset of how technology could be used in many different forms of business
railways had a major impact on industrialization
by lowering transportation costs they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railroad system itself
by there were locomotives which each carried passengers a year or tons of freight
member of parliament and solicitor to the city of london charles pearson campaigned for an underground rail service in london
parts of the first such railway the metropolitan line opened to the public in thereby becoming the first subway line in the world
trains were originally steam powered but in the first electric trains entered service
that same year the whole system became officially known as the tube after the shape of the rail tunnels
it was not until that the name london underground was introduced
india provides an example of the london based financiers pouring money and expertise into a very well built system designed for military reasons after the mutiny of and with the hope that it would stimulate industry
the system was overbuilt and much too elaborate and expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried
however it did capture the imagination of the indians who saw their railways as the symbol of an industrial modernity but one that was not realised until a century or so later
a gas network for lighting and heating was introduced in the s
the model town of saltaire was founded along with others as a planned environment with good sanitation and many civic educational and recreational facilities although it lacked a pub which was regarded as a focus of dissent
although initially developed in the early years of the th century gas lighting became widespread during the victorian era in industry homes public buildings and the streets
the invention of the incandescent gas mantle in the s greatly improved light output and ensured its survival as late as the s
hundreds of gasworks were constructed in cities and towns across the country
in incandescent electric lights were introduced to london streets although it took many years before they were installed everywhere
medicine progressed during queen victoria s reign
in fact medicine at the start of the nineteenth century was little different from that in the medieval era whereas by the end of the century it became a lot closer to twenty first century practice thanks to advances in science especially microbiology paving the way for the germ theory of disease
this was during the height of the industrial revolution and urbanisation occurred at a frantic pace
as the population density of the cities grew epidemics of cholera smallpox tuberculosis and typhus were commonplace
after studying previous outbreaks physician john snow drew the conclusion that cholera was a water borne disease
when the broke out snow mapped the locations of the cases in soho london and found that they centered around a well he deemed contaminated
he asked that the pump s handle be replaced after which the epidemic petered out
snow also discovered that households whose water supplies came from companies that used the thames downstream after many sewers had flown into the river were fourteen times more likely to die from cholera
he thus recommended boiling water before use
sanitation reforms prompted by the public health acts and were made in the crowded dirty streets of the existing cities and soap was the main product shown in the relatively new phenomenon of advertising
a great engineering feat in the victorian era was the sewage system in london
it was designed by joseph bazalgette in
he proposed to build mi km of sewer system linked with over mi km of street sewers
many problems were encountered but the sewers were completed
after this bazalgette designed the thames embankment which housed sewers water pipes and the london underground
during the same period london s water supply network was expanded and improved
john simon as chief medical officer of the general board of health secured funds for research into various common infectious diseases at the time including cholera diphtheria smallpox and typhus
using his political influence he garnered support for the public health act of which focused on preventative measures in housing the water supply sewage and drainage providing britain with an extensive public health system
by mid century the stethoscope became an oft used device and designs of the microscope had advanced enough for scientists to closely examine pathogens
the pioneering work of french microbiologist louis pasteur from the s earned widespread acceptance for the germ theory of disease
it led to the introduction antiseptics by joseph lister in in the form of carbolic acid phenol
he instructed the hospital staff to wear gloves and wash their hands instruments and dressings with a phenol solution and in he invented a machine that would spray carbolic acid in the operating theatre during surgery
infection related deaths fell noticeably as a result
as the british empire expanded britons found themselves facing novel climates and contagions there was active research into tropical diseases
in ronald ross proved that the mosquito was responsible for spreading malaria
although nitrous oxide or laughing gas had been proposed as an anaesthetic as far back as by humphry davy it was not until when an american dentist named william morton started using ether on his patients that anaesthetics became common in the medical profession
in chloroform was introduced as an anaesthetic by james young simpson
chloroform was favoured by doctors and hospital staff because it is much less flammable than ether but critics complained that it could cause the patient to have a heart attack
chloroform gained in popularity in england and germany after john snow gave queen victoria chloroform for the birth of her eighth child prince leopold
by chloroform was used in to of all narcoses performed in the uk and german speaking countries
a combination of antiseptics and anaesthetics helped surgeons operate more carefully and comfortably on their patients
anaesthetics made painless dentistry possible
at the same time sugar consumption in the british diet increased greatly increasing instances of tooth decay
as a result more and more people were having teeth extracted and needing dentures
this gave rise to waterloo teeth which were real human teeth set into hand carved pieces of ivory from hippopotamus or walrus jaws
the teeth were obtained from executed criminals victims of battlefields from grave robbers and were even bought directly from the desperately impoverished
the increase in tooth decay also brought the first prominent recommendation for fluoride as a nutrient particularly in pregnancy and childhood in
news of the discovery of x rays in spread like wildfire
its medical value was realised immediately and within a year doctors were prescribing x rays for diagnosis in particular to locate bone fractures and foreign objects inside the patient s body
radioactivity was discovered and was later to used to treat cancer
during the second half of the nineteenth century british medical doctors became increasingly specialised following the footsteps of their german counterparts and more hospitals were built
surgeons began wearing gowns in the operating room and doctors white coats and stethoscopes sights that are common in the early twenty first century
yet despite all the aforementioned medical advances the mortality rate fell only marginally from per thousand in to by the end of the century
urbanisation aided the spread of diseases and squalid living conditions in many places exacerbated the problem
moreover while some diseases such as cholera were being driven out others such as sexually transmitted diseases made themselves felt
victorian morality was a surprising new reality
the changes in moral standards and actual behaviour across the british were profound
historian harold perkin wrote
between and the english ceased to be one of the most aggressive brutal rowdy outspoken riotous cruel and bloodthirsty nations in the world and became one of the most inhibited polite orderly tender minded prudish and hypocritical historians continue to debate the various causes of this dramatic change
asa briggs emphasizes the strong reaction against the french revolution and the need to focus british efforts on its defeat and not be diverged by pleasurable sins
briggs also stresses the powerful role of the evangelical movement among the nonconformists as well as the evangelical faction inside the established church of england
the religious and political reformers set up organizations that monitored behaviour and pushed for government action
among the higher social classes there was a marked decline in gambling horse races and obscene theatres there was much less heavy gambling or patronage of upscale houses of prostitution
the highly visible debauchery characteristic of aristocratic england in the early th century simply disappeared
historians agree that the middle classes not only professed high personal moral standards but actually followed them
there is a debate whether the working classes followed suit
moralists in the late th century such as henry mayhew decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births
however new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low under for the working class and the poor
by contrast in st century britain nearly half of all children are born outside marriage and nine in ten newlyweds have been cohabitating
crime was getting exponentially worse
there were arrests for criminal offenses in tripling to in and doubling to in in england and wales
th century british criminology had emphasized severe punishment
slowly capital punishment was replaced by transportation first to the american colonies and then to australia and especially by long term incarceration in newly built prisons
as one historian points out public and violent punishment which attacked the body by branding whipping and hanging was giving way to reformation of the mind of the criminal by breaking his spirit and encouraging him to reflect on his shame before labour and religion transformed his character crime rates went up leading to calls for harsher measures to stop the flood of criminals released under the penal servitude system
the reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons colonel edmund frederick du cane was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of hard labour hard fare and a hard bed
as the prisons grew more numerous they became more depraved
historian s
checkland says it was sunk in promiscuity and squalor jailers tyranny and greed and administrative confusion in du cane encouraged disraeli s government to remove all prisons from local government he held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in
by the s the prison population was over
by the victorian era penal transportation to australia was falling out of use since it did not reduce crime rates
the british penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform education and training for post prison livelihoods
the reforms were controversial and contested
in era a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system
in the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the home office under a prison commission
the prison act of enabled the home secretary to impose multiple reforms on his own initiative without going through the politicized process of parliament
the probation of offenders act of introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life
the criminal justice administration act of required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines
previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason
the borstal system after was organized to reclaim young offenders and the children act of prohibited imprisonment under age and strictly limited that of ages to
the principal reformer was sir evelyn ruggles brise the chair of the prison commission
the infamous whitechapel murders purportedly composed by serial killer jack the ripper were committed in london in during the mid to late chapter of the victorian era
during victorian england prostitution was seen as a great social evil by clergymen and major news organizations but many feminists viewed prostitution as a means of economic independence for women
estimates of the number of prostitutes in london in the s vary widely but in his landmark study prostitution william acton reported an estimation of prostitutes in london alone in
the differing views on prostitution have made it difficult to understand its history
judith walkowitz has multiple works focusing on the feminist point of view on the topic of prostitution
many sources blame economic disparities as leading factors in the rise of prostitution and walkowitz writes that the demographic within prostitution varied greatly
however women who struggled financially were much more likely to be prostitutes than those with a secure source of income
orphaned or half orphaned women were more likely to turn to prostitution as a means of income
while overcrowding in urban cities and the amount of job opportunities for females were limited walkowitz argues that there were other variables that lead women to prostitution
walkowitz acknowledges that prostitution allowed for women to feel a sense of independence and self respect
although many assume that pimps controlled and exploited these prostitutes some women managed their own clientele and pricing
it is evident that women were exploited by this system yet walkowitz says that prostitution was often their opportunity to gain social and economic independence
prostitution at this time was regarded by women in the profession to be a short term position and once they earned enough money there were hopes that they would move on to a different profession
as previously stated the arguments for and against prostitution varied greatly from it being perceived as a mortal sin or desperate decision to an independent choice
while there were plenty of people publicly denouncing prostitution in england there were also others who took opposition to them
one event that sparked a lot of controversy was the implementation of the contagious diseases acts
this was a series of three acts in and that allowed police officers to stop women whom they believed to be prostitutes and force them to be examined
if the suspected woman was found with a venereal disease they placed the woman into a lock hospital
arguments made against the acts claimed that the regulations were unconstitutional and that they only targeted women
in a national association in opposition of the acts was created
because women were excluded from the first national association the ladies national association was formed
the leader of that organization was josephine butler
butler was an outspoken feminist during this time who fought for many social reforms
her book personal reminiscences of a great crusade describes her oppositions to the c d
along with the publication of her book she also went on tours condemning the c d
acts throughout the s
other supporters of reforming the acts included quakers methodists and many doctors
eventually the acts were fully repealed in
the book prostitution action by dr
william acton included detailed reports on his observations of prostitutes and the hospitals they would be placed in if they were found with a venereal disease
acton believed that prostitution was a poor institution but it is a result of the supply and demand for it
he wrote that men had sexual desires and they sought to relieve them and for many prostitution was the way to do it
while he referred to prostitutes as wretched women he did note how the acts unfairly criminalized women and ignored the men involved
