continental margin outer edge continental crust abutting oceanic crust coastal waters
one three major zone ocean floor two deep-ocean basin mid-ocean ridges
continental margin consists three different feature continental rise continental slope continental shelf
continental shelf relatively shallow water area found proximity continents
continental shelf portion continental margin transition shore towards ocean
continental shelf generally flat end shelf break drastic increase slope angle mean angle continental shelf worldwide typically steeper closer coastline near shelf break
shelf break begin continental slope km deep-ocean floor
continental slope often exhibit feature called submarine canyons
submarine canyon often cut continental shelf deeply near vertical side continue cut morphology abyssal plain
canyon often v-shaped sometime enlarge onto continental shelf
base continental slope sudden decrease slope angle sea floor begin level towards abyssal plain
portion seafloor called continental rise mark outermost zone continental margin
active margin convergent transform margin also place high tectonic activity including volcano earthquakes
west coast north america south america active margins
active continental margin typically narrow coast shelf break steep descent trenches
convergent active margin occur oceanic plate meet continental plates
denser oceanic crust one plate subducts le dense continental crust another plate
transform active margin rare occur oceanic plate continental plate moving parallel opposite directions
transform margin often characterized many offshore fault cause high degree relief offshore marked island shallow bank deep basins
passive margin often located interior lithospheric plate away plate boundary lack major tectonic activity
come wide variety feature low-relief land extending mile away beach long river system pile sediment accumulating continental shelf
continental crust weather erodes degrades mainly sand clays
modern river sediment often still preserved closer shore continental shelf show high level glacial relict sediment deposited sea level wa lower
often found passive margin several kilometre sediment consisting terrigenous carbonate biogenous deposits
sediment reservoir often useful study paleoceanography original formation ocean basins
deposit often well preserved active margin shelf due tectonic activity
often productive portion continental margin well studied portion due relatively shallow accessible depths
