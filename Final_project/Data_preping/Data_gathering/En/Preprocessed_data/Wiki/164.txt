the black knight is a british american technicolor adventure film directed by tay garnett and starring alan ladd as the title character and peter cushing and patrick troughton as two conspirators attempting to overthrow king arthur
it is the last of ladd s trilogy with warwick films the others being the red beret and hell below zero based on hammond innes book the white south
the blacksmith and swordsmith john alan ladd is tutored at the court of king arthur anthony bushell but as a commoner he can t hope to win the hand of lady linet patricia medina daughter of the earl of yeonil harry andrews
the earl s castle is attacked by saracens and cornishmen disguised as vikings and his wife is killed making him lose his memory
the attack was part of a plot by the saracen sir palamides peter cushing and the pagan cornish king mark patrick troughton to overthrow arthur and christianity and take over the country whilst pretending to be arthur s friends and allies palamides is a knight of the round table and mark has faked his own baptism
john accuses palamides servant bernard bill brandon of murder before arthur who grants him three months grace to prove the accusation or face execution himself
another knight sir ontzlake andr morell takes pity on john and trains him in swordplay so that he can take on an alternative secret identity as the wandering black knight
the vikings raid a newly founded monastery and take lady linet and its monks to stonehenge for a pagan sacrifice but the black knight arrives and saves her closely followed by arthur and his knights who defeat the pagans and destroy stonehenge
sir palamides tricks the lady linet into his castle to try to get her to reveal the black knight s identity but john is informed of this and saves her still in disguise
sir ontzlake then sends him to king mark s castle where a pro arthur woodcarver shows him a secret tunnel into the royal chambers
john arrives in time to overhear mark and palamides finalising their plot but palamides beats him back to camelot tricking arthur into thinking that the black knight is leading the viking raids
john arrives dressed as the black knight and despite revealing his identity is briefly imprisoned until lady linet and sir ontzlake free him with the latter standing bail for john to arthur
john returns to mark s castle where he traps mark s forces and kidnaps mark at swordpoint
the following morning the saracens land near camelot and sir palamides and bernard trick their way into camelot
bernard stabs a man in arthur s bed only to find it is mark and not arthur
john chases bernard and he falls from the battlements whilst arthur s knights trick the saracens by replying to their fire arrow signal which was to have been the signal for the cornish to join the saracen attack
the knights defeat the saracens beneath camelot s walls while inside them john beats palamides single handed
as a reward arthur knights john and offers him the further boon of his heart s desire
john asks to marry the lady linet and both she and arthur accept
the black knight was the fourth film alan ladd made outside the us in order to qualify for a tax exemption
his fee was as against of the gross
filming started in september
shooting took place at pinewood studios with exterior shots filmed at castell coch wales and on location in vila spain
producer irwin allen called spain a wonderful country to make pictures in because of its more than old castles twelve of which were used in the film
the film s sets were designed by the art director alex vetchinsky
halfway through production bryan forbes was called in to do some rewriting of the script he is credited as additional dialogue by
according to forbes s memoirs alan ladd s wife and long time agent sue carol had script approval and objected to a scene where her husband s character stole a horse
during a script conference she repeated alan ladd does not steal a horse period
i m telling you
he steals a horse we lose the boy scouts association and the daughters of the american revolution to say nothing of his fan club irving allen the senior producer was equal to the occasion and replied he s not stealing a horse sue he s borrowing a horse
you know like a hertz car so show me the difference said mrs ladd you keep the stolen horse in and you start looking for another star because we re gonna be on the next plane home how would it be i said if we kept all the action up to the point where mr ladd disposes single handedly of the attacking vikings then he runs to a sentry and says is that the horse i ordered the sentry nods in agreement and mr ladd jumps on the horse and rides over the drawbridge yeah i ll buy that said mrs ladd and that is what we shot she also instructed forbes when writing dialogue for ladd to keep him monosyllabic
donald sinden then a contract star for the rank organisation at pinewood studios had a permanent dressing room in the same block as ladd s
he said ladd brought in his entourage a double cum stunt man who bore an uncanny resemblance to him
the double did all the long shots most of the medium shots and even appeared in two shots when the hero had his back to the camera
the star only did eleven days work in the entire film
he was extremely short in stature and unless he was alone the camera could never show his feet because if he was stationary he was standing on a box if walking the other actors were in specially dug troughs or ditches and for anything between all other actors were required to stand with their legs apart and their knees bent
the title tune for the film was the whistling gypsy
for this purpose it was given new lyrics by its songwriter leo maguire and elton hayes who sang it in the film
one critic jeffrey richards thought ladd badly miscast playing the part like a tired american businessman prevailed upon to take the lead in a revival of merrie england
by contrast andrews and bushell played their parts for all and more than they were worth giving every one of the pseudo archaic line e g away with him his presence doth offend our sense of honour the full treatment resonant shakespearean delivery and lyceum flourishes
a lot of footage from this film was re used in the low budget matin e film siege of the saxons which is also set in arthurian times even the short sleeved signature armour of the black knight reappears for the sake of continuity
