Thiruvalluvar Tamil திருவள்ளுவர் commonly known as Valluvar was a celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher
He is best known as the author of the Tirukkuṟaḷ a collection of couplets on ethics political and economical matters and love
The text is considered an exceptional and widely cherished work of Tamil literature
Almost no authentic information is available about Valluvar states Kamil Zvelebil a scholar of Tamil literature
His life and likely background are variously inferred from his literary works by different biographers
There are unauthentic hagiographic and legendary accounts of Valluvar's life and all major Indian religions as well as Christian missionaries of the th century have tried to claim him as secretly inspired crypto- or originally belonging to their tradition
Little is known with certainty about his family background religious affiliation or birthplace
He is believed to have lived at least in the town of Mylapore a neighbourhood of the present-day Chennai and his floruit is dated variously from fourth century BCE to early fifth century CE based on the traditional accounts and the linguistic analyses of his writings
Maraimalai Adigal gives BCE as the birth year of Valluvar while Kamil Zvelebil infers the Tirukkuṟaḷ and Valluvar are best dated to around CE
Valluvar has influenced a wide range of scholars down the ages since his time across the ethical social political economical religious philosophical and spiritual spheres
He has long been venerated as a great sage and his literary works a classic of Tamil culture
There is negligible authentic information available about Valluvar's life
In fact neither his actual name nor the original title of his work can be determined with certainty
Tirukkuṟaḷ itself does not name its author
Monsieur Ariel a French translator of his work in the th century famously said it is the book without a name by an author without a name
Saint Valluvar was first mentioned in the later text Tiruvalluva Maalai
The speculations about Valluvar's life are largely inferred from his work Tirukkuṟaḷ and other Tamil literature that quote him
According to Zvelebil Valluvar was probably a learned Jain with eclectic leanings and intimate acquaintance with the early works of Tamil classical period and some knowledge of the Sanskrit legal and didactic texts subhashita
The Shaivite Tamil text Tiruvalluva Maalai contains the earliest known textual reference to the legend of Valluvar but it remains undated
This text attracted attention in the colonial era because an early th-century commentary referred to him as Valluvan Valluvar whose text presented the esoteric wisdom of the Vedas to the world
The original text relates the Kural in the context of Sanskrit literature
The commentary includes the gloss that Valluvan was born in a low caste but the original text does not
According to Stuart Blackburn this comment appears to be extra-textual and possibly based on the oral tradition
No other pre-colonial textual sources have been found to support any legends about the life of Valluvar
Starting around the early th century numerous legends on Valluvar in Indian languages and English were published
Various claims have been made regarding Valluvar's family background and occupation in the colonial era literature all inferred from selective sections of his text or hagiographies published since the colonial era started in Tamil Nadu
One traditional version claims that he was a Paraiyar weaver
Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of Vellalars because he extols agriculture in his work
Another states he was an outcast born to a Pariah woman and Brahmin father
Mu Raghava Iyengar speculated that valluva in his name is a variation of vallabha the designation of a royal officer
Vaiyapuri Pillai suggested Valluvar derived his name from valluvan a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers and theorized that he was the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army
Stuart in his Census Report of claimed that Valluvans were a priestly class among the Paraiyars and served as priests during Pallava reign and similarly Robert Caldwell J
Tremenheere and Edward Jewitt Robinson too claimed that Valluvar was a Paraiyar
Valluvar was likely married to a woman named Vasuki and lived in Mylapore
According to traditional accounts Valluvar died on the day of Anusham in the Tamil month of Vaikasi
The poem Kapilar Agaval purportedly written by Kapilar describes its author as a brother of Valluvar
It states that they were children of a Pulaya mother named Adi and a Brahmin father named Bhagwan
The poem claims that the couple had seven children including three sons Valluvar Kapilar and Atikaman and four sisters Avvai Uppai Uruvai and Velli
Kamil Zvelebil dates Kapilar Agaval to th century CE based on its language
Various biographies mention the name of Valluvar's wife as Vasuki but such details are of doubtful historicity
The traditional biographies are not only inconsistent they contain claims about Valluvar that are not credible
Along with various versions of his birth circumstances many state he went to a mountain and met the legendary Agastya and other sages
During his return journey he sits under a tree whose shadow sits still over Valluvar and does not move the entire day he kills a demon performs miracles such as causing floods and making them retreat he touches a grounded ship which miraculously then floats and sails off his bride Vasuki cooks sand which comes out as boiled rice and many more
Scholars consider these and all associated aspects of these hagiographic stories to be fiction and ahistorical a feature common to international and Indian folklore
The alleged low birth high birth and being a pariah in the traditional accounts are also doubtful
By Purnalingam Pillai an ardent Dravidianist had analyzed and called these traditional accounts and stories as myths
Pillai's analysis and arguments are robust according to Blackburn
These fictional accounts of Valluvar's life have become popular because aspects of the traditional accounts were selectively accepted by Christian missionaries such as George Pope and other European writers were widely published and then became a required reading about Tamil history
The exact date of Valluvar is unclear
His work Tirukkuṟaḷ has been dated variously from BCE to about the sixth century CE
According to traditional accounts it was the last work of the third Sangam and was subjected to a divine test which it passed
The scholars who believe this tradition such as Somasundara Bharathiar and M
Rajamanickam date the text to as early as BCE
Pillay assigned it to the early first-century CE
These early dates such as BCE to BCE are unacceptable and not supported by evidence within the text states Zvelebil
The diction and grammar of the Tirukkuṟaḷ his indebtedness to some earlier Sanskrit sources suggest that he lived after the early Tamil bardic poets but before Tamil bhakti poets era
Vaiyapuri Pillai assigned the work to around or after the sixth-century CE
His proposal is based on the evidence that the Tirukkuṟaḷ contains a large proportion of Sanskrit loan words shows awareness and indebtedness to some Sanskrit texts best dated to the first half of the first-millennium CE and the grammatical innovations in the language of Tirukkuṟaḷ
Pillai published a list of Sanskrit loan words in Tirukkuṟaḷ
Later scholars Thomas Burrow and Murray Barnson Emeneau show that of these are of Dravidian origin and not Sanskrit loan words
Zvelebil states that an additional few have uncertain etymology and future studies may prove those to be Dravidian
The remaining loan words from Sanskrit are not negligible and some of the teachings in the Tirukkuṟaḷ states Zvelebil are undoubtedly based on the then extant Sanskrit works such as the Arthashastra and Manusmriti also called the Manavadharmasastra
According to Kamil Zvelebil the Tirukkuṟaḷ does not belong to the Sangam period
In the s Zvelebil dated the text to somewhere between and CE
His estimate is based on the dates of Tamil texts with similar Tamil language features and by placing it after some of the Tamil and Sanskrit treatises that are evidenced in the Tirukkuṟaḷ
Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations that are absent in the older Sangam literature
The text also features a higher number of Sanskrit loan words compared with these older texts
According to Zvelebil besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition the author was also a part of the one great Indian ethical didactic tradition as a few of his verses are undoubtedly translations of the verses in Sanskrit classics
In the th century and early th century European writers and missionaries variously dated the text and Valluvar to between and CE
According to Blackburn the current scholarly consensus dates the text and the author to approximately CE
In January the Tamil Nadu government officially recognized BCE as the year of Valluvar
As suggested by Maraimalai Adigal the Valluvar Year was added to the calendar
Thus the Valluvar year is calculated by adding to any year of the common era
As with most other details about Valluvar the exact place of his birth remains uncertain
Valluvar is believed to have lived in Madurai and later in the town of Mayilapuram or Thirumayilai present-day Mylapore in Chennai
There are also accounts that say he was born in Mayilapuram and later moved to Madurai in order to publish his work at the royal court
The poem Kapilar Akaval states that Valluvar was born on the top of an oil-nut or iluppai tree Madhuca indica in Mayilapuram
while verse of the Tiruvalluva Maalai claims that he was born in Madurai
In a three-member research team from the Kanyakumari Historical and Cultural Research Centre KHCRC claimed that Valluvar was born in Thirunayanarkurichi a village in present-day Kanyakumari district
Their claim was based on an old Kani tribal leader who told them that Valluvar was a king who ruled the Valluvanadu territory in the hilly tracts of the Kanyakumari district
Valluvar is generally thought to have belonged to either Jainism or Hinduism
Hinduism Jainism and Buddhism were the three religions that flourished in the Indian subcontinent during the time of Valluvar
Early th-century writers proposed that Valluvar may have been a Jain
The translation by Francis Whyte Ellis mentions that the Tamil community debates whether Valluvar was a Jain or Hindu
If Valluvar was indeed a Jain it raises questions about the source of the traditional Valluvar legends and the mainstream colonial debate about his birth
Kamil Zvelebil believes that the ethics of the Tirukkuṟaḷ reflects the Jain moral code particularly moral vegetarianism couplets and ahimsa that is abstention from killing couplets scholars also note the articulation of Thiruvalluvar in one of the couplets of Tirukkuṟaḷ on the liberation Moksha from the cycle of rebirth Saṃsāra through living a life with a compassionate heart
Zvelebil states that the text contains epithets for God that reflect Jain ideology
Malarmicaiyekinan Couplet he who walked upon the lotus flower
Aravaliyantanan Couplet the Brahmin who had the wheel of dharma
Enkunattan Couplet one of the eight-fold qualitiesThese according to Zvelebil are very much Jaina-like because the arhat is seen as standing on the lotus or where the arhat in the Jain conception is the god with the lotus as his vehicle
There are exceptions adds Zvelebil when Valluvar treats this God with epithets found in the Hindu text Manusmriti that is the Primeval Lord and the King the Monarch
Zvelebil states that his proposal is supported by the th-century Hindu scholar Parimelalhagar who wrote a commentary on the Kural text who admitted that these epithets are very well applicable to a Jain Arhat
Sundaram a scholar who has translated the text in the late th century Parimelalhagar's commentary explicitly states that there are no Jaina heretical beliefs in the texts either
Some other epithets mentioned in the text also reflect a strong ascetic flavour of Jainism in Zvelebil's view
Ventutal ventamai ilan Couplet he who has neither desire nor aversion
Porivayil aintavittan Couplet he who has destroyed the gates of the five sensesZvelebil further states that Valluvar seems to have been cognizant of the latest developments in Jainism
Zvelebil theorizes that he was probably a learned Jain with eclectic leanings who was well-acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature and also had knowledge of the Sanskrit texts
Early Digambara or Svetambara Jaina texts do not mention Valluvar
The first claim of Valluvar as an authority appears in a th-century Jain text about years after his life
According to other scholars Valluvar's writings suggest that he belonged to Hinduism
Hindu teachers have mapped his teachings in Tirukkuṟaḷ to the teachings found in Hindu texts
Valluvar's treatment of the concept of ahimsa or non-violence which is the principal concept in both Jainism and Hinduism bolsters this argument
While the text extols the virtue of non-violence it also dedicates many of porul couplets to various aspects of statecraft and warfare in a manner similar to Arthasastra An army has a duty to kill in battle and a king must execute criminals for justice This non-mystic realism and the readiness for just war teachings are similar to those found in Hinduism
Purnalingam Pillai Valluvar has not condemned Saiva Siddhanta or its principles anywhere in the text which he says is the crucial test to be applied in determining his religion
Matthieu Ricard believes Valluvar belonged to the Shaivite tradition of South India
The three parts that the Kural literature is divided into namely aram virtue porul wealth and inbam love aiming at attaining vitu ultimate salvation follow respectively the four foundations of Hinduism namely dharma artha kama and moksha
According to Norman Cutler the prodigious th-century Tamil scholar Parimelalakar who wrote the most influential commentary on Tirukkuṟaḷ interprets the layout and focus on the Valluvar to be synonymous with the Sanskritic concept of Puruṣārtha the objectives of human life
According to Parimelalakar the Valluvar text covers primarily and directly the first three aspects but not vitu moksha release
The text however does cover turavaram renunciation the means to attain spiritual release
In the introductory chapters of the Kural Valluvar cites Indra the king of heaven to exemplify the virtue of conquest over one's senses
According to Tamil Hindu scholars such as Parimelalakar other concepts and teachings found in Valluvar's text and also found in Hindu texts include Vedas gods Trimurti sattva guṇa munis and sadhus renouncers rebirth affirmation of a primordial God among others
According to Purnalingam Pillai who is known for his critique of Brahminism a rational analysis of the Valluvar's work suggests that he was a Hindu and not a Jain
Glazov a Tamil literature scholar and the translator of the Kural text into the Russian language sees Thiruvalluvar as a Hindu by faith according to a review by Kamil Zvelebil
Valluvar's mentioning of God Vishnu in couplets and and Goddess Lakshmi in couplets and hints at the Vaishnavite beliefs of Valluvar
Shaivites have characterised Valluvar as a devotee of Shiva and have installed his images in their temples
According to Zvelebil Valluvar sometimes uses epithets for God that are found in Hindu Dharmasastras and not in Jaina texts
Further in some teachings about politics economics and love Valluvar undoubtedly has translated into Tamil the verses found in Sanskrit texts such as Arthasastra
According to Stuart Blackburn the Tirukkuṟaḷ is not a bhakti text and it neither satirizes nor eulogizes Brahmins or ritualism
It is a practical pragmatic text and certainly not a Shaivite or Vaishnavite text
According to Norman Cutler Tirukkuṟaḷ is an aphoristic text and the influential Parimelalakar's commentary interprets it within his own context grounded in Hindu concepts and theological agenda
His elegantly written interpretations have made his commentary a Tamil classic and maneuvered Valluvar as consistent within the framework of Parimelalakar's Hinduism
His commentary on Valluvar's teachings reflects both the cultural values and textual values in the th-to-th-century Tamil Nadu
Valluvar's text can be interpreted and maneuvered in other ways
Despite scholars suggesting that Valluvar is either a Jain or a Hindu owing to the Kural text's non-denominational nature almost every religious group in India including Christianity has claimed the work and its author as one of their own
However these claims are not supported academically and are constantly refuted by scholars
For example the Christian claims have cropped up only after the colonial missionaries came to India
Varadarajan suggests Valluvar must have practised religious eclecticism maintained unshakeable faith in dharma but should have rejected religious symbols and superstitious beliefs
BuddhismThe Dalit activist Iyothee Thass who converted to Buddhism claimed that Valluvar was originally called Tiruvalla Nayanar and was a Buddhist
Thass further contended that the name Tirukkuṟaḷ is a reference to the Buddhist Tripiṭaka
He claims that Valluvar's book was originally called Tirikural Three Kurals because it adhered to the three Buddhist scriptures Dhamma Pitaka Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka
According to Thass the legend that presents Valluvar as the son of a Brahmin father and a Paraiyar mother was invented by Brahmins in who wanted to Hinduise a Buddhist text
According to Geetha the deconstruction and reinterpretation of the history of Valluvar into a Buddhist framework by Thass shows the significance and appropriation of Valluvar's text by all sections of Tamil society
ChristianityThe th-century Christian missionary George Uglow Pope claimed that Valluvar must have come in contact with Christian teachers such as Pantaenus of Alexandria imbibed Christian ideas and peculiarities of Alexandrian teachers and then wrote the wonderful Kurral with an echo of the Sermon of the Mount
According to Pope Valluvar must have lived in the ninth century CE because that would fit the historical chronology to his theory
Nallaswamy Pillai Sundaram Pillai Kanakasabai Pillai and Krishnaswamy Aiyengar and even missionaries such as John Lazarus refute such claims
Pillai declares Pope's claim as an absurd literary anachronism and says that the first two books of the Kural in particular are a stumbling block which can browbeat the most sublime ideas of Christian morality According to John Lazarus the Kural's chapter on no killing applies to both humans and animals in stark contrast to the Bible's concept of killing which refers only to the taking away of human life
He observes None of the ten epithets by which the Deity is described in the opening chapter of the Kural have the remotest connection with Christ or God that is to say as they are designated in the Bible
He also says that the chapter on love is quite different from the Apostle’s eulogium in Cor
In the s some South Indian Christians led by M
Deivanayagam at the Madras Christian College presented Valluvar as a disciple of Thomas the Apostle
According to this theory Thomas visited present-day Chennai where Valluvar listened to his lectures on the Sermon of the Mount
According to Zvelebil the ethics and ideas in Valluvar's work are not Christian ethics but those found in Jainism doctrine
Zvelebil points out to the Kural's unwavering emphasis on the ethics of moral vegetarianism Chapter and non-killing Chapter as against any of the Abrahamic religious texts
Tirukkuṟaḷ is the primary work credited to Valluvar
It contains couplets which are divided into sections of couplets each
The first sections are on moral and cosmic order Tamil aram Skt dharma the next are about political and economic matters Tamil porul Skt artha and the remaining are about pleasure Tamil inbam Skt kama
Of the three sections Valluvar's second section porul is about twice the size of first section and three times that of the third
In the couplets on porul of the text Valluvar mostly discusses statecraft and warfare
Valluvar's work is a classic on realism and pragmatism and it is not a mystic purely philosophical document
Valluvar teachings are similar to those found in Arthasastra but differ in some important aspects
In Valluvar's theory of state unlike Kautilya the army patai is most important element
Valluvar recommends that a well kept and well trained army patai led by an able commander and ready to go to war is necessary for a state
Valluvar presents his theory of state using six elements army patai subjects kuti treasure kul ministers amaiccu allies natpu and forts aran
Valluvar also recommends forts and other infrastructure supplies and food storage in preparation for siege
The Tirukkuṟaḷ text has been translated into several Indian and international languages
It was translated into Latin by Constanzo Beschi in which helped make the work known to European intellectuals
Tirukkuṟaḷ is one of the most revered works in the Tamil language
Tirukkuṟaḷ is generally recognized as the only work by Valluvar
However in the Tamil literary tradition Valluvar is attributed to be the author of many other later-dated texts including two Tamil texts on medicine Gnana Vettiyan verses and Pancharathnam verses
Many scholars state that these are much later era texts th and th centuries possibly by an author with the same name as Valluvar
These books 'Pancharathnam' and 'Gnana Vettiyan' contribute to Tamil science literature and other Siddha medicines
In addition to these other Tamil texts have been attributed to Valluvar namely Rathna Sigamani verses Karpam verses Nadhaantha Thiravukol verses Naadhaantha Saaram verses Vaithiya Suthram verses Karpaguru Nool verses Muppu Saathiram verses Vaadha Saathiram verses Muppu Guru verses Kavuna Mani verses Aeni Yettram verses Guru Nool verses Sirppa Chinthamani a text on astrology Tiruvalluvar Gyanam and Tiruvalluvar Kanda Tirunadanam
Several scholars such as Devaneya Pavanar deny that Thiruvalluvar was the author of these texts
George Uglow Pope called Valluvar the greatest poet of South India but according to Zvelebil he does not seem to have been a poet
According to Zvelebil while the author handles the metre very skillfully the Tirukkuṟaḷ does not feature true and great poetry throughout the work except notably in the third book which deals with love and pleasure
This suggests that Valluvar's main aim was not to produce a work of art but rather an instructive text focused on wisdom justice and ethics
Valluvar is revered and highly esteemed in the Tamil culture and this is reflected in the fact that his work has been called by nine different names Tirukkuṟaḷ the sacred kural Uttaravedam the ultimate Veda Thiruvalluvar eponymous with the author Poyyamoli the falseless word Vayurai valttu truthful praise Teyvanul the divine book Potumarai the common Veda Muppal the three-fold path and Tamilmarai the Tamil Veda
Its influence and historic use is legendary
In the German missionary Bartholomaus Ziegenbalg remarked that the Malabaris think very highly of it they make it their handbook often quoting from it to prove the validity of their traditions and arguments and such books are not just read but learned by heart by the learned among them
According to Blackburn it is hard to outdo the hyperbolic honors heaped on Valluvar and his work by the early Europeans in colonial India
Gover for example praised it as Tamil Homer The Ten Commandments and Dante rolled into one
During the colonial era it was the text the Hindus used to respond to the Christian allegations of Hindu superstition and barbarity
Valluvar is traditionally worshiped as a god and saint by various communities across the Southern region of India
Many communities including those in Mylapore and Tiruchuli worship Valluvar as the th Nayanmar of the Saivite tradition
There are various temples exclusively dedicated to Valluvar across South India
The most famous of these is the temple at Mylapore Chennai
Built in the early th century the temple is located within the Ekambareeswara-Kamakshi Shiva-Parvati temple complex in Mylapore
The locals believe that this is where Valluvar was born underneath a tree within the shrines complex
A Valluvar statue in a seated posture holding a palm leaf manuscript of Tirukkuṟaḷ sits under the tree
In the shrine dedicated to him Valluvar's wife Vasuki is patterned after the Hindu deity Kamakshi inside the sanctum
The temple shikhara spire above the sanctum shows scenes of Hindu life and deities along with Valluvar reading his couplets to his wife
The sthala vriksham holy tree of the temple is the iluppai tree under which Valluvar is believed to have been born
The temple was extensively renovated in the s
At the Valluvar temple at Tiruchuli near Aruppukkottai in Virudhunagar district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu Valluvar is taken in a procession as the th Nayanmar on his death anniversary in the Tamil month of Maasi FebruaryMarch by the Valluvar community who are into fortune-telling chiefly in the Periya Pudupatti village
The same practice can be found in other communities as well including Mylapore
Other temples for Valluvar are located at Periya Kalayamputhur Thondi Kanjoor Thattanpady Senapathy and Vilvarani
A temple-like memorial to Valluvar Valluvar Kottam was built in Chennai in
This monument complex consists of structures usually found in Dravidian temples including a temple car carved from three blocks of granite and a shallow rectangular pond
The auditorium adjoining the memorial is one of the largest in Asia and can seat up to people
A -foot tall statue of Valluvar was unveiled on January at Kanyakumari at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent where the Arabian Sea the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean converge
The feet denote Tirukkuṟaḷ's chapters or athikarams and the show of three fingers denote the three themes Aram Porul and Inbam that is the sections on morals wealth and love
Ganapati Sthapati a temple architect from Tamil Nadu
On August a statue was unveiled in Ulsoor near Bengaluru also making it the first of its kind in India for a poet of a local language to be installed in its near states other than his own home land
A -foot statue of Valluvar was also installed in Haridwar Uttarakhand
There is also a statue of Valluvar outside the School of Oriental and African Studies in Russell Square London
A life-size statue of Valluvar is one among an array of statues installed by the Tamil Nadu government on the stretch of the Marina
The Government of Tamil Nadu celebrates the th th on leap years of January the second of the month of 'Thai' as per Tamil Calendar as Thiruvalluvar Day in the poet's honour as part of the Pongal celebrations
Thiruvalluvar Day was first celebrated on and May
Valluvar's works have also influenced the South Indian classical music and popular culture
Carnatic musicians and composers such as Mayuram Vishwanatha Shastri and M
Dandapani Desigar have tuned select couplets in the th and th centuries
Ravikiran set music to the entire verses using over Indian ragas
The Kural couplets have also been recorded by various Tamil film music composers
