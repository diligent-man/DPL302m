the clouded leopard neofelis nebulosa also called the mainland clouded leopard is a wild cat inhabiting dense forests from the foothills of the himalayas through mainland southeast asia into south china
in the early th century a clouded leopard was brought to london from china and described in
it has large dusky grey blotches and irregular spots and stripes reminiscent of clouds
its head and body length ranges from to cm to in with a to cm to in long tail
it uses its tail for balancing when moving in trees and is able to climb down vertical tree trunks head first
it rests in trees during the day and hunts by night on the forest floor
the clouded leopard is the first cat that genetically diverged to million years ago from the common ancestor of the pantherine cats
today the clouded leopard is locally extinct in singapore taiwan and possibly hainan island and vietnam
its total population is suspected to be fewer than mature individuals with a decreasing population trend and no single population numbering more than adults
it has therefore been listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list since
the population is threatened by large scale deforestation and commercial poaching for the wildlife trade
its body parts are offered for decoration and clothing though it is legally protected in most range countries
the clouded leopard has been kept in zoological gardens since the early th century
captive breeding programs were initiated in the s
in captivity the clouded leopard has an average lifespan of years
felis nebulosa was proposed by edward griffith in who first described a skin of a clouded leopard that was brought alive from canton province in china to the menagerie at exeter exchange in london
felis macrosceloides proposed by brian houghton hodgson in was a clouded leopard specimen from nepal
felis brachyura proposed by robert swinhoe in was a clouded leopard skin from taiwan
the generic name neofelis was proposed by john edward gray in who subordinated all three to this genus
at present n
nebulosa is considered a monotypic species due to lack of evidence for subspeciation
felis diardi proposed by georges cuvier in was based on a clouded leopard skin from java
it was considered a clouded leopard subspecies by reginald innes pocock in
in it was identified as a distinct neofelis species the sunda clouded leopard
populations in taiwan and hainan island are considered to belong to the mainland clouded leopard
skulls of clouded leopard and panthera species were analysed morphologically in the s
results indicate that the clouded leopard forms an evolutionary link between the pantherinae and the felinae
phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear dna in tissue samples from all felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the felidae began in the miocene around to million years ago in asia
analysis of mitochondrial dna of all felidae species indicates a radiation at to million years ago
the clouded leopard is estimated to have been the first cat that genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the felidae to million years ago based on analysis of their nuclear dna
the clouded leopard from mainland asia reached borneo and sumatra via a now submerged land bridge probably during the pleistocene when populations became isolated during periods of global cooling and warming
genetic analysis of hair samples of the clouded leopard and its sister species the sunda clouded leopard n
diardi indicates that they diverged million years ago
the clouded leopard s fur is of a dark grey or ochreous ground color often largely obliterated by black and dark dusky grey blotched pattern
there are black spots on the head and the ears are black
partly fused or broken up stripes run from the corner of the eyes over the cheek from the corner of the mouth to the neck and along the nape to the shoulders
elongated blotches continue down the spine and form a single median stripe on the loins
two large blotches of dark dusky grey hair on the side of the shoulders are each emphasized posteriorly by a dark stripe which passes on to the foreleg and breaks up into irregular spots
the flanks are marked by dark dusky grey irregular blotches bordered behind by long oblique irregularly curved or looped stripes
these blotches yielding the clouded pattern suggest the english name of the cat
the underparts and legs are spotted and the tail is marked by large irregular paired spots
its legs are short and stout and paws broad
females are slightly smaller than males
its hyoid bone is ossified making it possible to purr
its pupils contract into vertical slits
irises are brownish yellow to grayish green
melanistic clouded leopards are uncommon
it has rather short limbs compared to the other big cats
its hind limbs are longer than its front limbs to allow for increased jumping and leaping capabilities
its ulnae and radii are not fused which also contributes to a greater range of motion when climbing trees and stalking prey
clouded leopards weigh between and kg and lb
females vary in head to body length from to cm to in with a tail to cm to in long
males are larger at to cm to in with a tail to cm to in long
its shoulder height varies from to cm to in
its skull is long and low with strong occipital and sagittal crests
the canine teeth are exceptionally long the upper being about three times as long as the basal width of the socket
the first premolar is usually absent
the upper pair of canines measure cm in or longer
it has a bite force at the canine tip of newton and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of
the clouded leopard is often referred to as a modern day sabre tooth because it has the largest canines in proportion to its body size
the clouded leopard occurs from the himalayan foothills in nepal bhutan and india to myanmar southeastern bangladesh thailand peninsular malaysia to south of the yangtze river in china
it is regionally extinct in singapore and taiwan
in nepal the clouded leopard was thought to be extinct since the late s
but in and four individuals were found in the central part of the country close to chitwan national park and in pokhara valley
these findings extended the known range westward suggesting it is able to survive and breed in degraded woodlands that previously harboured moist subtropical semideciduous forest
since then the clouded leopard has been recorded in shivapuri nagarjun national park and in annapurna conservation area
between and it was also recorded in langtang national park at an elevation range of m ft
in india it occurs in sikkim northern west bengal meghalaya subtropical forests tripura mizoram manipur assam nagaland and arunachal pradesh
in pakke tiger reserve a clouded leopard was photographed in semi evergreen forest at an elevation of m ft
in sikkim clouded leopards were camera trapped at elevations of m ft between april and may in the khangchendzonga biosphere reserve
in manas national park individuals were recorded during a survey in november to february
between january and march clouded leopards were also recorded in dampa tiger reserve eaglenest wildlife sanctuary and singchung bugun village community reserve in meghalaya s nongkhyllem national park and balpakram baghmara landscape
in bhutan it was recorded in royal manas national park jigme singye wangchuck national park phibsoo wildlife sanctuary jigme dorji national park phrumsengla national park bumdeling wildlife sanctuary and several non protected areas
in bangladesh it was recorded in sangu matamuhari in the chittagong hill tracts in
in myanmar it was recorded by camera traps for the first time in the hill forests of karen state in
in thailand it inhabits relatively open dry tropical forest in huai kha khaeng wildlife sanctuary and closed forest habitats in khao yai national park
in laos it was recorded in nam et phou louey national protected area in dry evergreen and semi evergreen forests
in cambodia it was recorded in deciduous dipterocarp forest in phnom prich wildlife sanctuary between and and in central cardamom mountains national park southern cardamom national park botum sakor national park and phnom samkos wildlife sanctuary between and
in peninsular malaysia it was recorded in taman negara national park ulu muda forest pasoh forest reserve royal belum state park temengor forest reserve and in a few linkages between and
the last confirmed record of a formosan clouded leopard dates to when the skin of a young individual was found in the taroko area
it was not recorded during an extensive camera trapping survey conducted from to in more than sites inside and outside taiwanese protected areas
the clouded leopard is a solitary cat
early accounts depict it as a rare secretive arboreal and nocturnal inhabitant of dense primary forest
it is one of the most talented climbers among the cats
captive clouded leopards have been observed to climb down vertical tree trunks head first and hang on to branches with their hind paws bent around branchings of tree limbs
they are capable of supination and can even hang down from branches only by bending their hind paws and their tail around them
when jumping down they keep hanging on to a branch this way until the last moment
they can climb on horizontal branches with their back to the ground and in this position make short jumps forward
when balancing on thin branches they use their long tails to steer
they can easily jump up to m ft in high
they use trees as daytime rest sites but also spend time on the ground when hunting at night
captive clouded leopards have been observed to scent mark by spraying urine and rubbing their heads on prominent objects
their vocalisations include a short high pitched meow call a loud crying call both emitted when a cat is trying to locate another one over a long or short distance they prusten and raise their muzzle when meeting each other in a friendly manner when aggressive they growl with a low pitched sound and hiss with exposed teeth and wrinkled nose
radio collared clouded leopards were foremost active by night but also showed crepuscular activity peaks
clouded leopards recorded in northeast india were most active in the late evening after sunset
home ranges have only been estimated in thailand
four individuals were radio collared in phu khieo wildlife sanctuary from april to february
home ranges of two females were km sq mi and km sq mi and of two males km sq mi and km sq mi
two individuals were radio collared during a study from to in the khao yai national park
the home range of one female was km sq mi of the one male km sq mi
both individuals had a core area of km sq mi in clouded leopards were detected in the forest complex of khlong saeng wildlife sanctuary and khao sok national park during camera trapping surveys individuals were identified in a core zone of km sq mi with population density estimated at individuals per km sq mi but only individuals were identified in an edge zone of km sq mi which is more disturbed by humans with density estimated at individuals per km sq mi
when hunting the clouded leopard stalks its prey or waits for the prey to approach
after making and feeding on a kill it usually retreats into trees to digest and rest
its prey includes both arboreal and terrestrial vertebrates
pocock presumed that it is adapted for preying upon herbivorous mammals of considerable bulk because of its powerful build long canines and the deep penetration of its bites
in thailand clouded leopards have been observed preying on southern pig tailed macaque macaca nemestrina indian hog deer hyelaphus porcinus bengal slow loris nycticebus bengalensis asiatic brush tailed porcupine atherurus macrourus malayan pangolin manis javanica and berdmore s ground squirrel menetes berdmorei
known prey species in china include barking deer muntiacus and pheasants
in northern peninsular malaysia a male clouded leopard was photographed while carrying a binturong arctictis binturong in its jaws
both males and females average months at first reproduction
the female is in estrus for about six days with her estrous cycle lasting about days
in the wild mating usually occurs between december and march
the pair mates multiple times over the course of several days
the male grasps the female by the neck who responds with vocalization
occasionally he also bites her during courtship and is very aggressive during sexual encounters
females can bear one litter each year
the male is not involved in raising the cubs
the female gives birth to a litter of one to five mostly three cubs after a gestation period of days
cubs are born with closed eyes and weigh from to g to oz
their spots are solid dark rather than dark rings
their eyes open after about days
they are active within five weeks and fully weaned at around three months of age
they attain the adult coat pattern at around six months and become independent after around months
captive clouded leopards have an average lifespan of years
one individual has lived to be almost years old
generation length of the clouded leopard is about seven years
many of the remaining forest areas are too small to ensure the long term persistence of clouded leopard populations
they are threatened by habitat loss following large scale deforestation and commercial poaching for the wildlife trade
skins claws and teeth are offered for decoration and clothing bones and meat as substitute for body parts of the tiger in traditional asian medicines and tonics and live animals for the pet trade
few poaching incidents have been documented but all range states are thought to have some degree of commercial poaching
in recent years substantial domestic markets existed in indonesia myanmar and vietnam
in myanmar body parts of at least clouded leopards mostly skins and skeletons were observed in four markets surveyed between and
three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with china and thailand and cater to international buyers although clouded leopards are completely protected under myanmar s national legislation
effective implementation and enforcement of cites is considered inadequate
in nepal cases of clouded leopard body parts were discovered between november and march in nine districts of the country comprising at least individual clouded leopards
in of these cases the poachers and traders were arrested
the clouded leopard is listed in cites appendix i and protected over most of its range
hunting is banned in bangladesh china india malaysia myanmar nepal taiwan thailand and vietnam
it is not legally protected outside bhutan s protected areas
hunting is regulated in laos
no information about its protection status is available from cambodia
these bans however are poorly enforced in india malaysia and thailand
in the united states the clouded leopard is listed as endangered under the endangered species act prohibiting trade in live animals or body parts
international clouded leopard day is celebrated each year on august since in zoos and conservation organizations all over the world
clouded leopards have been kept in zoos since the early th century
the international studbook was initiated in the s
coordinated breeding programs were started in the s and encompass the european endangered species programme the species survival plan and the indian conservation breeding programme
as of institutions keep clouded leopards including six zoos in india
the zoo in sipahijola wildlife sanctuary since
darjeeling zoo since
aizawl zoo since
itanagar zoo since
gangtok zoo since
shillong zoo since early captive breeding programs involving clouded leopards were not successful largely due to ignorance of their courtship behaviour
males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females
for breeding success it has been deemed extremely important that male and female clouded leopards are compatible
introducing pairs at a young age gives them opportunities to bond and breed successfully
facilities breeding clouded leopards need to provide the female with a secluded off exhibit area
there has been some recent captive breeding success using artificial insemination with cubs successfully born in and
a study on morbidity and mortality rate of captive clouded leopards across zoos in europe asia and australia showed that of them died because of respiratory disease due to maternal neglect and starvation from generalized infectious disease from digestive diseases and from trauma
in march two breeding females at the nashville zoo at grassmere gave birth to three cubs which were raised by zookeepers
each cub weighed kg lb
in june two cubs were born at the point defiance zoo aquarium
the breeding pair was brought from the khao kheow open zoo in thailand in an ongoing education and research exchange program
four cubs were born at nashville zoo in
in may four cubs were born in point defiance zoo aquarium
the rukai people of taiwan considered the hunting of clouded leopards a taboo
it is the state animal of the indian state of meghalaya
