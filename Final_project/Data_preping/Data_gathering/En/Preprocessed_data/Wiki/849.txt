term hasid hasidut meaning pietist piety long history judaism
talmud old source refer pietists old hasid harishonim would contemplate entire hour preparation prayer
phrase denoted extremely devoted individual observed law letter performed good deed even beyond it
adam honored title tractate eruvin b rabbi meir adam wa great hasid fasted year first adopt epithet collectively apparently hasid second temple period judea known hasideans greek rendering name perhaps served model mentioned talmud
-century rhineland ashkenaz jewish parlance another prominent school ascetic named hasid distinguish rest later research employed term ashkenazi hasidim
century kabbalah spread title also became associated it
jacob ben hayyim zemah wrote glossa isaac luria's version shulchan aruch one wish tap hidden wisdom must conduct manner pious
movement founded israel ben eliezer century adopted term hasid original connotation
sect grew developed specific attribute name gradually acquired new meaning
common adherent belonging group headed spiritual leader henceforth known hasidim
transformation wa slow movement wa first referred new hasidism outsider recalled autobiography salomon maimon separate old one enemy derisively mocked member mithasdim pretend hasidim
yet eventually young sect gained mass following old connotation wa sidelined
popular discourse least hasid came denote someone follows religious teacher movement
one wa merely hasid anymore observed historian david assaf hasid someone dynasty particular
linguistic transformation paralleled word tzaddik righteous hasidic leader adopted though known colloquially rebbes honorific admor
originally denoting observant moral person hasidic literature tzaddik became synonymous often hereditary master heading sect followers
lengthy history hasidism numerous school thought therein particularly use traditional medium homiletic literature sermon comprising numerous reference earlier source torah talmud exegesis mean grounding oneself tradition almost sole channel convey idea made isolation common doctrine highly challenging researchers
noted joseph dan every attempt present body idea ha failed
even motif presented scholar past unique hasidic contribution later revealed common among predecessor opponent regarding many trait widely extant play dan added prominent role modern non-hasidic anti-hasidic writing well
difficulty separating movement's philosophy main inspiration lurianic kabbalah determining wa novel merely recapitulation also baffled historians
like louis jacob regarded early master innovator introduced much wa new emphasis others primarily mendel piekarz argued contrary little wa found much earlier tract movement's originality lay manner popularized teaching become ideology well-organized sect
among trait particularly associated hasidism common understanding fact widespread importance joy happiness worship religious life though sect undoubtedly stressed aspect still posse clear populist bent
another example value placed simple ordinary jew supposed contradiction favouring elitist scholar beforehand idea common ethical work far preceding hasidism
movement decade challenge rabbinic establishment relied authority torah acumen affirmed centrality study soon
concurrently image opponent dreary intellectual lacked spiritual fervour opposed mysticism likewise unfounded
neither hasidism often portrayed promoting healthy sensuality unanimously reject asceticism self-mortification associated primarily rivals
joseph dan ascribed perception so-called neo-hasidic writer thinker like martin buber
attempt build new model spirituality modern jew propagated romantic sentimental image movement
neo-hasidic interpretation influenced even scholarly discourse great degree tenuous connection reality
complication divide researcher term early hasidism ended roughly established hasidism since onwards
former wa highly dynamic religious revival movement latter phase characterized consolidation sect hereditary leadership
mystical teaching formulated first era mean repudiated many hasidic master remained consummate spiritualist original thinker noted benjamin brown buber's commonly accepted view routinization constituted decadence wa refuted later study demonstrating movement remained much innovative
yet many aspect early hasidism indeed de-emphasized favour conventional religious expression radical concept largely neutralized
rebbes adopted relatively rationalist bent sidelining explicit mystical theurgical role many others functioned almost solely political leader large communities
hasid affiliation wa le matter admiring charismatic leader early day rather birth family belonging specific court
fundamental theme underlying hasidic theory immanence god universe often expressed phrase tikunei hazohar leit atar panuy mi-nya aramaic site devoid him
panentheistic concept wa derived lurianic discourse greatly expanded hasidic one
beginning order create world god contracted tzimtzum omnipresence ein sof leaving vacant void khalal panui bereft obvious presence therefore able entertain free contradiction phenomenon seemingly separate god himself
yet reality world wa created void entirely dependent divine origin
matter would null void without true spiritual essence possesses
infinite ein sof cannot manifest vacant void must limit guise measurable corporeality may perceived
thus dualism true aspect everything physical side false ineluctable evolving god must compress disguise must human matter general ascend reunite omnipresence
rachel elior quoted shneur zalman liadi commentary torah genesis wrote purpose creation infinity finitude may reversed state finite infinity
kabbalah stressed importance dialectic mainly though exclusively evoked cosmic term referring example manner god progressively diminished world various dimension sephirot
hasidic school devoted prominent place teaching differing accentuation interchanging nature ein infinite imperceptible becoming yesh existent vice versa
used concept prism gauge world need spirit particular
elior noted reality lost static nature permanent value measured new standard seeking expose godly boundless essence manifest tangible circumscribed opposite
god wa everywhere connection pursued ceaselessly well time place occasions
experience wa reach every person negate inferior impulse grasp truth divine immanence enabling unite attain state perfect selfless bliss
hasidic master well versed teaching concerning communion supposed gain guide flock it
devekut wa strictly defined experience many variety described utmost ecstasy learned leader common man's humble yet le significant emotion prayer
closely linked former bitul ha-yesh negation existent corporeal
hasidism teach superficial observance universe eye flesh einei ha-basar purportedly reflects reality thing profane worldly true devotee must transcend illusory faade realize nothing god
matter perception practical entail also abandoning material concern cleaving true spiritual one oblivious surrounding false distraction life
practitioner's success detaching sense person conceive ein double meaning 'naught' 'infinite' regarded highest state elation hasidism
true divine essence man soul may ascend return upper realm doe posse existence independent god
enlightened capable bitul ha-yesh pursuing pure spiritual aim defying primitive impulse body one must overcome inferior bestial soul connected eye flesh
may able tap divine soul nefesh elohit craves communion employing constant contemplation hitbonenot hidden godly dimension exists
ideal adherent wa intended develop equanimity hishtavut hasidic parlance toward matter worldly ignoring understanding superficiality
hasidic master exhorted follower negate paying little heed could worldly concern thus clear way transformation
struggle doubt torn belief god's immanence real sensual experience indifferent world key theme movement's literature
many tract devoted subject acknowledging callous rude flesh hinders one holding fast ideal shortcoming extremely hard overcome even purely intellectual level fortiori actual life
another implication dualism notion worship corporeality avodah be-gashmi'yut
ein sof metamorphosed substance may turn raised back higher state likewise since machination higher sephirot exert influence world even simple action may performed correctly understanding achieve reverse effect
according lurianic doctrine netherworld wa suffused divine spark concealed within husk qliphoth
materiality could embraced consecrated noted glenn dynner hasidism taught common act like dancing eating performed intention spark could extricated set free
avodah be-gashmi'yut clear implicit antinomian edge possibly equating sacred ritual mandated judaism everyday activity granting status believer's eye content commit latter expense former
occasion movement appear step direction example early day prayer preparation consumed much time adherent blamed neglecting sufficient torah study hasidic master proved highly conservative
unlike radical sect influenced kabbalistic idea like sabbateans worship corporeality wa largely limited elite carefully restrained
common adherent taught may engage mildly small deed like earning money support leaders
complementary opposite corporeal worship elation finite infinite concept hamshacha drawing absorbing specifically hamschat ha-shefa absorption effluence
spiritual ascension one could siphon power animating higher dimension material world would manifest benevolent influence kinds
included spiritual enlightenment zest worship high-minded aim also prosaic health healing deliverance various trouble simple economic prosperity
corporeal worship absorption allowed mass access common action religious experience deemed esoteric
yet another reflection ein-yesh dialectic pronounced transformation evil goodness relation two pole contradicting element including various trait emotion human psyche like pride humility purity profanity et cetera
hasidic thinker argued order redeem spark hidden one associate merely corporeal sin evil
one example elevation impure thought prayer transforming noble one rather repressing advocated mainly early day sect breaking one's character directly confronting profane inclinations
aspect sharp antinomian implication wa used sabbateans justify excessive sinning
wa mostly toned late hasidism even leader careful stress wa exercised physical sense contemplative spiritual one
kabbalistic notion wa unique movement appeared frequently among jewish groups

sect began attract following expanded small circle learned disciple mass movement became evident complex philosophy could imparted partially new rank file
even intellectual struggled sublime dialectic infinity corporeality wa little hope common folk truly internalize mere abstraction pay lip service to
ideologue exhorted faith true answer marked rise distinct sect wa concept tzaddiq
hasidic master wa serve living embodiment recondite teachings
wa able transcend matter gain spiritual communion worship corporeality fulfill theoretical ideals
vast majority flock could cleave instead acquiring least semblance vicariously
commanding often especially early generation charismatic presence wa reassure faithful demonstrate truth hasidic philosophy countering doubt despair

descent righteous yeridat ha-tzaddiq matter world wa depicted identical need save sinner redeem spark concealed lowly places
link function communal leader spiritual guide legitimized political power wielded
also prevented retreat hasidic master hermitism passivity many mystic did
worldly authority wa perceived part long-term mission elevate corporeal world back divine infinity
certain extent saint even fulfilled congregation alone limited messianic capacity lifetime
sabbatean debacle moderate approach provided safe outlet eschatological urges
rabbi nachman breslov's work often reference true tzaddikim implying view true tzaddiq
rebbes subject intense hagiography even subtly compared biblical figure employing prefiguration
wa argued since follower could negate sufficiently transcend matter instead negate submission saint hitbatlut la-tzaddiq thus bonding enabling access achieved term spirituality
righteous served mystical bridge drawing effluence elevating prayer petition admirers
saintly forged well-defined relationship mass provided latter inspiration consulted matter expected intercede behalf adherent god ensure gained financial prosperity health male offspring
pattern still characterizes hasidic sect though prolonged routinization many turned rebbes de facto political leader strong institutionalized communities

example rebbes' family maintain endogamy marry almost solely scion dynasties
hasidic court individual prominent master developed distinct philosophy particular accentuation various theme movement's general teachings
several hasidic school lasting influence many dynasty others died proponents

another famous philosophy formulated nachman breslov adhered breslov hasidim
contrast peer believed god must worshiped enjoyment physical world nachman portrayed corporeal world grim color place devoid god's immediate presence soul yearns liberate itself
mocked attempt perceive nature infinite-finite dialectic manner god still occupies vacant void albeit stating paradoxical beyond human understanding
mortal constant struggle overcome profane instinct free limited intellect see world truly is
tzvi hirsh zidichov major galician tzaddiq wa disciple seer lublin combined populist inclination strict observance even among common follower great pluralism matter pertaining mysticism eventually emanating person's unique soul
