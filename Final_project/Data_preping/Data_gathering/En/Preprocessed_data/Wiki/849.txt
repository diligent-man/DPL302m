hasidism sometimes spelled chassidism and also known as hasidic judaism hebrew romanized s dus asi dus originally piety is a jewish religious group that arose as a spiritual revival movement in the territory of contemporary western ukraine during the th century and spread rapidly throughout eastern europe
today most affiliates reside in israel and the united states
israel ben eliezer the baal shem tov is regarded as its founding father and his disciples developed and disseminated it
present day hasidism is a sub group within haredi ultra orthodox judaism and is noted for its religious conservatism and social seclusion
its members adhere closely both to orthodox jewish practice with the movement s own unique emphases and the traditions of eastern european jews
many of the latter including various special styles of dress and the use of the yiddish language are nowadays associated almost exclusively with hasidism
hasidic thought draws heavily on lurianic kabbalah and to an extent is a popularization of it
teachings emphasize god s immanence in the universe the need to cleave and be one with him at all times the devotional aspect of religious practice and the spiritual dimension of corporeality and mundane acts
hasidim the adherents of hasidism are organized in independent sects known as courts or dynasties each headed by its own hereditary leader a rebbe
reverence and submission to the rebbe are key tenets as he is considered a spiritual authority with whom the follower must bond to gain closeness to god
the various courts share basic convictions but operate apart and possess unique traits and customs
affiliation is often retained in families for generations and being hasidic is as much a sociological factor entailing birth into a specific community and allegiance to a dynasty of rebbes as it is a purely religious one
there are several courts with many thousands of member households each and hundreds of smaller ones
as of there were over hasidic households worldwide about of the global jewish population
the terms hasid and hasidut meaning pietist and piety have a long history in judaism
the talmud and other old sources refer to the pietists of old hasidim harishonim who would contemplate an entire hour in preparation for prayer
the phrase denoted extremely devoted individuals who not only observed the law to its letter but performed good deeds even beyond it
adam himself is honored with the title in tractate eruvin b by rabbi meir adam was a great hasid having fasted for years the first to adopt the epithet collectively were apparently the hasidim in second temple period judea known as hasideans after the greek rendering of their name who perhaps served as the model for those mentioned in the talmud
the title continued to be applied as an honorific for the exceptionally devout
in th century rhineland or ashkenaz in jewish parlance another prominent school of ascetics named themselves hasidim to distinguish them from the rest later research employed the term ashkenazi hasidim
in the th century when kabbalah spread the title also became associated with it
jacob ben hayyim zemah wrote in his glossa on isaac luria s version of the shulchan aruch that one who wishes to tap the hidden wisdom must conduct himself in the manner of the pious
the movement founded by israel ben eliezer in the th century adopted the term hasidim in the original connotation
but when the sect grew and developed specific attributes from the s the names gradually acquired a new meaning
its common adherents belonging to groups each headed by a spiritual leader were henceforth known as hasidim
the transformation was slow the movement was at first referred to as new hasidism by outsiders as recalled in the autobiography of salomon maimon to separate it from the old one and its enemies derisively mocked its members as mithasdim those who pretend to be hasidim
yet eventually the young sect gained such a mass following that the old connotation was sidelined
in popular discourse at least hasid came to denote someone who follows a religious teacher from the movement
it also entered modern hebrew as such meaning adherent or disciple
one was not merely a hasid anymore observed historian david assaf but a hasid of someone or some dynasty in particular
this linguistic transformation paralleled that of the word tzaddik righteous which the hasidic leaders adopted for themselves though they are known colloquially as rebbes or by the honorific admor
originally denoting an observant moral person in hasidic literature tzaddik became synonymous with the often hereditary master heading a sect of followers
the lengthy history of hasidism the numerous schools of thought therein and particularly its use of the traditional medium of homiletic literature and sermons comprising numerous references to earlier sources in the torah talmud and exegesis as a means to grounding oneself in tradition as the almost sole channel to convey its ideas all made the isolation of a common doctrine highly challenging to researchers
as noted by joseph dan every attempt to present such a body of ideas has failed
even motifs presented by scholars in the past as unique hasidic contributions were later revealed to have been common among both their predecessors and opponents all the more so regarding many other traits that are widely extant these play dan added a prominent role in modern non hasidic and anti hasidic writings as well
the difficulty of separating the movement s philosophy from that of its main inspiration lurianic kabbalah and determining what was novel and what merely a recapitulation also baffled historians
some like louis jacobs regarded the early masters as innovators who introduced much that was new if only by emphasis others primarily mendel piekarz argued to the contrary that but a little was not found in much earlier tracts and the movement s originality lay in the manner it popularized these teachings to become the ideology of a well organized sect
among the traits particularly associated with hasidism in common understanding which are in fact widespread is the importance of joy and happiness at worship and religious life though the sect undoubtedly stressed this aspect and still possesses a clear populist bent
another example is the value placed on the simple ordinary jew in supposed contradiction with the favouring of elitist scholars beforehand such ideas are common in ethical works far preceding hasidism
the movement did for a few decades challenge the rabbinic establishment which relied on the authority of torah acumen but affirmed the centrality of study very soon
concurrently the image of its opponents as dreary intellectuals who lacked spiritual fervour and opposed mysticism is likewise unfounded
neither did hasidism often portrayed as promoting healthy sensuality unanimously reject the asceticism and self mortification associated primarily with its rivals
joseph dan ascribed all these perceptions to so called neo hasidic writers and thinkers like martin buber
in their attempt to build new models of spirituality for modern jews they propagated a romantic sentimental image of the movement
the neo hasidic interpretation influenced even scholarly discourse to a great degree but had a tenuous connection with reality
a further complication is the divide between what researchers term early hasidism which ended roughly in the s and established hasidism since then onwards
while the former was a highly dynamic religious revival movement the latter phase is characterized by consolidation into sects with hereditary leadership
the mystical teachings formulated during the first era were by no means repudiated and many hasidic masters remained consummate spiritualists and original thinkers as noted by benjamin brown buber s once commonly accepted view that the routinization constituted decadence was refuted by later studies demonstrating that the movement remained very much innovative
yet many aspects of early hasidism were indeed de emphasized in favour of more conventional religious expressions and its radical concepts were largely neutralized
some rebbes adopted a relatively rationalist bent sidelining their explicit mystical theurgical roles and many others functioned almost solely as political leaders of large communities
as to their hasidim affiliation was less a matter of admiring a charismatic leader as in the early days but rather birth into a family belonging to a specific court
the most fundamental theme underlying all hasidic theory is the immanence of god in the universe often expressed in a phrase from tikunei hazohar leit atar panuy mi n ya aramaic no site is devoid of him
this panentheistic concept was derived from lurianic discourse but greatly expanded in the hasidic one
in the beginning in order to create the world god contracted tzimtzum his omnipresence the ein sof leaving a vacant void khalal panui bereft from obvious presence and therefore able to entertain free will contradictions and other phenomena seemingly separate from god himself
these would have been impossible within his original perfect existence
yet the very reality of the world which was created in the void is entirely dependent on its divine origin
matter would have been null and void without the true spiritual essence it possesses
just the same the infinite ein sof cannot manifest in the vacant void and must limit itself in the guise of measurable corporeality that may be perceived
thus there is a dualism between the true aspect of everything and the physical side false but ineluctable with each evolving into the other as god must compress and disguise himself so must humans and matter in general ascend and reunite with the omnipresence
rachel elior quoted shneur zalman of liadi in his commentary torah or on genesis who wrote that this is the purpose of creation from infinity to finitude so it may be reversed from the state of finite to that of infinity
kabbalah stressed the importance of this dialectic but mainly though not exclusively evoked it in cosmic terms referring for example to the manner in which god progressively diminished himself into the world through the various dimensions or sephirot
hasidism applied it also to the most mundane details of human existence
all hasidic schools devoted a prominent place in their teaching with differing accentuation to the interchanging nature of ein both infinite and imperceptible becoming yesh existent and vice versa
they used the concept as a prism to gauge the world and the needs of the spirit in particular
elior noted reality lost its static nature and permanent value now measured by a new standard seeking to expose the godly boundless essence manifest in its tangible circumscribed opposite
one major derivative of this philosophy is the notion of devekut communion
as god was everywhere connection with him had to be pursued ceaselessly as well in all times places and occasions
such an experience was in the reach of every person who only had to negate his inferior impulses and grasp the truth of divine immanence enabling him to unite with it and attain the state of perfect selfless bliss
hasidic masters well versed in the teachings concerning communion are supposed not only to gain it themselves but to guide their flock to it
devekut was not a strictly defined experience many varieties were described from the utmost ecstasy of the learned leaders to the common man s more humble yet no less significant emotion during prayer
closely linked with the former is bitul ha yesh negation of the existent or of the corporeal
hasidism teaches that while a superficial observance of the universe by the eyes of the flesh einei ha basar purportedly reflects the reality of all things profane and worldly a true devotee must transcend this illusory fa ade and realize that there is nothing but god
it is not only a matter of perception but very practical for it entails also abandoning material concerns and cleaving only to the true spiritual ones oblivious to the surrounding false distractions of life
the practitioner s success in detaching from his sense of person and conceive himself as ein in the double meaning of naught and infinite is regarded as the highest state of elation in hasidism
the true divine essence of man the soul may then ascend and return to the upper realm where it does not possess an existence independent from god
this ideal is termed hitpashtut ha gashmi yut the expansion or removal of corporeality
it is the dialectic opposite of god s contraction into the world
to be enlightened and capable of bitul ha yesh pursuing the pure spiritual aims and defying the primitive impulses of the body one must overcome his inferior bestial soul connected with the eyes of the flesh
he may be able to tap into his divine soul nefesh elohit which craves communion by employing constant contemplation hitbonenot on the hidden godly dimension of all that exists
then he could understand his surroundings with the eyes of the intellect
the ideal adherent was intended to develop equanimity or hishtavut in hasidic parlance toward all matters worldly not ignoring them but understanding their superficiality
hasidic masters exhorted their followers to negate themselves paying as little heed as they could for worldly concerns and thus to clear the way for this transformation
the struggle and doubt of being torn between the belief in god s immanence and the very real sensual experience of the indifferent world is a key theme in the movement s literature
many tracts have been devoted to the subject acknowledging that the callous and rude flesh hinders one from holding fast to the ideal and these shortcomings are extremely hard to overcome even in the purely intellectual level a fortiori in actual life
another implication of this dualism is the notion of worship through corporeality avodah be gashmi yut
as the ein sof metamorphosed into substance so may it in turn be raised back to its higher state likewise since the machinations in the higher sephirot exert their influence on this world even the most simple action may if performed correctly and with understanding achieve the reverse effect
according to lurianic doctrine the netherworld was suffused with divine sparks concealed within husks qliphoth
the glints had to be recovered and elevated to their proper place in the cosmos
materiality itself could be embraced and consecrated noted glenn dynner and hasidism taught that by common acts like dancing or eating performed with intention the sparks could be extricated and set free
avodah be gashmi yut had a clear if not implicit antinomian edge possibly equating sacred rituals mandated by judaism with everyday activities granting them the same status in the believer s eyes and having him content to commit the latter at the expense of the former
while at some occasions the movement did appear to step at that direction for example in its early days prayer and preparation for it consumed so much time that adherents were blamed of neglecting sufficient torah study hasidic masters proved highly conservative
unlike in other more radical sects influenced by kabbalistic ideas like the sabbateans worship through corporeality was largely limited to the elite and carefully restrained
the common adherents were taught they may engage it only mildly through small deeds like earning money to support their leaders
the complementary opposite of corporeal worship or the elation of the finite into infinite is the concept of hamshacha drawing down or absorbing and specifically hamschat ha shefa absorption of effluence
during spiritual ascension one could siphon the power animating the higher dimensions down into the material world where it would manifest as benevolent influence of all kinds
these included spiritual enlightenment zest in worship and other high minded aims but also the more prosaic health and healing deliverance from various troubles and simple economic prosperity
thus a very tangible and alluring motivation to become followers emerged
both corporeal worship and absorption allowed the masses to access with common actions a religious experience once deemed esoteric
yet another reflection of the ein yesh dialectic is pronounced in the transformation of evil to goodness and the relations between these two poles and other contradicting elements including various traits and emotions of the human psyche like pride and humility purity and profanity et cetera
hasidic thinkers argued that in order to redeem the sparks hidden one had to associate not merely with the corporeal but with sin and evil
one example is the elevation of impure thoughts during prayer transforming them to noble ones rather than repressing them advocated mainly in the early days of the sect or breaking one s own character by directly confronting profane inclinations
this aspect once more had sharp antinomian implications and was used by the sabbateans to justify excessive sinning
it was mostly toned down in late hasidism and even before that leaders were careful to stress that it was not exercised in the physical sense but in the contemplative spiritual one
this kabbalistic notion too was not unique to the movement and appeared frequently among other jewish groups
while its mystical and ethical teachings are not easily sharply distinguished from those of other jewish currents the defining doctrine of hasidism is that of the saintly leader serving both as an ideal inspiration and an institutional figure around whom followers are organized
in the movement s sacral literature this person is referred to as the tzaddiq the righteous one often also known by the general honorific admor acronym of hebrew for our master teacher and rabbi granted to rabbis in general or colloquially as rebbe
the idea that in every generation there are righteous persons through whom the divine effluence is drawn to the material world is rooted in the kabbalistic thought which also claims that one of them is supreme the reincarnation of moses
hasidism elaborated the notion of the tzaddiq into the basis of its entire system so much that the very term gained an independent meaning within it apart from the original which denoted god fearing highly observant people
when the sect began to attract following and expanded from a small circle of learned disciples to a mass movement it became evident that its complex philosophy could be imparted only partially to the new rank and file
as even intellectuals struggled with the sublime dialectics of infinity and corporeality there was little hope to have the common folk truly internalize these not as mere abstractions to pay lip service to
ideologues exhorted them to have faith but the true answer which marked their rise as a distinct sect was the concept of the tzaddiq
a hasidic master was to serve as a living embodiment of the recondite teachings
he was able to transcend matter gain spiritual communion worship through corporeality and fulfill all the theoretical ideals
as the vast majority of his flock could not do so themselves they were to cleave to him instead acquiring at least some semblance of those vicariously
his commanding and often especially in the early generations charismatic presence was to reassure the faithful and demonstrate the truth in hasidic philosophy by countering doubts and despair
but more than spiritual welfare was concerned since it was believed he could ascend to the higher realms the leader was able to harvest effluence and bring it down upon his adherents providing them with very material benefits
the crystallization of that theurgical phase noted glenn dynner marked hasidism s evolution into a full fledged social movement
in hasidic discourse the willingness of the leader to sacrifice the ecstasy and fulfillment of unity in god was deemed a heavy sacrifice undertaken for the benefit of the congregation
his followers were to sustain and especially to obey him as he possessed superior knowledge and insight gained through communion
the descent of the righteous yeridat ha tzaddiq into the matters of the world was depicted as identical with the need to save the sinners and redeem the sparks concealed in the most lowly places
such a link between his functions as communal leader and spiritual guide legitimized the political power he wielded
it also prevented a retreat of hasidic masters into hermitism and passivity as many mystics before them did
their worldly authority was perceived as part of their long term mission to elevate the corporeal world back into divine infinity
to a certain extent the saint even fulfilled for his congregation and for it alone a limited messianic capacity in his lifetime
after the sabbatean debacle this moderate approach provided a safe outlet for the eschatological urges
rabbi nachman of breslov s works often reference the true tzaddikim implying that he did not view himself as the only true tzaddiq
the rebbes were subject to intense hagiography even subtly compared with biblical figures by employing prefiguration
it was argued that since followers could not negate themselves sufficiently to transcend matter they should instead negate themselves in submission to the saint hitbatlut la tzaddiq thus bonding with him and enabling themselves to access what he achieved in terms of spirituality
the righteous served as a mystical bridge drawing down effluence and elevating the prayers and petitions of his admirers
the saintly forged a well defined relationship with the masses they provided the latter with inspiration were consulted in all matters and were expected to intercede on behalf of their adherents with god and ensure they gained financial prosperity health and male offspring
the pattern still characterizes hasidic sects though prolonged routinization in many turned the rebbes into de facto political leaders of strong institutionalized communities
the role of a saint was obtained by charisma erudition and appeal in the early days of hasidism
but by the dawn of the th century the righteous began to claim legitimacy by descent to the masters of the past arguing that since they linked matter with infinity their abilities had to be associated with their own corporeal body
therefore it was accepted there can be no tzaddiq but the son of a tzaddiq
virtually all modern sects maintain this hereditary principle
for example the rebbes families maintain endogamy and marry almost solely with scions of other dynasties
some hasidic courts and not a few individual prominent masters developed distinct philosophies with particular accentuation of various themes in the movement s general teachings
several of these hasidic schools had lasting influence over many dynasties while others died with their proponents
in the doctrinal sphere the dynasties may be divided along many lines
some are characterized by rebbes who are predominantly torah scholars and decisors deriving their authority much like ordinary non hasidic rabbis do
such courts place great emphasis on strict observance and study and are among the most meticulous in the orthodox world in practice
prominent examples are the house of sanz and its scions such as satmar or belz
other sects like vizhnitz espouse a charismatic populist line centered on the admiration of the masses for the righteous his effervescent style of prayer and conduct and his purported miracle working capabilities
fewer still retain a high proportion of the mystical spiritualist themes of early hasidism and encourage members to study much kabbalistic literature and carefully engage in the field
the various ziditchover dynasties mostly adhere to this philosophy
others still focus on contemplation and achieving inner perfection
no dynasty is wholly devoted to a single approach of the above and all offer some combination with differing emphasis on each of those
in a schism occurred between the seer of lublin and his prime disciple the holy jew of przysucha due to both personal and doctrinal disagreements
the seer adopted a populist approach centered on the righteous theurgical functions to draw the masses
he was famous for his lavish enthusiastic conduct during prayer and worship and extremely charismatic demeanour
he stressed that as tzaddiq his mission was to influence the common folk by absorbing divine light and satisfying their material needs thus converting them to his cause and elating them
the holy jew pursued a more introspective course maintaining that the rebbe s duty was to serve as a spiritual mentor for a more elitist group helping them to achieve a senseless state of contemplation aiming to restore man to his oneness with god which adam supposedly lost when he ate the fruit of the lignum scientiae
the holy jew and his successors did neither repudiate miracle working nor did they eschew dramatic conduct but they were much more restrained in general
the przysucha school became dominant in central poland while populist hasidism resembling the lublin ethos often prevailed in galicia
one extreme and renowned philosopher who emerged from the przysucha school was menachem mendel of kotzk
adopting an elitist hard line attitude he openly denounced the folky nature of other tzaddiqim and rejected financial support
gathering a small group of devout scholars who sought to attain spiritual perfection whom he often berated and mocked he always stressed the importance of both somberness and totality stating it was better to be fully wicked than only somewhat good
the chabad school limited to its namesake dynasty but prominent was founded by shneur zalman of liadi and was elaborated by his successors until the late th century
the movement retained many of the attributes of early hasidism before a clear divide between righteous and ordinary followers was cemented
chabad rebbes insisted their adherents acquire proficiency in the sect s lore and not relegate most responsibility to the leaders
the sect emphasizes the importance of intellectually grasping the dynamics of the hidden divine aspect and how they affect the human psyche the very acronym chabad is for the three penultimate sephirot associated with the cerebral side of consciousness
another famous philosophy is that formulated by nachman of breslov and adhered to by breslov hasidim
in contrast to most of his peers who believed god must be worshiped through enjoyment of the physical world nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors as a place devoid of god s immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself
he mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite finite dialectics and the manner in which god still occupies the vacant void albeit not stating these were paradoxical beyond human understanding
only naive faith in their reality would do
mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as it truly is
tzvi hirsh of zidichov a major galician tzaddiq was a disciple of the seer of lublin but combined his populist inclination with a strict observance even among his most common followers and great pluralism in matters pertaining to mysticism as those were eventually emanating from each person s unique soul
mordechai yosef leiner of izbica promulgated a radical understanding of free will which he considered illusory and also derived directly from god
he argued that when one attained a sufficient spiritual level and could be certain evil thoughts did not derive from his animalistic soul then sudden urges to transgress revealed law were god inspired and may be pursued
this volatile potentially antinomian doctrine of transgression for the sake of heaven is found also in other hasidic writings especially from the early period
his successors de emphasized it in their commentaries
leiner s disciple zadok hakohen of lublin also developed a complex philosophic system which presented a dialectic nature in history arguing that great progress had to be preceded by crisis and calamity
the hasidic community is organized in a sect known as court hebrew hatzer yiddish hoif from german hof gerichtshof
in the early days of the movement a particular rebbe s following usually resided in the same town and hasidim were categorized by their leaders settlement a hasid of belz vizhnitz and so forth
later especially after world war ii the dynasties retained the names of their original eastern european settlements when moving to the west or israel
thus for example the court established by joel teitelbaum in at transylvania remained known after its namesake town sathmar even though its headquarters lay in new york and almost all other hasidic sects likewise albeit some groups founded overseas were named accordingly like the boston hasidic dynasty
akin to his spiritual status the rebbe is also the administrative head of the community
sects often possess their own synagogues study halls and internal charity mechanisms and ones sufficiently large also maintain entire educational systems
the rebbe is the supreme figure of authority and not just for the institutions
the rank and file hasidim are also expected to consult with him on important matters and often seek his blessing and advice
he is personally attended by aides known as gabbai or mashbak
many particular hasidic rites surround the leader
on the sabbath holidays and celebratory occasions rebbes hold a tisch table a large feast for their male adherents
together they sing dance and eat and the head of the sect shakes the hands of his followers to bless them and often delivers a sermon
a chozer repeater selected for his good memory commits the text to writing after the sabbath any form of writing during the sabbath itself being forbidden
in many courts the remnants of his meal supposedly suffused with holiness are handed out and even fought over
often a very large dish is prepared beforehand and the rebbe only tastes it before passing it to the crowd
apart from the gathering at noon the third repast on sabbath and the melaveh malkah meal when it ends are also particularly important and an occasion for song feasting tales and sermons
a central custom which serves as a major factor in the economics of most courts is the pidyon ransom better known by its yiddish name kvitel little note adherents submit a written petition which the master may assist with on behalf of his sanctity adding a sum of money for either charity or the leader s needs
occasions in the court serve as pretext for mass gatherings flaunting the power wealth and size of each
weddings of the leader s family for example are often held with large multistoried stands parentches filled with hasidim surround the main floor where the rebbe and his relatives dine celebrate and perform the mitzvah tantz
this is a festive dance with the bride both parties hold one end of a long sash a hasidic gartel for reasons of modesty
allegiance to the dynasty and rebbe is also sometimes a cause for tension
notable feuds between courts include the strife after chaim elazar spira of munkatch cursed the deceased yissachar dov rokeach i of belz the satmar belz collision after yissachar dov rokeach ii broke with the orthodox council of jerusalem which culminated when he had to travel in a bulletproof car and the present satmar succession dispute between brothers aaron teitelbaum and zalman teitelbaum which saw mass riots
as in other haredi groups apostates may face threats hostility violence and various punitive measures among them separation of children from their disaffiliated parents especially in divorce cases
due to their strictly religious education and traditionalist upbringing many who leave their sects have few viable work skills or even command of the english language and their integration into the broader society is often difficult
the segregated communities are also a comfortable setting for sexual abuse of children and numerous incidents have been reported
while hasidic leadership has often been accused of silencing the matter awareness of it is rising within the sects
another related phenomenon is the recent rise of mashpi im influencers
once a title for an instructor in chabad and breslov only the institutionalized nature of the established courts led many adherents to seek guidance and inspiration from persons who did not declare themselves new leaders but only mashpi im
technically they fill the original role of rebbes in providing for spiritual welfare yet they do not usurp the title and are therefore countenanced
most hasidim use some variation of nusach sefard a blend of ashkenazi and sephardi liturgies based on the innovations of rabbi isaac luria
many dynasties have their own specific adaptation of nusach sefard some such as the versions of the belzer bobover and dushinsky hasidim are closer to nusach ashkenaz while others such as the munkacz version are closer to the old lurianic
many sects believe that their version reflects luria s mystical devotions best
the baal shem tov added two segments to friday services on the eve of sabbath psalm before afternoon prayer and psalm at the end of evening service
hasidim use the ashkenazi pronunciation of hebrew and aramaic for liturgical purposes reflecting their eastern european background
wordless emotional melodies nigunim are particularly common in their services
hasidim lend great importance to kavana devotion or intention and their services tend to be extremely long and repetitive
some courts nearly abolished traditional specified times by which prayers must be conducted zemanim to prepare and concentrate
this practice still enacted in chabad for one is controversial in many dynasties which do follow the specifics of jewish law on praying earlier and not eating beforehand
chabad makes use of the permission granted in jewish law to eat before prayer in certain circumstances and to have later praying times as a result of longer periods of preparatory study and contemplation beforehand
a common saying to explain this attributed to the third chabad rebbe rabbi menachem mendel schneerson i goes better to eat in order to pray than to pray in order to eat implying it is better to eat before prayer if due to the later time of prayers finishing one will be hungry and unable to properly concentrate
another reglement is daily immersion in a ritual bath by males for spiritual cleansing at a rate much higher than is customary among other orthodox jews
hasidism developed a unique emphasis on the spirituality of melody nigunim as a means to reach deveikut divine communion during prayer and communal gatherings
ecstatic often wordless hasidic melodies developed new expressions and depths of the soul in jewish life often drawing from folk idioms of the surrounding gentile culture which were adapted to elevate their concealed sparks of divinity according to lurianic theology
within the hasidic world it is possible to distinguish different hasidic groups by subtle differences in dress
some details of their dress are shared by non hasidic haredim
much of hasidic dress was historically the clothing of all eastern european jews influenced by the style of polish lithuanian nobility
furthermore hasidim have attributed religious origins to specific hasidic items of clothing
hasidic men most commonly wear dark overclothes
on weekdays they wear a long black cloth jacket called a rekel and on jewish holy days the bekishe zaydene kapote yiddish lit satin caftan a similarly long black jacket but of satin fabric traditionally silk
indoors the colorful tish bekishe is still worn
some hasidim wear a satin overcoat known as rezhvolke
most hasidim do not wear neckties
on the sabbath the hasidic rebbes traditionally wore a white bekishe
this practice has fallen into disuse among most
many of them wear a black silk bekishe that is trimmed with velvet known as stro kes or samet and in hungarian ones gold embroidered
various symbolic and religious qualities are attributed to hasidic dress though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes origin is cultural and historical
for example the long overcoats are considered modest the shtreimel is supposedly related to shaatnez and keeps one warm without using wool and sabbath shoes are laceless in order not to have to tie a knot a prohibited action
a gartel divides the hasid s lower parts from his upper parts implying modesty and chastity and for kabbalistic reasons hasidim button their clothes right over left
hasidic men customarily wear black hats during the weekdays as do nearly all haredi men today
a variety of hats are worn depending on the group chabad men often pinch their hats to form a triangle on the top satmar men wear an open crown hat with rounded edges and samet velvet or biber beaver hats are worn by many galician and hungarian hasidic men
married hasidic men don a variety of fur headdresses on the sabbath once common among all wedded eastern european jewish males and still worn by non hasidic perushim in jerusalem
the most ubiquitous is the shtreimel which is seen especially among galician and hungarian sects like satmar or belz
a taller spodik is donned by polish dynasties such as ger
a kolpik is worn by unmarried sons and grandsons of many rebbes on the sabbath
some rebbes don it on special occasions
there are many other distinct items of clothing
such are the gerrer hoyznzokn long black socks into which the trousers are tucked
some hasidic men from eastern galicia wear black socks with their breeches on the sabbath as opposed to white ones on weekdays particularly belzer hasidim
following a biblical commandment not to shave the sides of one s face leviticus male members of most hasidic groups wear long uncut sidelocks called payot or peyes
some hasidic men shave off the rest of their hair
not every hasidic group requires long peyos and not all jewish men with peyos are hasidic but all hasidic groups discourage the shaving of one s beard
most hasidic boys receive their first haircuts ceremonially at the age of three years only the skverrer hasidim do this at their boys second birthday
until then hasidic boys have long hair
hasidic women wear clothing adhering to the principles of modest dress in jewish law
this includes long conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow as well as covered necklines
also the women wear stockings to cover their legs in some hasidic groups such as satmar or toldot aharon the stockings must be opaque
in keeping with jewish law married women cover their hair using either a sheitel wig a tichel headscarf a shpitzel a snood a hat or a beret
in some hasidic groups such as satmar women may wear two headcoverings a wig and a scarf or a wig and a hat
hasidic jews like many other orthodox jews typically produce large families the average hasidic family in the united states has children
this is followed out of a desire to fulfill the biblical mandate to be fruitful and multiply
most hasidim speak the language of their countries of residence but use yiddish among themselves as a way of remaining distinct and preserving tradition
thus children are still learning yiddish today and the language despite predictions to the contrary has not died
yiddish newspapers are still published and yiddish fiction is being written primarily aimed at women
even films in yiddish are being produced within the hasidic community
some hasidic groups such as satmar and toldot aharon actively oppose the everyday use of hebrew which they consider a holy tongue
the use of hebrew for anything other than prayer and study is according to them profane and so yiddish is the vernacular and common tongue for most hasidim around the world
hasidic tales are a literary genre concerning both hagiography of various rebbes and moralistic themes
some are anecdotes or recorded conversations dealing with matters of faith practice and the like
the most famous tend to be terse and carry a strong and obvious point
they were often transmitted orally though the earliest compendium is from
many revolve around the righteous
the baal shem in particular was subject to excess hagiography
characterized by vivid metaphors miracles and piety each reflects the surrounding and era it was composed in
common themes include dissenting the question what is acceptable to pray for whether or not the commoner may gain communion or the meaning of wisdom
the tales were a popular accessible medium to convey to movement s messages
the various hasidic groups may be categorized along several parameters including their geographical origin their proclivity for certain teachings and their political stance
these attributes are quite often but by no means always correlated and there are many instances when a court espouses a unique combination
thus while most dynasties from the former greater hungary and galicia are inclined to extreme conservatism and anti zionism rebbe yekusiel yehudah halberstam led the sanz klausenburg sect in a more open and mild direction and though hasidim from lithuania and belarus are popularly perceived as prone to intellectualism david assaf noted this notion is derived more from their litvak surroundings than their actual philosophies
apart from those each court often possesses its unique customs including style of prayer melodies particular items of clothing and the like
on the political scale courts are mainly divided on their relations to zionism
the right wing identified with satmar are hostile to the state of israel and refuse to participate in the elections there or receive any state funding
they are mainly affiliated with the edah hachareidis and the central rabbinical congress
the great majority belong to agudas israel represented in israel by the united torah judaism party
its council of torah sages now includes a dozen rebbes
in the past there were religious zionist rebbes mainly of the ruzhin line but there are virtually none today
in a study conducted by prof
marcin wodzi ski drawing from the courts own internal phone books and other resources located hasidic households worldwide about of the estimated total jewish population
of those resided in israel and in the united states in britain and in canada
in israel the largest hasidic concentrations are in the haredi neighbourhoods of jerusalem including ramot alon batei ungarin et cetera in the cities of bnei brak and el ad and in the west bank settlements of modi in illit and beitar illit
there is considerable presence in other specifically orthodox municipalities or enclaves like kiryat sanz netanya
in the united states most hasidim reside in new york though there are small communities across the entire country
brooklyn particularly the neighborhoods of borough park williamsburg and crown heights has an especially large population
so does the hamlet of monsey in upstate new york
in the same region new square and kiryas joel are rapidly growing all hasidic enclaves one founded by the skver dynasty and the other by satmar
in britain stamford hill is home to the largest hasidic community in the country and there are others in london and prestwich in manchester
in canada kiryas tosh is a settlement populated entirely by tosh hasidim and there are more adherents of other sects in and around montreal
there are more than a dozen hasidic dynasties with a large following and over a hundred which have small or minuscule adherence sometimes below twenty people with the presumptive rebbe holding the title more as a matter of prestige
many courts became completely extinct during the holocaust like the aleksander hasidic dynasty from aleksandr w dzki which numbered tens of thousands in and barely exists today
the largest sect in the world with some member households which constitute of all hasidim is satmar founded in in the namesake city in hungary and based in williamsburg brooklyn and kiryas joel
satmar is known for its extreme conservatism and opposition to both agudas israel and zionism inspired by the legacy of hungarian haredi judaism
the sect underwent a schism in and two competing factions emerged led by rival brothers aaron teitelbaum and zalman teitelbaum
the second largest court worldwide with some households or of all hasidism is ger established in at g ra kalwaria near warsaw
for decades it was the dominant power in agudas and espoused a moderate line toward zionism and modern culture
its origins lay in the rationalist przysucha school of central poland
the current rebbe is yaakov aryeh alter
the third largest dynasty is vizhnitz a charismatic sect founded in at vyzhnytsia bukovina
a moderate group involved in israeli politics it is split into several branches which maintain cordial relations
the main partition is between vizhnitz israel and vizhnitz monsey headed respectively by rebbes israel hager and the eight sons of the late rebbe mordecai hager
in total all vizhnitz sub courts constitute over households
the fourth major dynasty with some households is belz established in namesake belz south of lviv
an eastern galician dynasty drawing both from the seer of lublin s charismatic populist style and rabbinic hasidism it espoused hard line positions but broke off from the edah hachareidis and joined agudas in
belz is led by rebbe yissachar dov rokeach
the bobover dynasty founded in bobowa west galicia constitutes some households in total and has undergone a bitter succession strife since eventually forming the bobov households and bobov households sects
sanz klausenburg divided into a new york and israeli branches presides over households
the skver sect established in in skvyra near kyiv constitutes
the shomer emunim dynasties originating in jerusalem during the s and known for their unique style of dressing imitating that of the old yishuv have over families almost all in the larger courts of toldos aharon and toldos avraham yitzchak
karlin stolin which rose already in the s in a quarter of pinsk encompasses families
there are two other populous hasidic sub groups which do not function as classical rebbe headed courts but as de centralized movements retaining some of the characteristics of early hasidism
breslov rose under its charismatic leader nachman of breslov in the early th century
critical of all other rebbes he forbade his followers to appoint a successor upon his death in
his acolytes led small groups of adherents persecuted by other hasidim and disseminated his teachings
the original philosophy of the sect elicited great interest among modern scholars and that led many newcomers to orthodox judaism repentants to join it
numerous breslov communities each led by its own rabbis now have thousands of full fledged followers and far more admirers and semi committed supporters marcin wodzi ski estimated that the fully committed population of breslovers may be estimated at households
chabad lubavitch originating in the s did have hereditary leadership but always stressed the importance of self study rather than reliance on the righteous
its seventh and last leader menachem mendel schneerson converted it into a vehicle for jewish outreach
by his death in it had many more semi engaged supporters than hasidim in the strict sense and they are still hard to distinguish
chabad s own internal phone books list some member households
none succeeded schneerson and the sect operates as a large network of communities with independent leaders
in the late th century several social trends converged among the jews who inhabited the southern periphery of the polish lithuanian commonwealth especially in contemporary western ukraine
these enabled the emergence and flourishing of hasidism
the first and most prominent was the popularization of the mystical lore of kabbalah
for several centuries an esoteric teaching practiced surreptitiously by few it was transformed into almost household knowledge by a mass of cheap printed pamphlets
the kabbalistic inundation was a major influence behind the rise of the heretical sabbatean movement led by sabbatai zevi who declared himself messiah in
the propagation of kabbalah made the jewish masses susceptible to hasidic ideas themselves in essence a popularized version of the teaching indeed hasidism actually emerged when its founders determined to openly practice it instead of remaining a secret circle of ascetics as was the manner of almost all past kabbalists
the correlation between publicizing the lore and sabbateanism did not escape the rabbinic elite and caused vehement opposition to the new movement
another factor was the decline of the traditional authority structures
jewish autonomy remained quite secured later research debunked simon dubnow s claim that the council of four lands demise in was a culmination of a long process which destroyed judicial independence and paved the way for the hasidic rebbes to serve as leaders another long held explanation for the sect s rise advocated by raphael mahler that the khmelnytsky uprising effected economic impoverishment and despair was also refuted
however the magnates and nobles held much sway over the nomination of both rabbis and communal elders to such a degree that the masses often perceived them as mere lackeys of the land owners
their ability to serve as legitimate arbiters in disputes especially those concerning the regulation of leasehold rights over alcohol distillation and other monopolies in the estates was severely diminished
the reduced prestige of the establishment and the need for an alternative source of authority to pass judgement left a vacuum which hasidic charismatics eventually filled
they transcended old communal institutions to which all the jews of a locality were subordinate and had groups of followers in each town across vast territories
often supported by rising strata outside the traditional elite whether nouveau riche or various low level religious functionaries they created a modern form of leadership
historians discerned other influences
the formative age of hasidism coincided with the rise of numerous religious revival movements across the world including the first great awakening in new england german pietism wahhabism in arabia and the russian old believers who opposed the established church
they all rejected the existing order decrying it as stale and overly hierarchic
they offered what they described as more spiritual candid and simple substitutes
gershon david hundert noted the considerable similarity between the hasidic conceptions and this general background rooting both in the growing importance attributed to the individual s consciousness and choices
israel ben eliezer ca
known as the baal shem tov master of the good name acronym besht is considered the founder of hasidism
born apparently south of the prut in the northern frontier of moldavia he earned a reputation as a baal shem master of the name
these were common folk healers who employed mysticism amulets and incantations at their trade
little is known for certain on ben eliezer
though no scholar he was sufficiently learned to become notable in the communal hall of study and marry into the rabbinic elite his wife being the divorced sister of a rabbi in his later years he was wealthy and famous as attested by contemporary chronicles
apart from that most is derived from hasidic hagiographic accounts
these claim that as a boy he was recognized by one rabbi adam baal shem tov who entrusted him with great secrets of the torah passed in his illustrious family for centuries
the besht later spent a decade in the carpathian mountains as a hermit where he was visited by the biblical prophet ahijah the shilonite who taught him more
at the age of thirty six he was granted heavenly permission to reveal himself as a great kabbalist and miracle worker
by the s it is verified that he relocated to the town of medzhybizh and became recognized and popular in all podolia and beyond
it is well attested that he did emphasize several known kabbalistic concepts formulating a teaching of his own to some degree
the besht stressed the immanence of god and his presence in the material world and that therefore physical acts such as eating have an actual influence on the spiritual sphere and may serve to hasten the achievement of communion with the divine devekut
he was known to pray ecstatically and with great intention again in order to provide channels for the divine light to flow into the earthly realm
the besht stressed the importance of joy and contentment in the worship of god rather than the abstinence and self mortification deemed essential to becoming a pious mystic and of fervent and vigorous prayer as a means of spiritual elation instead of severe asceticism but many of his immediate disciples reverted in part to the older doctrines especially in disavowing sexual pleasure even in marital relations
in that the besht laid the foundation for a popular movement offering a far less rigorous course for the masses to gain a significant religious experience
and yet he remained the guide of a small society of elitists in the tradition of former kabbalists and never led a large public as his successors did
while many later figures cited him as the inspiration behind the full fledged hasidic doctrine the besht himself did not practice it in his lifetime
israel ben eliezer gathered a considerable following drawing to himself disciples from far away
they were largely of elitist background yet adopted the populist approach of their master
the most prominent was rabbi dov ber the maggid preacher
he succeeded the former upon his death though other important acolytes mainly jacob joseph of polonne did not accept his leadership
establishing himself in mezhirichi the maggid turned to greatly elaborate the besht s rudimentary ideas and institutionalize the nascent circle into an actual movement
ben eliezer and his acolytes used the very old and common epithet hasidim pious in the latter third of the th century a clear differentiation arose between that sense of the word and what was at first described as new hasidism propagated to a degree by the maggid and especially his successors
doctrine coalesced as jacob joseph dov ber and the latter s disciple rabbi elimelech of lizhensk composed the three magna opera of early hasidism respectively the toldot ya akov yosef the maggid d varav le ya akov and the no am elimelekh
other books were also published
their new teaching had many aspects
the importance of devotion in prayer was stressed to such degree that many waited beyond the prescribed time to properly prepare the besht s recommendation to elevate and sanctify impure thoughts rather than simply repress them during the service was expanded by dov ber into an entire precept depicting prayer as a mechanism to transform thoughts and feelings from a primal to a higher state in a manner parallel to the unfolding of the sephirot
but the most important was the notion of the tzaddiq later designated by the general rabbinic honorific admor our master teacher and rabbi or by the colloquial rebbe the righteous one the mystic who was able to elate and achieve communion with the divine but unlike kabbalists past did not practice it in secret but as leader of the masses
he was able to bring down prosperity and guidance from the higher sephirot and the common people who could not attain such a state themselves would achieve it by clinging to and obeying him
the tzaddiq served as a bridge between the spiritual realm and the ordinary folk as well as a simple understandable embodiment of the esoteric teachings of the sect which were still beyond the reach of most just as old style kabbalah before
the various hasidic tzaddiqim mainly the maggid s disciples spread across eastern europe with each gathering adherents among the people and learned acolytes who could be initiated as leaders
the righteous courts in which they resided attended by their followers to receive blessing and council became the institutional centers of hasidism serving as its branches and organizational core
slowly various rites emerged in them like the sabbath tisch or table in which the righteous would hand out food scraps from their meals considered blessed by the touch of ones imbued with godly light during their mystical ascensions
another potent institution was the shtibel the private prayer gatherings opened by adherents in every town which served as a recruiting mechanism
the shtibel differed from the established synagogues and study halls allowing their members greater freedom to worship when they pleased and also serving recreational and welfare purposes
combined with its simplified message more appealing to the common man its honed organizational framework accounted for the exponential growth of hasidic ranks
having ousted the old communal model and replaced it with a less hierarchical structure and more individually oriented religiosity hasidism was in fact the first great modern albeit not modernist its self understanding was grounded in a traditional mindset jewish movement
from its original base in podolia and volhynia the movement was rapidly disseminated during the maggid s lifetime and after his death
twenty or so of dov ber s prime disciples each brought it to a different region and their own successors followed aharon of karlin i menachem mendel of vitebsk and shneur zalman of liadi were the emissaries to the former lithuania in the far north while menachem nachum twersky headed to chernobyl in the east and levi yitzchok of berditchev remained nearby
elimelech of lizhensk his brother zusha of hanipol and yisroel hopsztajn established the sect in poland proper
vitebsk and abraham kalisker later led a small ascension to the land of israel establishing a hasidic presence in the galilee
the spread of hasidism also incurred organized opposition
rabbi elijah of vilnius one of the greatest authorities of the generation and a hasid and secret kabbalist of the old style was deeply suspicious of their emphasis on mysticism rather than mundane torah study threat to established communal authority resemblance to the sabbatean movement and other details he considered infractions
in april he and the vilnius community wardens launched a systematic campaign against the sect placing an anathema upon them banishing their leaders and sending letters denouncing the movement
further excommunication followed in brody and other cities
in during a second round of hostilities the books of jacob joseph were burned in vilnius
another cause for strife emerged when the hasidim adopted the lurianic prayer rite which they revised somewhat to nusach sefard the first edition in eastern europe was printed in and received approbation from the anti hasidic scholars of brody but the sect quickly embraced the kabbalah infused tome and popularized it making it their symbol
their rivals named misnagdim opponents a generic term which acquired an independent meaning as hasidism grew stronger soon accused them of abandoning the traditional nusach ashkenaz
in opponents made accusations of espionage against shneur zalman of liadi and he was imprisoned by the russian government for two months
excoriatory polemics were printed and anathemas declared in the entire region
but elijah s death in denied the misnagdim their powerful leader
in alexander i of russia allowed independent prayer groups to operate the chief vessel through which the movement spread from town to town
the failure to eradicate hasidism which acquired a clear self identity in the struggle and greatly expanded throughout it convinced its adversaries to adopt a more passive method of resistance as exemplified by chaim of volozhin
the growing conservatism of the new movement which at some occasions drew close to kabbalah based antinomian phraseology as did the sabbateans but never crossed the threshold and remained thoroughly observant and the rise of common enemies slowly brought a rapprochement and by the second half of the th century both sides basically considered each other legitimate
the turn of the century saw several prominent new fourth generation tzaddiqim
upon elimelech s death in the now partitioned poland his place in habsburg galicia was assumed by menachem mendel of rimanov who was deeply hostile to the modernization the austrian rulers attempted to force on the traditional jewish society though this same process also allowed his sect to flourish as communal authority was severely weakened
the rabbi of rimanov hearkened the alliance the hasidim would form with the most conservative elements of the jewish public
in central poland the new leader was jacob isaac horowiz the seer of lublin who was of a particularly populist bent and appealed to the common folk with miracle working and little strenuous spiritual demands
the seer s senior acolyte jacob isaac rabinovitz the holy jew of przysucha gradually dismissed his mentor s approach as overly vulgar and adopted a more aesthetic and scholarly approach virtually without theurgy to the masses
the holy jew s przysucha school was continued by his successor simcha bunim and especially the reclusive morose menachem mendel of kotzk
the most controversial fourth generation tzaddiq was the podolia based nachman of breslov who denounced his peers for becoming too institutionalized much like the old establishment their predecessors challenged decades before and espoused an anti rationalist pessimistic spiritual teaching very different from the prevalent stress on joy
napoleon s invasion of russia in promised to bring the first jewish emancipation to the pale of settlement
hasidic rebbes in poland and russia were divided on the issue between supporting western freedom from imperial anti semitic decrees to regarding napoleon as the opening to heresy and agnosticism
according to hasidic legend the fate of napoleon was decided not on the battlefields but between the theurgic prayers and deeds of the hasidic rebbes
the opening of the th century saw the hasidic sect transformed
once a rising force outside the establishment the tzaddiqim now became an important and often dominant power in most of eastern europe
the slow process of encroachment which mostly begun with forming an independent shtibel and culminated in the righteous becoming an authority figure either alongside or above the official rabbinate for the entire community overwhelmed many towns even in misnagdic stronghold of lithuania far more so in congress poland and the vast majority in podolia volhynia and galicia
it began to make inroads into bukovina bessarabia and the westernmost frontier of autochthonic pre wwii hasidism in northeastern hungary where the seer s disciple moses teitelbaum i was appointed in ujhely
less than three generations after the besht s death the sect grew to encompass hundreds of thousands by
as a mass movement a clear stratification emerged between the court s functionaries and permanent residents yoshvim sitters the devoted followers who would often visit the righteous on sabbath and the large public which prayed at sefard rite synagogues and was minimally affiliated
all this was followed by a more conservative approach and power bickering among the righteous
since the maggid s death none could claim the overall leadership
among the several dozens active each ruled over his own turf and local traditions and customs began to emerge in the various courts which developed their own identity
the high mystical tension typical of a new movement subsided and was soon replaced by more hierarchical orderly atmosphere
the most important aspect of the routinization hasidism underwent was the adoption of dynasticism
the first to claim legitimacy by right of descent from the besht was his grandson boruch of medzhybizh appointed
he held a lavish court with hershel of ostropol as jester and demanded the other righteous acknowledge his supremacy
upon the death of menachem nachum twersky of chernobyl his son mordechai twersky succeeded him
the principle was conclusively affirmed in the great dispute after liadi s demise in his senior acolyte aharon halevi of strashelye was defeated by his son dovber schneuri whose offspring retained the title for years
by the s virtually all courts were dynastic
rather than single tzaddiqim with followings of their own each sect would command a base of rank and file hasidim attached not just to the individual leader but to the bloodline and the court s unique attributes
israel friedman of ruzhyn insisted on royal splendour resided in a palace and his six sons all inherited some of his followers
with the constraints of maintaining their gains replacing the dynamism of the past the righteous or rebbes admorim also silently retreated from the overt radical mysticism of their predecessors
while populist miracle working for the masses remained a key theme in many dynasties a new type of rebbe rabbi emerged one who was both a completely traditional halakhic authority as well as a spiritualist
the tension with the misnagdim subsided significantly
but it was an external threat more than anything else that mended relations
while traditional jewish society remained well entrenched in backward eastern europe reports of the rapid acculturation and religious laxity in the west troubled both camps
when the haskalah the jewish enlightenment appeared in galicia and congress poland in the s it was soon perceived as a dire threat
the maskilim themselves detested hasidism as an anti rationalist and barbaric phenomenon as did western jews of all shades including the most right wing orthodox such as rabbi azriel hildesheimer
in galicia especially hostility towards it defined the haskalah to a large extent from the staunchly observant rabbi zvi hirsch chajes and joseph perl to the radical anti talmudists like osias schorr
the enlightened who revived hebrew grammar often mocked their rivals lack of eloquence in the language
while a considerable proportion of the misnagdim were not averse to at least some of the haskala s goals the rebbes were unremittingly hostile
the most distinguished hasidic leader in galicia in the era was chaim halberstam who combined talmudic erudition and the status of a major decisor with his function as tzaddiq
he symbolized the new era brokering peace between the small hasidic sect in hungary to its opponents
in that country where modernization and assimilation were much more prevalent than in the east the local righteous joined forces with those now termed orthodox against the rising liberals
rabbi moses sofer of pressburg while no friend to hasidism tolerated it as he combated the forces which sought modernization of the jews a generation later in the s the rebbes and the zealot haredi rabbi hillel lichtenstein allied closely
around the mid th century over a hundred dynastic courts related by marriage were the main religious power in the territory enclosed between hungary former lithuania prussia and inner russia with considerable presence in the former two
in central poland the pragmatist rationalist przysucha school thrived yitzchak meir alter founded the court of ger in and in jechiel danziger established alexander
in galicia and hungary apart from halberstam s house of sanz tzvi hirsh of zidichov s descendants each pursued a mystical approach in the dynasties of zidichov komarno and so forth
in sholom rokeach became the first rebbe of belz
at bukovina the hager line of kosov vizhnitz was the largest court
the haskalah was always a minor force but the jewish national movements which emerged in the s as well as socialism proved much more appealing to the young
progressive strata condemned hasidism as a primitive relic strong but doomed to disappear as eastern european jewry underwent slow yet steady secularization
the gravity of the situation was attested to by the foundation of hasidic yeshivas in the modern boarding school equivalent sense to enculturate the young and preserve their loyalty the first was established at nowy wi nicz by rabbi shlomo halberstam i in
these institutions were originally utilized by the misnagdim to protect their youth from hasidic influence but now the latter faced a similar crisis
one of the most contentious issues in this respect was zionism the ruzhin dynasties were quite favourably disposed toward it while hungarian and galician courts reviled it
outside pressure was mounting in the early th century
in many hasidic leaders partook in the creation of the agudas israel party a political instrument intended to safeguard what was now named orthodox judaism even in the relatively traditional east the more hard line dynasties mainly galician and hungarian opposed the aguda as too lenient
mass immigration to america urbanization world war i and the subsequent russian civil war uprooted the shtetls in which the local jews had lived for centuries and which were the bedrock of hasidism
in the new soviet union civil equality first achieved and a harsh repression of religion caused a rapid secularization
few remaining hasidim especially of chabad continued to practice underground for decades
in the new states of the interbellum era the process was only somewhat slower
on the eve of world war ii strictly observant jews were estimated to constitute no more than a third of the total jewish population in poland the world s most orthodox country
while the rebbes still had a vast base of support it was aging and declining
the holocaust hit the hasidim particularly hard because they were easily identifiable and because they were almost unable to disguise themselves among the larger populace due to cultural insularity
hundreds of leaders perished with their flock while the flight of many notable ones as their followers were being exterminated especially aharon rokeach of belz and joel teitelbaum of satmar elicited bitter recrimination
in the immediate post war years the entire movement seemed to teeter on the precipice of oblivion
in israel the united states and western europe the survivors children were at best becoming modern orthodox
while a century earlier the haskalah depicted it as a medieval malicious power now it was so weakened that the popular cultural image was sentimental and romantic what joseph dan termed frumkinian hasidism for it began with the short stories of michael levi rodkinson frumkin
martin buber was the major contributor to this trend portraying the sect as a model of a healthy folk consciousness
frumkinian style was very influential later inspiring the so called neo hasidism and also utterly ahistorical
yet the movement proved resilient
talented and charismatic hasidic masters emerged who re invigorated their following and drew new crowds
in new york the satmar rebbe joel teitelbaum formulated a fiercely anti zionist holocaust theology and founded an insular self sufficient community which attracted many immigrants from greater hungary
by of families were newcomers
yisrael alter of ger created robust institutions fortified his court s standing in agudas israel and held tisch every week for years
he halted the hemorrhage of his followers and retrieved many litvaks the contemporary less adverse epithet for misnagdim and religious zionists whose parents were gerrer hasidim before the war
chaim meir hager similarly restored vizhnitz
moses isaac gewirtzman founded the new pshevorsk hasidic dynasty in antwerp
the most explosive growth was experienced in chabad lubavitch whose head menachem mendel schneerson adopted a modern he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary shtreimel and outreach centered orientation
at a time when most orthodox jews and hasidim in particular rejected proselytization he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it blurring the difference between actual hasidim and loosely affiliated supporters until researchers could scarcely define it as a regular hasidic group
another phenomenon was the revival of breslov which remained without an acting tzaddiq since the rebellious rebbe nachman s death
its complex existentialist philosophy drew many to it
high fertility rates increasing tolerance and multiculturalism on behalf of surrounding society and the great wave of newcomers to orthodox judaism which began in the s all cemented the movement s status as very much alive and thriving
the clearest indication for that noted joseph dan was the disappearance of the frumkinian narrative which inspired much sympathy towards it from non orthodox jews and others as actual hasidism returned to the fore
it was replaced by apprehension and concern due to the growing presence of the reclusive strictly religious hasidic lifestyle in the public sphere especially in israel
as numbers grew courts were again torn apart by schisms between rebbes sons vying for power a common occurrence during the golden age of the th century
