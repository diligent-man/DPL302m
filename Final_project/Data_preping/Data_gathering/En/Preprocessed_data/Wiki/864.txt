a physical neural network is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse
physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software based approaches
more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse
in the s bernard widrow and ted hoff developed adaline adaptive linear neuron which used electrochemical cells called memistors memory resistors to emulate synapses of an artificial neuron
the memistors were implemented as terminal devices operating based on the reversible electroplating of copper such that the resistance between two of the terminals is controlled by the integral of the current applied via the third terminal
the adaline circuitry was briefly commercialized by the memistor corporation in the s enabling some applications in pattern recognition
however since the memistors were not fabricated using integrated circuit fabrication techniques the technology was not scalable and was eventually abandoned as solid state electronics became mature
in carver mead published his book analog vlsi and neural systems which spun off perhaps the most common variant of analog neural networks
the physical realization is implemented in analog vlsi
this is often implemented as field effect transistors in low inversion
such devices can be modelled as translinear circuits
this is a technique described by barrie gilbert in several papers around mid th and in particular his translinear circuits from
with this method circuits can be analyzed as a set of well defined functions in steady state and such circuits assembled into complex networks
alex nugent describes a physical neural network as one or more nonlinear neuron like nodes used to sum signals and nanoconnections formed from nanoparticles nanowires or nanotubes which determine the signal strength input to the nodes
alignment or self assembly of the nanoconnections is determined by the history of the applied electric field performing a function analogous to neural synapses
numerous applications for such physical neural networks are possible
for example a temporal summation device can be composed of one or more nanoconnections having an input and an output thereof wherein an input signal provided to the input causes one or more of the nanoconnection to experience an increase in connection strength thereof over time

nugent and molter have shown that universal computing and general purpose machine learning are possible from operations available through simple memristive circuits operating the ahah plasticity rule
more recently it has been argued that also complex networks of purely memristive circuits can serve as neural networks
in stanford ovshinsky described an analog neural computing medium in which phase change material has the ability to cumulatively respond to multiple input signals
an electrical alteration of the resistance of the phase change material is used to control the weighting of the input signals
greg snider of hp labs describes a system of cortical computing with memristive nanodevices
the memristors memory resistors are implemented by thin film materials in which the resistance is electrically tuned via the transport of ions or oxygen vacancies within the film
darpa s synapse project has funded ibm research and hp labs in collaboration with the boston university department of cognitive and neural systems cns to develop neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memristive systems
