physical neural network type artificial neural network electrically adjustable material used emulate function neural synapse
physical neural network used emphasize reliance physical hardware used emulate neuron opposed software-based approaches
generally term applicable artificial neural network memristor electrically adjustable resistance material used emulate neural synapse
bernard widrow ted hoff developed adaline adaptive linear neuron used electrochemical cell called memistors memory resistor emulate synapsis artificial neuron
memistors implemented terminal device operating based reversible electroplating copper resistance two terminal controlled integral current applied via third terminal
adaline circuitry wa briefly commercialized memistor corporation enabling application pattern recognition
however since memistors fabricated using integrated circuit fabrication technique technology wa scalable wa eventually abandoned solid-state electronics became mature
