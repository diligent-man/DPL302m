midodrine is a vasopressor antihypotensive agent it raises the blood pressure
midodrine was approved in the united states by the food and drug administration fda in for the treatment of dysautonomia and orthostatic hypotension
in august the fda proposed withdrawing this approval because the manufacturer shire plc failed to complete required studies after the medicine reached the market
in september the fda reversed its decision to remove midodrine from the market and allowed it to remain available to patients while shire plc collected further data regarding the efficacy and safety of the drug
shire announced on september that it was withdrawing completely from supplying midodrine and leaving it to several generics to supply the drug
midodrine is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension
it can reduce dizziness and faints by about a third but can be limited by troublesome goose bumps skin itch gastrointestinal discomfort chills elevated blood pressure while lying down and urinary retention
a meta analysis of clinical trials of midodrine or droxidopa in patients with low blood pressure when standing found that midodrine increased standing blood pressure more than droxidopa but that midodrine but not droxidopa increased the risk of high blood pressure when lying down
small studies have also shown that midodrine can be used to prevent excessive drops in blood pressure in people requiring dialysis
midodrine has been used in the complications of cirrhosis
it is also used with octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome the proposed mechanism is constriction of splanchnic vessels and dilation of renal vasculature
studies have not been sufficiently well conducted to show a clear place for midodrine
midodrine is contraindicated in patients with severe organic heart disease acute kidney disease urinary retention pheochromocytoma or thyrotoxicosis
midodrine should not be used in patients with persistent and excessive supine hypertension
headache feeling of pressure fullness in the head vasodilation flushing face scalp tingling confusion thinking abnormality dry mouth nervousness anxiety and rash
midodrine is a prodrug which forms an active metabolite desglymidodrine which is an receptor agonist and exerts its actions via activation of the alpha adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature producing an increase in vascular tone and elevation of blood pressure
desglymidodrine does not stimulate cardiac beta adrenergic receptors
desglymidodrine diffuses poorly across the blood brain barrier and is therefore not associated with effects on the central nervous system
after oral administration midodrine is rapidly absorbed
the plasma levels of the prodrug peak after about half an hour and decline with a half life of approximately minutes while the metabolite reaches peak blood concentrations about to hours after a dose of midodrine and has a half life of about to hours
the absolute bioavailability of midodrine measured as desglymidodrine is
midodrine is an odorless white crystalline powder soluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol
midodrine contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers making it a racemate i e a mixture of r and s forms
acylation of dimethoxybenzene with chloroacetyl chloride gives the chloroketone
the halogen is then converted to the amine by any set of standard schemes and the ketone reduced to an alcohol with borohydride
acylation of the amino group in this last intermediate with chloroacetyl chloride affords the amide
the halogen is then displaced with azide and the resulting product reduced catalytically to the glycinamide midodrine
