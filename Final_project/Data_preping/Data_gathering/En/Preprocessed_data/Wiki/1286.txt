Icingtons also known as French icingtons are traditional wedding figurines made entirely of icing sugar
Icingtons are distinguishable from other wedding figurines by their organic soft look
They are placed on top of the wedding cake as a visual and symbolic mechanism
Icingtons consist of royal icing also known as 'hard icing' or 'ready-to-roll icing' or sugar paste
The design of icingtons was inspired by classic French cinema of the s and s
They possessed a simple yet elegant aesthetic that encapsulated the on-screen sophistication of classic French actresses and actors
While the cake topper became popularized in America during the s as a symbol of union icingtons distinguished themselves by maintaining their elegance
Today the words 'cake figurines' and 'cake toppers' are interchangeable
Cake toppers increasingly refer to figurines that are made of plastic porcelain and now polymer clay
Figurines made of icing are traditionally referred to as icingtons
Some adopt the generic term 'sugar paste topper' to describe them as these days many sugar paste toppers are devoid of any French influences
Icingtons have evolved from the kitchens of patisserie chefs and cake decorators displaying their skills in fondant marzipan and royal icing
Icing sugar creations are considered an art form in itself and require a great deal of skill and craftsmanship and may involve embossing crimping broderie anglaise and Garret frills
Modern-day icingtons have not strayed too far from the traditional - they still retain the suave elegant look that mirror the French Classics
