The National Academy of Sciences NAS is a United States nonprofit non governmental organization NAS is part of the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine along with the National Academy of Engineering NAE and the National Academy of Medicine NAM
As a national academy new members of the organization are elected annually by current members based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research Election to the National Academy is one of the highest honors in the scientific field Members of the National Academy of Sciences serve pro bono as advisers to the nation on science engineering and medicine The group holds a congressional charter under Title of the United States Code
Founded in as a result of an Act of Congress that was approved by Abraham Lincoln the NAS is charged with providing independent objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology to provide scientific advice to the government 'whenever called upon' by any government department
The Academy receives no compensation from the government for its services
As of the National Academy of Sciences includes NAS members and international members It employed about staff in Some members have won a Nobel Prize By its own admission in the addition of women to the Academy continues at a dismal trickle at which time there were male members and female members
The National Academy of Sciences is one of the member organizations of the International Science Council ISC Although there is no formal relationship with state and local academies of science there often is informal dialogue The National Academy is governed by a member Council made up of five officers president vice president home secretary international secretary and treasurer and Councilors all of whom are elected from among the Academy membership Agencies of the United States government fund about percent of the Academy's activities Further funding comes from state governments private foundations and industrial organizations
The Council has the ability ad hoc to delegate certain tasks to committees For example the Committee on Animal Nutrition has produced a series of Nutrient requirements of domestic animals reports since at least each one being initiated by a different sub committee of experts in the field for example on dairy cattle
The National Academy of Sciences meets annually in Washington D C which is documented in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences its scholarly journal The National Academies Press is the publisher for the National Academies and makes more than publications freely available on its website
From to the National Academy of Sciences administered the Marian Koshland Science Museum to provide public exhibits and programming related to its policy work The museum's exhibits focused on climate change and infectious disease In the museum closed and made way for a new science outreach program called LabX
The Academy currently has members and international members Existing members elect new members for life Up to members are elected every year up to foreign citizens may be elected as international members annually The election process begins with a formal nomination followed by a vetting period and culminates in a final ballot at the Academy's annual meeting in April each year Members are affiliated with a section a specific scientific field in one of six so called classes Physical and Mathematical Sciences Biological Sciences Engineering and Applied Sciences Biomedical Sciences Behavioral and Social Sciences and Applied Biological Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Since its founding the Academy has elected members Harvard University is associated with the most members some of the all time total The top ten institutions half of which are Ivy League universities account for nearly of all members ever elected
The National Academy of Sciences maintains multiple buildings around the United States
The National Academy of Sciences Building is located at Constitution Avenue in northwest Washington D C it sits on the National Mall adjacent to the Marriner S Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building and in front of the headquarters of the U S State Department The building has a neoclassical architectural style and was built by architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue The building was dedicated in and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places Goodhue engaged a team of artists and architectural sculptors including Albert Herter Lee Lawrie and Hildreth Meiere to design interior embellishments celebrating the history and significance of science The building is used for lectures symposia exhibitions and concerts in addition to annual meetings of the NAS NAE and NAM The Presidential Award for Math and Science Teaching ceremony was held here on March Approximately staff members work at the NAS Building In June it reopened to visitors after a major two year restoration project which restored and improved the building's historic spaces increased accessibility and brought the building's aging infrastructure and facilities up to date
More than National Academies staff members work at The Keck Center of the National Academies at Fifth Street in northwest Washington D C The Keck Center provides meeting space and houses the National Academies Press Bookstore The Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences formerly located at E St N W hosted visits from the public school field trips traveling exhibits such as Mathemalchemy and permanent science exhibits
The NAS also maintains conference centers in California and Massachusetts The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center is located on Academy Drive in Irvine California near the campus of the University of California Irvine it offers a conference center and houses several NAS programs The J Erik Jonsson Conference Center located at Quissett Avenue in Woods Hole Massachusetts is another conference facility
The Act of Incorporation signed by President Abraham Lincoln on March created the National Academy of Sciences and named charter members Many of the original NAS members came from the so called Scientific Lazzaroni an informal network of mostly physical scientists working in the vicinity of Cambridge Massachusetts c
In the organizers enlisted the support of Alexander Dallas Bache and also Charles Henry Davis a professional astronomer who had been recently recalled from the Navy to Washington to head the Bureau of Navigation They also elicited support from Swiss American geologist Louis Agassiz and American mathematician Peirce who together planned the steps whereby the National Academy of Sciences was to be established Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts was to name Agassiz to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
Agassiz was to come to Washington at the government's expense to plan the organization with the others This bypassed Joseph Henry who was reluctant to have a bill for such an academy presented to Congress This was in the belief that such a resolution would be opposed as something at variance with our democratic institutions Nevertheless Henry soon became the second President of NAS Agassiz Davis Peirce Benjamin Gould and Senator Wilson met at Bache's house and hurriedly wrote the bill incorporating the Academy including in it the name of fifty incorporators
During the last hours of the session when the Senate was immersed in the rush of last minute business before its adjournment Senator Wilson introduced the bill Without examining it or debating its provisions both the Senate and House approved it and President Lincoln signed it
Although hailed as a great step forward in government recognition of the role of science in American society at the time the National Academy of Sciences created enormous ill feelings among scientists whether or not they were named as incorporators
The act states T he Academy shall whenever called upon by any department of the Government investigate examine experiment and report upon any subject of science or art the actual expense of such investigations examinations experiments and reports to be paid from appropriations which may be made for the purpose but the Academy shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the Government of the United States The National Academies did not solve the problems facing a nation in Civil War as the Lazzaroni had hoped nor did it centralize American scientific efforts However election to the National Academy did come to be considered the pinnacle of scientific achievement for Americans until the establishment of the Nobel Prize at the end of the th century
In the congressional charter was amended to remove the limitation on the number of members
In astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson was asked to write a speech for the th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address in which he made the point that one of Lincoln's greatest legacies was establishing the National Academy of Sciences in that same year which had the long term effect of setting our Nation on a course of scientifically enlightened governance without which we all may perish from this Earth
The president is the head of the Academy elected by a majority vote of the membership to serve in this position for a term to be determined by the governing Council not to exceed six years and may be re elected for a second term The Academy has had presidents since its foundation The current president is geophysicist Marcia K McNutt the first woman to hold this position Her term expires on June

On May a letter signed by Academy members was published in Science magazine decrying political assaults against climate change scientists This was in response to a civil investigative demand on the University of Virginia UVA by Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli seeking a broad range of documents from Michael E Mann a former UVA professor from Mann who currently works at Penn State is a climate change researcher and Cuccinelli alleges that Mann may have defrauded Virginia taxpayers in the course of his environmental research Investigations had cleared Mann of charges that he falsified or suppressed data
