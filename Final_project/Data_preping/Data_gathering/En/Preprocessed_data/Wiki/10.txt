ecological economics bioeconomics ecolonomy eco economics or ecol econ is both a transdisciplinary and an interdisciplinary field of academic research addressing the interdependence and coevolution of human economies and natural ecosystems both intertemporally and spatially
by treating the economy as a subsystem of earth s larger ecosystem and by emphasizing the preservation of natural capital the field of ecological economics is differentiated from environmental economics which is the mainstream economic analysis of the environment
one survey of german economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought with ecological economists emphasizing strong sustainability and rejecting the proposition that physical human made capital can substitute for natural capital see the section on weak versus strong sustainability below
ecological economics was founded in the s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various european and american academics see the section on history and development below
the related field of green economics is in general a more politically applied form of the subject
according to ecological economist malte michael faber de ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature justice and time
issues of intergenerational equity irreversibility of environmental change uncertainty of long term outcomes and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation
ecological economists have questioned fundamental mainstream economic approaches such as cost benefit analysis and the separability of economic values from scientific research contending that economics is unavoidably normative i e
prescriptive rather than positive or descriptive
positional analysis which attempts to incorporate time and justice issues is proposed as an alternative
ecological economics shares several of its perspectives with feminist economics including the focus on sustainability nature justice and care values
karl marx also commented on relationship between capital and ecology what is now known as ecosocialism
the antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the romantics of the th century as well as some enlightenment political economists of that era
concerns over population were expressed by thomas malthus while john stuart mill predicted the desirability of the stationary state of an economy
mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the post world war ii economic expansion
in marxian economist sergei podolinsky attempted to theorize a labor theory of value based on embodied energy his work was read and critiqued by marx and engels
otto neurath developed an ecological approach based on a natural economy whilst employed by the bavarian soviet republic in
he argued that a market system failed to take into account the needs of future generations and that a socialist economy required calculation in kind the tracking of all the different materials rather than synthesising them into money as a general equivalent
in this he was criticised by neo liberal economists such as ludwig von mises and freidrich hayek in what became known as the socialist calculation debate
the debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to nobel prize winning radiochemist frederick soddy
in his book wealth virtual wealth and debt soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine capable of generating infinite wealth a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as nicholas georgescu roegen and herman daly
european predecessors of ecological economics include k
william kapp karl polanyi and romanian economist nicholas georgescu roegen
georgescu roegen who would later mentor herman daly at vanderbilt university provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and consumption
his magnum opus the entropy law and the economic process is credited by daly as a fundamental text of the field alongside soddy s wealth virtual wealth and debt
some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of kenneth boulding and e f
schumacher whose book small is beautiful a study of economics as if people mattered was published just a few years before the first edition of herman daly s comprehensive and persuasive steady state economics
the first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the s
these began in at the instigation of lois banner with a meeting held in sweden including robert costanza herman daly charles hall bruce hannon h t
odum and david pimentel
most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists with the exception of daly
in daly and costanza edited an issue of ecological modeling to test the waters
a book entitled ecological economics by joan martinez alier was published later that year
he renewed interest in the approach developed by otto neurath during the interwar period
saw the foundation of the international society for ecological economics and publication of its journal ecological economics by elsevier
robert costanza was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal which is currently edited by richard howarth
other figures include ecologists c s
holling and h t
odum biologist gretchen daily and physicist robert ayres
in the marxian tradition sociologist john bellamy foster and cuny geography professor david harvey explicitly center ecological concerns in political economy
articles by inge ropke and clive spash cover the development and modern history of ecological economics and explain its differentiation from resource and environmental economics as well as some of the controversy between american and european schools of thought
an article by robert costanza david stern lining he and chunbo ma responded to a call by mick common to determine the foundational literature of ecological economics by using citation analysis to examine which books and articles have had the most influence on the development of the field
however citations analysis has itself proven controversial and similar work has been criticized by clive spash for attempting to pre determine what is regarded as influential in ecological economics through study design and data manipulation
in addition the journal ecological economics has itself been criticized for swamping the field with mainstream economics
various competing schools of thought exist in the field
some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook
an example of the latter is the european society for ecological economics
an example of the former is the swedish beijer international institute of ecological economics
clive spash has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment into three main categories
these are the mainstream new resource economists the new environmental pragmatists and the more radical social ecological economists
international survey work comparing the relevance of the categories for mainstream and heterodox economists shows some clear divisions between environmental and ecological economists
a growing field of radical social ecological theory is degrowth economics
degrowth addresses both biophysical limits and global inequality while rejecting neoliberal economics
degrowth prioritizes grassroots initiatives in progressive socio ecological goals adhering to ecological limits by shrinking the human ecological footprint see differences from mainstream economics below
it involves an equitable downscale in both production and consumption of resources in order to adhere to biophysical limits
degrowth draws from marxian economics citing the growth of efficient systems as the alienation of nature and man
economic movements like degrowth reject the idea of growth itself
some degrowth theorists call for an exit of the economy
critics of the degrowth movement include new resource economists who point to the gaining momentum of sustainable development
these economists highlight the positive aspects of a green economy which include equitable access to renewable energy and a commitment to eradicate global inequality through sustainable development see green economics
examples of heterodox ecological economic experiments include the catalan integral cooperative and the solidarity economy networks in italy
both of these grassroots movements use communitarian based economies and consciously reduce their ecological footprint by limiting material growth and adapting to regenerative agriculture
cultural and heterodox applications of economic interaction around the world have begun to be included as ecological economic practices
schumacher introduced examples of non western economic ideas to mainstream thought in his book small is beautiful where he addresses neoliberal economics through the lens of natural harmony in buddhist economics
this emphasis on natural harmony is witnessed in diverse cultures across the globe
buen vivir is a traditional socio economic movement in south america that rejects the western development model of economics
meaning good life buen vivir emphasizes harmony with nature diverse pluralculturism coexistence and inseparability of nature and material
value is not attributed to material accumulation and it instead takes a more spiritual and communitarian approach to economic activity
ecological swaraj originated out of india and is an evolving world view of human interactions within the ecosystem
this train of thought respects physical bio limits and non human species pursuing equity and social justice through direct democracy and grassroots leadership
social well being is paired with spiritual physical and material well being
these movements are unique to their region but the values can be seen across the globe in indigenous traditions such as the ubuntu philosophy in south africa
ecological economics differs from mainstream economics in that it heavily reflects on the ecological footprint of human interactions in the economy
this footprint is measured by the impact of human activities on natural resources and the wastes generated in the process
ecological economists aim to minimize the ecological footprint taking into account the scarcity of global and regional resources and their accessibility to an economy
some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical capital asset analysis of land labor and financial capital
these ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics but may apply them more closely to the natural world
whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics
they reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out
since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle
as ecological economists try to minimize these disasters calculating the fallout of environmental destruction becomes a humanitarian issue as well
already the global south has seen trends of mass emigration due to environmental changes
climate refugees from the global south are adversely affected by changes in the environment and some scholars point to global wealth inequality within the current neoliberal economic system as a source for this issue
the most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is tropical rainforest ecosystems most obviously the yasuni region of ecuador
while this area has substantial deposits of bitumen it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on earth and some estimates establish it has over undiscovered medical substances in its genomes most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen
effectively the instructional capital of the genomes is undervalued by analyses that view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood oil tar and perhaps food
increasingly the carbon credit for leaving the extremely carbon intensive dirty bitumen in the ground is also valued the government of ecuador set a price of us m for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest
while this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics growth market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment
critiques concern the need to create a more meaningful relationship with nature and the non human world than evident in the instrumentalism of shallow ecology and the environmental economists commodification of everything external to the market system
a simple circular flow of income diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of production
once consumed natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste
the potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an environment s source function and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources
the sink function describes an environment s ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function long term damage occurs
some persistent pollutants such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all ecological economists emphasize minimizing cumulative pollutants
pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem
the economic value of natural capital and ecosystem services is accepted by mainstream environmental economics but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics
ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms
ecological economist robert costanza led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in
initially published in nature the article concluded on trillion with a range from trillion to trillion in total global gdp was trillion
half of the value went to nutrient cycling
the open oceans continental shelves and estuaries had the highest total value and the highest per hectare values went to estuaries swamps floodplains and seagrass algae beds
the work was criticized by articles in ecological economics volume issue but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem
the earth s carrying capacity is a central issue in ecological economics
early economists such as thomas malthus pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth which was also central to the mit study limits to growth
diminishing returns suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made
food production may become a problem as erosion an impending water crisis and soil salinity from irrigation reduce the productivity of agriculture
ecological economists argue that industrial agriculture which exacerbates these problems is not sustainable agriculture and are generally inclined favorably to organic farming which also reduces the output of carbon
global wild fisheries are believed to have peaked and begun a decline with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition
the aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish like salmon does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish
studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them
since animals are higher on the trophic level they are less efficient sources of food energy
reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food but as nations develop they tend to adopt high meat diets similar to that of the united states
genetically modified food gmf a conventional solution to the problem presents numerous problems bt corn produces its own bacillus thuringiensis toxin protein but the pest resistance is believed to be only a matter of time
global warming is now widely acknowledged as a major issue with all national scientific academies expressing agreement on the importance of the issue
as the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases the world faces an energy crisis
some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained the stern report is an example
the disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of discounting and intergenerational equity
mainstream economics has attempted to become a value free hard science but ecological economists argue that value free economics is generally not realistic
ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of utility efficiency and cost benefits such as positional analysis or multi criteria analysis
ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for sustainable development and may have goals similar to green politics
in international regional and national policy circles the concept of the green economy grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development
the united nations environment programme unep defines a green economy as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high salary jobs
in its definition was further developed as the word green is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well organized but also impartial guaranteeing an objective shift to an economy that is low carbon resource efficient and socially inclusive
the ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective resourceful environment friendly and resource saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation
as an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development the green economy adherents robustly promote good governance
to boost local investments and foreign ventures it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere
likewise such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable
in the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant
in achieving a green economy competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies guidelines campaigns and programmes
shifting to a green economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business
it likewise necessitates new capacities skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors and able to work as effective components within multi disciplinary teams
to achieve this goal vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors
simultaneously the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines
among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology allocation of resources weak versus strong sustainability energy economics energy accounting and balance environmental services cost shifting modeling and monetary policy
a primary objective of ecological economics ee is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality especially in the laws of physics particularly the laws of thermodynamics and in knowledge of biological systems
it accepts as a goal the improvement of human well being through development and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies
of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy
richard b
norgaard argues traditional economics has hi jacked the development terminology in his book development betrayed
well being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the new welfare economics from the s which informs resource and environmental economics
this entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i e nature is valuable to our economies that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air clean water encounters with wilderness etc
ecological economics is distinguishable from neoclassical economics primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system
ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the earth and the human economy is by definition contained within this system
ecological economists argue that neoclassical economics has ignored the environment at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy
the neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e g the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and ecosystem services directly to human communities micro and macro climate regulation water recycling water purification storm water regulation waste absorption food and medicine production pollination protection from solar and cosmic radiation the view of a starry night sky etc
there has then been a move to regard such things as natural capital and ecosystems functions as goods and services
however this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding nature as a commodity
this has been referred to as ecologists selling out on nature
there is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in environmental ethics about how to structure a plural value system
resource and neoclassical economics focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics distribution equity and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies
ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth quantitative increase in economic output and development qualitative improvement of the quality of life while arguing that neoclassical economics confuses the two
ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels increased per capita consumption the typical economic measure of standard of living may not always lead to improvement in human well being but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well being
this situation is sometimes referred to as uneconomic growth see diagram above
ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human made capital labor and technology
the impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy
shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other
for instance photo voltaic or solar panels have a efficiency when absorbing the sun s energy but its construction demand has increased within both commercial and residential properties
additionally this construction has led to a roughly increase in work demands chen
the potential for the substitution of man made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability
there is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of robert solow and martin weitzman at one extreme and the entropy pessimists notably nicholas georgescu roegen and herman daly at the other
neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man made capital can in principle replace all types of natural capital
this is known as the weak sustainability view essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials
at the other extreme the strong sustainability view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable
from the premises of strong sustainability it follows that economic policy has a fiduciary responsibility to the greater ecological world and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions
recently stanislav shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi criteria methods which allows consideration of different perspectives including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a middle way by providing a strong neo keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources including water or producing emissions both directly and indirectly
a key concept of energy economics is net energy gain which recognizes that all energy sources require an initial energy investment in order to produce energy
to be useful the energy return on energy invested eroei has to be greater than one
the net energy gain from the production of coal oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted
ecological economics generally rejects the view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity or natural capital and individual capital in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically
in practice ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of uneconomic growth and quality of life
ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this
thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood through the second law of thermodynamics but also in terms of such economic criteria as productivity efficiency and especially the costs and benefits or profitability of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work
as a result thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development
exergy analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently
the term exergy was coined by zoran rant in but the concept was developed by j
willard gibbs
in recent decades utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology ecological economics systems ecology and energetics
an energy balance can be used to track energy through a system and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts using the first and second laws of thermodynamics to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues
the energy accounting system keeps track of energy in energy out and non useful energy versus work done and transformations within the system
scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting
ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings playing a key role in producing well being
at the same time there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits
a study was carried out by costanza and colleagues to determine the value of the services provided by the environment
this was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context
dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e g
wetlands oceans
a total was then produced which came out at trillion us dollars values more than twice the total gdp of the world at the time of the study
this study was criticized by pre ecological and even some environmental economists for being inconsistent with assumptions of financial capital valuation and ecological economists for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators
the whole idea of treating ecosystems as goods and services to be valued in monetary terms remains controversial
a common objection is that life is precious or priceless but this demonstrably degrades to it being worthless within cost benefit analysis and other standard economic methods
reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of insurance or wages
economics in principle assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services
in doing so a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other reputation financial risks
ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities
despite these issues many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing ecosystem valuation
biodiversity measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values and there are many active efforts in this regard
the growing field of biodiversity finance began to emerge in in response to many specific proposals such as the ecuadoran yasuni proposal or similar ones in the congo
us news outlets treated the stories as a threat to drill a park reflecting a previously dominant view that ngos and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems
however peter barnes and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship trustee commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm
commodification of other ecological relations as in carbon credit and direct payments to farmers to preserve ecosystem services are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity but is also controversial in ecological economics
the united nations food and agriculture organization achieved near universal agreement in that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging permaculture were the only practical way out of a food crisis
the holdouts were all english speaking countries that export gmos and promote free trade agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network the us uk canada and australia
ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics nce assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling externalities is not warranted
joan martinez alier for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet
the assumptions behind future discounting which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods has been criticized by david pearce and by the recent stern report although the stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as clive spash
concerning these externalities some like the eco businessman paul hawken argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy paid by the non monetized human environment community or future generations
these arguments are developed further by hawken amory and hunter lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in natural capitalism creating the next industrial revolution
in contrast ecological economists like joan martinez alier appeal to a different line of reasoning
rather than assuming some new form of capitalism is the best way forward an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system
the work by karl william kapp explains why the concept of externality is a misnomer
in fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits
charles eisenstein has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities passing the costs to the community to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive
as social ecological economist clive spash has noted externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system
internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed externalities
mathematical modeling is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis
various approaches and techniques include evolutionary input output neo austrian modeling entropy and thermodynamic models multi criteria and agent based modeling the environmental kuznets curve and stock flow consistent model frameworks
system dynamics and gis are techniques applied among other to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling
the matrix accounting methods of christian felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying the common good
ecological economics draws upon its work on resource allocation and strong sustainability to address monetary policy
drawing upon a transdisciplinary literature ecological economics roots its policy work in monetary theory and its goals of sustainable scale just distribution and efficient allocation
ecological economics work on monetary theory and policy can be traced to frederick soddy s work on money
the field considers questions such as the growth imperative of interest bearing debt the nature of money and alternative policy proposals such as alternative currencies and public banking
assigning monetary value to natural resources such as biodiversity and the emergent ecosystem services is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices policy and decision making
while this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist some argue that it is inherently false
mccauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful
he describes four main problems with this approach
firstly it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial
this is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems they do not act specifically in favour of any single species
while certain services might be very useful to us such as coastal protection from hurricanes by mangroves for example others might cause financial or personal harm such as wolves hunting cattle
the complexity of eco systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species
wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations the absence of such an apex predator in the scottish highlands has caused the over population of deer preventing afforestation which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property
secondly allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate
this can lead to devaluation of services that were previously considered financially beneficial
such is the case of the bees in a forest near former coffee plantations in finca santa fe costa rica
the pollination services were valued to over us a year but soon after the study coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple
pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated so the value of their service dropped to zero
thirdly conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means
mccauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of technology is about how humanity developed artificial alternatives to nature s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease
this would also lead to the devaluation of ecosystem services
lastly it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration
in the case of the introduction of the nile perch to lake victoria the ecological consequence was decimation of native fauna
however this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish
mccauley argues that for these reasons trying to convince decision makers to conserve nature for monetary reasons is not the path to be followed and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature
