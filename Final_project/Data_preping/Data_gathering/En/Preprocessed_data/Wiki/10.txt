ecological economist aim minimize ecological footprint taking account scarcity global regional resource accessibility economy
ecological economist prioritise adding natural capital typical capital asset analysis land labor financial capital
ecological economist use tool mathematical economics mainstream economics may apply closely natural world
whereas mainstream economist tend technological optimist ecological economist inclined technological sceptics
reason natural world ha limited carrying capacity resource may run out

ecological economics distinguishable neoclassical economics primarily assertion economy embedded within environmental system
ecology deal energy matter transaction life earth human economy definition contained within system
ecological economist argue neoclassical economics ha ignored environment best considering subset human economy
neoclassical view ignores much natural science taught u contribution nature creation wealth eg planetary endowment scarce matter energy along complex biologically diverse ecosystem provide good ecosystem service directly human community micro- macro-climate regulation water recycling water purification storm water regulation
ha move regard thing natural capital ecosystem function good services
however far uncontroversial within ecology ecological economics due potential narrowing value found mainstream economics danger merely regarding nature commodity
concern ecological economics ha failed learn extensive literature environmental ethic structure plural value system
resource neoclassical economics focus primarily efficient allocation resource le two problem importance ecological economics distribution equity scale economy relative ecosystem upon relies
ecological economics make clear distinction growth quantitative increase economic output development qualitative improvement quality life arguing neoclassical economics confuses two
ecological economist point beyond modest level increased per-capita consumption typical economic measure standard living may always lead improvement human well-being may harmful effect environment broader societal well-being
situation sometimes referred uneconomic growth see diagram above
ecological economics challenge conventional approach towards natural resource claiming undervalues natural capital considering interchangeable human-made capitallabor technology
impending depletion natural resource increase climate-changing greenhouse gas motivate u examine political economic social policy benefit alternative energy

potential substitution man-made capital natural capital important debate ecological economics economics sustainability
continuum view among economist strongly neoclassical position robert solow martin weitzman one extreme 'entropy pessimists' notably nicholas georgescu-roegen herman daly other
neoclassical economist tend maintain man-made capital principle replace type natural capital
known weak sustainability view essentially every technology improved upon replaced innovation substitute scarce materials
extreme strong sustainability view argues stock natural resource ecological function irreplaceable
premise strong sustainability follows economic policy ha fiduciary responsibility greater ecological world sustainable development must therefore take different approach valuing natural resource ecological functions
recently stanislav shmelev developed new methodology assessment progress macro scale based multi-criteria method allows consideration different perspective including strong weak sustainability conservationist v industrialist aim search 'middle way' providing strong neo-keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure natural resource including

ecological economics founded upon view neoclassical economics nce assumption environmental community cost benefit mutually canceling externality warranted
joan martinez alier instance show bulk consumer automatically excluded impact upon price commodity consumer future generation born yet
assumption behind future discounting assume future good cheaper present good ha criticized david pearce recent stern report although stern report doe employ discounting ha criticized reason ecological economist clive spash
concerning externality like eco-businessman paul hawken argue orthodox economic line reason good produced unsustainably usually cheaper good produced sustainably due hidden subsidy paid non-monetized human environment community future generations
argument developed hawken amory hunter lovins promote vision environmental capitalist utopia natural capitalism creating next industrial revolution
contrast ecological economist like joan martinez-alier appeal different line reasoning
rather assuming new form capitalism best way forward older ecological economic critique question idea internalizing externality providing corrective current system
work karl william kapp explains concept externality misnomer
fact modern business enterprise operates basis shifting cost onto others normal practice make profits
charles eisenstein ha argued method privatising profit socialising cost externality passing cost community natural environment future generation inherently destructive
social ecological economist clive spash ha noted externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental social problem minor aberration otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system
internalizing odd externality doe nothing address structural systemic problem fails recognize pervasive nature supposed 'externalities'

ecological economics' work monetary theory policy traced frederick soddy's work money
field considers question growth imperative interest-bearing debt nature money alternative policy proposal alternative currency public banking
assigning monetary value natural resource biodiversity emergent ecosystem service often viewed key process influencing economic practice policy decision-making
idea becoming accepted among ecologist conservationist argue inherently false
mccauley argues ecological economics resulting ecosystem service based conservation harmful
undermined basic characteristic ecosystem act specifically favour single species

complexity eco-systems make challenging weigh value given species
wolf play critical role regulating prey population absence apex predator scottish highland ha caused population deer preventing afforestation increase risk flooding damage property
secondly allocating monetary value nature would make conservation reliant market fluctuate
case bee forest near former coffee plantation finca santa fe costa rica
pollination service valued u year soon study coffee price dropped field replanted pineapple
pineapple doe require bee pollinated value service dropped zero
thirdly conservation programme sake financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity invent replace ecosystem service artificial means
mccauley argues proposal deemed short lifespan history technology humanity developed artificial alternative nature's service time passing cost service tend decrease
lastly assumed conserving ecosystem always financially beneficial opposed alteration
