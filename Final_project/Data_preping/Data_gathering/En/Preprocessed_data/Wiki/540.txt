the senior wrangler is the top mathematics undergraduate at cambridge university in england a position which has been described as the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in britain
specifically it is the person who achieves the highest overall mark among the wranglers the students at cambridge who gain first class degrees in mathematics
the cambridge undergraduate mathematics course or mathematical tripos is famously difficult
many senior wranglers have become world leading figures in mathematics physics and other fields
they include george airy jacob bronowski christopher budd kevin buzzard arthur cayley donald coxeter arthur eddington ben green john herschel james inman j
littlewood lee hsien loong jayant narlikar morris pell john polkinghorne frank ramsey lord rayleigh john strutt george stokes isaac todhunter and sir gilbert walker
senior wranglers were once f ted with torchlit processions and took pride of place in the university s graduation ceremony
years in cambridge were often remembered by who had been senior wrangler that year
the annual ceremony in which the senior wrangler becomes known was first held in the th century
standing on the balcony of the university s senate house the examiner reads out the class results for mathematics and printed copies of the results are then thrown to the audience below
the examiner no longer announces the students exact rankings but they still identify the senior wrangler nowadays by tipping their academic hat when reading out the person s name
those who have achieved second place known as second wranglers include alfred marshall james clerk maxwell j
thomson lord kelvin william clifford and william whewell
those who have finished between third and th include karl pearson and william henry bragg third george green g
hardy and alfred north whitehead fourth adam sedgwick fifth john venn sixth bertrand russell nevil maskelyne and sir james timmins chance seventh thomas malthus ninth and john maynard keynes and william henry fox talbot th
between and the university publicly announced the ranking which was then reported in newspapers such as the times
the examination was considered to be by far the most important in britain and the empire
the prestige of being a high wrangler was great the respect accorded to the senior wrangler was immense
andrew warwick author of masters of theory describes the term senior wrangler as synonymous with academic supremacy
since successful students in the examinations have been told their rankings privately and not all senior wranglers have become publicly known as such
in recent years the custom of discretion regarding ranking has progressively vanished and all senior wranglers since have announced their identity publicly
the youngest person to be senior wrangler is probably arran fernandez who came top in aged years and months
the previous youngest was probably james wilkinson in aged years and nine months
the youngest up to were alfred flux in aged years and two months and peter tait in aged years and eight months
two individuals have placed first without becoming known as senior wrangler
one was the student philippa fawcett in
at that time although the university allowed women to take the examinations it did not allow them to be members of the university nor to receive degrees
therefore they could not be known as wranglers and were merely told how they had performed compared to the male candidates for example equal to the third wrangler or between the seventh and eighth wranglers
having gained the highest mark fawcett was declared to have finished above the senior wrangler
the other was the mathematics professor george p lya
as he had contributed to reforming the tripos with the aim that an excellent performance would be less dependent on solving hard problems and more so on showing a broad mathematical understanding and knowledge g h
hardy asked p lya to sit the examinations himself unofficially during his stay in england in
p lya did so and to hardy s surprise received the highest mark an achievement which had he been a student would have made him the senior wrangler
senior wrangler s walk is a path in cambridge the walk to and along which was considered to be sufficient constitutional exercise for a student aspiring to become the senior wrangler
the route was shorter than other walks such as wranglers walk and the grantchester grind undertaken by undergraduates whose aspirations were lower
senior wrangler sauce is a cambridge term for brandy butter a type of hard sauce made from brandy butter and sugar traditionally served in britain with christmas pudding and warm mince pies
senior wrangler is also the name of a solitaire card game alternatively known as mathematics and double calculation played with two decks of cards and involving elementary modular arithmetic

in catherine hall s the proof of love victor turner is listed as having been senior wrangler in
in george bernard shaw s play mrs
warren s profession the title character s daughter vivie is praised for tieing with the third wrangler and she comments that the mathematical tripos means grind grind grind for six to eight hours a day at mathematics and nothing but mathematics
in ford madox ford s parade s end the character christopher tietjens is described as having settled deliberately for only being second wrangler in order to avoid the weight of expectation that the title would create
in his discworld series of novels terry pratchett has a character called the senior wrangler a faculty member at the unseen university whose first name is horace
the compiler of crosswords for the leader in the s used senior wrangler as a pseudonym
the two most successful th century coaches of senior wranglers were william hopkins and edward routh
hopkins the senior wrangler maker who himself was the th wrangler coached senior wranglers
routh who had himself been the senior wrangler coached
another described by his student and senior wrangler j e
littlewood as the last of the great coaches was another senior wrangler robert alfred herman
during the top two colleges in terms of number of senior wranglers were trinity and st john s with and respectively
gonville and caius was third with
senior wranglers since also include
david hobson christ s college s
peter swinnerton dyer trinity college s
