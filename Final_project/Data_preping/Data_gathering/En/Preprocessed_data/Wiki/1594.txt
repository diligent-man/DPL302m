Lastly, there used to be a school in the village called 'The Dunbury School'
Unfortunately, the school closed its doors in 2011 and sat abandoned and empty for many years
It was originally going to be transferred into another primary school baring a different name but this never happened
Around 2013-2014, students at other Dunbury School bases decided ro chose a name for the new nursery which would be in the old Stickland base
The name chosen was 'Stickleberries'
The new nursery opened in the old school premises around 2015-2016 and currently holds an after school club for Dunbury School students
The nursery is also surrounded by the village green.
