the great fear french grande peur was a general panic that took place between july to august at the start of the french revolution
rural unrest had been present in france since the worsening grain shortage of the spring and fuelled by rumors of an aristocrats famine plot to starve or burn out the population both peasants and townspeople mobilized in many regions
in response to these rumors fearful peasants armed themselves in self defense and in some areas attacked manor houses
the content of the rumors differed from region to region in some areas it was believed that a foreign force was burning the crops in the fields while in other areas it was believed that robbers were burning buildings
fear of the peasant revolt was a contributing factor to the abolition of seignorialism in france through the august decrees
french historian georges lefebvre has demonstrated that the revolt in the countryside can be followed in remarkable detail
the revolt had both economic and political causes pre dating the events of the summer of
as lefebvre commented to get the peasant to rise and revolt there was no need of the french revolution as so many historians have suggested when the panic came he was already up and away
the rural unrest can be traced back to the spring of when a drought threatened the prospect of the coming harvest
harvests had in fact been poor since the massive laki eruption in iceland
storms and floods also destroyed much of the harvest during the summer leading to both a decrease in seigneurial dues and defaults on leases
frosts and snow damaged vines and ruined chestnut and olive groves in the south
vagrancy became a serious problem in the countryside and in some areas such as the franche comt in late peasants gathered to take collective action against the seigneurs
historian mary kilbourne matossian argued that one of the causes of the great fear was consumption of ergot a hallucinogenic fungus
in years of good harvests rye contaminated with ergot was discarded but when the harvest was poor the peasants could not afford to be so choosy
the panic began in the franche comt spread south along the rh ne valley to provence east towards the alps and west towards the centre of france
almost simultaneously a panic began in ruffec south of poitiers and travelled to the pyrenees toward berry and into the auvergne
the uprising coalesced into a general great fear as neighbouring villages mistook armed peasants for brigands
during the attacks by the peasants on the estates of the feudal nobility and convent estates their main objective was reported to have been finding and destroying the documents of the feudal privileges granting the feudal lords their feudal privileges over the peasantry and burn them
in some cases the manor houses were burned along with the documents
hundreds of manor houses are reported to have been burned this way but they belonged to the minority and there was no indiscriminate pillaging
in most cases the peasants simply left when the letters of feudal privileges had been destroyed
the members of the feudal aristocracy were forced to leave or fled on their own initiative some aristocrats were captured and among them there were reports of mistreatment such as beatings and humiliation but there are only three confirmed cases of a landlord actually having been killed during the uprising
although the great fear is usually associated with the peasantry all the uprisings tended to involve all sectors of the local community including some elite participants such as artisans or well to do farmers
often the bourgeoisie had as much to gain from the destruction of the feudal regime as did the poorer peasantry
although the main phase of the great fear died out by august peasant uprisings continued well into leaving few areas of france primarily alsace lorraine and brittany untouched
as a result of the great fear the national assembly in an effort to appease the peasants and forestall further rural disorders on august formally abolished the feudal regime including seigneurial rights
this led in effect to a general unrest among the nobility of france
peasant revolt was clearly not a phenomenon new to late eighteenth century france the fourteenth century saw the jacquerie in the oise valley and the seventeenth century saw the croquant rebellions
yves marie berc in history of the peasant revolts concludes peasant revolts of the years to had much in common with their seventeenth century counterparts unanimity of the rural community rejection of new taxation to which they were unaccustomed defiance of enemy townsmen and a belief that there would be a general remission in taxes particularly when the king decided to convene the estates general
in spite of all that is suggested by the political history of the period the peasant disturbances at the beginning of the french revolution did not depart from the typical community revolt of the preceding century
the usual cause of communal violence was an assault launched from outside upon the community as a whole whether that outsider be those profiting from unfairly high bread prices marauding bandits witches or magistrates abusing power
this statement about sixteenth and seventeenth century uprisings appears at first to apply equally to the great fear of
however one distinctive aspect of the latter was fear of an ambiguous outsider at the outset of the disturbance
whether the brigands were english piedmontese or merely vagabonds was not easily determined and when the great fear had spread to its largest expanse it was a system feudalism rather than a specific person or group at which its animosity was directed
earlier revolts had not been subversive but rather looked to a golden age that participants wished to see reinstated the socio political system was implicitly validated by a critique of recent changes in favour of tradition and custom
the cahiers des dol ances had opened the door to the people s opinion directly affecting circumstances and policy and the great fear evidenced this change
the most glaring difference between the great fear of and previous peasant revolts was its scope
spreading from a half dozen or so separate nuclei across the countryside almost all of france found itself in rural uproar
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries revolt was almost always contained within the borders of a single province
this change in magnitude reflects to what extent social discontent was with the entire governmental system and its ineffectiveness rather than with anything particular to a locality
while as tackett argues the specific manifestation of the fear of brigands who they were and what they were most likely to attack may have been contingent upon local contexts the fact that the brigands were perceived as a genuine threat to the peasants across the country in a wide variety of local contexts speaks to a more systemic disorder
comparing the peasant revolts of the tard avis s with the great fear of reveals some key similarities and differences
from in limousin and p rigord groups of peasants rose up against the armed forces that occupied the countryside and raised funds by levying taxes and ransom
in a series of assemblies the croquants as they were pejoratively called worked on a military plan for action and successfully expelled the garrisons from their lands
the letters between these assemblies justified their armed resistance as opposition to unjust claims on their property
when the chaotic political situation was stabilized with the coronation of henry iv the revolts ended and the peasants were eventually accorded the tax rebate they had demanded earlier
the tard avis s had specific goals and achieved them the same cannot be said of the participants in the great fear
the great fear of broke with another pattern typical of peasant revolts in earlier centuries
the panic lasted for more than a few weeks and took place during the most labour intensive months
communal violence was but one tactic of many for opposing an enemy and the peasants of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries drawing on a heritage of communal justice might rise up to prevent enclosement of a communal grazing space like a marsh to demand lower bread prices or to evade their taxes
during the reign of louis xiv however popular revolt became an ever less viable option for reform as the state both became better able to respond to insurgency and also addressed many of the issues at the heart of peasant revolt
reforms in the military structure prevented french soldiers from plundering french soil and armed conflict with other powers were not fought at home
thus the threat of roaming bandits was a particularly poignant one it evoked an era of lawlessness which the french monarchy had successfully countered in previous years
there was much in common between the peasantry in the great fear of and the peasants of the revolts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but they were neither unmalleable nor unchanged by the experience of bourbon rule and its subsequent dissolution
without the monarchy or a replacement government to administer and protect the people the harvest and with it life itself was in grave danger
