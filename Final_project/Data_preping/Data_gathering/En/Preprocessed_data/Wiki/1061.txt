since adherent believe lord one father lord's prayer directed lord only
opening father art heaven hallowed thy name name everything god worshiped particularly son approached
according new testament jesus sometimes prayed father declared one father times

union faith charity central tenet new church substantial thing related divine love divine wisdom understanding person receptacle god's love wisdom
according new church adherent person must learn live truth union humanity lord faith becomes living spiritual
first act faith repentance self-examination acknowledging one's sin turning away evil
new church ha three pillar god's divinity holiness bible life good works
bible divinely inspired according adherent spiritual sense ha revealed new church symbolic correspondence
literal meaning similar parable hide inner spiritual sense truth sense letter word part naked truth appearance truth like similitude comparison taken thing nature thus accommodated adapted capacity simple also children
bible cannot properly understood without doctrine church doctrine confirmed it
bible contains divine truth according new church adherent person join god angel reading it
new church ha two primary sacrament baptism eucharist also known communion holy supper
baptism signifies entrance christianity reformation mind falseness replaced truth
although believer baptised age reason make decision follow jesus swedenborg said baptised infant receive guardian angel guide christian faith
marriage personal sacrament new church administration priest desirable essential

spirit angel one approach heaven hell depending one's action associated person life
although communication spirit human doe generally occur wa widespread ancient times
angel spirit retain memory mental state communication open person may experience spirit's memory own
mental state may achieved hypnosis resembles past life regression wa ancient came believe preexistence soul reincarnation
however true one life one life life determines one's eternal destiny
death soul shed physical body becomes aware spiritual society one's soul wa associated
new church adherent believe purgatory punishment occurs hell
immediately death one enters spirit world intermediate state awaits judgment whether enter heaven hell
since evil try appear good good retain false idea one remains intermediate state examined
good know truth go immediately heaven evil go hell
otherwise one gradually withdraws exterior appearance fallacy one's interior intention affection spirit world
process complete one act complete freedom without exterior restraint person's character open manifest
thus hidden thing laid open secret thing uncovered according lord's word 'there nothing covered shall revealed hid shall known whatsoever ye said darkness shall heard light ye spoken ear closet shall preached housetops' luke xii
another place 'i say unto every idle word men shall speak shall give account thereof day judgment' matt
external restraint removed spirit world nothing remains stop evil spirit except punishment
since evil spirit act accordance nature drawn towards hell
every evil brings punishment two making one whoever therefore evil also punishment evil
still one world suffers punishment account evil done world account evil does
yet amount thing whether said men suffer punishment account evil world suffer punishment account evil life inasmuch every one death return life thus similar evil nature remaining life body
exhortation longer avail neither instruction fear law loss reputation since every one act nature cannot restrained broken except punishment new church adherent believe god sends one heaven hell since hell internal state evil heaven internal state good person enters state
every spirit join like-minded group death feel comfortable according swedenborg hell believed place happiness spirit delight evilness
new church adherent believe heaven proceeds god seen angel light heaven occasionally appears angelic form
jesus said wa light world apostle saw face shining like sun
heaven countless society fulfill particular purpose according love
individual devil satan whole heaven one angel wa created beginning hell devil wa created angel light cast heaven hell human race heaven lived world heavenly love faith hell lived infernal love faith hell taken whole called devil satan
new church adherent believe free choose good evil originates one's spiritual equilibrium heaven hell
spiritual equilibrium free human think rationally lead spiritual reform acknowledging evil oneself ceasing evil avoiding it
choice spiritual every thought action influence soul mind
good work join person angel evil join evil spirits
reform salvation possible divine truth fight evil falseness
truth accepted one ha evil desire temptation conflict results
although one must resist temptation really combat god devil hell
good considered good evil removed must done love god profit honour
good come god conquer temptation continuous lifelong process
jesus came save humanity spiritual equilibrium heaven hell become unbalanced people began choose evil threatening entire human race
taking human form god could fight hell directly jesus experienced temptation
belief passion cross wa redemption fundamental error church error together error concerning three divine person eternity ha perverted whole church nothing spiritual left crucifixion wa last temptation endured jesus
new church adherent believe word god bible ha symbolic hidden spiritual meaning
swedenborg's vision told bible divinely inspired described multi-volume arcanum coelestia heavenly secrets
called symbolic language passage follow coherently logically correspondence
inner meaning wa kept hidden wa revealed humanity wa ready
hidden meaning distinguishes bible book swedenborg support statement biblical passages
book inner spiritual meaning form new church biblical canon
according swedenborg original text old testament preserved hebrew masoretic text letter counted masorete ensure text remained accurate
like judaism doe divide old testament three part law moses prophet psalms
old testament book internal spiritual sense thus divinely inspired include
psalmsswedenborg's grouping differs judaism's assigned joshua judge samuel king law moses according jewish biblical canon law moses torah refers first five booksjoshua judge samuel king belong prophet nevi'im
elsewhere however swedenborg say moses elijah represent law prophet respectively
book old testament generally believed divinely inspired include grouped jew writing ketuvim
greek septuagint incorporated writing hebrew text martin luther removed placed apocrypha
although jew included lamentation daniel psalm ketuvim new church adherent consider divinely inspired
new church regard word jesus divinely inspired considers new testament gospel matthew mark luke john book revelation sacred scripture
church hold act apostle epistle esteem similar jewish regard old testament writings
swedenborg wrote book included act divine providence since book general public explaining christian doctrine needed
believed although paul's letter contain word-for-word symbolic correspondence still divinely influenced paul indeed spoke inspiration way prophet every single word wa dictated inspiration wa received influx according thing quite different inspiration ha conjunction heaven correspondences
swedenborg believed sacred text ancient church middle east preceded judaism text lost
another work swedenborg believed belonged ancient church wa book jasher also quoted bible josh
hebrew midrash sefer hayashar wa published venice english translation wa published in
hebrew text wa examined -century biblical scholar george bush relative bush family later became swedenborgian minister
although new church ha official position hebrew text swedenborg said first part genesis taken ancient word found book jasher
doctrine new church review ass doctrine earlier churches
swedenborg believed new church received doctrine older church must exposed rejected new church opposed doctrine older christian church cannot coexist
new church authority based divine revelation rather creed church councils
interpretation scripture determined doctrine however enlightenment god sought reading words
apostles' creed creed apostolic church doe refer trinity believe god father almighty creator heaven earth jesus christ son lord wa conceived holy spirit born virgin mary also holy spirit creed agreement new church since doe mention eternally-existing son
nicene creed modified version apostles' creed according new church trinity person trinity gods
creed also introduces concept son begotten eternity new church considers erroneous human god sent world son god
new church considers athanasian creed like nicene incorrect defining trinity persons
however church belief athanasian creed corrected trinity one person god understood speaks trinity persons
creed express church's doctrine divine human lord jesus christ son god god man although god man still two one christ
one divine took human yea altogether one one person since soul body make one man god man one christ according new church god's human nature wa made divine
council chalcedon declared jesus ha two nature divine human contradicts new church doctrine
swedenborg said wa revealed heavenly vision greatest influence council superior rest rank authority came together dark room concluded divine human nature attributed lord principally reason otherwise papal sway could maintained
acknowledged lord one father say one could recognized vicar earth schism arising time papal power might fallen dissipated made distinction
give decision strength sought confirmation word persuaded rest although church maintain jesus ha two nature new church belief human nature wa made divine
considered heretical new church belief divine human mean humanity saved since heaven presence christian deny jesus' divinity go hell
according new church revelation many christian socinian heart deny jesus divine derives trinitarian doctrine dividing christ two nature calling jesus merely son mary
new church considers partial introductory revelation islam worship one god teach one live well shun evil teach jesus wa great prophet son virgin mary son god christianity
church belief islam religion adapted society practice polygamy
since polygamy opposite love monogamous marriage marriage husband wife corresponds marriage god church spiritual matter revealed islam
regarded differently socinianism arianism christian profane holy distorting scripture non-christians muslim cannot
new church belief muslim may enter heaven reject polygamy learn true nature god
according swedenborgianism catholic church ha perverted scripture obtain primacy dominion spiritual matters
council chalcedon declared jesus ha divine human nature pope could claim vicar christ appropriate spiritual power priesthood belong god alone
desire spiritually rule others appear pious honour reputation originates self-love opposite love god others
papal primacy claimed catholic church interpretation matthew apostle peter appointed rock church built given key heaven
new church passage understood spiritually rock signifies truth jesus god peter signifies faith god key kingdom heaven signify faith allows one enter heaven
divine providence gave catholic church spiritual dominion since helped spread gospel prevented christian church destroyed arianism socinianism
catholic read scripture worship externally prevent scripture profaned
new church adherent believe catholic avoided idolatry worshiped god alone done good work receive spiritual truth scripture easily
although protestant church broken away catholic church rejected many tradition basic theology remains same
catholic protestant agree belief trinity original sin justification faith main difference protestant believe faith alone save without act charity
reformer separated faith charity separate completely catholic church
new church good work must done acknowledgment good originates god self
protestant separation faith good work derived epistle paul apostle saying humanity justified faith without work law romans
new church adherent consider false interpretation work law paul meant external ritual mosaic law ten commandment act charity
person acquires nature according work must repent sin refusing evil
faith former church repentance remission sin renewal regeneration sanctification salvation follow faith given imputed without thing man mingled joined faith new church teach repentance reformation regeneration thus remission sin man's cooperation
faith former church teach imputation christ's merit imputation embraced faith given faith new church teach imputation good evil time faith imputation according sacred scripture contrary protestant church including new church withdrawn doctrine faith alone word read lord worshipped hence greatest

ego triumphed great thinker retreated swedenborg new revelations
however one factor must never forgotten statement new testament criterion measuring subsequent revelation whatever found contrary must always ha rejected christian church
christian emphasise distinguishing evil spirit angel angel must glorify jesus teaching must based scripture
new church adherent say swedenborg would agree since said evil spirit utter name jesus signifies salvation spiritual world speak think
unlike many spiritualist swedenborg praise jesus god heaven earth doctrine derived scriptural references
according swedenborg none teaching originated angel spirit spiritual world wa revealed humanity would know life death
