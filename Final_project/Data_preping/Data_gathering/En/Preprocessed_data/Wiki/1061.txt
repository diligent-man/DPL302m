the new church or swedenborgianism is any of several historically related christian denominations that developed as a new religious group influenced by the writings of scientist and mystic emanuel swedenborg
swedenborgian organisations acknowledge what they believe to be the universal nature of god s church all who do good in accordance with the truth of their religion will be accepted into heaven since god is goodness itself and doing good joins one with god
swedenborg published some of his theological works anonymously his writings promoted one universal church based on love and charity rather than multiple churches named after their founders and based on belief or doctrine
although swedenborg spoke in his works about a new church that would be based on theology he never tried to establish such an organisation
in a heresy trial began in sweden against swedenborg s writings and two men who promoted them the trial questioned whether swedenborg s theological writings were consistent with christian doctrine
a royal ordinance in declared that his writings were clearly mistaken and should not be taught but his theology was never examined
swedenborg s clerical supporters were ordered to stop using his teachings and customs officials were directed to impound his books and stop their circulation in any district unless the nearest consistory granted permission
swedenborg begged the king for grace and protection in a letter from amsterdam a new investigation of him stalled and was dropped in
at the time of swedenborg s death few efforts had been made to establish an organised church
on may however years after his death the new church movement was founded in england where swedenborg had often visited and where he died
a number of churches had sprung up around england by and in april of that year the first general conference of the new church was held in great eastcheap london
new church ideas were brought to the united states by missionaries one of whom was john chapman johnny appleseed
early missionaries also travelled to parts of africa
swedenborg believed that the african race was in greater enlightenment than others on this earth since they are such that they think more interiorly and so receive truths and acknowledge them african enlightenment was considered a liberal concept at the time and swedenborgians accepted freed african converts in their homes as early as
several swedenborgians were also abolitionists
occultism became increasingly popular during the th century particularly in france and england and some followers blended swedenborg s writings with theosophy cabala alchemy and divination
swedenborg s mystical side fascinated them they concentrated on heaven and hell which describes swedenborg s visits to heaven and hell to experience and report on the conditions there
in structure it was related to dante s divine comedy
the u s
church was organised in with the founding of the general convention of the new church sometimes shortened to the convention now also known as the swedenborgian church of north america
the movement in the united states strengthened until the late th century and there was a new church theology school in cambridge
controversies about doctrine and the authority of swedenborg s writings caused a faction to split off and form the academy of the new church
it later became known as the general church of the new jerusalem sometimes called the general church with its headquarters in bryn athyn pennsylvania a suburb of philadelphia
other congregations felt doctrinally compelled to join the general church at its inception
two convention congregations in canada one in toronto and another in kitchener and two congregations from the british conference michael church in london and colchester new church joined the general church
in the most recent membership figures for the four church organisations were
general conference of the new church great britain
swedenborgian church of north america also known as the general convention usa
general church of the new jerusalem
the lord s new church which is nova hierosolyma membership in the new church has always been small and the organisations have been deeply involved in publishing
the new church has two essential doctrines
the first is that there is one god jehovah who incarnated as jesus so that he may redeem mankind
the second is the obligation to live according to his commandments
there are two essentials which constitute the church and hence two principal things of doctrine one that the lord s human is divine the other that love to the lord and charity toward the neighbor constitute the church and not faith separate from love and charity these two things the acknowledgment of the lord and a life according to the precepts of the decalogue
are the two essentials of the new church
adherents believe that these two doctrines bring about salvation and union with jesus
all things of the doctrine of the new church have reference to these two because they are its universals on which all the particulars depend and are its essentials from which all the formalities proceed if a person is unaware of the doctrines but has believed in one god and lived a good life according to swedenborg they will learn them from angels after death
swedenborg argued that the trinity was not three persons the father son and holy spirit but one the father being the originating divine being itself the son the human embodiment of that divine soul and the holy spirit the outflowing activity of jesus or the divine human
he wrote that the doctrine of a three person trinity originated during the fourth century with the adoption of the nicene creed to combat arianism but it was unknown to the apostolic church indicated by the apostles creed which he believed preceded the nicene creed
the new church s universal principle of faith is that the lord from eternity who is jehovah came into the world to subjugate the hells and to glorify his human and without this no mortal could have been saved and those are saved who believe in him it is a universal principle of faith that god is one in essence and in person in whom is a divine trinity and that he is the lord god the savior jesus christ
it is a universal principle of faith that no mortal could have been saved unless the lord had come into the world
it is a universal principle of faith that he came into the world to remove hell from man and that he did remove it by means of contests with it and victories over it and thereby he subdued it and reduced it to order and made it obedient to himself
it is a universal principle of faith that he came into the world to glorify his human which he took on in the world that is to unite it with the divine from which are all things and thereby he eternally holds hell in order and under obedience to himself
as this could be accomplished only by means of temptations admitted into his human even to the last of them which was the passion of the cross he endured even that
from this doctrine the trinity is defined as the three essentials of one god and they make one as soul body and operation make one in man
before the world was created this trinity was not but after creation when god became incarnate it was provided and brought about and then in the lord god the redeemer and savior jesus christ as a trinity of body soul and spirit exists in every man this became the holy trinity in jesus
the doctrine of one god as one person distinguishes the new church from other christian churches most of which define the trinity as three eternal persons
the new church sees trinitarianism as illogical in the ideas of thought a trinity of divine persons from eternity or before the world was created is a trinity of gods and these ideas cannot be effaced by a lip confession of one god
monotheism is defined as one god who is one person only the lord jehovah is worshiped
worship of and faith in jesus is not worshiping a created being although he was born with a human body his soul was eternally divine
when he rose from the dead he discarded the human body he inherited from mary and put on a human body from the divinity within him known in the new church as the divine human
according to swedenborg god the father is the inner divinity which became outwardly manifest in human form known as the son
since adherents believe that the lord is one with the father the lord s prayer is directed to the lord only
in the opening our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name name is everything by which god is worshiped particularly the son through whom he is approached
according to the new testament jesus sometimes prayed to the father and declared himself one with the father at other times
new church adherents believe that this was because jesus progressed towards god during his life by gradually making his human body one with the divine
new church adherents believe that faith in jesus brings salvation
faith in jesus is faith in a visible god
jesus is the image and form of the invisible god on whom the human mind can focus
according to the new church god is man himself
if a person is good and follows the truth god lives in that person who becomes an image and likeness of him
the new church is said to be the crown of all churches which preceded it since the invisible god is worshiped in human form
the sum of faith is that he who lives well and believes is saved
faith is not mere belief
faith without charity is not faith and charity without faith is not charity faith and charity are intertwined
faith and charity become one in acts of good works or repentance
the union of faith and charity is a central tenet of the new church all substantial things are related to divine love and divine wisdom and the will and understanding of each person is a receptacle of god s love and wisdom
according to new church adherents a person must learn and live by the truth in the union between humanity and the lord faith becomes living and spiritual
all the precepts of how one should live are contained in the ten commandments
the first act of faith is repentance self examination acknowledging one s sins and turning away from evil
the bible concerns god and his kingdom
the new church has three pillars god s divinity the holiness of the bible and a life of good works
the bible is divinely inspired according to adherents its spiritual sense has been revealed in the new church through symbolic correspondence
its literal meaning similar to a parable hides the inner spiritual sense the truths of the sense of the letter of the word are in part not naked truths but are appearances of truth and like similitudes and comparisons are taken from such things as are in nature and thus are such as have been accommodated and adapted to the capacity of the simple and also of children
the bible cannot be properly understood without doctrine and church doctrine should be confirmed with it
doctrine can only be known by those who are enlightened by god and those who are not can fall into heresy
the bible contains divine truth according to new church adherents a person joins god and his angels when reading it
the new church has two primary sacraments baptism and the eucharist also known as communion or holy supper
these external rituals symbolise inner spiritual life
baptism signifies entrance into christianity and reformation of the mind where falseness is replaced by truth
although believers should be baptised at the age of reason to make a decision to follow jesus swedenborg said that baptised infants receive a guardian angel to guide them into the christian faith
marriage is a personal sacrament of the new church and its administration by a priest is desirable but not essential
according to swedenborg marriage should be administered by a priest because marriages considered in themselves are spiritual and thence holy for they descend from the heavenly marriage of good and truth and things conjugial correspond to the divine marriage of the lord and the church and hence they are from the lord himself
married love is founded in religion since both originate from god
without a religious foundation a marriage can turn cold
according to the new church man is a form of truth and woman is a form of love the two make one
married love comes directly from heaven and celibacy interferes with this
therefore marriage is preferable to celibacy
marriage is considered a union of souls and this can only exist between one man and one woman
contrary to mainstream christian beliefs swedenborg did not condemn all sexual activity between those who were not married
while he was particularly against infidelity swedenborg believed that all erotic love even that which arose within unpropitious circumstances still had the potential to develop into true conjugial love
he also believed that not all married couples necessarily experience conjugial love
new church adherents believe that there was no space and time before the universe was created and the realm with no space and time is the spiritual world
the spiritual world which is divided between heaven and hell is where the soul is realised
all who die and become angels put off those two things proper to nature which
are space and time for they enter then into spiritual light in which the objects of thought are truths and the objects of sight are similar to the objects in the natural world but correspondent to their thoughts states of being replace time and love replaces space or distance
new church adherents believe that the soul is the recipient of life from god and the body is its clothing
the beginning of life the soul comes from the seed of the father and the external body comes from the mother
since most christians believe that jesus was born of a virgin by the holy spirit his soul was god itself and he always preexisted as jehovah
since souls originate from the seed of the father new church adherents do not believe in reincarnation
spirits and angels through whom one approaches heaven or hell depending on one s actions are associated with a person during their life
although communication between spirits and humans does not generally occur it was more widespread in ancient times
angels and spirits retain their memories and in a mental state where communication is open a person may experience a spirit s memory as if it were their own
this mental state which may be achieved under hypnosis resembles past life regression and was how some ancients came to believe in the preexistence of souls and reincarnation
however this is not true one lives only once and how one lives this life determines one s eternal destiny
at death the soul sheds the physical body and becomes aware of the spiritual society with which one s soul was associated
new church adherents do not believe in purgatory punishment occurs only in hell
immediately after death one enters the spirit world an intermediate state and awaits judgment of whether they will enter heaven or hell
since the evil try to appear good and the good retain false ideas one remains in this intermediate state until they are examined
those who are good and know the truth go immediately to heaven and those who are evil go to hell
otherwise one gradually withdraws from exterior appearances and fallacies into one s interior intentions and affections in the spirit world
this process is complete when one acts in complete freedom without exterior restraint and a person s character is open and manifest
thus hidden things are laid open and secret things are uncovered according to the lord s words there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light and what ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be preached on the housetops luke xii
and in another place i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matt
when all external restraints are removed in the spirit world nothing remains to stop evil spirits except punishment
since evil spirits act in accordance with their nature they are drawn towards hell
every evil brings with itself punishment the two making one whoever therefore is in evil is also in the punishment of evil
but still no one in the other world suffers punishment on account of the evils which he had done in this world but on account of the evils which he then does
yet it amounts to the same and is the same thing whether it be said that men suffer punishment on account of their evils in the world or that they suffer punishment on account of the evils which they do in the other life inasmuch as every one after death returns into his own life and thus into similar evils his nature remaining the same as it had been in the life of the body
that they are punished is because the fear of punishment is the only means of subduing evils in this state
exhortation is no longer of any avail neither instruction nor the fear of the law and loss of reputation since every one now acts from his nature which cannot be restrained nor broken except by punishments new church adherents believe that god sends no one to heaven or hell since hell is the internal state of evil and heaven the internal state of good each person enters a state matching his or her internal nature
because every spirit joins the like minded group after death in which it feels the most comfortable according to swedenborg hell is believed to be a place of happiness for the spirits which delight in evilness
each person will remain eternally in accordance with his will or love
new church adherents believe that heaven proceeds from god who is seen by the angels as the light of heaven and occasionally appears in angelic form
jesus said that he was the light of the world and the apostles once saw his face shining like a sun
for this reason the ancients aligned their temples with the rising sun
in heaven countless societies fulfill a particular purpose each according to their love
since angels and demons were human angels have a human form
there is no individual devil or satan in the whole heaven there is not one angel who was so created from the beginning nor in hell any devil who was created an angel of light and cast down but that all both in heaven and in hell are from the human race in heaven those who lived in the world in heavenly love and faith in hell those who lived in infernal love and faith and that hell taken as a whole is what is called the devil and satan
new church adherents believe that the free will to choose between good and evil originates from one s spiritual equilibrium between heaven and hell
hell influences humans to do evil and heaven influences them to do good
this spiritual equilibrium frees humans to think rationally which can lead to spiritual reform by acknowledging evil in oneself ceasing to do evil and avoiding it
this choice is spiritual because every thought and action influences the soul and mind
good works join a person with angels and evil joins them with evil spirits
reform and salvation are possible with divine truth which fights evil and falseness
when the truth is accepted and one has an evil desire temptation conflict results
although one must resist temptation it is really a combat between god and the devil or hell
thus he who thinks that he fights from himself against the devil is enormously deceived
salvation or condemnation is a result of moral choices based on intentions
good is only considered good when evil is removed and must be done out of love for god not for profit or honour
good comes only from god who can conquer temptation a continuous lifelong process
jesus came to save humanity because the spiritual equilibrium between heaven and hell had become unbalanced more people began to choose evil threatening the entire human race
by taking human form god could fight hell directly jesus experienced temptation
remission of sins is their removal after repentance
the new church differs from older christian churches on this point
the belief that the passion of the cross was redemption itself is a fundamental error of the church and that error together with the error concerning three divine persons from eternity has perverted the whole church so that nothing spiritual is left in it the crucifixion was the last temptation endured by jesus
new church adherents believe that the word of god is in the bible which has a symbolic hidden spiritual meaning
swedenborg s visions told him how and why the bible is divinely inspired and are described in his multi volume arcana coelestia heavenly secrets
he called its symbolic language where passages follow each other coherently and logically correspondence
this inner meaning was kept hidden and was revealed when humanity was ready
this hidden meaning distinguishes the bible from other books and swedenborg supports his statements with biblical passages
the books with this inner spiritual meaning forms the new church biblical canon
according to swedenborg the original text of the old testament is preserved in the hebrew masoretic text where letters were counted by the masoretes to ensure that the text remained accurate
like judaism does he divides the old testament into three parts the law of moses the prophets and the psalms
the old testament books with an internal spiritual sense and thus divinely inspired include
the law of moses
genesis
exodus
leviticus
numbers
deuteronomy
joshua
judges
samuel
kings
the prophets
isaiah
jeremiah
lamentations
ezekiel
daniel
hosea
obadiah
jonah
micah
nahum
habakkuk
zephaniah
haggai
zechariah
malachi
the psalmsswedenborg s grouping differs from judaism s he assigned joshua judges samuel and kings to the law of moses but according to the jewish biblical canon the law of moses the torah refers to the first five books joshua judges samuel and kings belong to the prophets nevi im
elsewhere however swedenborg says that moses and elijah represent the law and the prophets respectively
the other books of the old testament which are not generally believed to be divinely inspired include those grouped by the jews as writings ketuvim
the greek septuagint incorporated other writings into the hebrew texts which martin luther removed and placed in the apocrypha
although the jews included lamentations daniel and the psalms in the ketuvim new church adherents consider them divinely inspired
the new church regards the words of jesus as divinely inspired and considers the new testament gospels of matthew mark luke john and the book of revelation as sacred scripture
the church holds the acts of the apostles and the epistles in esteem similar to the jewish regard for the old testament writings
swedenborg wrote that these books were included as an act of divine providence since books for the general public explaining christian doctrine were needed
he believed that although paul s letters did not contain a word for word symbolic correspondence they were still divinely influenced paul indeed spoke from inspiration but not in the same way as the prophets to whom every single word was dictated but that his inspiration was that he received an influx according to those things which were with him which is quite a different inspiration and has no conjunction with heaven by correspondences
swedenborg believed that sacred texts of an ancient church in the middle east preceded judaism but the texts have been lost
some such as the wars of jehovah num
and another book similar to those in the prophets num
are quoted in the bible
another work that swedenborg believed belonged to the ancient church was the book of jasher which is also quoted in the bible josh
according to him this book still existed in tartary
a hebrew midrash sefer hayashar was published in venice in an english translation was published in
the hebrew text was examined by the th century biblical scholar george bush a relative of the bush family who later became a swedenborgian minister
although the new church has no official position on this hebrew text swedenborg said that the first parts of genesis were taken from the ancient word and are found in the book of jasher
the doctrines of the new church review and assess the doctrines of earlier churches
swedenborg believed that before the new church can be received the doctrines of older churches must be exposed and rejected the new church is so opposed to the doctrines of the older christian churches that they cannot coexist
in the new church authority is based on divine revelation rather than creeds or church councils
all doctrine should be confirmed by scripture
the interpretation of scripture is determined by doctrine however and enlightenment by god should be sought when reading his words
the apostles creed the creed of the apostolic church does not refer to a trinity i believe in god the father almighty creator of heaven and earth and in jesus christ his only son our lord who was conceived by the holy spirit born of the virgin mary also in the holy spirit this creed is in agreement with the new church since it does not mention an eternally existing son
the nicene and athanasian creeds introduced the trinity
the nicene creed is a modified version of the apostles creed according to the new church a trinity of persons is a trinity of gods
the creed also introduces the concept of a son begotten from eternity which the new church considers erroneous the human by which god sent himself into the world is the son of god
the new church considers the athanasian creed like the nicene incorrect in defining a trinity of persons
however the church believes that the athanasian creed can be corrected if a trinity of one person in god is understood when it speaks of a trinity of persons
the creed expresses the church s doctrine of the divine human that our lord jesus christ the son of god is both god and man and although he is god and man still there are not two but there is one christ
he is one because the divine took to itself the human yea he is altogether one for he is one person since as the soul and the body make one man so god and man is one christ according to the new church god s human nature was made divine
the council of chalcedon declared that jesus has two natures divine and human which contradicts new church doctrine
swedenborg said that it was revealed to him in a heavenly vision that those who had the greatest influence in the council and who were superior to the rest in rank and authority came together in a dark room and there concluded that both a divine and a human nature should be attributed to the lord principally for the reason that otherwise the papal sway could not be maintained
for if they had acknowledged the lord to be one with the father as he himself says no one could have been recognized as his vicar on earth and schisms were arising at that time by which the papal power might have fallen and been dissipated if they had not made this distinction
then to give their decision strength they sought out confirmations from the word and persuaded the rest although most other churches maintain that jesus has two natures the new church believes that his human nature was made divine
in socinianism jesus divinity is denied
arianism is similar believing that jesus was a created being
both are considered heretical by the new church which believes that the divine human is the means by which humanity is saved since all those who are in heaven are in his presence christians who deny jesus divinity go to hell
however this does not apply to those who have been born and lived outside christianity
according to new church revelation many christians are socinian at heart and deny that jesus is divine this derives from a trinitarian doctrine from dividing christ into two natures and from calling jesus merely the son of mary
islam was established by divine providence to eliminate idolatry
the new church considers it a partial or introductory revelation islam worships one god teaches one to live well and shun evil and teaches that jesus was a great prophet and the son of the virgin mary but not the son of god as in christianity
the quran contains teachings from sacred scripture
the church believes that islam is a religion adapted to societies that practice polygamy
since polygamy is an opposite love from monogamous marriage and a marriage between a husband and wife corresponds to the marriage of god and the church spiritual matters were not revealed in islam
it is regarded differently from socinianism or arianism because only christians can profane what is holy by distorting scripture non christians such as muslims cannot
muslims oppose any trinitarian christian church
the new church believes that muslims may enter heaven but only those who reject polygamy can learn the true nature of god
according to swedenborgianism the catholic church has perverted scripture to obtain primacy and dominion in spiritual matters
the council of chalcedon declared that jesus has a divine and human nature so that the pope could claim to be the vicar of christ and appropriate spiritual powers to the priesthood that belong to god alone
authority is claimed by the pope and the priesthood over that of scripture
the desire to spiritually rule others or appear pious for honour and reputation originates from self love which is opposite the love of god and others
papal primacy is claimed by the catholic church from an interpretation of matthew where the apostle peter is appointed the rock on which the church will be built and given the keys to heaven
in the new church this passage is understood spiritually the rock signifies the truth that jesus is god peter signifies faith in god and the keys of the kingdom of heaven signify the faith that allows one to enter heaven
divine providence gave the catholic church spiritual dominion since it helped spread the gospel and prevented the christian church from being destroyed by arianism or socinianism
catholics who do not read scripture worship externally only to prevent the scriptures from being profaned
new church adherents believe that catholics who have avoided idolatry worshiped god alone and done good works can receive spiritual truth from scripture more easily
although the protestant churches have broken away from the catholic church and rejected many of its traditions their basic theology remains the same
catholics and protestants agree on the belief in the trinity original sin and justification by faith the main difference is that the protestants believe that faith alone saves without acts of charity
the reformers separated faith from charity to separate completely from the catholic church
in the new church good works must be done with the acknowledgment that good originates from god and not from self
the protestant separation of faith and good works is derived from an epistle by paul the apostle saying that humanity is justified by faith without works of the law romans
new church adherents consider this is a false interpretation for by works of the law paul meant the external rituals of mosaic law not the ten commandments or acts of charity
there is no instantaneous salvation by paying lip service to a belief in christ
a person acquires a nature according to their works and must repent for their sins by refusing to do evil
the faith of the former church is that repentance remission of sins renewal regeneration sanctification and salvation follow of themselves the faith that is given and imputed without any thing of man being mingled or joined with them but the faith of the new church teaches repentance reformation regeneration and thus remission of sins with man s cooperation
the faith of the former church teaches the imputation of christ s merit and the imputation embraced in the faith that is given but the faith of the new church teaches the imputation of good and evil and at the same time of faith and that this imputation is according to the sacred scripture while the other is contrary to it some protestant churches including the new church have withdrawn from the doctrine of faith alone the word is read by them and the lord is worshipped and hence with them there is the greatest light and spiritual light which is from the lord as the sun which in its essence is divine love proceeds and extends itself in every direction and enlightens even those who are in the circumferences round about and opens the faculty of understanding truths so far as they can receive them in accordance with their religion
new church adherents do not believe in an end of the world
the church has passed through several ages each ending with a spiritual last judgement the last of these occurred in
judgments also occurred at the time of noah s flood and jesus crucifixion
the purpose of the judgments is to separate good from evil in the intermediate spiritual world lying between heaven and hell
as a result of the judgments a new age or new church begins among the people on earth
the new church is a result of revelation
four churches have preceded the new church
the first was the most ancient church before the flood when contact with heaven was direct
the second was the ancient church following the flood which was destroyed by idolatry
the third was judaism which began with the revelation of the ten commandments to moses on mount sinai
the fourth was christianity established by jesus and his apostles which divided into the eastern orthodox church the catholic church and protestantism
adherents believe that the new church the final phase is a renewal of christianity based on jesus second coming
it is the fulfilment of the prophecy of a new jerusalem in the book of revelation
swedenborg said that the new church would be established gradually since the false beliefs of the former churches had to be set aside
swedenborg stated that he had distributed his books to english bishops and nobility who considered them well written but of little value and advised against reading them
some members of other christian denominations have criticised the church s denial of a trinity and jesus atonement
the new church believes that there is one god in jesus and some christian theologians classify the church as a cult
others reject swedenborg s visions
walter ralston martin quoted a critic that swedenborg s spiritual experiences were admittedly of such a character that in an ordinary man they would have sufficed to qualify him for an asylum according to martin however his theological writings were so systematic that no one can reasonably say that swedenborg was insane swedenborg was a rationalist and paradoxically a mystic
he was one who absorbed the introspective and subjective philosophy of rene descartes and the empiricism of john locke which he combined with the transcendentalism of lmmanuel kant thus forming a mold into which christian theology was poured and what would not go into the mold selected old testament works the pauline epistles acts james peter jude etc he simply discarded
what emerged was a deeply speculative philosophical system of theology couched in a redefined christian terminology and buttressed with mystical visions trances and dreams
the earliest assessment of swedenborg came from contemporary german philosopher immanuel kant
swedenborg was relatively unknown until when a fire broke out in stockholm and threatened to burn down his house and his writings
at a dinner in gothenburg kilometres mi away he reportedly turned pale and described to the guests exactly what was happening until the fire was put out three houses away from his house
this was investigated by kant who wrote dreams of a spirit seer criticising swedenborg and knowledge derived from dreams and visions
kant wrote in letters that he privately admired swedenborg but did not publicly admit it in fear of ridicule
swedenborg stated that all teachings came to him from the lord while reading scripture in a full waking state and although allowed to converse with angels and spirits to give an account of the afterlife all doctrinal teachings were received from jesus alone
religious critics disagree saying that he received his information from evil spirits and his revelations are among the most antibiblical and anti christian material ever printed according to martin swedenborg was apparently well aware of the fact that pauline theology if accepted at face value would vitiate almost en toto his own
so he began with the basic assumption that he was right and that the apostle paul was wrong in some of his visions and dreams he stated that he actually argued with paul luther calvin and others
and as ego triumphed these great thinkers all retreated before swedenborg s new revelations
however one factor must never be forgotten and that is the statement that the new testament is the criterion for measuring all subsequent revelations and whatever is found to be contrary to it must be and always has been rejected by the christian church
christians emphasise that in distinguishing an evil spirit from an angel angels must glorify jesus and teachings must be based on scripture
new church adherents say that swedenborg would agree since he said no evil spirit can utter the name of jesus it signifies salvation and those in the spiritual world speak as they think
unlike many spiritualists swedenborg praises jesus as the god of heaven and earth and his doctrines are derived from scriptural references
according to swedenborg none of the teachings originated from an angel or spirit and the spiritual world was revealed to him so humanity would know that there is life after death
when i think of what i am about to write and while i am writing i enjoy a complete inspiration for otherwise it would be my own but now i know for certain that what i write is the living truth of god that the lord manifested himself before me his servant and sent me to this office and that he afterward opened the sight of my spirit and so has admitted me into the spiritual world and has granted to me to see the heavens and the hells also to converse with angels and spirits and this now continuously for many years i testify in truth likewise that from the first day of that call i have not received any thing which pertains to the doctrines of that church from any angel but from the lord alone while i read the word
critics note that swedenborg viewed only books in the bible as divinely inspired
according to them masquerading as a being of light is a demonic tactic swedenborg s allegorical esoteric interpretations and paranormal encounters bordering on the occult contradict the scriptures and make his claims spurious
this criticism ignores the fact that the majority of swedenborg s writings are based on direct scriptural quotations with numerous cross references
as for the writings of paul swedenborg clarified the distinction between the epistles of paul with the rest of scripture in his private diary paul indeed spoke from inspiration but not in the same way as the prophets to whom every single word was dictated but that his inspiration was that he received an influx according to those things which were with him which is quite a different inspiration and has no conjunction with heaven by correspondences
michael quinn suggests that joseph smith the founder of mormonism was influenced by swedenborg s writings
like swedenborg mormons believe in eternal marriage
however they require that the ritual be performed in a temple
smith s concept of three heavens is similar to swedenborg s view
both swedenborg and smith refer to heaven as celestial similar to paul s see corinthians description of a visit to the third heaven
edward hunter a swedenborgian who became a member of the church reported that in joseph smith told him that he was familiar with swedenborg s writings
new thought a spiritual movement that began in the united states during the late th century promotes positive thinking and healing
phineas quimby a healer who said that illness in the body originated in false beliefs was an early proponent
quimby healed warren felt evans a swedenborgian minister who became a healer and published several books promoting new thought in new church doctrines
according to swedenborg there is a correspondence from heaven with all things on earth
carl jung founder of analytical psychology and a contemporary of sigmund freud was familiar with swedenborg s works
he cited swedenborg s reported clairvoyance about the stockholm fire as an example of synchronicity when
the vision arose in swedenborg s mind of a fire in stockholm there was a real fire raging there at the same time without there being any demonstrable or
even thinkable connection between the two
william blake his the marriage of heaven and hell satirised swedenborg s heaven and hell
blake and his wife catherine attended the first general conference of the new jerusalem church in
blake was influenced by an earlier version of the new church
his doctrine however later evolved
