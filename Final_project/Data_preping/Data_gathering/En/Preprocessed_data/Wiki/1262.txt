Kaustubha Sanskrit कौस्तुभ is a divine jewel or Mani or ratnam which is in the possession of Lord Vishnu who lives in the Kshira Sagara - the ocean of milk
It is believed in the Hindu scriptures to be the most valuable ratnam in the whole world and a symbol of divine authority
In Hindu theology the Devas and Asuras performed the Churning of the Ocean of Milk Samudra manthan in order to get Amrita Devanagari - अमृत
In this process the fourteen treasure jewels Ratnas emerged from the ocean
The fourth Ratna that emerged is known as Kaustubha
It represents pure consciousness shining in all its luminous manifestations
It was said by Lord Brahma Lord Shiva and all other devthas that nobody in the universe except Lord Vishnu could handle the brilliance and magnificence of this Mani since it could corrupt the bearer by infusing in them with a greed to carry it forever
Kaustubhadhari is the person who is wearing that Mani ie
