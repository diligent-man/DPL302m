nestorianism is a term used in christian theology and church history to refer to several mutually related but doctrinarily distinct sets of teachings
the first meaning of the term is related to the original teachings of christian theologian nestorius d
who promoted specific doctrines in the fields of christology and mariology
the second meaning of the term is much wider and relates to a set of later theological teachings that were traditionally labeled as nestorian but differ from the teachings of nestorius in origin scope and terminology
the oxford english dictionary defines nestorianism as the doctrine of nestorius patriarch of constantinople appointed in by which christ is asserted to have had distinct human and divine persons
original nestorianism is attested primarily by works of nestorius and also by other theological and historical sources that are related to his teachings in the fields of mariology and christology
his theology was influenced by teachings of theodore of mopsuestia d
the most prominent theologian of the antiochian school
nestorian mariology rejects the title theotokos god bearer for mary thus emphasizing distinction between divine and human aspects of the incarnation
nestorian christology promotes the concept of a prosopic union of two natures divine and human in jesus christ thus trying to avoid and replace the concept of a hypostatic union
this christological position is defined as radical dyophysitism and differs from orthodox dyophysitism that was reaffirmed at the council of chalcedon
such teachings brought nestorius into conflict with other prominent church leaders most notably cyril of alexandria who issued anathemas against him
nestorius and his teachings were eventually condemned as heretical at the council of ephesus in and again at the council of chalcedon in
his teachings were considered as heretical not only in chalcedonian christianity but even more in oriental orthodoxy
after the condemnation some supporters of nestorius who were followers of the antiochian school and the school of edessa relocated to the sasanian empire where they were affiliated with the local christian community known as the church of the east
during the period from to gradual development led to the creation of specific doctrinal views within the church of the east
evolution of those views was finalized by prominent east syriac theologian babai the great d
who was using the specific syriac term qnoma as a designation for dual divine and human substances within one prosopon person or hypostasis of christ
such views were officially adopted by the church of the east at a council held in
opponents of such views labeled them as nestorian thus creating the practice of misnaming the church of the east as nestorian
for a long time such labeling seemed appropriate since nestorius is officially venerated as a saint in the church of the east
in modern religious studies this label has been criticized as improper and misleading
as a consequence the use of nestorian label in scholarly literature and also in the field of inter denominational relations is gradually being reduced to its primary meaning focused on the original teachings of nestorius
nestorianism was condemned as heresy at the council of ephesus
the armenian church rejected the council of chalcedon because they believed chalcedonian definition was too similar to nestorianism
the persian nestorian church on the other hand supported the spread of nestorianism in persarmenia
the armenian church and other eastern churches saw the rise of nestorianism as a threat to the independence of their church
peter the iberian a georgian prince also strongly opposed the chalcedonian creed
thus in catholicos babken i of armenia along with the albanian and iberian bishops met in vagharshapat and issued a condemnation of the chalcedonian definition
nestorians held that the council of chalcedon proved the orthodoxy of their faith and had started persecuting non chalcedonian or monophysite syrian christians during the reign of peroz i
in response to pleas for assistance from the syrian church armenian prelates issued a letter addressed to persian christians reaffirming their condemnation of the nestorianism as heresy
following the exodus to persia scholars expanded on the teachings of nestorius and his mentors particularly after the relocation of the school of edessa to the then persian city of nisibis modern day nusaybin in turkey in where it became known as the school of nisibis
nestorian monasteries propagating the teachings of the nisibis school flourished in th century persarmenia
despite this initial eastern expansion the nestorians missionary success was eventually deterred
david j
bosch observes by the end of the fourteenth century however the nestorian and other churches which at one time had dotted the landscape of all of central and even parts of east asia were all but wiped out
isolated pockets of christianity survived only in india
the religious victors on the vast central asian mission field of the nestorians were islam and buddhism
nestorianism is a radical form of dyophysitism differing from orthodox dyophysitism on several points mainly by opposition to the concept of hypostatic union
it can be seen as the antithesis to eutychian monophysitism which emerged in reaction to nestorianism
where nestorianism holds that christ had two loosely united natures divine and human monophysitism holds that he had but a single nature his human nature being absorbed into his divinity
a brief definition of nestorian christology can be given as jesus christ who is not identical with the son but personally united with the son who lives in him is one hypostasis and one nature human this contrasts with nestorius own teaching that the word which is eternal and the flesh which is not came together in a hypostatic union jesus christ jesus thus being both fully man and god of two ousia ancient greek essences but of one prosopon person
both nestorianism and monophysitism were condemned as heretical at the council of chalcedon
nestorius developed his christological views as an attempt to understand and explain rationally the incarnation of the divine logos the second person of the holy trinity as the man jesus
he had studied at the school of antioch where his mentor had been theodore of mopsuestia theodore and other antioch theologians had long taught a literalist interpretation of the bible and stressed the distinctiveness of the human and divine natures of jesus
nestorius took his antiochene leanings with him when he was appointed patriarch of constantinople by byzantine emperor theodosius ii in
nestorius s teachings became the root of controversy when he publicly challenged the long used title theotokos god bearer for mary
he suggested that the title denied christ s full humanity arguing instead that jesus had two persons dyoprosopism the divine logos and the human jesus
as a result of this prosopic duality he proposed christotokos christ bearer as a more suitable title for mary
nestorius opponents found his teaching too close to the heresy of adoptionism the idea that christ had been born a man who had later been adopted as god s son
nestorius was especially criticized by cyril patriarch of alexandria who argued that nestorius s teachings undermined the unity of christ s divine and human natures at the incarnation
some of nestorius s opponents argued that he put too much emphasis on the human nature of christ and others debated that the difference that nestorius implied between the human nature and the divine nature created a fracture in the singularity of christ thus creating two christ figures
nestorius himself always insisted that his views were orthodox though they were deemed heretical at the council of ephesus in leading to the nestorian schism when churches supportive of nestorius and the rest of the christian church separated
however this formulation was never adopted by all churches termed nestorian
indeed the modern assyrian church of the east which reveres nestorius does not fully subscribe to nestorian doctrine though it does not employ the title theotokos
nestorianism became a distinct sect following the nestorian schism beginning in the s
nestorius had come under fire from western theologians most notably cyril of alexandria
cyril had both theological and political reasons for attacking nestorius on top of feeling that nestorianism was an error against true belief he also wanted to denigrate the head of a competing patriarchate
cyril and nestorius asked pope celestine i to weigh in on the matter
celestine found that the title theotokos was orthodox and authorized cyril to ask nestorius to recant
cyril however used the opportunity to further attack nestorius who pleaded with emperor theodosius ii to call a council so that all grievances could be aired
in theodosius called the council of ephesus
however the council ultimately sided with cyril who held that the christ contained two natures in one divine person hypostasis unity of subsistence and that the virgin mary conceiving and bearing this divine person is truly called the mother of god theotokos meaning god bearer
the council accused nestorius of heresy and deposed him as patriarch
upon returning to his monastery in he was banished to upper egypt
nestorianism was officially anathematized a ruling reiterated at the council of chalcedon in
however a number of churches particularly those associated with the school of edessa supported nestorius though not necessarily his doctrine and broke with the churches of the west
many of nestorius supporters relocated to the sasanian empire of iran home to a vibrant but persecuted christian minority
in upper egypt nestorius wrote his book of heraclides responding to the two councils at ephesus
not shown are non nicene nontrinitarian and some restorationist denominations the western provinces of the persian empire had been home to christian communities headed by metropolitans and later patriarchs of seleucia ctesiphon
the christian minority in persia was frequently persecuted by the zoroastrian majority which was accusing local christians of political leanings towards the roman empire
in the church in persia declared itself independent in order to ward off allegations of any foreign allegiance
by the end of the th century the persian church increasingly aligned itself with the teachings of theodore of mopsuestia and his followers many of whom became dissidents after the councils of ephesus and chalcedon
persian church became increasingly opposed to doctrines promoted by those councils thus furthering the divide between chalcedonian christianity and christianity in persia
in the metropolitan barsauma of nisibis publicly accepted nestorius mentor theodore of mopsuestia as a spiritual authority
in when the school of edessa in mesopotamia was closed by byzantine emperor zeno for its pro nestorian teachings the school relocated to its original home of nisibis becoming again the school of nisibis leading to a wave of christian dissidents immigration into persia
the persian patriarch babai reiterated and expanded upon the church s esteem for theodore of mopsuestia
now firmly established in persia with centers in nisibis ctesiphon and gundeshapur and several metropoleis the persian church began to branch out beyond the sasanian empire
however through the sixth century the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution by zoroastrians
the infighting led to a schism which lasted from until around when the issues were resolved
however immediately afterward roman persian conflict led to the persecution of the church by the sassanid emperor khosrow i this ended in
the church survived these trials under the guidance of patriarch aba i who had converted to christianity from zoroastrianism
the church emerged stronger after this period of ordeal and increased missionary efforts farther afield
missionaries established dioceses in the arabian peninsula and india the saint thomas christians
they made some advances in egypt despite the strong miaphysite presence there
missionaries entered central asia and had significant success converting local turkic tribes
the anuradhapura cross discovered in sri lanka strongly suggests a strong presence of nestorian christianity in sri lanka during the th century ad according to humphrey codrington who based his claim on a th century manuscript christian topography that mentions of a community of persian christians who were known to reside in taproban the ancient greek name for sri lanka
nestorian missionaries were firmly established in china during the early part of the tang dynasty the chinese source known as the nestorian stele records a mission under a persian proselyte named alopen as introducing nestorian christianity to china in
the jingjiao documents also described by the japanese scholar p
saeki as nestorian documents or jesus sutras are said to be connected with alopen
in his foreword of the english translation of the chinese taoist classic the secret of the golden flower by richard wilhelm carl jung mentions the possibility of a connection between the nestorians and the chin tan chiao religion of the golden elixir of life membership
the fact that the author of the secret of the golden flower l dongbin is said to have been active during the tang dynasty also supports this view
following the arab conquest of persia completed in the persian church became a dhimmi community under the rashidun caliphate
the church and its communities abroad grew larger under the caliphate
by the th century it had metropolitan sees within the caliphate s territories and another five elsewhere including in china and india
after that time however nestorianism went into decline
in a article published in the bulletin of the john rylands library fellow of the british academy sebastian brock wrote the term nestorian church has become the standard designation for the ancient oriental church which in the past called itself the church of the east but which today prefers the fuller title the assyrian church of the east
the common christological declaration between the catholic church and the assyrian church of the east signed by pope john paul ii and mar dinkha iv underlines the chalcedonian christological formulation as the expression of the common faith of these churches and recognizes the legitimacy of the title theotokos
in a paper mar awa royel bishop of the assyrian church stated the position of that church after the council of ephesus when nestorius the patriarch of constantinople was condemned for his views on the unity of the godhead and the humanity in christ the church of the east was branded as nestorian on account of its refusal to anathematize the patriarch
several historical records suggest that the assyrian church of the east may have been in sri lanka between the middle fifth and sixth centuries
