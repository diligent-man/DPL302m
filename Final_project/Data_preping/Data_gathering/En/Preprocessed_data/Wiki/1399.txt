the council of clermont was a mixed synod of ecclesiastics and laymen of the catholic church called by pope urban ii and held from to november at clermont auvergne at the time part of the duchy of aquitaine
pope urban s speech on november included the call to arms that would result in the first crusade and eventually the capture of jerusalem and the establishment of the kingdom of jerusalem
in this urban reacted to the request by byzantine emperor alexius i comnenus who had sent envoys to the council of piacenza requesting military assistance against the seljuk turks
several accounts of the speech survive of these the one by fulcher of chartres who was present at the council is generally accepted as the most reliable
urban also discussed cluniac reforms of the church and also extended the excommunication of philip i of france for his adulterous remarriage to bertrade of montfort
the council also declared a renewal of the truce of god an attempt on the part of the church to reduce feuding among frankish nobles
the council was attended by about clerics
no official list of the participants or of the signatories to the decrees of the council survives
a partial list of some of the attendees can nonetheless be constructed
there are six main sources of information about this portion of the council
a letter that was written by urban himself in december referring to the council
the anonymous gesta francorum the deeds of the franks dated c
fulcher of chartres who was present at the council in his gesta francorum jerusalem expugnantium c
robert the monk who may have been present at the council in historia hierosolymitana
baldric archbishop of dol written c
guibert de nogent dei gesta per francos the five versions of the speech vary widely in their details and especially those of baldric and guibert both of whom were not present at the council
are certainly colored by later events
the account by fulcher who is known to have been present at the council is generally considered the most reliable version
urban s own letter written in december and addressed to the faithful waiting in flanders does lament that a barbaric fury has deplorably afflicted and laid waste the churches of god in the regions of the orient
urban does allude to jerusalem saying that this barbaric fury has even grasped in intolerable servitude its churches and the holy city of christ glorified by his passion and resurrection
he calls upon the princes to free the churches of the east appointing adhemar of le puy as the leader of the expedition to set out on the day of the assumption of mary august
the gesta francorum does not give an account of the speech at any length it merely mentions that urban called upon all to take up the way of the lord and be prepared to suffer much assured of their reward in heaven
it goes on to emphasize how news of urban s call to arms quickly spread by word of mouth through all the regions and countries of gaul the franks upon hearing such reports forthwith caused crosses to be sewed on their right shoulders saying that they followed with one accord the footsteps of christ by which they had been redeemed from the hand of hell
fulcher of chartres was present at the speech and recorded it in gesta francorum jerusalem expugnantium
he was writing from memory a few years later c
he asserts in his prologue that he is recording only such events as he had seen with his own eyes and his record is phrased in a way consistent with the style of oration known from papal speeches in the th century
in fulcher s text urban begins by reminding the clergy present that they are shepherds and that they must be vigilant and avoid carelessness and corruption
he reminds them to refrain from simony and to adhere to the laws of the church
urban complains about the lack of justice and public order in the frankish provinces and calls for the re establishment of the truce protecting clergy from violence
in the historiography of the crusades there is a long standing argument as to how much the pacification of the frankish realm was designed to go hand in hand with the export of violence to the enemy in the east
fulcher reports that everyone present agreed to the pope s propositions and promised to adhere to the church s decrees
then after this and other matters had been attended to urban spoke about the suffering of christianity in another part of the world
in this second part of his speech urban urges the frankish christians that once they have re established peace and righteousness in their own land they should turn their attention to the east and bring aid to the christians there as the turks
had attacked them and had recently conquered the territory of romania i e
byzantine anatolia as far west as the mediterranean the part known as the arm of saint george the sea of marmara
killing and capturing many christians and destroying churches and devastating the kingdom of god
in order to avoid further loss of territory and even more widespread attacks on christians urban calls on the clergy present to publish his call to arms everywhere and persuade all people of whatever rank both nobles and commoners to go to the aid of the christians currently under attack
concluding his call to arms with christ commands it christus autem imperat urban defines the crusade both as a defensive just war and as a religious holy war
urban goes on to promise immediate absolution to all who die either on the way or in battle against the infidels
he then connects his call to arms with his previous call for peace in gaul let those who have been accustomed unjustly to wage private warfare against the faithful now go against the infidels and end with victory this war which should have been begun long ago
let those who for a long time have been robbers now become knights
let those who have been fighting against their brothers and relatives now fight in a proper way against the barbarians
let those who have been serving as mercenaries for small pay now obtain the eternal reward
let those who have been wearing themselves out in both body and soul now work for a double honor
some historians prefer the version of the speech reported by robert the monk in his historia iherosolimitana written in
robert gives a more vivid account consisting both of a more elaborate sermon and the dramatic response of the audience bursting into spontaneous cries of deus vult
in robert s version urban calls the race of the franks to christian orthodoxy reform and submission to the church and to come to the aid of the greek christians in the east
as in fulcher s account urban promises remission of sins for those who went to the east
robert s account of urban s speech has the rhetoric of a dramatic battle speech
urban here emphasizes reconquering the holy land more than aiding the greeks an aspect lacking in fulcher s version and considered by many historians an insertion informed by the success of the first crusade
both robert s and fulcher s account of the speech include a description of the terrible plight of the christians in the east under the recent conquests of the turks and the promise of remission of sins for those who go to their aid
robert s version however includes a more vivid description of the atrocities committed by the conquerors describing the desecration of churches the forced circumcision beheading and torture by disemboweling of christian men and alluding to grievous rape of christian women
perhaps with the wisdom of hindsight robert makes urban advise that none but knights should go not the old and feeble nor priests without the permission of their bishops for such are more of a hindrance than aid more of a burden than advantage
nor ought women to set out at all without their husbands or brothers or legal guardians
about the same time baldric archbishop of dol also basing his account generally on gesta francorum reported an emotional sermon focusing on the offenses of the muslims and the reconquest of the holy land in terms likely to appeal to chivalry
like fulcher he also recorded that urban deplored the violence of the christian knights of gaul
it is less wicked to brandish your sword against saracens baldric s urban cries comparing them to the amalekites
the violence of knights he wanted to see ennobled in the service of christ defending the churches of the east as if defending a mother
baldric asserts that urban there on the spot appointed the bishop of puy to lead the crusade
guibert abbot of nogent in his dei gesta per francos also made that urban emphasize the reconquest of the holy land more than help to the greeks or other christians there
this emphasis may as in the case of robert and baldric be due to the influence account of the reconquest of jerusalem in the gesta francorum
urban s speech in guibert s version emphasizes the sanctity of the holy land which must be in christian possession so that prophecies about the end of the world could be fulfilled
