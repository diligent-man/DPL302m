shidduchim שִׁדּוּכִים‎ Aramaic שידוכין is a system of matchmaking in which Jewish singles are introduced to one another in Orthodox Jewish communities for the purpose of marriage
In Orthodox Jewish circles dating is limited to the search for a marriage partner
Both sides usually the parents close relatives or friends of the persons and the singles themselves involved make inquiries about the prospective partner e
g on hisher character intelligence level of learning financial status family and health status appearance and level of religious observance
A shidduch often begins with a recommendation from family members friends or others who see matchmaking as a mitzvah or commandment
Some engage in it as a profession and charge a fee for their services
Usually a professional matchmaker is called a shadchan but anyone who makes a shidduch is considered the shadchan for it
After the match has been proposed the prospective partners meet a number of times to gain a sense of whether they are right for one another
The number of dates prior to announcing an engagement may vary by community
In some the dating continues several months
In stricter communities the couple may decide a few days after originally meeting with each other
Also the age when shidduchim start may vary by community
In frum circles especially among Hasidim eighteen is the age when shidduchim start and shadchanim take notice
Those who support marriage by shidduch believe that it complies with traditional Judaism's outlook on Tzniut modest behaviour in relations between men and women and prevents promiscuity
It may also be helpful in small Jewish communities where meeting prospective marriage partners is limited and this gives them access to a broader spectrum of potential candidates
If the shidduch does not succeed the shadchan is usually contacted and it is heshe that tells the other side that the arrangement will not be going ahead
If the shidduch is successful the couple informs the shadchan of its success
In recent years a number of shidduchim sites have appeared on the Internet
The prospective partners either date each other or in stricter Haredi communities they go to a bashow or sit-in
The practice has been called a chaperoned quasi-date
A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house or that of someone hosting to see if the prospective couple are compatible
Both sets of parents talk to each other and then when the setting is more relaxed they go into another room leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves
Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions while some just want to see if they like each other relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people
The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies as some have many bashows while others have as few as one which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes
Bashert or beshert Yiddish באַשערט means destiny
The etymology of the word is somewhat unknown
with some arguing that it comes from the German beschert meaning bestowed or given
Others insist that it comes from the Yiddish sher meaning scissors or shears
It is often used to refer to one's divinely foreordained spouse or soulmate who is called one's basherte female or basherter male
It can also be used to express the seeming fate or destiny of an auspicious or important event friendship or happening
In modern usage Jewish singles will say that they are looking for their bashert meaning they are looking for that person who will complement them perfectly and whom they will complement perfectly
Since it is considered to have been Heavenly foreordained whom one will marry one's spouse is considered to be one's bashert by definition independent of whether the couple's marital life works out well or not

The first recorded shidduch in the Torah was the match that Eliezer the servant of the Jewish patriarch Abraham made for his master's son Isaac Genesis Ch
Abraham gave him specific instructions to choose a woman from Abraham's own tribe
Eliezer traveled to his master's homeland to fulfill Abraham's wishes arriving at a well
After a short prayer to God for guidance describing how a virtuous woman might act toward a traveling stranger at the well Rebekah appeared on the scene and did everything described in Eliezer's prayer
Eliezer then went with Rebekah to her family and appealed to them for permission to take Rebekah back with him to be Isaac's wife
Once this permission was granted Rebekah joined Eliezer on the road home to Isaac
Even so Isaac gained his own impression of her before agreeing to marry her Rashi commentary to Genesis
However when Eliezer proposes to take Rebekah back to Isaac in Canaan he is told by Rebekah's family Let us ask the maiden i
This is taken as an instruction for Jewish parents to weigh their child's opinion in the balance during an arranged marriage
Regardless of whether proper procedure is followed this is not the end of the decision - it is believed by Jews that the final say belongs to God who may have different plans compare with the match of Jacob and Leah
The Talmud Bavli Kiddushin a first version states that academy head Abba Arikha would give corporal punishment to a man who would marry without shidduchin that is without prearrangement by the couple
The text gives three versions of his practice the other two versions disagree
Some authorities rule according to the first version while others rule according to the other two versions
In Kiddushin a it states that a man should not marry a woman he has not seen lest he come to violate love your neighbour as yourself
The etymology of the words shidduch and shadchan is uncertain
The medieval rabbi Nissim of Gerona commonly called Ran traces it to the Aramaic word for calm cf
Targum to the Book of Judges and elaborates that the main purpose of the shidduch process is for young people to settle down into marriage
According to Jastrow the word means to negotiate or stipulate the financial terms of a betrothal
Shadchan Hebrew שַׁדְּכָן plural שַׁדְּכֳנִם shadchanim shadchonim female שַׁדְכָנִית shadchanis shadchanit is a Hebrew word for matchmaker Yiddish Shadkhn
The word shadchan refers to people who carry out shidduchim as a profession within the religious Jewish community
However shadchan can also be used to refer to anyone who introduces two single Jews to one another with the hope that they will form a couple
One of the characters in the musical Fiddler on the Roof is a matchmaker named Yente
Because of this the name Yenta יענטע is sometimes mistakenly taken to be a synonym for shadchan

Although Torah law allows for a bat-kohen to marry a challal convert or freed slave Hebrew eved meshukhrar the Midrash and Talmud cite Johanan bar Nappaha's view that a daughter of the kohen is best off marrying a kohen
Rabbi Yochanan maintains that in the event a bat-kohen marries a non-Kohen undesired results for the groom are likely to surface such as poverty or the demise of the groom
An exception to this taboo is if the groom is a Talmid Chacham
Considering the prevalence of a number of genetic diseases in both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities several organisations most notably Dor Yeshorim routinely screen large groups of young people anonymously only handing them a telephone number and a PIN
When a shidduch is suggested the candidates can phone the organisation enter both their PINs and find out whether their union could result in critically disabled children
Although the implementation has been controversial there has been a sharp decrease in the number of children born with TaySachs disease and other genetic disorders since its inception
