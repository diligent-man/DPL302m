risk management appears scientific management literature since s
became formal science article book risk management title also appear library searches
widely used vocabulary risk management defined iso guide risk management
ideal risk management prioritization process followed whereby risk greatest loss impact greatest probability occurring handled first
risk lower probability occurrence lower loss handled descending order
practice process assessing overall risk difficult balancing resource used mitigate risk high probability occurrence lower loss versus risk high loss lower probability occurrence often mishandled
intangible risk management identifies new type risk ha probability occurring ignored organization due lack identification ability
example deficient knowledge applied situation knowledge risk materializes
process-engagement risk may issue ineffective operational procedure applied
risk directly reduce productivity knowledge worker decrease cost-effectiveness profitability service quality reputation brand value earnings quality
intangible risk management allows risk management create immediate value identification reduction risk reduce productivity
difficult determine put resource toward risk management use resource elsewhere
ideal risk management minimizes spending manpower resource also minimizes negative effect risks
risk defined possibility event occur adversely affect achievement objective
system like committee sponsoring organization treadway commission enterprise risk management coso erm assist manager mitigating risk factors

create value resource expended mitigate risk le consequence inaction
continually periodically re-assessedbenoit mandelbrot distinguished mild wild risk argued risk assessment management must fundamentally different two type risk
mild risk follows normal near-normal probability distribution subject regression mean law large number therefore relatively predictable
wild risk follows fat-tailed distribution eg pareto power-law distribution subject regression tail infinite mean variance rendering law large number invalid ineffective therefore difficult impossible predict
common error risk assessment management underestimate wildness risk assuming risk mild fact wild must avoided risk assessment management valid reliable according mandelbrot
according standard iso risk management principle guideline implementation process risk management consists several step follows
mitigation solution risk using available technological human organizational resourcesafter establishing context next step process managing risk identify potential risks
hence risk identification start source problem competitor benefit problem's consequences
source analysis risk source may internal external system target risk management use mitigation instead management since definition risk deal factor decision-making cannot managedsome example risk source stakeholder project employee company weather airport
example threat losing money threat abuse confidential information threat human error accident casualties
threat may exist various entity important shareholder customer legislative body governmentwhen either source problem known event source may trigger event lead problem investigated
example stakeholder withdrawing project may endanger funding project confidential information may stolen employee even within closed network lightning striking aircraft takeoff may make people board immediate casualties
chosen method identifying risk may depend culture industry practice compliance
identification method formed template development template identifying source problem event
scenario-based risk identification scenario analysis different scenario created
scenario may alternative way achieve objective analysis interaction force example market battle
event trigger undesired scenario alternative identified risk see future study methodology used futurists
taxonomy-based risk identification taxonomy taxonomy-based risk identification breakdown possible risk sources
common-risk checking several industry list known risk available
risk charting method combine approach listing resource risk threat resource modifying factor may increase decrease risk consequence wished avoid
one begin resource consider threat exposed consequence each
alternatively one start threat examine resource would affect one begin consequence determine combination threat resource would involved bring aboutonce risk identified must assessed potential severity impact generally negative impact damage loss probability occurrence
quantity either simple measure case value lost building impossible know sure case unlikely event probability occurrence unknown
therefore assessment process critical make best educated decision order properly prioritize implementation risk management plan
traffic capacity lead greater development area surrounding improved traffic capacity
many engineering example expanded capacity function soon filled increased demand
since expansion come cost resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting management
fundamental difficulty risk assessment determining rate occurrence since statistical information available kind past incident particularly scanty case catastrophic event simply infrequency
furthermore evaluating severity consequence impact often quite difficult intangible assets
thus best educated opinion available statistic primary source information
nevertheless risk assessment produce information senior executive organization primary risk easy understand risk management decision may prioritized within overall company goals
numerous different risk formula exist perhaps widely accepted formula risk quantification rate probability occurrence multiplied impact event equal risk magnitude
risk mitigation measure usually formulated according one following major risk option are
design new business process adequate built-in risk control containment measure start
periodically re-assess risk accepted ongoing process normal feature business operation modify mitigation measures
closing particular high-risk business arealater research ha shown financial benefit risk management le dependent formula used dependent frequency risk assessment performed
business imperative able present finding risk assessment financial market schedule terms
courtney formula wa accepted official risk analysis method u governmental agencies
formula proposes calculation ale annualized loss expectancy compare expected loss value security control implementation cost cost-benefit analysis
risk identified assessed technique manage risk fall one four major categories
retention accept budgetideal use risk control strategy may possible
may involve trade-off acceptable organization person making risk management decisions
another source u department defense see link defense acquisition university call category acat avoid control accept transfer
use acat acronym reminiscent another acat acquisition category used u defense industry procurement risk management figure prominently decision making planning
similarly risk opportunity specific mitigation strategy exploit share enhance ignore
refusing purchase property business avoid legal liability one example
avoidance may seem like answer risk avoiding risk also mean losing potential gain accepting retaining risk may allowed
entering business avoid risk loss also avoids possibility earning profits
increasing risk regulation hospital ha led avoidance treating higher risk condition favor patient presenting lower risk
risk reduction optimization involves reducing severity loss likelihood loss occurring
example sprinkler designed put fire reduce risk loss fire
method may cause greater loss water damage therefore may suitable
halon fire suppression system may mitigate risk cost may prohibitive strategy
acknowledging risk positive negative optimizing risk mean finding balance negative risk benefit operation activity risk reduction effort applied
effectively applying health safety environment hse management standard organization achieve tolerable level residual risk
modern software development methodology reduce risk developing delivering software incrementally
early methodology suffered fact delivered software final phase development problem encountered earlier phase meant costly rework often jeopardized whole project
developing iteration software project limit effort wasted single iteration
outsourcing could example risk sharing strategy outsourcer demonstrate higher capability managing reducing risks
example company may outsource software development manufacturing hard good customer support need another company handling business management itself
way company concentrate business development without worry much manufacturing process managing development team finding physical location center
control either detect cause unwanted event prior consequence occurring use product detection root cause unwanted failure team avoid
briefly defined sharing another party burden loss benefit gain risk measure reduce risk
term 'risk transfer' often used place risk-sharing mistaken belief transfer risk third party insurance outsourcing
practice insurance company contractor go bankrupt end court original risk likely still revert first party
terminology practitioner scholar alike purchase insurance contract often described transfer risk however technically speaking buyer contract generally retains legal responsibility loss transferred meaning insurance may described accurately post-event compensatory mechanism
example personal injury insurance policy doe transfer risk car accident insurance company
risk still lie policyholder namely person ha accident
insurance policy simply provides accident event occurs involving policyholder compensation may payable policyholder commensurate sufferingdamage
risk-retention pool technically retaining risk group spreading whole group involves transfer among individual member group
different traditional insurance premium exchanged member group upfront instead loss assessed member group
risk retention involves accepting loss benefit gain risk incident occurs
risk retention viable strategy small risk cost insuring risk would greater time total loss sustained
includes risk large catastrophic either cannot insured premium would infeasible
war example since property risk insured war loss attributed war retained insured
also amount potential loss risk amount insured retained risk
may also acceptable chance large loss small cost insure greater coverage amount great would hinder goal organization much
instance risk concerning image organization top management decision behind whereas management would authority decide computer virus risks
risk management plan propose applicable effective security control managing risks
example observed high risk computer virus could mitigated acquiring implementing antivirus software
good risk management plan contain schedule control implementation responsible person actions
according isoiec stage immediately completion risk assessment phase consists preparing risk treatment plan document decision identified risk handled
mitigation risk often mean selection security control documented statement applicability identifies particular control objective control the
purchase insurance policy risk ha decided transferred insurer avoid risk avoided without sacrificing entity's goal reduce others retain rest
practice experience actual loss result necessitate change plan contribute information allow possible different decision made dealing risk faced
evaluate whether previously selected security control still applicable effective
example information risk good example rapidly changing business environmentprioritizing risk management process highly could keep organization ever completing project even getting started
especially true work suspended risk management process considered complete
risk improperly assessed prioritized time wasted dealing risk loss likely occur
spending much time assessing managing unlikely risk avoided
unlikely event occur risk unlikely enough occur may better simply retain risk deal result loss doe fact occur
primary justification formal risk assessment process legal bureaucratic
