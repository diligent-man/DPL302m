risk management is the identification evaluation and prioritization of risks defined in iso as the effect of uncertainty on objectives followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize monitor and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities
risks can come from various sources including uncertainty in international markets threats from project failures at any phase in design development production or sustaining of life cycles legal liabilities credit risk accidents natural causes and disasters deliberate attack from an adversary or events of uncertain or unpredictable root cause
there are two types of events i e
negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities
risk management standards have been developed by various institutions including the project management institute the national institute of standards and technology actuarial societies and iso standards
methods definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management security engineering industrial processes financial portfolios actuarial assessments or public health and safety
certain risk management standards have been criticized for having no measurable improvement on risk whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seems to increase
strategies to manage threats uncertainties with negative consequences typically include avoiding the threat reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat transferring all or part of the threat to another party and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat
the opposite of these strategies can be used to respond to opportunities uncertain future states with benefits
as a professional role a risk manager will oversee the organization s comprehensive insurance and risk management program assessing and identifying risks that could impede the reputation safety security or financial success of the organization and then develop plans to minimize and or mitigate any negative financial outcomes
risk analysts support the technical side of the organization s risk management approach once risk data has been compiled and evaluated analysts share their findings with their managers who use those insights to decide among possible solutions
see also chief risk officer internal audit and financial analyst corporate and other
risk management appears in scientific and management literature since the s
it became a formal science in the s when articles and books with risk management in the title also appear in library searches
most of research was initially related to finance and insurance
a widely used vocabulary for risk management is defined by iso guide risk management
vocabulary
in ideal risk management a prioritization process is followed whereby the risks with the greatest loss or impact and the greatest probability of occurring are handled first
risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order
in practice the process of assessing overall risk can be difficult and balancing resources used to mitigate between risks with a high probability of occurrence but lower loss versus a risk with high loss but lower probability of occurrence can often be mishandled
intangible risk management identifies a new type of a risk that has a probability of occurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identification ability
for example when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation a knowledge risk materializes
relationship risk appears when ineffective collaboration occurs
process engagement risk may be an issue when ineffective operational procedures are applied
these risks directly reduce the productivity of knowledge workers decrease cost effectiveness profitability service quality reputation brand value and earnings quality
intangible risk management allows risk management to create immediate value from the identification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity
opportunity cost represents a unique challenge for risk managers
it can be difficult to determine when to put resources toward risk management and when to use those resources elsewhere
again ideal risk management minimizes spending or manpower or other resources and also minimizes the negative effects of risks
risk is defined as the possibility that an event will occur that adversely affects the achievement of an objective
uncertainty therefore is a key aspect of risk
systems like the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission enterprise risk management coso erm can assist managers in mitigating risk factors
each company may have different internal control components which leads to different outcomes
for example the framework for erm components includes internal environment objective setting event identification risk assessment risk response control activities information and communication and monitoring
opportunities first appear in academic research or management books in the s
the first pmbok project management body of knowledge draft of doesn t mention opportunities at all
modern project management school does recognize the importance of opportunities
opportunities have been included in project management literature since the s e g
in pmbok and became a significant part of project risk management in the years s when articles titled opportunity management also begin to appear in library searches
opportunity management thus became an important part of risk management
modern risk management theory deals with any type of external events positive and negative
positive risks are called opportunities
similarly to risks opportunities have specific mitigation strategies exploit share enhance ignore
in practice risks are considered usually negative
risk related research and practice focus significantly more on threats than on opportunities
this can lead to negative phenomena such as target fixation
for the most part these methods consist of the following elements performed more or less in the following order
identify the threats
assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats
determine the risk i e
the expected likelihood and consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets
identify ways to reduce those risks
prioritize risk reduction measuresthe risk management knowledge area as defined by the project management body of knowledge pmbok consists of the following processes
plan risk management defining how to conduct risk management activities
identify risks identifying individual project risks as well as sources
perform qualitative risk analysis prioritizing individual project risks by assessing probability and impact
perform quantitative risk analysis numerical analysis of the effects
plan risk responses developing options selecting strategies and actions
implement risk responses implementing agreed upon risk response plans
in the th ed
of pmbok this process was included as an activity in the monitor and control process but was later separated as a distinct process in pmbok th ed
monitor risks monitoring the implementation
this process was known as monitor and control in the previous pmbok th ed when it also included the implement risk responses process the international organization for standardization iso identifies the following principles of risk management
risk management should
create value resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction
be an integral part of organizational processes
be part of decision making process
explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions
be a systematic and structured process
be based on the best available information
be tailorable
take human factors into account
be transparent and inclusive
be dynamic iterative and responsive to change
be capable of continual improvement and enhancement
be continually or periodically re assessedbenoit mandelbrot distinguished between mild and wild risk and argued that risk assessment and management must be fundamentally different for the two types of risk
mild risk follows normal or near normal probability distributions is subject to regression to the mean and the law of large numbers and is therefore relatively predictable
wild risk follows fat tailed distributions e g pareto or power law distributions is subject to regression to the tail infinite mean or variance rendering the law of large numbers invalid or ineffective and is therefore difficult or impossible to predict
a common error in risk assessment and management is to underestimate the wildness of risk assuming risk to be mild when in fact it is wild which must be avoided if risk assessment and management are to be valid and reliable according to mandelbrot
according to the standard iso risk management principles and guidelines on implementation the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows
this involves
observing the context
the social scope of risk management
the identity and objectives of stakeholders
the basis upon which risks will be evaluated constraints
defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification
developing an analysis of risks involved in the process
mitigation or solution of risks using available technological human and organizational resourcesafter establishing the context the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks
risks are about events that when triggered cause problems or benefits
hence risk identification can start with the source of problems and those of competitors benefit or with the problem s consequences
source analysis risk sources may be internal or external to the system that is the target of risk management use mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals with factors of decision making that cannot be managed some examples of risk sources are stakeholders of a project employees of a company or the weather over an airport
problem analysis risks are related to identified threats
for example the threat of losing money the threat of abuse of confidential information or the threat of human errors accidents and casualties
the threats may exist with various entities most important with shareholders customers and legislative bodies such as the government when either source or problem is known the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated
for example stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties
the chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture industry practice and compliance
the identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source problem or event
common risk identification methods are
objectives based risk identification organizations and project teams have objectives
any event that may prevent an objective from being achieved is identified as risk
scenario based risk identification in scenario analysis different scenarios are created
the scenarios may be the alternative ways to achieve an objective or an analysis of the interaction of forces in for example a market or battle
any event that triggers an undesired scenario alternative is identified as risk see futures studies for methodology used by futurists
taxonomy based risk identification the taxonomy in taxonomy based risk identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources
based on the taxonomy and knowledge of best practices a questionnaire is compiled
the answers to the questions reveal risks
common risk checking in several industries lists with known risks are available
each risk in the list can be checked for application to a particular situation
risk charting this method combines the above approaches by listing resources at risk threats to those resources modifying factors which may increase or decrease the risk and consequences it is wished to avoid
creating a matrix under these headings enables a variety of approaches
one can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to and the consequences of each
alternatively one can start with the threats and examine which resources they would affect or one can begin with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and resources would be involved to bring them about once risks have been identified they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact generally a negative impact such as damage or loss and to the probability of occurrence
these quantities can be either simple to measure in the case of the value of a lost building or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event the probability of occurrence of which is unknown
therefore in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the risk management plan
even a short term positive improvement can have long term negative impacts
take the turnpike example
a highway is widened to allow more traffic
more traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity
over time traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity
turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles
there are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity to do any function is soon filled by increased demand
since expansion comes at a cost the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management
the fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events simply because of their infrequency
furthermore evaluating the severity of the consequences impact is often quite difficult for intangible assets
asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed
thus best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information
nevertheless risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals
thus there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks
numerous different risk formulae exist but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is rate or probability of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude
risk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options which are
design a new business process with adequate built in risk control and containment measures from the start
periodically re assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures
transfer risks to an external agency e g
an insurance company
avoid risks altogether e g
by closing down a particular high risk business area later research has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed
in business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial market or schedule terms
robert courtney jr
ibm proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms
the courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the us governmental agencies
the formula proposes calculation of ale annualized loss expectancy and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs cost benefit analysis
once risks have been identified and assessed all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories
avoidance eliminate withdraw from or not become involved
reduction optimize mitigate
sharing transfer outsource or insure
retention accept and budget ideal use of these risk control strategies may not be possible
some of them may involve trade offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions
another source from the us department of defense see link defense acquisition university calls these categories acat for avoid control accept or transfer
this use of the acat acronym is reminiscent of another acat for acquisition category used in us defense industry procurements in which risk management figures prominently in decision making and planning
similarly to risks opportunities have specific mitigation strategies exploit share enhance ignore
this includes not performing an activity that could present risk
refusing to purchase a property or business to avoid legal liability is one such example
avoiding airplane flights for fear of hijacking
avoidance may seem like the answer to all risks but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting retaining the risk may have allowed
not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits
increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions in favor of patients presenting with lower risk
risk reduction or optimization involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring
for example sprinklers are designed to put out a fire to reduce the risk of loss by fire
this method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable
halon fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk but the cost may be prohibitive as a strategy
acknowledging that risks can be positive or negative optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity and between risk reduction and effort applied
by effectively applying health safety and environment hse management standards organizations can achieve tolerable levels of residual risk
modern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally
early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project
by developing in iterations software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration
outsourcing could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks
for example a company may outsource only its software development the manufacturing of hard goods or customer support needs to another company while handling the business management itself
this way the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process managing the development team or finding a physical location for a center
also implanting controls can also be an option in reducing risk
controls that either detect causes of unwanted events prior to the consequences occurring during use of the product or detection of the root causes of unwanted failures that the team can then avoid
controls may focus on management or decision making processes
all these may help to make better decisions concerning risk
briefly defined as sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain from a risk and the measures to reduce a risk
the term risk transfer is often used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing
in practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party
as such in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a transfer of risk however technically speaking the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses transferred meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post event compensatory mechanism
for example a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company
the risk still lies with the policyholder namely the person who has been in the accident
the insurance policy simply provides that if an accident the event occurs involving the policyholder then some compensation may be payable to the policyholder that is commensurate with the suffering damage
methods of managing risk fall into multiple categories
risk retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group
this is different from traditional insurance in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group upfront but instead losses are assessed to all members of the group
risk retention involves accepting the loss or benefit of gain from a risk when the incident occurs
true self insurance falls in this category
risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained
all risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default
this includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible
war is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured
also any amounts of potential loss risk over the amount insured is retained risk
this may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much
select appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk
risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management
for instance a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas it management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks
the risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks
for example an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software
a good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions
according to iso iec the stage immediately after completion of the risk assessment phase consists of preparing a risk treatment plan which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled
mitigation of risks often means selection of security controls which should be documented in a statement of applicability which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the
standard have been selected and why
implementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks
purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity s goals reduce others and retain the rest
initial risk management plans will never be perfect
practice experience and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced
risk analysis results and management plans should be updated periodically
there are two primary reasons for this
to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still applicable and effective
to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment
for example information risks are a good example of rapidly changing business environment prioritizing the risk management processes too highly could keep an organization from ever completing a project or even getting started
this is especially true if other work is suspended until the risk management process is considered complete
it is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk and uncertainty
risk can be measured by impacts probability
if risks are improperly assessed and prioritized time can be wasted in dealing with risk of losses that are not likely to occur
spending too much time assessing and managing unlikely risks is to be avoided
unlikely events do occur but if the risk is unlikely enough to occur it may be better to simply retain the risk and deal with the result if the loss does in fact occur
qualitative risk assessment is subjective and lacks consistency
the primary justification for a formal risk assessment process is legal and bureaucratic
as applied to finance risk management concerns the techniques and practices for measuring monitoring and controlling the market risk credit risk and operational risk on a firm s balance sheet on a bank s trading book or re a fund manager s portfolio value
a traditional measure in banking is value at risk var the possible loss due to adverse credit and market events
banks seek to hedge these risks and will hold risk capital on the net position
the basel iii framework governs the parallel regulatory capital requirements including for operational risk
fund managers employ various strategies to protect their fund value these given their mandate and benchmark
non financial firms focus on business risk more generally i e
those events and occurrences which could negatively impact cash flow or profitability and hence result in a loss of business value or a decline in share price in information technology risk management includes incident handling an action plan for dealing with intrusions cyber theft denial of service fire floods and other security related events
according to the sans institute it is a six step process preparation identification containment eradication recovery and lessons learned
the concept of contractual risk management emphasises the use of risk management techniques in contract deployment i e
managing the risks which are accepted through entry into a contract
norwegian academic petri keskitalo defines contractual risk management as a practical proactive and systematical contracting method that uses contract planning and governance to manage risks connected to business activities
in an article by samuel greengard published in two us legal cases are mentioned which emphasise the importance of having a strategy for dealing with risk
udc v
ch m hill which deals with the risk to a professional advisor who signs an indemnification provision including acceptance of a duty to defend who may thereby pick up the legal costs of defending a client subject to a claim from a third party
witt v
la gorce country club which deals with the effectiveness of a limitation of liability clause which may in certain jurisdictions be found to be ineffective greengard recommends using industry standard contract language as much as possible to reduce risk as much as possible and rely on clauses which have been in use and subject to established court interpretation over a number of years
in enterprise risk management a risk is defined as a possible event or circumstance that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question
its impact can be on the very existence the resources human and capital the products and services or the customers of the enterprise as well as external impacts on society markets or the environment
in a financial institution enterprise risk management is normally thought of as the combination of credit risk interest rate risk or asset liability management liquidity risk market risk and operational risk
in the more general case every probable risk can have a pre formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences to ensure contingency if the risk becomes a liability

the probable increase in time associated with a risk schedule variance due to risk rs where rs p s
sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the schedule first
this is intended to cause the greatest risks to the project to be attempted first so that risk is minimized as quickly as possible
this is slightly misleading as schedule variances with a large p and small s and vice versa are not equivalent
the risk of the rms titanic sinking vs

the probable increase in cost associated with a risk cost variance due to risk rc where rc p c p car s p s car
sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the budget first
see concerns about schedule variance as this is a function of it as illustrated in the equation above risk in a project or process can be due either to special cause variation or common cause variation and requires appropriate treatment
that is to re iterate the concern about extremal cases not being equivalent in the list immediately above
esrm is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise s mission and business goals through risk management methods
the security leader s role in esrm is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks
esrm involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance
for medical devices risk management is a process for identifying evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment
risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development production processes and evaluation of field experience and is applicable to all types of medical devices
the evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the us fda
the management of risks for medical devices is described by the international organization for standardization iso in iso medical devices the application of risk management to medical devices a product safety standard
the standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities risk analysis and evaluation risk controls and lifecycle risk management
guidance on the application of the standard is available via iso tr
the european version of the risk management standard was updated in and again in to refer to the medical devices directive mdd and active implantable medical device directive aimdd revision in as well as the in vitro medical device directive ivdd
the requirements of en are nearly identical to iso
the differences include three informative z annexes that refer to the new mdd aimdd and ivdd
these annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced as far as possible and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device i e labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk
typical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include hazard analysis fault tree analysis fta failure mode and effects analysis fmea hazard and operability study hazop and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective i e
tracking risks identified to product requirements design specifications verification and validation results etc
fta analysis requires diagramming software
fmea analysis can be done using a spreadsheet program
there are also integrated medical device risk management solutions
through a draft guidance the fda has introduced another method named safety assurance case for medical device safety assurance analysis
the safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers supported by a body of evidence that provides a compelling comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment
with the guidance a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices e g
infusion devices as part of the pre market clearance submission e g
in the fda introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information
project risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition
in the beginning of a project the advancement of technical developments or threats presented by a competitor s projects may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives see analysis of alternatives
once a decision is made and the project begun more familiar project management applications can be used
planning how risk will be managed in the particular project
plans should include risk management tasks responsibilities activities and budget
assigning a risk officer a team member other than a project manager who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems
typical characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism
maintaining live project risk database
each risk should have the following attributes opening date title short description probability and importance
optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved
creating anonymous risk reporting channel
each team member should have the possibility to report risks that he she foresees in the project
preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated
the purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk will be handled what when by whom and how will it be done to avoid it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability
summarizing planned and faced risks effectiveness of mitigation activities and effort spent for the risk management megaprojects sometimes also called major programs are large scale investment projects typically costing more than billion per project
megaprojects include major bridges tunnels highways railways airports seaports power plants dams wastewater projects coastal flood protection schemes oil and natural gas extraction projects public buildings information technology systems aerospace projects and defense systems
megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance safety and social and environmental impacts
risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for such risk management
it is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods earthquakes and so on
outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs business interruption losses and other downtime effects on the environment insurance costs and the proposed costs of reducing the risk
the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction is a international accord that has set goals and targets for disaster risk reduction in response to natural disasters
there are regular international disaster and risk conferences in davos to deal with integral risk management
several tools can be used to assess risk and risk management of natural disasters and other climate events including geospatial modeling a key component of land change science
this modeling requires an understanding of geographic distributions of people as well as an ability to calculate the likelihood of a natural disaster occurring
the management of risks to persons and property in wilderness and remote natural areas has developed with increases in outdoor recreation participation and decreased social tolerance for loss
organizations providing commercial wilderness experiences can now align with national and international consensus standards for training and equipment such as ansi nasbla boating uiaa ice climbing tools and european norm a mountaineering equipment
the association for experiential education offers accreditation for wilderness adventure programs
the wilderness risk management conference provides access to best practices and specialist organizations provide wilderness risk management consulting and training
in his book outdoor leadership and education climber outdoor educator and author ari schneider notes that outdoor recreation is inherently risky and there is no way to eliminate risk
however he explains how that can be a good thing for outdoor education programs
according to schneider optimal adventure is achieved when real risk is managed and perceived risk is maintained in order to keep actual danger low and a sense of adventure high
the text outdoor safety risk management for outdoor leaders published by the new zealand mountain safety council provides a view of wilderness risk management from the new zealand perspective recognizing the value of national outdoor safety legislation and devoting considerable attention to the roles of judgment and decision making processes in wilderness risk management
one popular models for risk assessment is the risk assessment and safety management rasm model developed by rick curtis author of the backpacker s field manual
the formula for the rasm model is risk probability of accident severity of consequences
the rasm model weighs negative risk the potential for loss against positive risk the potential for growth
it risk is a risk related to information technology
this is a relatively new term due to an increasing awareness that information security is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to it and the real world processes it supports
cybersecurity is tied closely to the advancement of technology
it lags only long enough for incentives like black markets to evolve and new exploits to be discovered
there is no end in sight for the advancement of technology so we can expect the same from cybersecurity
isaca s risk it framework ties it risk to enterprise risk management
duty of care risk analysis docra evaluates risks and their safeguards and considers the interests of all parties potentially affected by those risks
for the offshore oil and gas industry operational risk management is regulated by the safety case regime in many countries
hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard iso and organisations such as the iadc international association of drilling contractors publish guidelines for health safety and environment hse case development which are based on the iso standard
further diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions these are known as bow tie diagrams see network theory in risk assessment
the technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining aviation health defence industrial and finance
the principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems
these aspects include development manufacturing distribution inspection and submission review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances drug products biological and biotechnological products including the use of raw materials solvents excipients packaging and labeling materials in drug products biological and biotechnological products
risk management is also applied to the assessment of microbiological contamination in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments
