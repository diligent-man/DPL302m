Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus
An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion these occur in approximately to of pregnancies
When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy it is called an induced abortion or less frequently induced miscarriage
The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion
When properly done induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine
In the United States the risk of maternal mortality is times lower after induced abortion than after childbirth
However unsafe abortions—those performed by people lacking the necessary skills or in inadequately resourced settings—are a major cause of maternal death especially in the developing world
Public-health data show that making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths
Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions
The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy
The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device
Birth control such as the pill or intrauterine devices can be used immediately following abortion
When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems
In contrast unsafe abortions those performed by unskilled individuals with hazardous equipment or in unsanitary facilities cause deaths and million hospital admissions each year
The World Health Organization states that access to legal safe and comprehensive abortion care including post-abortion care is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health
Around million abortions are performed each year in the world with about done unsafely
Abortion rates changed little between and before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased
As of of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason
Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed
Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it
Historically abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines sharp tools forceful massage or through other traditional methods
Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world
In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape fetal defects poverty risk to a woman's health or incest
There is debate over the moral ethical and legal issues of abortion
Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life and thus equate abortion with murder
Those who support the legality of abortion often argue that it is part of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body
Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure
Approximately million pregnancies occur each year worldwide
Over a third are unintended and about a fifth end in induced abortion
In the United Kingdom to of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus
A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways
The manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses
Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality regional availability and doctor or a woman's personal preference
Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective
An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to save the life of the pregnant woman to prevent harm to the woman's physical or mental health to terminate a pregnancy where indications are that the child will have a significantly increased chance of mortality or morbidity or to selectively reduce the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with multiple pregnancy
An abortion is referred to as an elective or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non-medical reasons
Confusion sometimes arises over the term elective because elective surgery generally refers to all scheduled surgery whether medically necessary or not
Miscarriage also known as spontaneous abortion is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the th week of gestation
A pregnancy that ends before weeks of gestation resulting in a live-born infant is a premature birth or a preterm birth
When a fetus dies in utero after viability or during delivery it is usually termed stillborn
Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap
Studies of pregnant women in the US and China have shown that between and of embryos do not progress to birth
The vast majority of miscarriages occur before the woman is aware that she is pregnant and many pregnancies spontaneously abort before medical practitioners can detect an embryo
Between and of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman
of these spontaneous abortions happen in the first trimester
The most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus accounting for at least of sampled early pregnancy losses
Other causes include vascular disease such as lupus diabetes other hormonal problems infection and abnormalities of the uterus
Advancing maternal age and a woman's history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion
A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide
Medical abortions are those induced by abortifacient pharmaceuticals
Medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the s and the antiprogestogen mifepristone also known as RU- in the s
The most common early first-trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with misoprostol or sometimes another prostaglandin analog gemeprost up to weeks days gestational age methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to weeks gestation or a prostaglandin analog alone
Mifepristonemisoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexatemisoprostol combination regimens and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone
This regimen is effective in the second trimester
Medical abortion regimens involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between and hours later are effective when performed before days' gestation
In very early abortions up to weeks gestation medical abortion using a mifepristonemisoprostol combination regimen is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion vacuum aspiration especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of aspirated tissue
Early medical abortion regimens using mifepristone followed hours later by buccal or vaginal misoprostol are effective up to weeks gestational age from to weeks efficacy decreases modestly to
If medical abortion fails surgical abortion must be used to complete the procedure
Early medical abortions account for the majority of abortions before weeks gestation in Britain France Switzerland United States and the Nordic countries
Medical abortion regimens using mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog are the most common methods used for second-trimester abortions in Canada most of Europe China and India in contrast to the United States where of second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by dilation and evacuation
A Cochrane Systematic Review concluded that providing women with medications to take home to complete the second stage of the procedure for an early medical abortion results in an effective abortion
Further research is required to determine if self-administered medical abortion is as safe as provider-administered medical abortion where a health care professional is present to help manage the medical abortion
Safely permitting women to self-administer abortion medication has the potential to improve access to abortion
Other research gaps that were identified include how to best support women who choose to take the medication home for a self-administered abortion
Up to weeks' gestation suction-aspiration or vacuum aspiration are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion
Manual vacuum aspiration MVA consists of removing the fetus or embryo placenta and membranes by suction using a manual syringe while electric vacuum aspiration EVA uses an electric pump
These techniques can both be used very early in pregnancy
MVA can be used up to weeks but is more often used earlier in the US
MVA also known as mini-suction and menstrual extraction or EVA can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dilation may not be required
Dilation and curettage DC refers to opening the cervix dilation and removing tissue curettage via suction or sharp instruments
DC is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy investigation of abnormal bleeding and abortion
The World Health Organization recommends sharp curettage only when suction aspiration is unavailable
Dilation and evacuation DE used after to weeks consists of opening the cervix and emptying the uterus using surgical instruments and suction
DE is performed vaginally and does not require an incision
Intact dilation and extraction DX refers to a variant of DE sometimes used after to weeks when removal of an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons
Abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy
Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia
It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy
Gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy
Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than DE or induction abortion
First-trimester procedures can generally be performed using local anesthesia while second-trimester methods may require deep sedation or general anesthesia
In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction or where preferred by practitioners an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary
This procedure may be performed from weeks gestation to the third trimester
Although it is very uncommon in the United States more than of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor-induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries
Only limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction
Unlike DE labor-induced abortions after weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival which may be legally characterized as live birth
For this reason labor-induced abortion is legally risky in the United States
Historically a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine
Among these are tansy pennyroyal black cohosh and the now-extinct silphium
In one woman in Colorado died and another developed organ damage when they attempted to terminate their pregnancies by taking pennyroyal oil
Because the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects such as multiple organ failure such use is not recommended by physicians
Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen
The degree of force if severe can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage
In Southeast Asia there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage
One of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld
Reported methods of unsafe self-induced abortion include misuse of misoprostol and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus
These and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called induced miscarriage
Such methods are rarely used in countries where surgical abortion is legal and available
The health risks of abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafely
The World Health Organization WHO defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals with hazardous equipment or in unsanitary facilities
Legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the safest procedures in medicine
In the United States as of abortion was estimated to be about times safer for women than childbirth
CDC estimated in that US pregnancy-related mortality was maternal deaths per live births while the US abortion mortality rate is maternal deaths per procedures
In the UK guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term Worldwide on average abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term
A study reported that of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion whereas deaths from improperly performed abortion procedures constitute of maternal mortality globally In Indonesia in it was estimated that million pregnancies ended in abortion million pregnancies were carried to term and - percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion
In the US from to abortion had a mortality rate lower than plastic surgery lower or similar to running a marathon and about equivalent to traveling miles km in a passenger car
Five years after seeking abortion services women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions
The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age but remains lower than that of childbirth
Outpatient abortion is as safe from to days' gestation as it before days
There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion vacuum aspiration in early first trimester abortions up to weeks gestation
Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion
Vacuum aspiration in the first trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion and can be performed in a primary care office abortion clinic or hospital
Complications which are rare can include uterine perforation pelvic infection and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate
Infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the United States
The rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion in the first trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in a hospital surgical center or office
Preventive antibiotics such as doxycycline or metronidazole are typically given before abortion procedures as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection however antibiotics are not routinely given with abortion pills
The rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid-level practitioner
Complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion and depend somewhat on the method chosen
The risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy from one in a million before weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at weeks or more as measured from the last menstrual period
It appears that having had a prior surgical uterine evacuation whether because of induced abortion or treatment of miscarriage correlates with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies
The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage and hence the causes of this correlation have not been determined although multiple possibilities have been suggested
Some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion groups
For example the question of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer has been investigated extensively
Major medical and scientific bodies including the WHO National Cancer Institute American Cancer Society Royal College of OBGYN and American Congress of OBGYN have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer
In the past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe
Referring to the US historian Linda Gordon states In fact illegal abortions in this country have an impressive safety record According to Rickie Solinger
Authors Jerome Bates and Edward Zawadzki describe the case of an illegal abortionist in the eastern US
in the early th century who was proud of having successfully completed abortions without any fatality
In s New York City the famous abortionistmidwife Madame Restell Anna Trow Lohman appears to have lost very few women among her more than patients—a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the time
In the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology Frederick J
Taussig wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the US
Current evidence finds no relationship between most induced abortions and mental health problems other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy
A report by the American Psychological Association concluded that a woman's first abortion is not a threat to mental health when carried out in the first trimester with such women no more likely to have mental-health problems than those carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term the mental-health outcome of a woman's second or greater abortion is less certain
Some older reviews concluded that abortion was associated with an increased risk of psychological problems however they did not use an appropriate control group
Although some studies show negative mental-health outcomes in women who choose abortions after the first trimester because of fetal abnormalities more rigorous research would be needed to show this conclusively
Some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by anti-abortion advocates as a separate condition called post-abortion syndrome but this is not recognized by medical or psychological professionals in the United States
A long term-study among US women found that about of women felt that they made the right decision five years after they had an abortion
Relief was the primary emotion with few women feeling sadness or guilt
Social stigma was a main factor predicting negative emotions and regret years later
Women seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods especially when it is legally restricted
They may attempt self-induced abortion or seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities
This can lead to severe complications such as incomplete abortion sepsis hemorrhage and damage to internal organs
Unsafe abortions are a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide
Although data are imprecise it is estimated that approximately million unsafe abortions are performed annually with taking place in developing countries
Unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of injuries
Estimates of deaths vary according to methodology and have ranged from to in the past decade deaths from unsafe abortion account for around of all maternal deaths
The World Health Organization believes that mortality has fallen since the s
To reduce the number of unsafe abortions public health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the legalization of abortion training of medical personnel and ensuring access to reproductive-health services
A major factor in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the legal standing of abortion
Countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion and similar overall abortion rates compared to those where abortion is legal and available
For example the legalization of abortion in South Africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion-related complications with abortion-related deaths dropping by more than
Similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberalized their abortion laws such as Romania and Nepal
A study concluded that in the United States some state-level anti-abortion laws are correlated with lower rates of abortion in that state
The analysis however did not take into account travel to other states without such laws to obtain an abortion
In addition a lack of access to effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion
It has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by up to from million to million annually if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally
Rates of such abortions may be difficult to measure because they can be reported variously as miscarriage induced miscarriage menstrual regulation mini-abortion and regulation of a delayedsuspended menstruation
Forty percent of the world's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits while an additional percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical mental or socioeconomic criteria
While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions unsafe abortions result in deaths and million disabilities per year
Complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortalities worldwide though this varies by region
Secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated million women
The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from to between and
Health education access to family planning and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon
There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion
Abortion rate number of abortions annually per women between and years of age some sources use a range of
Abortion percentage number of abortions out of known pregnancies pregnancies include live births abortions and miscarriagesIn many places where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma medical reporting of abortion is not reliable
For this reason estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error
The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years with million having been performed in and million having been performed in
The abortion rate worldwide was per women per year though it was per women per year for developed countries and per women per year for developing countries
The same study indicated that in the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at worldwide with in developed countries and in developing countries
On average the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion
However restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely
The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives according to the Guttmacher Institute providing access to contraceptives would result in about million fewer unsafe abortions and fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide
The rate of legal induced abortion varies extensively worldwide
According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from per women per year Germany and Switzerland to per women per year Estonia in countries with complete statistics in
The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about Israel the Netherlands and Switzerland to Estonia in the same group though it might be as high as in Hungary and Romania whose statistics were deemed incomplete
An American study in concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant
Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the birth control pill of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage
The Guttmacher Institute estimated that most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women because minority women have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy
In while people of color comprise of the population in Mississippi of the population in Texas of the population in Louisiana and of the population in Alabama they comprise and of those receiving abortions
The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years this is referred to as total abortion rate TAR
Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced
In the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reported that of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than weeks' gestation at weeks at weeks at through weeks at through weeks at through weeks at through weeks and at more than weeks
of these were classified as having been done by curettage suction-aspiration dilation and curettage dilation and evacuation by medical means mifepristone by intrauterine instillation saline or prostaglandin and by other including hysterotomy and hysterectomy
According to the CDC due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion
The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were intact dilation and extraction procedures in the US during this accounts for of the total number of abortions performed that year
Similarly in England and Wales in of terminations occurred at or under weeks between and weeks and at or over weeks
of those reported were by vacuum aspiration by DE and were medical
There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China India and Vietnam than in developed countries
The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world
Some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child domestic violence lack of support feeling they are too young and the wish to complete education or advance a career
Additional reasons include not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest
Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures
These might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race disapproval of single or early motherhood stigmatization of people with disabilities insufficient economic support for families lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods or efforts toward population control such as China's one-child policy
These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex-selective abortion
An additional factor is maternal health which was listed as the main reason by about a third of women in of countries and about of women in a further of these countries
In the US the Supreme Court decisions in Roe v
Bolton ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother
Even after the point of viability the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman
Under the right of privacy physicians must be free to use their medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother On the same day that the Court decided Roe it also decided Doe v
Bolton in which the Court defined health very broadly The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical emotional psychological familial and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient
All these factors may relate to health
This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment
Public opinion shifted in America following television personality Sherri Finkbine's discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to thalidomide
Unable to obtain a legal abortion in the United States she traveled to Sweden
From to an outbreak of German measles left babies with severe birth defects
In the American Medical Association publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws
A National Opinion Research Center poll in showed supported abortion when the mother's life was at risk when birth defects were present and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest
The rate of cancer during pregnancy is and in many cases cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment
This is particularly true for cervical cancer the most common type of which occurs in of every pregnancies for which initiation of treatment cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life unless neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen
Very early stage cervical cancers I and IIa may be treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection radiation therapy or both while later stages are treated by radiotherapy
Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations because lumpectomy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mastectomy unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth
Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a risk of teratogenic effects on the fetus with higher risks for multiple drug treatments
Treatment with more than Gy of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion
Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester especially to weeks of development can cause intellectual disability or microcephaly and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight
Exposures above Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in IQ
It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus
The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk
Vaginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels haemorrhage cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non-surgical treatment
Since ancient times abortions have been done using a number of methods including herbal medicines sharp tools with force or through other traditional methods
Induced abortion has a long history and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as ancient China abortifacient knowledge is often attributed to the mythological ruler Shennong ancient India since its Vedic age ancient Egypt with its Ebers Papyrus c BCE and the Roman Empire in the time of Juvenal c CE
One of the earliest known artistic representations of abortion is in a bas relief at Angkor Wat c
Found in a series of friezes that represent judgment after death in Hindu and Buddhist culture it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion
Some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the Hippocratic Oath forbade Ancient Greek physicians from performing abortions other scholars disagree with this interpretation and state that the medical texts of Hippocratic Corpus contain descriptions of abortive techniques right alongside the Oath
The physician Scribonius Largus wrote in CE that the Hippocratic Oath prohibits abortion as did Soranus although apparently not all doctors adhered to it strictly at the time
According to Soranus' st or nd century CE work Gynaecology one party of medical practitioners banished all abortives as required by the Hippocratic Oath the other party—to which he belonged—was willing to prescribe abortions but only for the sake of the mother's health
Aristotle in his treatise on government Politics BCE condemns infanticide as a means of population control
He preferred abortion in such cases with the restriction that it must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive
In Christianity and in the Catholic Church in particular opinion was divided on how serious abortion was in comparison with such acts as contraception oral sex and sex in marriage for pleasure rather than procreation and the Catholic Church did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the th century
the Didache taught that abortion was sinful
Several historians have written that prior to the th century most Catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before quickening or ensoulment as an abortion
Among these authors were the Doctors of the Church St
Pope Sixtus V was the only Pope before Pope Pius IX in his bull Apostolicae Sedis to institute a Church policy labeling all abortion as homicide and condemning abortion regardless of the stage of pregnancy
However Sixtus' pronouncement of was reversed three years later by Pope Gregory XIV
In the recodification of Canon Law in Apostolicae Sedis was strengthened in part to remove a possible reading that excluded excommunication of the mother
Statements made in in the Catechism of the Catholic Church the codified summary of the current Church's teachings considered abortion from the moment of conception as homicide and called for the end of legal abortion
A Guttmacher survey of US abortion patients found that many reported a religious affiliation— were Catholic while were Protestant
A survey reported that Catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy Protestants are less likely to do so and Evangelical Christians are the least likely to do so
A Pew Research Study found that all Christians denominations at around except White Evangelicals at were against overturning Roe Vs Wade which in the US legalized Abortion as the general public
Islamic tradition has traditionally permitted abortion until a point in time when Muslims believe the soul enters the fetus considered by various theologians to be at conception days after conception days after conception or quickening
However abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high Islamic faith such as the Middle East and North Africa
In Europe and North America abortion techniques advanced starting in the th century but the conservatism of most in the medical profession with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of abortion techniques
Other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services and they were not widely regulated until the th century when the practice sometimes called restellism was banned in both the United States and the United Kingdom
Church groups as well as physicians were highly influential in anti-abortion movements
In the US according to some sources abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about when incremental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer
Other sources maintain that in the th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe
In addition some commentators have written that despite improved medical procedures the period from the s until legalization also saw more zealous enforcement of anti-abortion laws and concomitantly an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime
Soviet Russia Iceland and Sweden were among the first countries to legalize certain or all forms of abortion
In Nazi Germany a law permitted abortions for those deemed hereditarily ill while women considered of German stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions
Beginning in the second half of the th century abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries
Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate
Ethical moral philosophical biological religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to value systems
Opinions of abortion may be about fetal rights governmental authority and women's rights
In both public and private debate arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion
The World Medical Association Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated Abortion debates especially pertaining to abortion laws are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions
Groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion including complete prohibition most often describe themselves as pro-life while groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as pro-choice
Generally the former position argues that a human fetus is a human person with a right to live making abortion morally the same as murder
The latter position argues that a woman has certain reproductive rights especially the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term
Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse
Religious moral and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world
The right to life the right to liberty the right to security of person and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws
In jurisdictions where abortion is legal certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a legal abortion an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered feticide
These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus often using a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality or as in the US on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' viability
Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion
Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including risks not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary
Many restrictions are waived in emergency situations
China which has ended their one-child policy and now has a two child policy has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy
Many but not all of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances
These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest the fetus' development is impaired the woman's physical or mental well-being is endangered or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship
In countries where abortion is banned entirely such as Nicaragua medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies
Some countries such as Bangladesh that nominally ban abortion may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene
This is also a terminology in traditional medicine
In places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies
Women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves
The organization Women on Waves has been providing education about medical abortions since
The NGO created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws
Because the ships are registered in the Netherlands Dutch law prevails when the ship is in international waters
While in port the organization provides free workshops and education while in international waters medical personnel are legally able to prescribe medical abortion drugs and counseling
Sonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth
The development of this technology has led to sex-selective abortion or the termination of a fetus based on its sex
The selective termination of a female fetus is most common
Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries
The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan South Korea India and China
This deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex-selective abortion or even sex-screening
In China a historical preference for a male child has been exacerbated by the one-child policy which was enacted in
Many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex-selective abortion
At the International Conference on Population and Development in over states agreed to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference conditions also condemned by a PACE resolution in
The World Health Organization and UNICEF along with other United Nations agencies have found that measures to reduce access to abortion are much less effective at reducing sex-selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality
In a number of cases abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence including murder attempted murder kidnapping stalking assault arson and bombing
Anti-abortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism
and Canada over incidents of violence trespassing and death threats have been recorded by providers since including over bombingsarsons and hundreds of assaults
The majority of abortion opponents have not been involved in violent acts
In the United States four physicians who performed abortions have been murdered David Gunn John Britton Barnett Slepian and George Tiller
and Australia have been other personnel at abortion clinics including receptionists and security guards such as James Barrett Shannon Lowney Lee Ann Nichols and Robert Sanderson
Woundings eg Garson Romalis and attempted murders have also taken place in the United States and Canada
Hundreds of bombings arsons acid attacks invasions and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have occurred
Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include Eric Robert Rudolph Scott Roeder Shelley Shannon and Paul Jennings Hill the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider
Legal protection of access to abortion has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal
These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction vandalism picketing and other actions or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment
Far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure
In Chris Danze organized anti-abortion organizations throughout Texas to prevent the construction of a Planned Parenthood facility in Austin
The organizations released the personal information online of those involved with construction sending them up to phone calls a day and contacting their churches
Some protestors record women entering clinics on camera
For example in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical exertion such as crowding through doors or being chased by dogs
In cows abortion may be caused by contagious disease such as brucellosis or Campylobacter but can often be controlled by vaccination
