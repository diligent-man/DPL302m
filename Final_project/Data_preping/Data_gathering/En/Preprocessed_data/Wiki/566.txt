He died on July in Portland Oregon of cancer at the age of In keeping with a special tradition his daughter Lucienne Bloch and her husband Steve Dimitroff prepared several death masks of Ernest Bloch This once common practice was usually undertaken to create a memento or portrait of the deceased but it is unusual for an immediate family member to make the death mask The Center for Creative Photography and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music each have a copy of Bloch's death mask His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Pacific ocean near his home in Agate Beach
Bloch's compositions are often described as reflecting his Jewish heritage yet had many other sources Perhaps what is at the heart of the question is his genius for evocative color in music If some of his works evoke the atmosphere of the Old Testament they operate elsewhere with equally telling and totally different effect the Gauguinesque South Seas in the slow movement of the first Quintet and the Chinese of the Episodes are examples Beside Israel stand Helvetia and America beside Scenes from Jewish Life stands Nirvana
Bloch's musical style does not fit easily into any of the usual categories He studied variously with mile Jaques Dalcroze Iwan Knorr and Ludwig Thuille as well as corresponding with Mahler and meeting Debussy Many of his works as can be seen from their Hebrew inspired titles also draw heavily on his Jewish heritage Bloch's father had at one stage intended to become a rabbi and the young Ernest had a strong religious upbringing as an adult he felt that to write music that expressed his Jewish identity was the only way in which I can produce music of vitality and significance
The music of Bloch uses a variety of contemporary harmonic devices These are enumerated in Vincent Persichetti s book Twentieth Century Harmony
According to Persichetti these include the use of the Dorian mode and of harmony with extensive alterations in his Concerto Grosso No tone clusters in his Piano Sonata No the percussive use of harmony as well as serial harmony in his Piano Quintet
