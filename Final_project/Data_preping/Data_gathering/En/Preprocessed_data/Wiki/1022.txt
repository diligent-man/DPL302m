Ska skɑː Jamaican skjæ is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae
It combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues
Ska is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off beat
It was developed in Jamaica in the s when Stranger Cole Prince Buster Clement Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm and blues and then began recording their own songs
In the early s ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods and with many skinheads
Music historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods the original Jamaican scene of the s the Tone ska revival of the late s in Britain which fused Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with the faster tempos and harder edge of punk rock forming ska-punk and third wave ska which involved bands from a wide range of countries around the world in the late s and s
There are multiple theories about the origins of the word ska
Ernest Ranglin claimed that the term was coined by musicians to refer to the skat skat skat scratching guitar strum
Another explanation is that at a recording session in produced by Coxsone Dodd double bassist Cluett Johnson instructed guitarist Ranglin to play like ska ska ska although Ranglin has denied this stating Clue couldn't tell me what to play A further theory is that it derives from Johnson's word skavoovie with which he was known to greet his friends
Jackie Mittoo insisted that the musicians called the rhythm Staya Staya and that it was Byron Lee who introduced the term ska
Derrick Morgan said Guitar and piano making a ska sound like 'ska ska
After World War II Jamaicans purchased radios in increasing numbers and were able to hear rhythm and blues music from the Southern United States in cities such as New Orleans by artists such as Fats Domino Barbie Gaye Rosco Gordon and Louis Jordan whose early recordings all contain the seeds of the behind-the-beat feel of ska and reggae
The stationing of American military forces during and after the war meant that Jamaicans could listen to military broadcasts of American music and there was a constant influx of records from the United States
To meet the demand for that music entrepreneurs such as Prince Buster Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid formed sound systems
As the supply of previously unheard tunes in the jump blues and more traditional RB genres began to dry up in the late s Jamaican producers began recording their own version of the genres with local artists
These recordings were initially made to be played on soft wax a lacquer on metal disc acetate later to become known as a dub plate but as demand for them grew eventually sometime in the second half of believed by most to be in the last quarter producers such as Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid began to issue these recording on rpm -inch discs
At this point the style was a direct copy of the American shuffle blues style but within two or three years it had morphed into the more familiar ska style with the off-beat guitar chop that could be heard in some of the more uptempo late-s American rhythm and blues recordings such as Domino's Be My Guest and Barbie Gaye's My Boy Lollypop both of which were popular on Jamaican sound systems of the late s
Domino's rhythm accentuating the offbeat was a particular influence
This classic ska style was of bars made up of four triplets but was characterized by a guitar chop on the off beat—known as an upstroke or 'skank'—with horns taking the lead and often following the off-beat skank and piano emphasizing the bass line and again playing the skank
Drums kept time and the bass drum was accented on the third beat of each four-triplet phrase
The snare would play side stick and accent the third beat of each -triplet phrase
The upstroke sound can also be found in other Caribbean forms of music such as mento and calypso
Ernest Ranglin asserted that the difference between RB and ska beats is that the former goes chink-ka and the latter goes ka-chink
Famous ska band the Skatalites recorded Dynamite Ringo and Guns of Navarone
One theory about the origin of ska is that Prince Buster created it during the inaugural recording session for his new record label Wild Bells
The session was financed by Duke Reid who was supposed to get half of the songs to release
The guitar began emphasizing the second and fourth beats in the bar giving rise to the new sound
The drums were taken from traditional Jamaican drumming and marching styles
To create the ska beat Prince Buster essentially flipped the RB shuffle beat stressing the offbeats with the help of the guitar
Prince Buster has explicitly cited American rhythm and blues as the origin of ska specifically Willis Jackson's song Later for the Gator which was Coxsone Dodd's number one selection
The first ska recordings were created at facilities such as Federal Records Studio One and WIRL Records in Kingston Jamaica with producers such as Dodd Reid Prince Buster and Edward Seaga
The ska sound coincided with the celebratory feelings surrounding Jamaica's independence from the UK in an event commemorated by songs such as Derrick Morgan's Forward March and The Skatalites' Freedom Sound
Until Jamaica ratified the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works the country did not honor international music copyright protection
This created many cover songs and reinterpretations
One such cover was Millie Small's version of the RBshuffle tune My Boy Lollypop first recorded in New York in by -year-old Barbie Gaye
Smalls' rhythmically similar version released in was Jamaica's first commercially successful international hit
With over seven million copies sold it remains one of the best selling reggaeska songs of all time
Many other Jamaican artists would have success recording instrumental ska versions of popular American and British music such as Beatles songs Motown and Atlantic soul hits movie theme songs and instrumentals Guns of Navarone
The Wailers covered the Beatles' And I Love Her and radically reinterpreted Bob Dylan's Like a Rolling Stone
They also created their own versions of Latin-influenced music from artists such as Mongo Santamara

The Tone genre which began in the late s in the Coventry area of UK was a fusion of Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with punk rock's more aggressive guitar chords and lyrics
