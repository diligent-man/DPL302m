paddington gives chase but the thief escapes and paddington is framed

while in prison paddington befriends many of the inmates including the short tempered chef knuckles who recruits paddington impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe
the browns work to clear paddington s name putting up sketches of the thief
buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within london s landmarks which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure
during their efforts to prove paddington s innocence the browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author
with paddington inside the prison is a much livelier place but paddington struggles to remain positive when the browns are unable to prove his innocence but keep hunting

to catch him they arrange to meet at paddington station where a carnival train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave

he learns that he has been exonerated and that buchanan has been arrested and the book with the hidden fortune on the train are being kept by authorities
he is disappointed that he cannot give lucy the book which was taken in as evidence but soon discovers that the browns with the help of various other people in the neighbourhood made sure lucy could come to london and see it for herself
when answering the door to her paddington rushes up and hugs her wishing her a happy birthday
