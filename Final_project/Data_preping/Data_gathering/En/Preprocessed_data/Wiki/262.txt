Paddington 2 is a 2017 live-action animated comedy film directed by Paul King and written by King and Simon Farnaby
Based on the stories of Paddington Bear, created by Michael Bond (to whom the film is also dedicated, Bond having died that year), it is the sequel to Paddington (2014), and is produced by Heyday Films and StudioCanal UK
The film, a British-French-Luxembourgish co-production, stars Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington, with Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Brendan Gleeson, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent, Peter Capaldi, and Hugh Grant in live-action roles
In the film, Paddington tries to get a present for his aunt's birthday, but when the gift is stolen and he is wrongly arrested and imprisoned for the theft, he and his family have to find the real culprit and prove Paddington's innocence.
Principal photography began in October 2016 and ended in June 2017
The film was theatrically released on 10 November 2017 in the United Kingdom and 6 December 2017 in France, and grossed $227 million worldwide
It received widespread critical acclaim on Metacritic, and had an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes (and was, with 245 positive reviews, the highest-rated film on the site until a negative review was registered at 246)
It has been considered one of the best films of the 2010s, for children and adults
It received three nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards: Outstanding British Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor in a Supporting Role, for Grant
A third film, Paddington in Peru, is in development.
Paddington, having settled with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, has become popular in his community, offering people emotional support in various ways
To purchase a unique pop-up book of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for his aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages, but the book is stolen
Paddington gives chase, but the thief escapes, and Paddington is framed
The thief returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor who lives near the Browns
Paddington appears in court, and although Gruber states that he does not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence of the thief's existence, Paddington is convicted and sent to prison.
While in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, including the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who recruits Paddington, impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe
The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief
Buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within London's landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure
During their efforts to prove Paddington's innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author.
With Paddington inside, the prison is a much livelier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to prove his innocence, but keep hunting
Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon later tell Paddington that although the Browns mean well, they will eventually forget about him.
Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house
They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, including the costume of the thief
Buchanan returns home and they are forced to leave
Meanwhile, the Browns' investigation causes them to miss visiting Paddington in prison.
Paddington, thinking that the Browns have in fact forgotten him, joins Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon in a prison break
They promise to aid in proving his innocence, but after escaping, they promptly abandon the idea in order to leave the country, inviting Paddington to join them
Paddington refuses and, while avoiding the police, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that Buchanan is the real culprit
To catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a carnival train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave.
Paddington reaches the station, disguising himself as a litter bin to avoid the police, and boards the train just as it leaves
The Browns pursue on a LNER Peppercorn Class A1, at the opposite platform
Buchanan finds the hidden fortune but is thwarted by Paddington who takes back the book
Henry, Judy and Mrs
Bird catch up and board the other train to confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and escapes
He severs the coupling of the train's rear carriage (with Paddington locked inside), but is photographed by Judy while holding the book, before Henry knocks him out.
Paddington is left stranded in the rear carriage, which crashes into a nearby river
Mary tries to rescue Paddington but struggles to open the locked carriage; she is soon assisted by Knuckles and the other inmates, who had a change of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised.
Paddington becomes very ill and falls into a coma, but wakes up on Lucy's birthday
He learns that he has been exonerated, and that Buchanan has been arrested and the book with the hidden fortune on the train are being kept by authorities
He is disappointed that he cannot give Lucy the book, which was taken in as evidence, but soon discovers that the Browns, with the help of various other people in the neighbourhood, made sure Lucy could come to London and see it for herself
When answering the door to her, Paddington rushes up and hugs her, wishing her a happy birthday.
During the credits, Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon are pardoned, and Knuckles opens a sandwich business
Buchanan is sentenced to 10 years in prison; six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use by hosting shows for the inmates and providing entertainment throughout the building
The book was handed over to the Browns after it was released from the authorities.

Following the sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein Company founder Harvey Weinstein, Heyday Films and StudioCanal looked for another American distributor for Paddington 2, because they believed that a film for children should not be associated with the Weinstein scandal
In mid-November 2017, Warner Bros
Pictures, which distributed Heyday's Harry Potter films and was already distributing the Paddington films in Spain, acquired the film's North American distribution rights for $32 million (£24 million), making it the first film in the series to do so
Warner Bros
also has the right of first refusal to distribute future Paddington films in North America.

Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "Paddington 2 won't save the world, sadly, but its existence makes everything just that tiny bit better and more, well, bearable." Guy Lodge of Variety wrote, "Another near pawfect family entertainment, honouring the cosy, can-do spirit of Michael Bond's stories while bringing them smoothly into a bustling, diverse 21st century London — with space for some light anti-Brexit subtext to boot." Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote, "The film is pitched with insouciant ease and a lightness of touch at both children and adults without any self-conscious shifts in irony or tone: it's humour with the citrus tang of top quality thick-cut marmalade." In 2019, The Guardian ranked Paddington 2 the 69th best film of the 21st century.
