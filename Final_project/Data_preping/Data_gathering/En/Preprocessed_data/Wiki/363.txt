They married a year later on August
They had two daughters Marion and Doris
Kaempfert's first hit with his orchestra was Wonderland by Night
Recorded in July the song could not get released in Germany so Kaempfert took the track to Decca Records in New York which released it in America in the fall of
With its haunting solo trumpet by Charles Tabor muted brass and lush strings the single topped the American pop charts and turned Bert Kaempfert and Orchestra into international stars
Over the next few years he revived such pop tunes as Tenderly Red Roses for a Blue Lady Three O'Clock in the Morning and Bye Bye Blues as well as composing pieces of his own including Spanish Eyes aka
Moon Over Naples Danke Schoen and Wooden Heart which were recorded by respectively Al Martino Wayne Newton and Elvis Presley
For Kaempfert little brought him more personal satisfaction than Nat King Cole recording his L-O-V-E
Kaempfert's orchestra made extensive use of horns
A couple of numbers that featured brass prominently Magic Trumpet and The Mexican Shuffle were played by both Kaempfert's orchestra and by Herb Alpert the Tijuana Brass
The Brass covered Magic Trumpet and Kaempfert returned the favor by covering Brass compadre Sol Lake's number The Mexican Shuffle
The latter tune evolved into a TV ad The Teaberry Shuffle
In his capacity as record producer Kaempfert played a part in the rise of the Beatles
In he hired the Beatles to back Tony Sheridan on an album called My Bonnie
Sheridan had been performing in Hamburg and needed to recruit a band to play behind him on the proposed tracks
Kaempfert auditioned and signed the Beatles and recorded two tracks with them during his sessions for Sheridan Ain't She Sweet sung by rhythm guitarist John Lennon and Cry for a Shadow an instrumental written by Lennon and lead guitarist George Harrison
The album and its singles released by Polydor Records were the Beatles' first commercially released recordings
On October a man walked into the Liverpool music store owned by Brian Epstein and asked for a copy of My Bonnie a song recorded by the Beatles but credited to Tony Sheridan
The store did not have it but Epstein noted the request
He was so intrigued by the idea of a Liverpool band releasing a record that he investigated

Drummer Rolf Ahrens supplied the characteristically simple but steady beat often playing just a snare drum with brushes
Another contributor to Kaempfert's music was guitaristbassist Ladislav Ladi Geisler who popularized the famous knackbass crackling bass sound using the Fender Telecaster Bass Guitar which became the most distinctive feature of many Kaempfert recordings — a treble staccato bass guitar sound in which the bass string was plucked with a pick and immediately suppressed to cancel out any sustain
An acoustic bass played a simple pattern in unison with this staccato electric bass which created a unique sound
It was Geisler who lent his guitar amplifier to The Beatles for their recording session with Tony Sheridan after the band's own equipment proved to be inadequate for recording purposes
Kaempfert died suddenly following a stroke at his home in Majorca on June at the age of shortly after a successful appearance in the United Kingdom
