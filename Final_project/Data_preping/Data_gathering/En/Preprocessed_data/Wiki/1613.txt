century cennino cennini described painting technique utilizing tempera painting covered light layer oil
slow-drying property organic oil commonly known early european painters
however difficulty acquiring working material meant rarely used indeed slow drying wa seen disadvantage
paint wa made yolk egg therefore substance would harden adhere surface wa applied to
paint used either oil water base diluent solvent vehicle pigment
flemish-trained influenced antonello da messina vasari wrongly credited introduction oil paint italy doe seem improved formula adding litharge lead ii oxide
still extant example -century house oil painting ham house surrey england primer wa used along several undercoat elaborate decorative overcoat pigment oil mixture would ground paste mortar pestle
process wa done hand painter exposed lead poisoning due white-lead powder
marshall smith invented machine engine grinding colour england
known precisely operated wa device increased efficiency pigment grinding dramatically
soon company called emerton manby wa advertising exceptionally low-priced paint ground labor-saving technology
one pound colour ground horse-mill paint twelve yard work whereas colour ground way half quantityby proper onset industrial revolution mid- century paint wa ground steam-powered mill alternative lead-based pigment found white derivative zinc oxide
interior house painting increasingly became norm century progressed decorative reason paint wa effective preventing wall rotting damp
linseed oil wa also increasingly used inexpensive binder
sherwin-williams united state opened large paint-maker invented paint could used tin without preparation
wa stimulus world war ii created shortage linseed oil supply market artificial resin alkyd invented
cheap easy make also held color well lasted long time
vehicle composed binder necessary thin binder diluent like solvent water combination binder diluent
case paint ha dried cured nearly diluent ha evaporated binder left coated surface
thus important quantity coating formulation vehicle solid sometimes called resin solid formula
binder include synthetic natural resin alkyd acrylic vinyl-acrylics vinyl acetateethylene vae polyurethane polyester melamine resin epoxy silanes siloxane oils
drying refers simple evaporation solvent thinner leave coherent film behind
coalescence refers mechanism involves drying followed actual interpenetration fusion formerly discrete particles
thermoplastic film-forming mechanism sometimes described thermoplastic cure misnomer chemical curing reaction required knit film
thermosetting mechanism hand true curing mechanism involve chemical reaction among polymer make binder
example encaustic wax paint liquid warm harden upon cooling
paint dry solvent evaporation contain solid binder dissolved solvent known lacquers
chemical crosslinking involved film re-dissolve solvent lacquer unsuitable application chemical resistance important
classic nitrocellulose lacquer fall category non-grain raising stain composed dye dissolved solvent
performance varies formulation lacquer generally tend better uv resistance lower corrosion resistance comparable system cure polymerization coalescence
paint type known emulsion uk latex united state water-borne dispersion sub-micrometer polymer particles
term respective country cover paint use synthetic polymer acrylic vinyl acrylic pva styrene acrylic etc
term latex context paint united state simply mean aqueous dispersion latex rubber rubber tree ingredient
paint cure process called coalescence first water trace coalescing solvent evaporate draw together soften binder particle fuse together irreversibly bound networked structure paint cannot redissolve solventwater originally carried it
residual surfactant paint well hydrolytic effect polymer cause paint remain susceptible softening time degradation water
general term latex paint usually used united state term emulsion paint used product uk term latex paint used all
thermosetting mechanism paint cure polymerization generally one- two-package coating polymerize way chemical reaction cure cross-linked film
depending composition may need dry first evaporation solvent
drying oil counter-intuitively actually cure crosslinking reaction even put oven cycle seem simply dry air
film formation mechanism simplest example involve first evaporation solvent followed reaction oxygen environment period day week even month create crosslinked network
oxidative cure coating catalyzed metal complex drier cobalt naphthenate though cobalt octoate common
recent environmental requirement restrict use volatile organic compound vocs alternative mean curing developed generally industrial purposes
uv curing paint example enable formulation low amount solvent even none all
achieved monomer oligomers used coating relatively low molecular weight therefore low enough viscosity enable good fluid flow without need additional thinner
solvent present significant amount generally mostly evaporated first crosslinking initiated ultraviolet light
flow cure produced heating substrate electrostatic application dry powder
combination mechanism so-called catalyzed lacquer crosslinking latex coating designed form film combination method classic drying plus curing reaction benefit catalyst

filler special type pigment serve thicken film support structure increase volume paint
filler usually cheap inert material diatomaceous earth talc lime barytes clay etc
floor paint must resist abrasion may contain fine quartz sand filler
paint manufacturer began replacing white lead pigment titanium white titanium dioxide lead wa banned paint residential use u consumer product safety commission
titanium dioxide used paint today often coated silicaaluminazirconium various reason better exterior durability better hiding performance opacity promoted optimal spacing within paint film
micaceous iron oxide mio another alternative lead protection steel giving protection water light damage paints
mio pigment ground fine particle cleave shiny layer reflect light thus minimising uv degradation protecting resin binder
pigment used paint tend spherical lamellar pigment glass flake mio overlapping plate impede path water molecules
optimum performance mio high content thin flake-like particle resembling mica
