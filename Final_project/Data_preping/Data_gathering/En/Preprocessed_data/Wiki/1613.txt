Paint is any pigmented liquid liquefiable or solid mastic composition that after application to a substrate in a thin layer converts to a solid film
It is most commonly used to protect color or provide texture
Paint can be made in many colors—and in many different types
Paint is typically stored sold and applied as a liquid but most types dry into a solid
Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics
For one it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers
Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint
Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted such as a house Usually the object being painted must be over °C °F although some manufacturers of external paintsprimers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as °C °F
Paint was one of the earliest arts of humanity
Some cave paintings drawn with red or yellow ochre hematite manganese oxide and charcoal may have been made by early Homo sapiens as long as years ago
In and South African archeologists reported finds in Blombos Cave of a -year-old human-made ochre-based mixture that could have been used like paint
Further excavation in the same cave resulted in the report of a complete toolkit for grinding pigments and making a primitive paint-like substance
Interior walls at the -year-old Ness of Brodgar have been found to incorporate individual stones painted in yellows reds and oranges using ochre pigment made of haematite mixed with animal fat milk or eggs
Ancient colored walls at Dendera Egypt which were exposed for years to the elements still possess their brilliant color as vivid as when they were painted about years ago
The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture
They appear to have used six colors white black blue red yellow and green
They first covered the area entirely with white then traced the design in black leaving out the lights of the ground color
They used minium for red generally of a dark tinge
The oldest known oil paintings are Buddhist murals created circa AD
The works are located in cave-like rooms carved from the cliffs of Afghanistan's Bamiyan Valley using walnut and poppy seed oils Pliny mentions some painted ceilings in his day in the town of Ardea which had been made prior to the foundation of Rome
He expressed great surprise and admiration at their freshness after the lapse of so many centuries
In the th century oil was used to detail tempera paintings
In the th century Cennino Cennini described a painting technique utilizing tempera painting covered by light layers of oil
The slow-drying properties of organic oils were commonly known to early European painters
However the difficulty in acquiring and working the materials meant that they were rarely used and indeed the slow drying was seen as a disadvantage
Paint was made with the yolk of eggs and therefore the substance would harden and adhere to the surface it was applied to
Pigment was made from plants sand and different soils
Most paints used either oil or water as a base the diluent solvent or vehicle for the pigment
The Flemish-trained or influenced Antonello da Messina who Vasari wrongly credited with the introduction of oil paint to Italy does seem to have improved the formula by adding litharge or lead II oxide
A still extant example of th-century house oil painting is Ham House in Surrey England where a primer was used along with several undercoats and an elaborate decorative overcoat the pigment and oil mixture would have been ground into a paste with a mortar and pestle
The process was done by hand by the painters which exposed them to lead poisoning due to the white-lead powder
In Marshall Smith invented a Machine or Engine for the Grinding of Colours in England
It is not known precisely how it operated but it was a device that increased the efficiency of pigment grinding dramatically
Soon a company called Emerton and Manby was advertising exceptionally low-priced paints that had been ground with labor-saving technology
One Pound of Colour ground in a Horse-Mill will paint twelve Yards of Work whereas Colour ground any other Way will not do half that QuantityBy the proper onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-th century paint was being ground in steam-powered mills and an alternative to lead-based pigments had been found in a white derivative of zinc oxide
Interior house painting increasingly became the norm as the th century progressed both for decorative reasons and because the paint was effective in preventing the walls rotting from damp
Linseed oil was also increasingly used as an inexpensive binder
In Sherwin-Williams in the United States opened as a large paint-maker and invented a paint that could be used from the tin without preparation
It was not until the stimulus of World War II created a shortage of linseed oil in the supply market that artificial resins or alkyds were invented
Cheap and easy to make they also held the color well and lasted for a long time
The vehicle is composed of the binder or if it is necessary to thin the binder with a diluent like solvent or water it is the combination of binder and diluent
In this case once the paint has dried or cured very nearly all of the diluent has evaporated and only the binder is left on the coated surface
Thus an important quantity in coatings formulation is the vehicle solids sometimes called the resin solids of the formula
This is the proportion of the wet coating weight that is binder ie
the polymer backbone of the film that will remain after drying or curing is complete
The binder is the film-forming component of paint
It is the only component that is always present among all the various types of formulations
Many binders are too thick to be applied and must be thinned
The type of thinner if present varies with the binder
The binder imparts properties such as gloss durability flexibility and toughness
Binders include synthetic or natural resins such as alkyds acrylics vinyl-acrylics vinyl acetateethylene VAE polyurethanes polyesters melamine resins epoxy silanes or siloxanes or oils
Binders can be categorized according to the mechanisms for film formation
Drying refers to simple evaporation of the solvent or thinner to leave a coherent film behind
Coalescence refers to a mechanism that involves drying followed by actual interpenetration and fusion of formerly discrete particles
Thermoplastic film-forming mechanisms are sometimes described as thermoplastic cure but that is a misnomer because no chemical curing reactions are required to knit the film
Thermosetting mechanisms on the other hand are true curing mechanism that involve chemical reactions among the polymers that make up the binder
Thermoplastic mechanisms Some films are formed by simple cooling of the binder
For example encaustic or wax paints are liquid when warm and harden upon cooling
In many cases they re-soften or liquify if reheated
Paints that dry by solvent evaporation and contain the solid binder dissolved in a solvent are known as lacquers
A solid film forms when the solvent evaporates
Because no chemical crosslinking is involved the film can re-dissolve in solvent as such lacquers are unsuitable for applications where chemical resistance is important
Classic nitrocellulose lacquers fall into this category as do non-grain raising stains composed of dyes dissolved in solvent
Performance varies by formulation but lacquers generally tend to have better UV resistance and lower corrosion resistance than comparable systems that cure by polymerization or coalescence
The paint type known as Emulsion in the UK and Latex in the United States is a water-borne dispersion of sub-micrometer polymer particles
These terms in their respective countries cover all paints that use synthetic polymers such as acrylic vinyl acrylic PVA styrene acrylic etc
The term latex in the context of paint in the United States simply means an aqueous dispersion latex rubber from the rubber tree is not an ingredient
These dispersions are prepared by emulsion polymerization
Such paints cure by a process called coalescence where first the water and then the trace or coalescing solvent evaporate and draw together and soften the binder particles and fuse them together into irreversibly bound networked structures so that the paint cannot redissolve in the solventwater that originally carried it
The residual surfactants in paint as well as hydrolytic effects with some polymers cause the paint to remain susceptible to softening and over time degradation by water
The general term of latex paint is usually used in the United States while the term emulsion paint is used for the same products in the UK and the term latex paint is not used at all
Thermosetting mechanisms Paints that cure by polymerization are generally one- or two-package coatings that polymerize by way of a chemical reaction and cure into a cross-linked film
Depending on composition they may need to dry first by evaporation of solvent
Classic two-package epoxies or polyurethanes would fall into this category
The drying oils counter-intuitively actually cure by a crosslinking reaction even if they are not put through an oven cycle and seem to simply dry in air
The film formation mechanism of the simplest examples involve first evaporation of solvents followed by reaction with oxygen from the environment over a period of days weeks and even months to create a crosslinked network
Classic alkyd enamels would fall into this category
Oxidative cure coatings are catalyzed by metal complex driers such as cobalt naphthenate though cobalt octoate is more common
Recent environmental requirements restrict the use of volatile organic compounds VOCs and alternative means of curing have been developed generally for industrial purposes
UV curing paints for example enable formulation with very low amounts of solvent or even none at all
This can be achieved because of the monomers and oligomers used in the coating have relatively very low molecular weight and are therefore low enough in viscosity to enable good fluid flow without the need for additional thinner
If solvent is present in significant amounts generally it is mostly evaporated first and then crosslinking is initiated by ultraviolet light
Similarly powder coatings contain little or no solvent
Flow and cure are produced by the heating of the substrate after electrostatic application of the dry powder
Combination mechanisms So-called catalyzed lacquers or crosslinking latex coatings are designed to form films by a combination of methods classic drying plus a curing reaction that benefits from the catalyst
There are paints called plastisolsorganosols which are made by blending PVC granules with a plasticiser
These are stoved and the mix coalesces
The main purposes of the diluent are to dissolve the polymer and adjust the viscosity of the paint
It is volatile and does not become part of the paint film
It also controls flow and application properties and in some cases can affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state
Its main function is as the carrier for the non-volatile components
To spread heavier oils for example linseed as in oil-based interior house paint a thinner oil is required
These volatile substances impart their properties temporarily—once the solvent has evaporated the remaining paint is fixed to the surface
This component is optional some paints have no diluent
Water is the main diluent for water-borne paints even the co-solvent types
Solvent-borne also called oil-based paints can have various combinations of organic solvents as the diluent including aliphatics aromatics alcohols ketones and white spirit
Specific examples are organic solvents such as petroleum distillate esters glycol ethers and the like
Sometimes volatile low-molecular weight synthetic resins also serve as diluents
Pigments are granular solids incorporated in the paint to contribute color
Dyes are colorants that dissolve in the paint
Fillers are granular solids incorporated to impart toughness texture give the paint special properties or to reduce the cost of the paint
During production the size of such particles can be measured with a Hegman gauge
Rather than using only solid particles some paints contain dyes instead of or in combination with pigments
Pigments can be classified as either natural or synthetic
Natural pigments include various clays calcium carbonate mica silicas and talcs
Synthetics would include engineered molecules calcined clays blanc fixe precipitated calcium carbonate and synthetic pyrogenic silicas
Hiding pigments in making paint opaque also protect the substrate from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light
Hiding pigments include titanium dioxide phthalo blue red iron oxide and many others
Fillers are a special type of pigment that serve to thicken the film support its structure and increase the volume of the paint
Fillers are usually cheap and inert materials such as diatomaceous earth talc lime barytes clay etc
Floor paints that must resist abrasion may contain fine quartz sand as a filler
On the other hand some paints contain large proportions of pigmentfiller and binder
Some pigments are toxic such as the lead pigments that are used in lead paint
Paint manufacturers began replacing white lead pigments with titanium white titanium dioxide before lead was banned in paint for residential use in by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission
The titanium dioxide used in most paints today is often coated with silicaaluminazirconium for various reasons such as better exterior durability or better hiding performance opacity promoted by more optimal spacing within the paint film
Micaceous iron oxide MIO is another alternative to lead for protection of steel giving more protection against water and light damage than most paints
When MIO pigments are ground into fine particles most cleave into shiny layers which reflect light thus minimising UV degradation and protecting the resin binder
Most pigments used in paint tend to be spherical but lamellar pigments such as glass flake and MIO have overlapping plates which impede the path of water molecules
For optimum performance MIO should have a high content of thin flake-like particles resembling mica
ISO sets two levels of MIO content
MIO is often derived from a form of hematite
Besides the three main categories of ingredients paint can have a wide variety of miscellaneous additives which are usually added in small amounts yet provide a significant effect on the product
Some examples include additives to modify surface tension improve flow properties improve the finished appearance increase wet edge improve pigment stability impart antifreeze properties control foaming control skinning etc
Other types of additives include catalysts thickeners stabilizers emulsifiers texturizers adhesion promoters UV stabilizers flatteners de-glossing agents biocides to fight bacterial growth and the like
Additives normally do not significantly alter the percentages of individual components in a formulation
Various technologies exist for making paints that change color
Thermochromic ink and coatings contain materials that change conformation when heat is applied or removed and so they change color
Liquid crystals have been used in such paints such as in the thermometer strips and tapes used in aquaria and noveltypromotional thermal cups and straws
Photochromic materials are used to make eyeglasses and other products
Similar to thermochromic molecules photochromic molecules change conformation when light energy is applied or removed and so they change color
Color-changing paints can also be made by adding halochromic compounds or other organic pigments
One patent cites use of these indicators for wall coating applications for light-colored paints
When the paint is wet it is pink in color but upon drying it regains its original white color
As cited in patent this property of the paint enabled two or more coats to be applied on a wall properly and evenly
The previous coats having dried would be white whereas the new wet coat would be distinctly pink
introduced foundry refractory coatings with similar principle in for use in foundries
Electrochromic paints change color in response to an applied electric current
Car manufacturer Nissan has been reportedly working on an electrochromic paint based on particles of paramagnetic iron oxide
When subjected to an electromagnetic field the paramagnetic particles change spacing modifying their color and reflective properties
The electromagnetic field would be formed using the conductive metal of the car body
Electrochromic paints can be applied to plastic substrates as well using a different coating chemistry
The technology involves using special dyes that change conformation when an electric current is applied across the film itself
This new technology has been used to achieve glare protection at the touch of a button in passenger airplane windows
Color can also change depending on viewing angle using iridescence for example in ChromaFlair
Since the time of the Renaissance siccative drying oil paints primarily linseed oil have been the most commonly used kind of paints in fine art applications oil paint is still common today
However in the th century new water-based paints such acrylic paints entered the market with the development of acrylic and other latex paints
Milk paints also called casein where the medium is derived from the natural emulsion that is milk were common in the th century and are still used
Used by the earliest western artists Egg tempera where the medium is an emulsion of raw egg yolk mixed with oil remains in use as well as are encaustic wax-based paints
Gouache is an opaque variant of watercolor which is based around varying levels of translucency both paints use gum arabic as the carrier and water as a thinner
Gouache is also known as 'designer color' or 'body color'
Poster paint is a distemper paint that has been used primarily in the creation of student works or by children
There are varying brands of poster paint and depending on the brand the quality will differ
More inexpensive brands will often crack or fade over time if they are left on a poster for an extended time
Paint can be applied as a solid a gaseous suspension aerosol or a liquid
Techniques vary depending on the practical or artistic results desired
As a solid usually used in industrial and automotive applications the paint is applied as a very fine powder then baked at high temperature
This melts the powder and causes it to adhere to the surface
The reasons for doing this involve the chemistries of the paint the surface itself and perhaps even the chemistry of the substrate the object being painted
This is called powder coating an object
As a gas or as a gaseous suspension the paint is suspended in solid or liquid form in a gas that is sprayed on an object
This is called spray painting an object
The application mechanism is air and thus no solid object touches the object being painted
The distribution of the paint is uniform so there are no sharp lines
It is possible to deliver very small amounts of paint
Painting multiple items at once quickly and efficiently
A chemical typically a solvent can be sprayed along with the paint to dissolve together both the delivered paint and the chemicals on the surface of the object being painted
Some chemical reactions in paint involve the orientation of the paint moleculesIn the liquid application paint can be applied by direct application using brushes paint rollers blades scrapers other instruments or body parts such as fingers and thumbs
Rollers generally have a handle that allows for different lengths of poles to be attached allowing painting at different heights
Generally roller application requires two coats for even color
A roller with a thicker nap is used to apply paint on uneven surfaces
Edges are often finished with an angled brush
Using the finish flat one would most likely use a nap roller
Using the finish eggshell one would most likely use a nap roller
Using the finish satin or pearl one would most likely use a nap roller
Using the finish semi-gloss or gloss one would most likely use a nap roller
After liquid paint is applied there is an interval during which it can be blended with additional painted regions at the wet edge called open time
The open time of an oil or alkyd-based emulsion paint can be extended by adding white spirit similar glycols such as Dowanol propylene glycol ether or open time prolongers
This can also facilitate the mixing of different wet paint layers for aesthetic effect
Latex and acrylic emulsions require the use of drying retardants suitable for water-based coatings
Depending on the quality and type of liquid paint used the open time will vary
Oil paints for instance are renowned for their open time as oil paints allow for artists to blend the colors for extended periods of time without having to add any extending agents
Paint application by spray is the most popular method in industry
In this paint is aerosolized by the force of compressed air or by the action of high pressure compression of the paint itself and the paint is turned into small droplets that travel to the article to be painted
Alternate methods are airless spray hot spray hot airless spray and any of these with an electrostatic spray included
Dipping used to be the norm for objects such as filing cabinets but this has been replaced by high speed air turbine driven bells with electrostatic spray
Car bodies are primed using cathodic elephoretic primer which is applied by charging the body depositing a layer of primer
The unchanged residue is rinsed off and the primer stoved
Many paints tend to separate when stored the heavier components settling to the bottom and require mixing before use
Some paint outlets have machines for mixing the paint by shaking the can vigorously for a few minutes
The opacity and the film thickness of paint may be measured using a drawdown card
Water-based paints tend to be the easiest to clean up after use the brushes and rollers can be cleaned with soap and water
Proper disposal of left over paint is a challenge
Sometimes it can be recycled Old paint may be usable for a primer coat or an intermediate coat and paints of similar chemistry can be mixed to make a larger amount of a uniform color
To dispose of paint it can be dried and disposed of in the domestic waste stream provided that it contains no prohibited substances see container
Disposal of liquid paint usually requires special handling and should be treated as hazardous waste and disposed of according to local regulations
Primer is a preparatory coating put on materials before applying the paint itself
The primed surface ensures better adhesion of the paint thereby increasing the durability of the paint and providing improved protection for the painted surface
Suitable primers also may block and seal stains or hide a color that is to be painted over
Emulsion paints are water-based paints in which the paint material is dispersed in a liquid that consists mainly of water
For suitable purposes this has advantages in fast-drying low toxicity low cost easier application and easier cleaning of equipment among other factors
Varnish and shellac are in effect paints without pigment they provide a protective coating without substantially changing the color of the surface though they can emphasise the colour of the material
Wood stain is a type of paint that is formulated to be very thin meaning low in viscosity so that the pigment soaks into a material such as wood rather than remaining in a film on the surface
Stain is mainly dispersed pigment or dissolved dye plus binder material in a solvent
It is designed to add color without providing a surface coating
Lacquer is a solvent-based paint or varnish that produces an especially hard durable finish
Usually it is a rapidly drying formulation
Enamel paint is formulated to give an especially hard usually glossy finish
Some enamel paints contain fine glass powder or metal flake instead of the color pigments in standard oil-based paints
Enamel paint sometimes is mixed with varnish or urethane to improve its shine and hardness
A glaze is an additive used with paint to slow drying time and increase translucency as in faux painting and for some artistic effects
A roof coating is a fluid that sets as an elastic membrane that can stretch without harm
It provides UV protection to polyurethane foam and is widely used in roof restoration
Fingerpaints are formulations suitable for application with the fingers they are popular for use by children in primary school activities
Inks are similar to paints except that they are typically made using finely ground pigments or dyes and are not designed to leave a thick film of binder
They are used largely for writing printing or calligraphy
Anti-graffiti coatings are used to defeat the marking of surfaces by graffiti artists or vandals
There are two categories of anti-graffiti coatings sacrificial and non-bondingSacrificial coatings are clear coatings that allow the removal of graffiti usually by washing the surface with high-pressure water that removes the graffiti together with the coating hence the term sacrificial
After removal of the graffiti the sacrificial coating must be re-applied for continued protection
Such sacrificial protective coatings are most commonly used on natural-looking masonry surfaces such as statuary and marble walls and on rougher surfaces that are difficult to clean
Non-bonding coatings are clear high-performance coatings usually catalyzed polyurethanes that do not bond strongly to paints used for graffiti
Graffiti on such a surface can be removed with a solvent wash without damaging either the underlying surface or the protective non-bonding coating
These coatings work best on smooth surfaces and are especially useful on decorative surfaces such as mosaics or painted murals which might be expected to suffer harm from high pressure spraysUrine-repellent paint is a very hydrophobic water-repellent paint
It has been used by cities and other property owners to deter men from urinating against walls as the urine splashes back on their shoes instead of dripping down the wall
Anti-climb paint is a non-drying paint that appears normal but is extremely slippery
It is useful on drainpipes and ledges to deter burglars and vandals from climbing them and is found in many public places
When a person attempts to climb objects coated with the paint it rubs off onto the climber as well as making it hard for them to climb
Anti-fouling paint or bottom paint prevents barnacles and other marine organisms from adhering to the hulls of ships
Insulative paint or insulating paint reduces the rate of thermal transfer through a surface it's applied to
One type of formulation is based on the addition of hollow microspheres to any suitable type of paint
Anti-slip paint contains chemicals or grit to increase the friction of a surface so as to decrease the risk of slipping particularly in wet conditions
Road marking paint is specially used to marking and painting road traffic signs and lines to form a durable coating film on the road surface
It must be fast-drying provide a thick coating and resist wear and slipping especially in wet conditions
Luminous paint or luminescent paint is paint that exhibits luminescence
In other words it gives off visible light through fluorescence phosphorescence or radioluminescence
Chalk paint is a decorative paint used for home decor to achieve looks such as shabby chic or vintage with home decorFlat Finish paint is generally used on ceilings or walls that are in bad shape
This finish is useful for hiding imperfections in walls and it is economical in effectively covering relatively great areas
However this finish is not easily washable and is subject to staining
Matte Finish is generally similar to flat finish but such paints commonly offer superior washability and coverage
Eggshell Finish has some sheen supposedly like that of the shell on an egg
This finish provides great washability but is not very effective at hiding imperfections on walls and similar surfaces
Eggshell finish is valued for bathrooms because it is washable and water repellent so that it tends not to peel in a wet environment
Pearl Satin Finish is very durable in terms of washability and resistance to moisture even in comparison to an eggshell finish
It protects walls from dirt moisture and stains
Accordingly it is exceptionally valuable for bathrooms furniture and kitchens but it is shinier than eggshell so it is even more prone to show imperfections
Semi-Gloss Finish typically is used on the trim to emphasize detail and elegance and to show off woodwork such as on doors and furniture
It provides a shiny surface and provides good protection from moisture and stains on walls
Its gloss does however emphasize imperfections on the walls and similar surfaces
It is popular in schools and factories where washability and durability are the main considerations
High-gloss paint is a highly glossy and super shiny form of paint that is light reflecting and has a mirror-like look
While it is highly durable and easy to clean high gloss paint is known for obvious visibility of imperfections like scratches dentsThe main reasons for paint failure after application on the surface are the applicator and improper treatment of the surface
Defects or degradation can be attributed to
This usually occurs when the dilution of the paint is not done as per manufacturers recommendation
There can be a case of over dilution and under dilution as well as dilution with the incorrect diluent
Foreign contaminants added without the manufacturers' consent can cause various film defects
Most commonly due to improper surface treatment before application and inherent moisturedampness being present in the substrate
The degree of blistering can be assessed according to ISO Part or ASTM Method D Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Blistering of Paints
Chalking is the progressive powdering of the paint film on the painted surface
The primary reason for the problem is polymer degradation of the paint matrix due to exposure of UV radiation in sunshine and condensation from dew
The degree of chalking varies as epoxies react quickly while acrylics and polyurethanes can remain unchanged for long periods
The degree of chalking can be assessed according to International Standard ISO Part or or American Society of Testing and MaterialsASTM Method D Standard Test Methods for Evaluating the Degree of Chalking of Exterior Paint FilmsCracking
Cracking of paint film is due to the unequal expansion or contraction of paint coats
It usually happens when the coats of the paint are not allowed to curedry completely before the next coat is applied
The degree of cracking can be assessed according to International Standard ISO Part or ASTM Method D Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Cracking of Exterior Paints
Cracking can also occur when the paint is applied to a surface that is incompatible or unstable
For instance clay that hasn't dried completely when painted will cause the paint to crack due to the residual moisture in the clay
It occurs due to external agents like air water etc
It can be evaluated using ASTM Method ASTM D Standard Test Method for Evaluating Degree of Erosion of Exterior Paints
The generation of acid by fungal species can be a significant component of erosion of painted surfaces
The fungus Aureobasidium pullulans is known for damaging wall paintsVolatile organic compounds VOCs in paint are considered harmful to the environment and especially for people who work with them on a regular basis
Exposure to VOCs has been related to organic solvent syndrome although this relation has been somewhat controversial
The controversial solvent -butoxyethanol is also used in paint production
Jurisdictions such as Canada China the EU India the United States and South Korea have definitions for VOCs in place along with regulations to limit the use of VOCs in consumer products such as paint
In the US environmental regulations consumer demand and advances in technology led to the development of low-VOC and zero-VOC paints and finishes
These new paints are widely available and meet or exceed the old high-VOC products in performance and cost-effectiveness while having significantly less impact on human and environmental health
A polychlorinated biphenyl PCB was reported published in in air samples collected in Chicago Philadelphia the Arctic and several sites around the Great Lakes
PCB is a global pollutant and was measured in the wastewater effluent from paint production
The widespread distribution of PCB suggests volatilization of this compound from surfaces roofs etc
PCB is present in consumer goods including newspapers magazines and cardboard boxes which usually contain color pigments
Therefore a hypothesis exists that PCB congeners are present as byproduct in some current commercial pigments
