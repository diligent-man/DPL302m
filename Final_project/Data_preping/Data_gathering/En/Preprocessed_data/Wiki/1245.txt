st paul s tower is a skyscraper located on arundel gate in sheffield south yorkshire
construction commenced in may and the building was topped out in august surpassing sheffield university s arts tower as the tallest building in sheffield at metres ft tall
the city s first skyscraper it was constructed as the centrepiece of the st paul s place project as part of the heart of the city redevelopment of sheffield city centre
the site of st paul s tower was occupied from by a chapel of ease of the nearby sheffield cathedral known as st paul s church from which the skyscraper takes its name
the sheffield town hall was constructed next to the church in the s and the church was subsequently demolished in to make way for an area of gardens next to the town hall known originally as st paul s gardens
in two brutalist extensions to the town hall nicknamed the egg box and the wedding cake due to their designs were constructed over the eastern section of st paul s gardens the western remainder subsequently became the peace gardens
these buildings were occupied by the offices of sheffield city council however their contrasting design alongside the s renaissance revival style town hall proved controversial throughout their existence
in the early s two new office buildings namely derwent house and howden house were constructed a short distance to the south along arundel gate to house the relocated sheffield city council offices and the s town hall extension was subsequently emptied and demolished in
this left the site once again unoccupied
following the completion of the peace gardens millennium square and winter gardens as part of the heart of the city project attention turned to the former egg box site now named st paul s place
planning permission for the project was first granted in october with excavation work beginning in may and construction officially commencing in may
the construction process of the development was originally due to be completed by late
the development includes a total of one and two bedroom apartments located in the main skyscraper and an adjacent nine storey mid rise building named st paul s view linked by ground floor retail
the project s design is conservatively modern complementing the surrounding buildings such as the adjacent grade i listed town hall and the modern winter garden
according to the official website for the project
on july it was announced that the company leading this project city lofts group plc had gone into administration
the insolvency followed from a series of large financial losses spiralling lending costs and falling property market values
although construction at st paul s tower was not immediately affected a number of completed developments were placed under the control of the administrators ernst young
on october the bbc look north news programme reported that the exterior cladding for the main tower had been significantly changed due to costs and was causing concern amongst sheffield city council planning officials and the wider public
two well known websites that had been following the construction of the tower reported that the council was calling a halt to any more cladding being placed on the building pending a decision as to whether the new design complied with the original plans
a revised set of design plans was drafted before being finally approved in december
the new plans removed or modified certain features of the build such as the removal of the spire and increased thickness of the window frames
st paul s tower predominantly consists of apartments containing a mixture of one and two bedrooms
however provision for retail space was provided at the ground level of both the main skyscraper fronting onto arundel gate and the adjacent st paul s view mid rise fronting onto millennium square the two buildings are linked by ground floor retail
the entire ground floor retail space of st paul s tower has been occupied by a sainsbury s local supermarket since july
on the st paul s view side of the building the retail space is currently split between two restaurants a cosmo s and a pizza express
