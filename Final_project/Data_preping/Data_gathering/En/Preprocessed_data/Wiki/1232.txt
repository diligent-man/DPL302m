popular culture also called mass culture or pop culture is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the practices beliefs and objects that are dominant or prevalent in a society at a given point in time
popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects
the primary driving force behind popular culture is mass appeal and it is produced by what cultural analyst theodor adorno refers to as the culture industry
heavily influenced in modern times by mass media this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of people in a given society
therefore popular culture has a way of influencing an individual s attitudes towards certain topics
however there are various ways to define pop culture
because of this popular culture is something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts
it is generally viewed in contrast to other forms of culture such as folk cults working class culture or high culture and also through different academic perspectives such as psychoanalysis structuralism postmodernism and more
the common pop culture categories are entertainment such as film music television and video games sports news as in people places in the news politics fashion technology and slang
popular culture in the west has been critiqued for its being a system of commercialism that privileges products selected and mass marketed by the upper class capitalist elite such criticisms are most notable in many marxist theorists such as herbert marcuse theodor adorno max horkheimer antonio gramsci guy debord fredric jameson terry eagleton as well as certain postmodern philosophers such as jean fran ois lyotard who has written about the commercialisation of information under capitalism and jean baudrillard as well as others
in the past folk culture functioned analogously to the popular culture of the masses and of the nations
the phrase popular culture was coined in the th century or earlier
traditionally popular culture was associated with poor education and with the lower classes as opposed to the official culture and higher education of the upper classes
with the rise of the industrial revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates and with the rise of capitalism and industrialization people began to spend more money on entertainment such as commercialised pubs and sports
reading also gained traction
labelling penny dreadfuls the victorian equivalent of video games the guardian in described penny fiction as britain s first taste of mass produced popular culture for the young
a growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the newly invented railway the first public railway stockton and darlington railway opened in north east england in created both a market for cheap popular literature and the ability for its distribution on a large scale
the first penny serials were published in the s to meet the growing demand
the stress in the distinction from official culture became more pronounced towards the end of the th century a usage that became established by the interbellum period
from the end of world war ii following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with the connotations of mass culture media culture image culture consumer culture and culture for mass consumption
the abbreviated form pop for popular as in pop music dates from the late s
although terms pop and popular are in some cases used interchangeably and their meaning partially overlap the term pop is narrower
pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal while popular refers to what has gained popularity regardless of its style
according to author john storey there are various definitions of popular culture
the quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much high culture e g television dramatizations of jane austen is also popular pop culture is also defined as the culture that is leftover when we have decided what high culture is
however many works straddle the boundaries e g william shakespeare and charles dickens leo tolstoy and george orwell
a third definition equates pop culture with mass culture and ideas
this is seen as a commercial culture mass produced for mass consumption by mass media
from a western european perspective this may be compared to american culture
alternatively pop culture can be defined as an authentic culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the people storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture neo gramscian hegemony theory
sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the resistance of subordinate groups in society and the forces of incorporation operating in the interests of dominant groups in society a postmodernist approach to popular culture would no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture
jean baudrillard argued that the vague conception public opinion is a subjective and inaccurate illusion which is more complicit in populism rather than in factuality for it attributes a sovereignty to consumers that they do not really possess
storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the industrial revolution
studies of shakespeare by weimann barber or bristol for example locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in renaissance popular culture while contemporary practitioners like dario fo and john mcgrath use popular culture in its gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions the commedia dell arte for example
popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and time
it forms currents and eddies and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways
for example certain currents of pop culture may originate from or diverge into a subculture representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity
items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public
important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the german researcher ronald daus who studies the impact of extra european cultures in north america asia and especially in latin america
within the realm of popular culture there exists an organizational culture
from its beginning popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push back between them
within popular culture there are two levels that have emerged high and low
high culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value historically aesthetically and socially
low culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes historically
adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture
this early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from mass produced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media e g
in the form of jokes or urban legends
with the widespread use of the internet from the s the distinction between mass media and word of mouth has become blurred
although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold
moreover certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by word of mouth and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves
the most influential critiques of popular culture came from marxist theorists of the frankfurt school during the twentieth century
theodor adorno and max horkheimer analysed the dangers of the culture industry in their influential work the dialectic of enlightenment by drawing upon the works of kant marx nietzsche and others
capitalist popular culture as adorno argued was not an authentic culture of the people but a system of homogenous and standardised products manufactured in the service of capitalist domination by the elite
the consumer demand for hollywood films pop tunes and consumable books is influenced by capitalist industries like hollywood and the elite who decide which commodities are to be promoted in the media including television and print journalism
adorno wrote the industry bows to the vote it has itself rigged it is the elite who commodify products in accordance with their narrow ideological values and criteria and adorno argues that the audience becomes accustomed to these formulaic conventions making intellectual contemplation impossible
adorno s work has had a considerable influence on culture studies philosophy and the new left
writing in the new yorker in music critic alex ross argued that adorno s work has a renewed importance in the digital age the pop hegemony is all but complete its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons culture appears more monolithic than ever with a few gigantic corporations google apple facebook amazon presiding over unprecedented monopolies there is much scholarship on how western entertainment industries strengthen transnational capitalism and reinforce a western cultural dominance
hence rather than being a local culture commercial entertainment is artificially reinforced by transnational media corporations
jack zipes a professor of german and literature critiqued the mass commercialisation and corporate hegemony behind the harry potter franchise
he argued that the commodities of the culture industry are popular because they are homogenous and obey standard conventions the media then influences the tastes of children
in his analysis of harry potter s global brand zipes wrote it must conform to the standards of exception set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in general
to be a phenomenon means that a person or commodity must conform to the hegemonic groups that determine what makes up a phenomenon
according to john m
mackenzie many products of popular culture have been designed to promote imperialist ideologies and to glorify the british upper classes rather than present a democratic view of the world
although there are many films which do not contain such propaganda there have been many films that promote racism and militarist imperialism
bell hooks an influential feminist argues that commercial commodities and celebrities cannot be symbols of progressiveness when they collaborate with imperialist capitalism and promote ideals of beauty hooks uses beyonc as an example of a commodity reinforced by capitalist corporations complicit in imperialism and patriarchy
edward s
herman and noam chomsky critiqued the mass media in their work manufacturing consent the political economy of the mass media
they argue that mass media is controlled by a powerful hegemonic elite who are motivated by their own interests that determine and manipulate what information is present in the mainstream
the mass media is therefore a system of propaganda
according to the postmodern sociologist jean baudrillard the individual is trained into the duty of seeking the relentless maximisation of pleasure lest he or she become asocial
therefore enjoyment and fun become indistinguishable from the need to consume
whereas the frankfurt school believed consumers were passive baudrillard argued that consumers were trained to consume products in a form of active labour in order to achieve upward social mobility
thus consumers under capitalism are trained to purchase products such as pop albums and consumable fiction in order to signal their devotion to social trends fashions and subcultures
although the consumption may arise from an active choice the choice is still the consequence of a social conditioning which the individual is unconscious of
baudrillard says one is permanently governed by a code whose rules and meaning constraints like those of language are for the most part beyond the grasp of individuals
in baudrillard s understanding the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful
baudrillard stated in an interview critiquing the content and production of the matrix
sources of popular culture include
films
television programs
television advertisements
animation
popular music
sports
corporations
fashion
books
comics
radio
video games
the internetwith the invention of the printing press in the sixteenth century mass produced cheap books became widely available to the public
with this the transmission of common knowledge and ideas was possible
in the s nikola tesla and guglielmo marconi created the radiotelegraph allowing for the modern radio to be born
this led to the radio being able to influence a more listened to culture with individuals being able to feel like they have a more direct impact
this radio culture is vital because it was imperative to advertising and it introduced the commercial
films and cinema are highly influential to popular culture as films as an art form are what people seem to respond to the most
with moving pictures being first captured by eadweard muybridge in films have evolved into elements that can be cast into different digital formats spreading to different cultures
the impact of films and cinema are most evident when analyzing in the search of what the films aim to portray
films are used to seek acceptance and understanding of many subjects because of the influence the films carry an example of an early representation of this can be seen in casablanca the film introduced war subjects to the public after the united states entered world war ll and it meant to increase pro war sentiment for the allies
films are a known massive influencer to popular culture yet not all films create a movement that contributes enough to be part of the popular culture that starts movements
the content must resonate to most of the public so the knowledge in the material connects with the majority
popular culture is a set of beliefs in trends and entail to change a person s set of ideologies and create social transformation
the beliefs are still a trend that change more rapidly in the modern age that carries a continuation of outpouring media and more specifically films
the trend does not last but it also carries a different effect based on individuals that can be grouped to generalized groups based on age and education
the creation of culture by films is seen in fandoms religions ideologies and movements
the culture of film is more evident through social media
social media is an instant source of feedback and creates discussion on films
a repeating event that has been set in modern culture within the trend setting phase is the creation of movements in social media platforms to defend a featured subject on a film
popular culture or mass culture is reached easily with films which are easily shared and reached worldwide
a television program is a segment of audiovisual content intended for broadcast other than a commercial trailer or other content not serving as attraction for viewership
television programs may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or non fictional as in documentary news and reality television
they may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some made for television movies or historical as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series
they can be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows
popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry
these forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training
it stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music
art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music although since the beginning of the recording industry it is also disseminated through recordings
traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally or to smaller local audiences
sports include all forms of competitive physical activity or games which through casual or organised participation aim to use maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and in some cases entertainment for spectators
corporate branding refers to the practice of promoting the brand name of a corporate entity as opposed to specific products or services
personal branding includes the use of social media to promotion to brands and topics to further good repute among professionals in a given field produce an iconic relationship between a professional a brand and its audience that extends networks past the conventional lines established by the mainstream and to enhance personal visibility
popular culture is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the practices beliefs and objects that are dominant or prevalent in a society at a given point in time
as celebrities online identities are extremely important in order to create a brand to line up sponsorships jobs and opportunities
as influencers micro celebrities and users constantly need to find new ways to be unique or stay updated with trends in order to maintain followers views and likes
for example ellen degeneres has created her own personal branding through her talk show the ellen degeneres show
as she developed her brand we can see the branches she created to extend her fan base such as ellen clothing socks pet beds and more
social media is interactive computer mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of information ideas career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks
social media platforms such as instagram facebook twitter youtube tiktok and snapchat are the most popular applications used on a daily basis for younger generations
social media tends to be implemented into the daily routine of individuals in our current society
social media is a vital part of our culture as it continues to impact the forms of communication used to connect with those in our communities families or friend groups
we often see that terms or slang is used online that is not used in face to face conversations thus adding to a persona users create through the screens of technology
for example some individuals respond to situations with a hashtag or emojis
