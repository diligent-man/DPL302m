in the post mauryan period a tribal society at kosambi modern allahabad district made cast copper coinage with and without punchmarks
their coinage resemble the damaru drum
all such coinage has been attributed to the kosambi
many indian museums such as the national museum have these coins in their collections
in the tibetan buddhist tradition the damaru is part of a collection of sacred implements and musical instrument was adopted from the tantric practices of ancient india
these reached the himalayas from the th to th century persisting in tibet as the practice of vajrayana flourished there even as it vanished in the subcontinent of india
the skull th pa damaru is made from a male and female skull bone or calvarium cut well above the area of the ear and joined at their apex
inside male and female mantras are appropriately inscribed in gold
the skins are traditionally cured by burying them with copper and other mineral salts and special herbal formulas for about two weeks
these are then stretched and applied to the two sides giving the skins their familiar blue or green mottled appearance
a collar of simple brocade or copper or silver has a hand hold and is the site of attachment of the beaters whose knit cover represents two eyeballs
the skulls are also carefully chosen for their attributes and source
after the tibetan diaspora in they began to be manufactured in india and nepal with a continued degradation of quality
today india is no longer a source and their creation and export from nepal are banned because of the acquiring of human bone through illegal practices
one still does find occasionally those with painted skins and without the proper mantras or other characteristics
the symbolism and energetic properties of the drums is extensive
these human skull damaru or chang te u are used in a wide range of vajrayana ritual as a standard right hand accompaniment to the bell held in the left hand
usually used to together as an accent or punctuation during various tantric practices the drum can also keep time during entire passages
for the solo practitioner it is an essential tool while in larger assemblies only the presiding rinpoches and chant masters use them in concert with the long horns radung short horns gyaling large cymbals silnyen and rolmo and large temple drums lag na
the ch d damaru or ch da is a specialized form of damaru
it is generally larger in circumference and has a more round shape than its smaller counterpart
the ch d damaru is used in the tantric practice of chod
with no known antecedent the chod is traditionally made of acacia wood seng deng though a variety of woods are acceptable as long as the tree is not toxic and does not possess thorns or other negative attributes
made as a one piece double sided two headed bell shape size varies from inches to inches in diameter
usually featuring only a thin veneer of varnish so that the grain of the wood shows they come the common red marpo black nakpo or rare yellow serpo type of acacia and are very occasionally painted with skulls the eight charnel grounds or other symbols
the waist or belt is traditionally made of leather though often brocades are used
a set of mantras are traditionally painted on the interior of the drum prior to its skinning
the pitch of the drum varies and the tone may vary depending on conditions of dampness temperature and so on
played slowly and methodically the droning of the damaru accompanies the haunting melodies and chants of the chod ritual as of which are accompaniments for the inner meditations and visualizations that are at the heart of this spiritual practice
the above applies to the ideal manufacture of the damaru and as still described in the definitive modern work the mindroling handbook of vajrayana implements those manufactured in india and nepal are made of indeterminate and cheap woods with painted skins often no interior mantras and altogether deviating from the many other essentials as prescribed in technical literature such as the mindroling handbook
such copies are now widespread and in use by eastern monastics and western students
damaru of all kinds are traditionally paired with a long sash or tail called a ch pen
the ch pen is attached to the end of the drum s handle so that it waves about while the drum is being played
they are most commonly made of brocade or silk using the colors of the tantric elements
on smaller damaru the ch pen is usually found without adornment but on ch d damaru the tail will often feature several items which have been sewn onto the fabric
these adornments commonly include but are not limited to a polished silver mirror or melong a set of small bells strips of tiger and or leopard skin one or more precious stones i e
