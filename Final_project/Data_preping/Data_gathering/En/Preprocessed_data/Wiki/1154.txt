There were two corps of the Union Army called IV Corps during the American Civil War
They were separate units one serving with the Army of the Potomac and the Department of Virginia in the Eastern Theater the other with the Army of the Cumberland in the Western Theater
The IV Corps Army of the Potomac was created on March and placed under the command of Erasmus D
Keyes who had commanded a brigade at First Bull Run
It consisted initially of three divisions under Darius N
Couch's division was transferred to join VI Corps during the Antietam Campaign and remained with them for the duration of the war
The corps' peak strength in early was men
The corps took part in George B
McClellan's Peninsula Campaign of playing a major role in repulsing Confederate attacks at Seven Pines and Malvern Hill
After the campaign IV Corps remained on the Peninsula with Couch's division later detached
The corps was attached to the Department of Virginia under John A
Dix and took part along with VII Corps in minor diversionary actions against Richmond during the Gettysburg Campaign
The corps was officially discontinued on August
Elements of IV Corps were later absorbed into XVIII Corps
This corps was created on October from the remnants of XX and XXI Corps both of which had suffered heavy casualties at Chickamauga
It was initially commanded by Gordon Granger and its division commanders were Philip Sheridan Charles Cruft and Thomas J
It served with distinction in the famous unordered attack on Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga and served in the Knoxville and Atlanta Campaigns
Sherman left the IV and XXIII Corps under the overall command of General George H
Thomas to defend Tennessee and the corps was heavily engaged in the battles at Spring Hill Franklin and Nashville
When the force Thomas commanded at Nashville was divided he was left in command only of the IV Corps and cavalry under James H
The IV Corps was ordered to block the mountain passes and prevent a potential retreat by Lee's army into the mountains
Records differ regarding the further history of the corps
Two sources report that it was deactivated on August
A third reports that after the war it was sent to Texas as part of the US
Army detachment dispatched to persuade French Emperor Napoleon III to withdraw his troops from Mexico and was not disbanded until December
Stanley's personnel records indicate he commanded the Central District of Texas in June and July so a corps commander for the entire disputed period cannot be identifiedEicher John H Eicher David J Civil War High Commands Stanford University Press ISBN ---
