Ricardian socialism is a branch of classical economic thought based upon the work of the economist David Ricardo
The term is used to describe economists in the s and s who developed a theory of capitalist exploitation from the theory developed by Ricardo that stated that labor is the source of all wealth and exchange value
This principle extends back to the principles of English philosopher John Locke
The Ricardian socialists reasoned that labor is entitled to all it produces and that rent profit and interest were not natural outgrowths of the free market process but were instead distortions
They argued that private ownership of the means of production should be supplanted by cooperatives owned by associations of workers
This designation is used in reference to economists in the early th century that elaborated a theory of capitalist exploitation from the classical economic proposition derived from Adam Smith and David Ricardo stating that labor is the source of wealth
Although Ricardian socialist thought had some influence on Karl Marx's theories there is disagreement about the extent to which this is the case
Some believe Marx rejected many of the fundamental assumptions of the Ricardian socialists including the view that labor was the source of all wealth while others believe the Ricardian socialists though generally dismissed as incoherent utopians were in fact an important though very largely neglected influence on Marxist economic theories
Ricardian socialism is considered to be a form of socialism based on the arguments made by Ricardo that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated producer prices when those commodities were in elastic supply that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor and that profit interest and rent were deductions from this exchange-value
This is deduced from the axiom of Ricardo and Adam Smith that labor is the source of all value
The first imputation that early British and Irish socialists were influenced by Ricardo is made by Karl Marx in his Poverty of Philosophy Anyone who is in any way familiar with the trend of political economy in England cannot fail to know that almost all the Socialists in that country have at different periods proposed the equalitarian application of the Ricardian theory

Consequently the category of Ricardian socialist came to be accepted by supporters and opponents both of Marxism by the early th century
However in recent years a number of scholars have challenged the validity of the category based on the lack of evidence that its proposed members had either read Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy or the contradictory internal evidence of their own value theory which appears to owe more to Adam Smith than Ricardo
So much so that several scholars prefer the term Smithian Socialism
