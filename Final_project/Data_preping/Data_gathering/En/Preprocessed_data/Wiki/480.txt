the emancipation proclamation officially proclamation was a presidential proclamation and executive order issued by united states president abraham lincoln on january during the civil war
the proclamation changed the legal status of more than million enslaved african americans in the secessionist confederate states from enslaved to free
as soon as slaves escaped the control of their enslavers either by fleeing to union lines or through the advance of federal troops they were permanently free
in addition the proclamation allowed for the recruitment of former slaves into the paid service of the united states armed forces
on september lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation
its third paragraph reads
that on the first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty three all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free and the executive government of the united states including the military and naval authority thereof will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons or any of them in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom on january lincoln issued the final emancipation proclamation
after quoting from the preliminary emancipation proclamation it stated
i abraham lincoln president of the united states by virtue of the power in me vested as commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states in time of actual armed rebellion against authority and government of the united states and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion do
order and designate as the states and parts of states wherein the people thereof respectively are this day in rebellion against the united states the following towit lincoln then listed the ten states still in rebellion excluding parts of states under union control and continued
i do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated states and parts of states are and henceforward shall be free
s uch persons of suitable condition will be received into the armed service of the united states
and upon this act sincerely believed to be an act of justice warranted by the constitution upon military necessity i invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of almighty god the proclamation was directed to all of the areas in rebellion and all segments of the executive branch including the army and navy of the united states
it proclaimed the freedom of enslaved people in the ten states in rebellion
even though it excluded areas not in rebellion it still applied to more than million of the million enslaved people in the country
around to were immediately emancipated in those regions of the confederacy where the us army was already in place
it could not be enforced in the areas still in rebellion but as the union army took control of confederate regions the proclamation provided the legal framework for the liberation of more than three and a half million enslaved people in those regions by the end of the war
the emancipation proclamation outraged white southerners and their sympathizers who saw it as the beginning of a race war
it energized abolitionists and undermined those europeans who wanted to intervene to help the confederacy
the proclamation lifted the spirits of african americans both free and enslaved it led many to escape from their masters and get to union lines to obtain their freedom and to join the union army
the emancipation proclamation became a historic document because it would redefine the civil war turning it from a struggle to preserve the union to one focused on ending slavery and set a decisive course for how the nation would be reshaped after that historic conflict
the emancipation proclamation was never challenged in court
to ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the u s lincoln also insisted that reconstruction plans for southern states require them to enact laws abolishing slavery which occurred during the war in tennessee arkansas and louisiana lincoln encouraged border states to adopt abolition which occurred during the war in maryland missouri and west virginia and pushed for passage of the thirteenth amendment
the senate passed the th amendment by the necessary two thirds vote on april the house of representatives did so on january and the required three fourths of the states ratified it on december
the amendment made slavery and involuntary servitude unconstitutional except as a punishment for crime
the united states constitution of did not use the word slavery but included several provisions about unfree persons
the three fifths compromise in article i section allocated congressional representation based on the whole number of free persons and three fifths of all other persons
under the fugitive slave clause article iv section no person held to service or labour in one state would be freed by escaping to another
article i section allowed congress to pass legislation to outlaw the importation of persons but not until
however for purposes of the fifth amendment which states that no person shall
be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law slaves were understood to be property
although abolitionists used the fifth amendment to argue against slavery it was made part of the legal basis for treating slaves as property by dred scott v
sandford
slavery was also supported in law and in practice by a pervasive culture of white supremacy
nonetheless between and every northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery
no southern state did so and the slave population of the south continued to grow peaking at almost four million people at the beginning of the american civil war when most slave states sought to break away from the united states
lincoln understood that the federal government s power to end slavery in peacetime was limited by the constitution which before committed the issue to individual states
during the american civil war however lincoln issued the proclamation under his authority as commander in chief of the army and navy under article ii section of the united states constitution
as such he claimed to have the authority to free persons held as slaves in those states that were in rebellion as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion
he did not have such authority over the four border slave holding states that were not in rebellion missouri kentucky maryland and delaware so those states were not named in the proclamation
the fifth border jurisdiction west virginia where slavery remained legal but was in the process of being abolished was in january still part of the legally recognized reorganized state of virginia based in alexandria which was in the union as opposed to the confederate state of virginia based in richmond
the proclamation applied in the ten states that were still in rebellion in and thus did not cover the nearly slaves in the slave holding border states missouri kentucky maryland or delaware that had not seceded
those slaves were freed by later separate state and federal actions
the state of tennessee had already mostly returned to union control under a recognized union government so it was not named and was exempted
virginia was named but exemptions were specified for the counties then in the process of forming the new state of west virginia and seven additional counties and two cities in the union controlled tidewater region of virginia
also specifically exempted were new orleans and named parishes of louisiana which were mostly under federal control at the time of the proclamation
these exemptions left unemancipated an additional slaves
the emancipation proclamation has been ridiculed notably in an influential passage by richard hofstadter who wrote that it had all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading and declared free all slaves
precisely where its effect could not reach these slaves were freed under lincoln s war powers as commander in chief of the army and navy under article ii section of the constitution of the united states
this act cleared up the issue of contraband slaves
it automatically clarified the status of over now former slaves
some to slaves were freed the day it went into effect in parts of nine of the ten states to which it applied texas being the exception
in every confederate state except tennessee and texas the proclamation went into immediate effect in union occupied areas and at least slaves were freed at once on january
the proclamation provided the legal framework for the emancipation of nearly all four million slaves as the union armies advanced and committed the union to end slavery which was a controversial decision even in the north
hearing of the proclamation more slaves quickly escaped to union lines as the army units moved south
as the union armies advanced through the confederacy thousands of slaves were freed each day until nearly all approximately million according to the census were freed by july
although the proclamation had freed most slaves as a war measure it had not made slavery illegal
of the states that were exempted from the proclamation maryland missouri tennessee and west virginia prohibited slavery before the war ended
in president lincoln proposed a moderate plan for the reconstruction of the captured confederate state of louisiana
only of the state s electorate had to take the loyalty oath
the state was also required to accept the proclamation and abolish slavery in its new constitution
identical reconstruction plans would be adopted in arkansas and tennessee
by december the lincoln plan abolishing slavery had been enacted in louisiana as well as in arkansas and tennessee
in kentucky union army commanders relied on the proclamation s offer of freedom to slaves who enrolled in the army and provided freedom for an enrollee s entire family for this and other reasons the number of slaves in the state fell by over during the war
however in delaware and kentucky slavery continued to be legal until december when the thirteenth amendment went into effect
the fugitive slave act of required individuals to return runaway slaves to their owners
during the war in may union general benjamin butler declared that slaves who escaped to union lines were contraband of war and accordingly he refused to return them
on may after a cabinet meeting called by president lincoln simon cameron the secretary of war telegraphed butler to inform him that his contraband policy is approved this decision was controversial because it could have been taken to imply recognition of the confederacy as a separate independent sovereign state under international law a notion that lincoln steadfastly denied
in addition as contraband these people were legally designated as property when they crossed union lines and their ultimate status was uncertain
in december lincoln sent his first annual message to congress the state of the union address but then typically given in writing and not referred to as such
in it he praised the free labor system as respecting human rights over property rights he endorsed legislation to address the status of contraband slaves and slaves in loyal states possibly through buying their freedom with federal taxes and also the funding of strictly voluntary colonization efforts
in january thaddeus stevens the republican leader in the house called for total war against the rebellion to include emancipation of slaves arguing that emancipation by forcing the loss of enslaved labor would ruin the rebel economy
on march congress approved an act prohibiting the return of slaves which prohibited all officers or persons in the military or naval service of the united states from returning fugitive slaves to their owners
pursuant to a law signed by lincoln slavery was abolished in the district of columbia on april and owners were compensated
on june congress prohibited slavery in all current and future united states territories though not in the states and president lincoln quickly signed the legislation
this act effectively repudiated the opinion of the supreme court of the united states in the dred scott case that congress was powerless to regulate slavery in u s
territories
it also rejected the notion of popular sovereignty that had been advanced by stephen a
douglas as a solution to the slavery controversy while completing the effort first legislatively proposed by thomas jefferson in to confine slavery within the borders of existing states
on august the first confiscation act freed the slaves who were employed against the government and lawful authority of the united states on july the second confiscation act freed the slaves within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by forces of the united states the second confiscation act unlike the first confiscation act explicitly provided that all slaves covered by it would be permanently freed stating in section that all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the united states or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states and all slaves of such person found on or being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the united states shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves however lincoln s position continued to be that although congress lacked the power to free the slaves in rebel held states he as commander in chief could do so if he deemed it a proper military measure
by this time in the summer of lincoln had drafted the preliminary emancipation proclamation which when he issued it on september would declare that on january he would free the slaves in states still in rebellion
abolitionists had long been urging lincoln to free all slaves
in the summer of republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune wrote a famous editorial entitled the prayer of twenty millions demanding a more aggressive attack on the confederacy and faster emancipation of the slaves on the face of this wide earth mr
president there is not one
intelligent champion of the union cause who does not feel
that the rebellion if crushed tomorrow would be renewed if slavery were left in full vigor and that every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the union lincoln responded in his letter to horace greeley from august in terms of the limits imposed by his duty as president to save the union
lincoln scholar harold holzer wrote in this context about lincoln s letter unknown to greeley lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary emancipation proclamation which he had determined to issue after the next union military victory
therefore this letter was in truth an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the union not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture
it was one of lincoln s most skillful public relations efforts even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator historian richard striner argues that for years lincoln s letter has been misread as lincoln only wanted to save the union however within the context of lincoln s entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong according to striner
rather lincoln was softening the strong northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the union
this opposition would fight for the union but not to end slavery so lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both at the same time
in his book lincoln s gamble journalist and historian todd brewster asserted that lincoln s desire to reassert the saving of the union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation
since slavery was protected by the constitution the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war not as the mission itself
but that carried the risk that when the war ended so would the justification for freeing the slaves
late in lincoln asked his attorney general edward bates for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war related proclamation of emancipation could be re enslaved once the war was over
bates had to work through the language of the dred scott decision to arrive at an answer but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free
still a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment
conflicting advice to free all slaves or not free them at all was presented to lincoln in public and private
thomas nast a cartoon artist during the civil war and the late s considered father of the american cartoon composed many works including a two sided spread that showed the transition from slavery into civilization after president lincoln signed the proclamation
nast believed in equal opportunity and equality for all people including enslaved africans or free blacks
a mass rally in chicago on september demanded immediate and universal emancipation of slaves
a delegation headed by william w
patton met the president at the white house on september
lincoln had declared in peacetime that he had no constitutional authority to free the slaves
even used as a war power emancipation was a risky political act
public opinion as a whole was against it
there would be strong opposition among copperhead democrats and an uncertain reaction from loyal border states
delaware and maryland already had a high percentage of free blacks and respectively in
lincoln first discussed the proclamation with his cabinet in july
he drafted his preliminary proclamation and read it to secretary of state william seward and secretary of navy gideon welles on july
seward and welles were at first speechless then seward referred to possible anarchy throughout the south and resulting foreign intervention welles apparently said nothing
on july lincoln presented it to his entire cabinet as something he had determined to do and he asked their opinion on wording
although secretary of war edwin stanton supported it seward advised lincoln to issue the proclamation after a major union victory or else it would appear as if the union was giving its last shriek of retreat
in september the battle of antietam gave lincoln the victory he needed to issue the preliminary emancipation proclamation
in the battle though the union suffered heavier losses than the confederates and general mcclellan allowed the escape of robert e
lee s retreating troops union forces turned back a confederate invasion of maryland eliminating more than a quarter of lee s army in the process
on september five days after antietam and while residing at the soldier s home lincoln called his cabinet into session and issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation
according to civil war historian james m
mcpherson lincoln told cabinet members i made a solemn vow before god that if general lee was driven back from pennsylvania i would crown the result by the declaration of freedom to the slaves lincoln had first shown an early draft of the proclamation to vice president hannibal hamlin an ardent abolitionist who was more often kept in the dark on presidential decisions
the final proclamation was issued on january
although implicitly granted authority by congress lincoln used his powers as commander in chief of the army and navy to issue the proclamation as a necessary war measure therefore it was not the equivalent of a statute enacted by congress or a constitutional amendment because lincoln or a subsequent president could revoke it
some days after issuing the final proclamation lincoln wrote to major general john mcclernand after the commencement of hostilities i struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the institution and when finally i conditionally determined to touch it i gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose to all the states and people within which time they could have turned it wholly aside by simply again becoming good citizens of the united states
they chose to disregard it and i made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessity
and being made it must stand
initially the emancipation proclamation effectively freed only a small percentage of the slaves namely those who were behind union lines in areas not exempted
most slaves were still behind confederate lines or in exempted union occupied areas
secretary of state william h
seward commented we show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free had any slave state ended its secession attempt before january it could have kept slavery at least temporarily
the proclamation freed the slaves only in areas of the south that were still in rebellion on january
but as the union army advanced into the south slaves fled to behind its lines and s hortly after issuing the emancipation proclamation the lincoln administration lifted the ban on enticing slaves into union lines these events contributed to the destruction of slavery
the emancipation proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the united states military
during the war nearly black men most of them ex slaves joined the union army
their contributions were significant in winning the war
the confederacy did not allow slaves in their army as soldiers until the last month before its defeat
though the counties of virginia that were soon to form west virginia were specifically exempted from the proclamation jefferson county being the only exception a condition of the state s admittance to the union was that its constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery an immediate emancipation of all slaves was also adopted there in early
slaves in the border states of maryland and missouri were also emancipated by separate state action before the civil war ended
in maryland a new state constitution abolishing slavery in the state went into effect on november
the union occupied counties of eastern virginia and parishes of louisiana which had been exempted from the proclamation both adopted state constitutions that abolished slavery in april
in early tennessee adopted an amendment to its constitution prohibiting slavery
the proclamation was issued in a preliminary version and a final version
the former issued on september was a preliminary announcement outlining the intent of the latter which took effect days later on january during the second year of the civil war
the preliminary emancipation proclamation was abraham lincoln s declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the confederacy that were still in rebellion on january
the ten affected states were individually named in the final emancipation proclamation south carolina mississippi florida alabama georgia louisiana texas virginia arkansas north carolina
not included were the union slave states of maryland delaware missouri and kentucky
also not named was the state of tennessee in which a union controlled military government had already been set up based in the capital nashville
specific exemptions were stated for areas also under union control on january namely counties that would soon become west virginia seven other named counties of virginia including berkeley and hampshire counties which were soon added to west virginia new orleans and named parishes nearby
union occupied areas of the confederate states where the proclamation was put into immediate effect by local commanders included winchester virginia corinth mississippi the sea islands along the coasts of the carolinas and georgia key west florida and port royal south carolina
on new year s eve in african americans enslaved and free gathered across the united states to hold watch night ceremonies for freedom s eve looking toward the stroke of midnight and the promised fulfillment of the proclamation
it has been inaccurately claimed that the emancipation proclamation did not free a single slave historian lerone bennett jr
alleged that the proclamation was a hoax deliberately designed not to free any slaves
however as a result of the proclamation most slaves became free during the course of the war beginning on the day it took effect eyewitness accounts at places such as hilton head island south carolina and port royal south carolina record celebrations on january as thousands of blacks were informed of their new legal status of freedom
estimates of the number of slaves freed immediately by the emancipation proclamation are uncertain
one contemporary estimate put the contraband population of union occupied north carolina at and the sea islands of south carolina also had a substantial population
those slaves were freed immediately by the emancipation proclamation this union occupied zone where freedom began at once included parts of eastern north carolina the mississippi valley northern alabama the shenandoah valley of virginia a large part of arkansas and the sea islands of georgia and south carolina
although some counties of union occupied virginia were exempted from the proclamation the lower shenandoah valley and the area around alexandria were covered
emancipation was immediately enforced as union soldiers advanced into the confederacy
slaves fled their masters and were often assisted by union soldiers
booker t
washington as a boy of in virginia remembered the day in early
runaway slaves who had escaped to union lines had previously been held by the union army as contraband of war under the confiscation acts when the proclamation took effect they were told at midnight that they were free to leave
the sea islands off the coast of georgia had been occupied by the union navy earlier in the war
the whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed
an early program of reconstruction was set up for the former slaves including schools and training
naval officers read the proclamation and told them they were free
slaves had been part of the engine of war for the confederacy
they produced and prepared food sewed uniforms repaired railways worked on farms and in factories shipping yards and mines built fortifications and served as hospital workers and common laborers
news of the proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth arousing hopes of freedom creating general confusion and encouraging thousands to escape to union lines
george washington albright a teenage slave in mississippi recalled that like many of his fellow slaves his father escaped to join union forces
according to albright plantation owners tried to keep the proclamation from slaves but news of it came through the grapevine
the young slave became a runner for an informal group they called the ls lincoln s legal loyal league bringing news of the proclamation to secret slave meetings at plantations throughout the region
robert e
lee saw the emancipation proclamation as a way for the union to bolster the number of soldiers it could place on the field making it imperative for the confederacy to increase their own numbers
writing on the matter after the sack of fredericksburg lee wrote in view of the vast increase of the forces of the enemy of the savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death if we would save the honor of our families from pollution our social system from destruction let every effort be made every means be employed to fill and maintain the ranks of our armies until god in his mercy shall bless us with the establishment of our independence
the proclamation was immediately denounced by copperhead democrats who opposed the war and advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery
horatio seymour while running for the governorship of new york cast the emancipation proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white southerners saying it was a proposal for the butchery of women and children for scenes of lust and rapine and of arson and murder which would invoke the interference of civilized europe
the copperheads also saw the proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of presidential power
editor henry a
reeves wrote in greenport s republican watchman that in the name of freedom of negroes the proclamation imperils the liberty of white men to test a utopian theory of equality of races which nature history and experience alike condemn as monstrous it overturns the constitution and civil laws and sets up military usurpation in their stead
racism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the north supported the war only as an effort to force the south to stay in the union
the promises of many republican politicians that the war was to restore the union and not about black rights or ending slavery were now declared lies by their opponents citing the proclamation
copperhead david allen spoke to a rally in columbiana ohio stating i have told you that this war is carried on for the negro
there is the proclamation of the president of the united states
now fellow democrats i ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your britheren of the southern states for the negro
i answer no the copperheads saw the proclamation as irrefutable proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members in connecticut h
whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to those stupid thickheaded persons who persisted in thinking that the president was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the union under the constitution
war democrats who rejected the copperhead position within their party found themselves in a quandary
while throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves they did see the proclamation as a viable military tool against the south and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the union army
the question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed
lincoln further alienated many in the union two days after issuing the preliminary copy of the emancipation proclamation by suspending habeas corpus
his opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot
in light of this and a lack of military success for the union armies many war democrat voters who had previously supported lincoln turned against him and joined the copperheads in the off year elections held in october and november
in the elections the democrats gained seats in the house as well as the governorship of new york
lincoln s friend orville hickman browning told the president that the proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been disastrous for his party by handing the democrats so many weapons
lincoln made no response
copperhead william javis of connecticut pronounced the election the beginning of the end of the utter downfall of abolitionism in the united states
historians james m
mcpherson and allan nevins state that though the results looked very troubling they could be seen favorably by lincoln his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and at the national level their gains in the house were the smallest of any minority party s in an off year election in nearly a generation
michigan california and iowa all went republican
moreover the republicans picked up five seats in the senate mcpherson states if the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on lincoln s conduct of the war a majority of northern voters endorsed these policies
the initial confederate response was one of expected outrage
the proclamation was seen as vindication of the rebellion and proof that lincoln would have abolished slavery even if the states had remained in the union
in an august letter to president lincoln u s
army general ulysses s
grant observed that the proclamation s arming the negro together with the emancipation of the negro is the heavyest sic blow yet given the confederacy
the south rave a greatdeel sic about it and profess to be very angry in may a few months after the proclamation took effect the confederacy passed a law demanding full and ample retaliation against the u s
for such measures
the confederacy stated that black u s
soldiers captured while fighting against the confederacy would be tried as slave insurrectionists in civil courts a capital offense with automatic sentence of death
less than a year after the law s passage the confederates massacred black u s
soldiers at fort pillow
confederate general robert e
lee called the proclamation a savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death
however some confederates welcomed the proclamation as they believed it would strengthen pro slavery sentiment in the confederacy and thus lead to greater enlistment of white men into the confederate army
according to one confederate cavalry sergeant from kentucky the proclamation is worth three hundred thousand soldiers to our government at least
it shows exactly what this war was brought about for and the intention of its damnable authors even some union soldiers concurred with this view and expressed reservations about the proclamation not on principle but rather because they were afraid it would increase the confederacy s determination to fight on and maintain slavery
one union soldier from new york stated worryingly after the proclamation s issuance i know enough of the southern spirit that i think they will fight for the institution of slavery even to extermination
as a result of the proclamation the price of slaves in the confederacy increased in the months after its issuance with one confederate from south carolina opining in that now is the time for uncle to buy some negro women and children
as lincoln had hoped the proclamation turned foreign popular opinion in favor of the union by gaining the support of anti slavery countries and countries that had already abolished slavery especially the developed countries in europe such as the united kingdom and france
this shift ended the confederacy s hopes of gaining official recognition
since the emancipation proclamation made the eradication of slavery an explicit union war goal it linked support for the south to support for slavery
public opinion in britain would not tolerate support for slavery
as henry adams noted the emancipation proclamation has done more for us than all our former victories and all our diplomacy in italy giuseppe garibaldi hailed lincoln as the heir of the aspirations of john brown
on august garibaldi wrote to lincoln posterity will call you the great emancipator a more enviable title than any crown could be and greater than any merely mundane treasure
mayor abel haywood a representative for workers from manchester england wrote to lincoln saying we joyfully honor you for many decisive steps toward practically exemplifying your belief in the words of your great founders all men are created free and equal the emancipation proclamation served to ease tensions with europe over the north s conduct of the war and combined with the recent failed southern offensive at antietam to remove any practical chance for the confederacy to receive foreign support in the war
lincoln s gettysburg address in november made indirect reference to the proclamation and the ending of slavery as a war goal with the phrase new birth of freedom
the proclamation solidified lincoln s support among the rapidly growing abolitionist element of the republican party and ensured that they would not block his re nomination in
in december lincoln issued his proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction which dealt with the ways the rebel states could reconcile with the union
key provisions required that the states accept the emancipation proclamation and thus the freedom of their slaves and accept the confiscation acts as well as the act banning of slavery in united states territories
near the end of the war abolitionists were concerned that the emancipation proclamation would be construed solely as a war measure lincoln s original intent and would no longer apply once fighting ended
they also were increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves not just those freed by the emancipation proclamation
thus pressed lincoln staked a large part of his presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery uniformly throughout the united states
lincoln s campaign was bolstered by separate votes in both maryland and missouri to abolish slavery in those states
maryland s new constitution abolishing slavery took effect on november
slavery in missouri ended on january when a state convention approved an ordinance abolishing slavery by a vote of and later the same day governor thomas c
fletcher followed up with his own proclamation of freedom
winning re election lincoln pressed the lame duck th congress to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming th congress to convene
in january congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the thirteenth amendment banning slavery in all u s
states and territories
the amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by december and proclaimed days later
there were approximately slaves in kentucky and in delaware who were liberated then
in context the th century and because of its scope lincoln s proclamation is arguably one of the most radical emancipations in the history of the modern world nonetheless as the years went on and american life continued to be deeply unfair towards black people cynicism towards lincoln and the emancipation proclamation increased
perhaps the strongest attack was lerone bennett s forced into glory abraham lincoln s white dream which claimed that lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the emancipation proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed
in his lincoln s emancipation proclamation allen c
guelzo noted the professional historians lack of substantial respect for the document since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies
he argued that lincoln was the us s last enlightenment politician and as such was dedicated to removing slavery strictly within the bounds of law
other historians have given more credit to lincoln for what he accomplished within the tensions of his cabinet and a society at war for his own growth in political and moral stature and for the promise he held out to the slaves
more might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated
as eric foner wrote
lincoln was not an abolitionist or radical republican a point bennett reiterates innumerable times
he did not favor immediate abolition before the war and held racist views typical of his time
but he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery and during the civil war displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth kal ashraf wrote
perhaps in rejecting the critical dualism lincoln as individual emancipator pitted against collective self emancipators there is an opportunity to recognise the greater persuasiveness of the combination
in a sense yes a racist flawed lincoln did something heroic and not in lieu of collective participation but next to and enabled by it
to venerate a singular great emancipator may be as reductive as dismissing the significance of lincoln s actions
who he was as a man no one of us can ever really know
so it is that the version of lincoln we keep is also the version we make dr
martin luther king jr
made many references to the emancipation proclamation during the civil rights movement
these include an emancipation proclamation centennial address he gave in new york city on september in which he placed the proclamation alongside the declaration of independence as an imperishable contribution to civilization and added all tyrants past present and future are powerless to bury the truths in these declarations he lamented that despite a history where the united states proudly professed the basic principles inherent in both documents it sadly practiced the antithesis of these principles he concluded there is but one way to commemorate the emancipation proclamation
that is to make its declarations of freedom real to reach back to the origins of our nation when our message of equality electrified an unfree world and reaffirm democracy by deeds as bold and daring as the issuance of the emancipation proclamation
king s most famous invocation of the emancipation proclamation was in a speech from the steps of the lincoln memorial at the march on washington for jobs and freedom often referred to as the i have a dream speech
king began the speech saying five score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the emancipation proclamation
this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice
it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity
but one hundred years later we must face the tragic fact that the negro is still not free
one hundred years later the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination
in the early s dr
martin luther king jr
and his associates developed a strategy to call on president john f
kennedy to bypass a southern segregationist opposition in the congress by issuing an executive order to put an end to segregation
this envisioned document was referred to as the second emancipation proclamation
on june president kennedy appeared on national television to address the issue of civil rights
kennedy who had been routinely criticized as timid by some leaders of the civil rights movement told americans that two black students had been peacefully enrolled in the university of alabama with the aid of the national guard despite the opposition of governor george wallace
john kennedy called it a moral issue invoking the centennial of the emancipation proclamation he said
in the same speech kennedy announced he would introduce comprehensive civil rights legislation in the united states congress which he did a week later and he pushed for its passage until he was assassinated on november
historian peniel e
joseph holds lyndon johnson s ability to get that bill the civil rights act of signed into law on july to have been aided by the moral forcefulness of the june speech which had turned the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal
during the civil rights movement of the s lyndon b
johnson invoked the emancipation proclamation holding it up as a promise yet to be fully implemented
as vice president while speaking from gettysburg on may memorial day during the centennial year of the emancipation proclamation johnson connected it directly with the ongoing civil rights struggles of the time saying one hundred years ago the slave was freed
one hundred years later the negro remains in bondage to the color of his skin
in this hour it is not our respective races which are at stake it is our nation
let those who care for their country come forward north and south white and negro to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision
