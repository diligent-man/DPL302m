John Common is an American songwriter, musician and singer based in Denver, Colorado, United States.
Born in Jacksonville, North Carolina, Common spent most of his youth in Pensacola, Florida
 When he was thirteen years old, Common found his older brother's Epiphone acoustic guitar in a closet and began writing songs
 While in Pensacola, Common founded and fronted the psychedelic roots rock band Bunkhouse Jones
 Featuring drummer Matthew Baranowski, guitarists Aaron Monte and Richard Abercrombie, Bunkhouse Jones released two records and toured clubs and small venues in the South
 After finishing school, he traveled around the country to New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Burlington, and other towns writing, busking, playing shows and making lo-fi recordings
 After a stint working on a small family farm in Denmark, Kansas, he made his way to Colorado.
As the singer, songwriter and guitarist for the Denver-based roots rock/alt-country band Rainville, he built a reputation for writing gritty, honest songs
Rainville released two albums to critical acclaim nationally and in Europe, and toured from 1999 to 2004.
Common began exploring different musical and lyrical territory in 2005
 This new creative direction surfaced on Good To Be Born and Why Birds Fly – the first two records released under his name on Free School Records in 2006 and 2007 respectively
Those two records established Common in the Denver music scene as an independent artist and songwriter.
He continued to evolve his sound by releasing a record entitled Beautiful Empty under the name John Common and Blinding Flashes of Light in 2011
That full length was quickly followed by an EP named Side 3
Common's band, Blinding Flashes of Light, was a large collective of musicians, artists and friends drawn from Denver's indie music scene
They toured across the United States multiple times in support of Beautiful Empty and Side 3
The musical collective evolved into John Common Superheart in 2014, and in 2015 Common released an EP named Two Rivers, again on Free School Records
Two Rivers was co-produced by John Common and Steve Vidaic
John Common Superheart tracked a full length record with Steve Vidaic as co-producer and engineer that hasn't been released yet.
In 2017, Common began exploring a more stripped down direction and returned to playing and recording under his name
The current musical configuration features John Common on vocals, guitars and keys, Jess DeNicola on backing vocals, and Joe Mazza on guitars and sounds
They released the first single named Make It Real in December 2019
Make It Real is from a new EP that will be serially released in early 2019
This same group has also tracked another full length record that they will complete and release in 2020.
