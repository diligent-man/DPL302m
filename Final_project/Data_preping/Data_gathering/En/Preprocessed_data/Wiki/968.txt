Mesoamerican chronology divides the history of prehispanic Mesoamerica into several periods the Paleo-Indian first human habitation until BCE the Archaic before BCE the Preclassic or Formative BCE CE the Classic CE and the Postclassic CE as well as the post European contact Colonial Period and Postcolonial or the period after independence from Spain present
The periodisation of Mesoamerica by researchers is based on archaeological ethnohistorical and modern cultural anthropology research dating to the early twentieth century
Archaeologists ethnohistorians historians and cultural anthropologists continue to work to develop cultural histories of the region
The Paleo-Indian less frequently Lithic period or era is that which spans from the first signs of human presence in the region to the establishment of agriculture and other practices eg
pottery permanent settlements and subsistence techniques characteristic of proto-civilisations
In Mesoamerica the termination of this phase and its transition into the succeeding Archaic period may generally be reckoned at between and BCE
This dating is approximate only and different timescales may be used between fields and sub-regions
During the Archaic Era agriculture was developed in the region and permanent villages were established
Late in this era use of pottery and loom weaving became common and class divisions began to appear
Many of the basic technologies of Mesoamerica in terms of stone-grinding drilling pottery etc
During the Preclassic Era or Formative Period large-scale ceremonial architecture writing cities and states developed
Many of the distinctive elements of Mesoamerican civilisation can be traced to this period including the dominance of corn the building of pyramids human sacrifice jaguar-worship the complex calendar and many of the gods
The Olmec civilisation developed and flourished at such sites as La Venta and San Lorenzo Tenochtitln eventually succeeded by the Epi-Olmec culture between BCE
The Zapotec civilization arose in the Valley of Oaxaca the Teotihuacan civilisation arose in the Valley of Mexico
The Maya civilization began to develop in the Mirador Basin in modern-day Guatemala and the Epi-Olmec culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in modern-day Chiapas later expanding into Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula
The Classic Period was dominated by numerous independent city-states in the Maya region and also featured the beginnings of political unity in central Mexico and the Yucatn
Regional differences between cultures grew more manifest
The city-state of Teotihuacan dominated the Valley of Mexico until the early th century but little is known of the political structure of the region because the Teotihuacanos left no written records
The city-state of Monte Albn dominated the Valley of Oaxaca until the late Classic leaving limited records in their script which is as yet mostly undeciphered
Highly sophisticated arts such as stuccowork architecture sculptural reliefs mural painting pottery and lapidary developed and spread during the Classic era
In the Maya region under considerable military influence by Teotihuacan after the arrival of Siyaj K'ak' in CE numerous city states such as Tikal Uaxactun Calakmul Copn Quirigua Palenque Cob and Caracol reached their zeniths
Each of these polities was generally independent although they often formed alliances and sometimes became vassal states of each other
The main conflict during this period was between Tikal and Calakmul which fought a series of wars over the course of more than half a millennium
Each of these states declined during the Terminal Classic and were eventually abandoned
In the Postclassic Period many of the great nations and cities of the Classic Era collapsed although some continued such as in Oaxaca Cholula and the Maya of Yucatan such as at Chichen Itza and Uxmal
This is sometimes thought to have been a period of increased chaos and warfare
The Postclassic is often viewed as a period of cultural decline
However it was a time of technological advancement in architecture engineering and weaponry
Metallurgy introduced c came into use for jewelry and some tools with new alloys and techniques being developed in a few centuries
The Postclassic was a period of rapid movement and population growth—especially in Central Mexico post-—and of experimentation in governance
For instance in Yucatan 'dual rulership' apparently replaced the more theocratic governments of Classic times while oligarchic councils operated in much of central Mexico
Likewise it appears that the wealthy pochteca merchant class and military orders became more powerful than was apparently the case in Classic times
This afforded some Mesoamericans a degree of social mobility
The Toltec for a time dominated central Mexico in the thth century then collapsed
The northern Maya were for a time united under Mayapan
Oaxaca was briefly united by Mixtec rulers in the thth centuries
The Aztec Empire arose in the early th century and appeared to be on a path to asserting dominance over the Valley of Mexico region not seen since Teotihuacan
By the th century the Mayan 'revival' in Yucatan and southern Guatemala and the flourishing of Aztec imperialism evidently enabled a renaissance of fine arts and science
Examples include the 'Pueblan-Mexica' style in pottery codex illumination and goldwork the flourishing of Nahua poetry and the botanical institutes established by the Aztec elite
Spain was the first European power to contact Mesoamerica
Its conquistadors aided by numerous native allies conquered the Aztecs
The Colonial Period was initiated with the Spanish conquest which ended the hegemony of the Aztec Empire
It was accomplished with Spaniards' strategic alliances with enemies of the empire most especially Tlaxcala but also Huexotzinco Xochimilco and even Texcoco a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance
Although not all parts of Mesoamerica were brought under control of the Spanish Empire immediately the defeat of the Aztecs marked the dramatic beginning of an inexorable process of conquest in Mesoamerica and incorporation that Spain completed in the mid-seventeenth century
Indigenous peoples did not disappear although their numbers were greatly reduced in the sixteenth century by new infectious diseases brought by the Spanish invaders they suffered high mortality from slave labor and during epidemics
The fall of Tenochtitlan marked the beginning of the three-hundred-year colonial period and the imposition of Spanish rule
Mesoamerican civilisation was a complex network of different cultures
As seen in the time-line below these did not necessarily occur at the same time
The processes that gave rise to each of the cultural systems of Mesoamerica were very complex and not determined solely by the internal dynamics of each society
External as well as endogenous factors influenced their development
Among these factors for example were the relations between human groups and between humans and the environment human migrations and natural disasters
Historians and archaeologists divide pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican history into three periods
The Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire marks the end of indigenous rule and the incorporation of indigenous peoples as subjects of the Spanish Empire for the year colonial period
The postcolonial period began with Mexican independence in and continues to the present day
European conquest did not end the existence of Mesoamerica's indigenous peoples but did subject them to new political regimes
In the chart below of prehispanic cultures it is important to note that the dates mentioned are approximations and that the transition from one period to another did not occur at the same time nor under the same circumstances in all societies
The Preclassic period ran from BCE to CE
Its beginnings are marked by the development of the first ceramic traditions in the West specifically at sites such as Matanchn Nayarit and Puerto Marqus in Guerrero
Some authors hold that the early development of pottery in this area is related to the ties between South America and the coastal peoples of Mexico
The advent of ceramics is taken as an indicator of a sedentary society and it signals the divergence of Mesoamerica from the hunter-gatherer societies in the desert to the north
The Preclassic Era also known as the Formative Period is divided into three phases the Early BCE Middle BCE and Late BCE CE
During the first phase the manufacture of ceramics was widespread across the entire region the cultivation of maize and other vegetables became well-established and society started to become socially stratified in a process that concluded with the appearance of the first hierarchical societies along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico
In the early Preclassic period the Capacha culture acted as a driving force in the process of civilizing Mesoamerica and its pottery spread widely across the region
By BCE small settlements were developing in Guatemala's Pacific Lowlands places such as Tilapa La Blanca Ocs El Mesak Ujuxte and others where the oldest ceramic pottery from Guatemala have been found
From BCE a heavy concentration of pottery in the Pacific Coast Line has been documented
Recent excavations suggest that the Highlands were a geographic and temporal bridge between Early Preclassic villages of the Pacific coast and later Petn lowlands cities
In Monte Alto near La Democracia Escuintla in the Pacific lowlands of Guatemala some giant stone heads and potbelly sculptures barrigones have been found dated at c
BCE of the so-named Monte Alto Culture
Around BCE the cultures of the West entered a period of decline accompanied by an assimilation into the other peoples with whom they had maintained connections
As a result the Tlatilco culture emerged in the Valley of Mexico and the Olmec culture in the Gulf
Tlatilco was one of the principal Mesoamerican population centers of this period
Its people were adept at harnessing the natural resources of Lake Texcoco and at cultivating maize
Some authors posit that Tlatilco was founded and inhabited by the ancestors of today's Otomi people
The Olmecs on the other hand had entered into an expansionist phase that led them to construct their first works of monumental architecture at San Lorenzo and La Venta
The Olmecs exchanged goods within their own core area and with sites as far away as Guerrero and Morelos and present day Guatemala and Costa Rica
San Jos Mogote a site that also shows Olmec influences ceded dominance of the Oaxacan plateau to Monte Albn toward the end of the middle Preclassic Era
During this same time the Chupcuaro culture flourished in Bajo while along the Gulf the Olmecs entered a period of decline
One of the great cultural milestones that marked the Middle Preclassic period is the development of the first writing system by either the Maya the Olmec or the Zapotec
During this period the Mesoamerican societies were highly stratified
The connections between different centers of power permitted the rise of regional elites that controlled natural resources and peasant labor
This social differentiation was based on the possession of certain technical knowledge such as astronomy writing and commerce
Furthermore the Middle Preclassic period saw the beginnings of the process of urbanization that would come to define the societies of the Classic period
In the Maya area cities such as Nakbe c
BCE and San Bartolo show the same monumental architecture of the Classic period
In fact El Mirador is the largest Maya city
It has been argued that the Maya experienced a first collapse c
Some population centers such as Tlatilco Monte Albn and Cuicuilco flourished in the final stages of the Preclassic period
Meanwhile the Olmec populations shrank and ceased to be major players in the area
Toward the end of the Preclassic period political and commercial hegemony shifted to the population centers in the Valley of Mexico
Around Lake Texcoco there existed a number of villages that grew into true cities Tlatilco and Cuicuilco are examples
The former was found on the northern bank of the lake while the latter was on the slopes of the mountainous region of Ajusco
Tlatilco maintained strong relationships with the cultures of the West so much so that Cuicuilco controlled commerce in the Maya area Oaxaca and the Gulf coast
The rivalry between the two cities ended with the decline of Tlatilco
Meanwhile at Monte Albn in the Valley of Oaxaca the Zapotec had begun developing culturally independent of the Olmec adopting aspects of that culture but making their own contributions as well
On the southern coast of Guatemala Kaminaljuy advanced in the direction of what would be the Classic Maya culture even though its links to Central Mexico and the Gulf would initially provide their cultural models
Apart from the West where the tradition of the Tumbas de tiro had taken root in all the regions of Mesoamerica the cities grew in wealth with monumental constructions carried out according to urban plans that were surprisingly complex
The circular pyramid of Cuicuilco dates from this time as well as the central plaza of Monte Albn and the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan
Around the start of the common era Cuicuilco had disappeared and the hegemony over the Mexican basin had passed to Teotihuacan
The next two centuries marked the period in which the so-called city of the gods consolidated its power becoming the premier Mesoamerican city of the first millennium and the principal political economic and cultural center for the next seven centuries
For many years the Olmec culture was thought to be the 'mother culture' of Mesoamerica because of the great influence that it exercised throughout the region
However more recent perspectives consider this culture to be more of a process to which all the contemporary peoples contributed and which eventually crystallized on the coasts of Veracruz and Tabasco
The ethnic identity of the Olmecs is still widely debated
Based on linguistic evidence archaeologists and anthropologists generally believe that they were either speakers of an Oto-Manguean language or more likely the ancestors of the present-day Zoque people who live in the north of Chiapas and Oaxaca
According to this second hypothesis Zoque tribes emigrated toward the south after the fall of the major population centers of the Gulf plains
Whatever their origin these bearers of Olmec culture arrived at the leeward shore some eight thousand years BCE entering like a wedge among the fringe of proto-Maya peoples who lived along the coast a migration that would explain the separation of the Huastecs of the north of Veracruz from the rest of the Maya peoples based in the Yucatn Peninsula and Guatemala
The Olmec culture represents a milestone of Mesoamerican history as various characteristics that define the region first appeared there
Among them are the state organization the development of the -day ritual calendar and the -day secular calendar the first writing system and urban planning
The development of this culture started to BCE though it continued to consolidate itself up to the th century BCE
Its principal sites were La Venta San Lorenzo and Tres Zapotes in the core region
However throughout Mesoamerica numerous sites show evidence of Olmec occupation especially in the Balsas river basin where Teopantecuanitlan is located
This site is quite enigmatic since it dates from several centuries earlier than the main populations of the Gulf a fact which has continued to cause controversy and given rise to the hypothesis that the Olmec culture originated in that region
Among the best-known expressions of Olmec culture are giant stone heads sculptured monoliths up to three meters in height and several tons in weight
These feats of Olmec stonecutting are especially impressive when one considers that Mesoamericans lacked iron tools and that the heads are at sites dozens of kilometers from the quarries where their basalt was mined
The function of these monuments is unknown
Some authors propose that they were commemorative monuments for notable players of the ballgame and others that they were images of the Olmec governing elite
The Olmec are also known for their small carvings made of jade and other greenstones
So many of the Olmec figurines and sculptures contain representations of the were-jaguar that according to Jos Mara Covarrubias they could be forerunners of the worship of the rain god or maybe a predecessor of the future Tezcatlipoca in his manifestation as Tepeyolohtli the Heart of the Mountain
The exact causes of the Olmec decline are unknown
In the Pacific lowlands of the Maya Area Takalik Abaj c
BCE in the central Highlands of Guatemala advanced in the direction of what would be the Classic Maya culture
Apart from the West where the tradition of the Tumbas de tiro had taken root in all the regions of Mesoamerica the cities grew in wealth with monumental constructions carried out according to urban plans that were surprisingly complex
La Danta in El Mirador the San Bartolo murals and the circular pyramid of Cuicuilco date from this time as do the central plaza of Monte Albn and the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan
Toward the end of the Preclassic period political and commercial hegemony shifted to the population centers in the Valley of Mexico
Around Lake Texcoco there existed a number of villages that grew into true cities Tlatilco and Cuicuilco are examples
The former was found on the northern bank of the lake while the latter was on the slopes of the mountainous region of Ajusco
Tlatilco maintained strong relationships with the cultures of the West so much so that Cuicuilco controlled commerce in the Maya area Oaxaca and the Gulf coast
The rivalry between the two cities ended with the decline of Tlatilco
Meanwhile at Monte Albn in Oaxaca the Zapotec had begun developing culturally independent of the Olmec adopting aspects of that culture and making their own contributions as well
In Peten the great Classic Maya cities of Tikal Uaxactun and Seibal began their growth at c
Cuicuilco's hegemony over the valley declined in the period BCE to CE
As Cuicuilco declined Teotihuacan began to grow in importance
The next two centuries marked the period in which the so-called City of the gods consolidated its power becoming the premier Mesoamerican city of the first millennium and the principal political economic and cultural center in Central Mexico for the next seven centuries
The Classic period of Mesoamerica includes the years from to CE
The end point of this period varied from region to region for example in the center of Mexico it is related to the fall of the regional centers of the late Classic sometimes called Epiclassic period toward the year in the Gulf with the decline of El Tajn in the year in the Mayan area with the abandonment of the highland cities in the th century and in Oaxaca with the disappearance of Monte Albn around
Normally the Classic period in Mesoamerica is characterized as the stage in which the arts science urbanism architecture and social organization reached their peak
This period was also dominated by the influence of Teotihuacan throughout the region and the competition between the different Mesoamerican states led to continuous warfare
This period of Mesoamerican history can be divided into three phases
Early from to CE Middle from to and Late from to
The early Classic period began with the expansion of Teotihuacan which led to its control over the principal trade routes of northern Mesoamerica
During this time the process of urbanization that started in the last centuries of the early Preclassic period was consolidated
The principal centers of this phase were Monte Albn Kaminaljuyu Ceibal Tikal and Calakmul and then Teotihuacan in which percent of the inhabitants of the Lake Texcoco basin were concentrated
The cities of this era were characterized by their multi-ethnic composition which entailed the cohabitation in the same population centers of people with different languages cultural practices and places of origin
During this period the alliances between the regional political elites were strengthened especially for those allied with Teotihuacan
Also social differentiation became more pronounced a small dominant group ruled over the majority of the population
This majority was forced to pay tribute and to participate in the building of public structures such as irrigation systems religious edifices and means of communication
The growth of the cities could not have happened without advances in agricultural methods and the strengthening of trade networks involving not only the peoples of Mesoamerica but also the distant cultures of Oasisamerica
The arts of Mesoamerica reached their high-point in this era
Especially notable are the Mayan stelae carved pillars exquisite monuments commemorating the stories of the Royal families the rich corpus of polychrome ceramics mural painting and music
In Teotihuacan architecture made great advances the Classic style was defined by the construction of pyramidal bases that sloped upward in a step-wise fashion
The Teotihuacan architectural style was reproduced and modified in other cities throughout Mesoamerica the clearest examples being the Zapotec capital of Monte Alban and Kaminal Juy in Guatemala
Centuries later long after Teotihuacan was abandoned c
CE cities of the Postclassic era followed the style of Teotihuacan construction especially Tula Tenochtitlan and Chichn Itz
Many scientific advances were also achieved during this period
The Maya refined their calendar script and mathematics to their highest level of development
Writing came to be used throughout the Mayan area although it was still regarded as a noble activity and practiced only by noble scribes painters and priests
Using a similar system of writing other cultures developed their own scripts the most notable examples being those of the Ñuiñe culture and the Zapotecs of Oaxaca although the Mayan system was the only fully developed writing system in Precolumbian America
Astronomy remained a matter of vital significance because of its importance for agriculture the economic basis of Mesoamerican society and to predict events in the future such as lunar and solar eclipses an important feature for the rulers proving to the commoners their links with the heavenly world
The Middle Classic period ended in Northern Mesoamerica with the decline of Teotihuacan
This allowed other regional power centers to flourish and compete for control of trade routes and natural resources
In this way the late Classic era commenced
Political fragmentation during this era meant no city had complete hegemony
Various population movements occurred caused by the incursion of groups from Aridoamerica and other northern regions who pushed the older populations of Mesoamerica south
Among these new groups were the Nahua who would later found the cities of Tula and Tenochtitlan the two most important capitals of the Postclassic era
In addition southern peoples established themselves in the center of Mexico including the Olmec-Xicalanca who came from the Yucatn Peninsula and founded Cacaxtla and Xochicalco
In the Maya region Tikal an ally of Teotihuacan experienced a decline the so-called Tikal Hiatus after being defeated by Dos Pilas and Caracol ally of Calakmul lasted about another years
During this hiatus the cities of Dos Pilas Piedras Negras Caracol Calakmul Palenque Copn and Yaxchiln were consolidated
These and other city-states of the region found themselves involved in bloody wars with changing alliances until Tikal defeated in order Dos Pilas Caracol with the help of Yaxha and El Naranjo Waka Calakmul's last ally and finally Calakmul itself an event that took place in with the sacrifice of Yuknom Cheen's son in Tikal
That led to construction of monumental architecture in Tikal from to the last date documented there was
The ruin of the Classic Maya civilization in the northern lowlands begun at La Passion states such as Dos Pilas Aguateca Ceibal and Cancun c
followed by the Usumacinta system cities of Yaxchilan Piedras Negras and Palenque following a path from south to north
Toward the end of the late Classic period the Maya stopped recording the years using the Long Count calendar and many of their cities were burned and abandoned to the jungle
Meanwhile in the Southern Highlands Kaminal Juy continued its growth until
In Oaxaca Monte Alban reached its apex c
and finally succumbed toward the end of the th century for reasons that are still unclear
Its fate was not much different from that of other cities such as La Quemada in the north and Teotihuacan in the center it was burned and abandoned
In the last century of the Classic era hegemony in the valley of Oaxaca passed to Lambityeco several kilometers to the east
Teotihuacan The City of the Gods in Nahuatl originated toward the end of the Preclassic period c
Very little is known about its founders but it is believed that the Otom had an important role in the city's development as they did in the ancient culture of the Valley of Mexico represented by Tlatilco
Teotihuacan initially competed with Cuicuilco for hegemony in the area
In this political and economic battle Teotihuacan was aided by its control of the obsidian deposits in the Navaja mountains in Hidalgo
The decline of Cuicuilco is still a mystery but it is known that a large part of the former inhabitants resettled in Teotihuacan some years before the eruption of Xitle which covered the southern town in lava
Once free of competition in the area of the Lake of Mexico Teotihuacan experienced an expansion phase that made it one of the largest cities of its time not just in Mesoamerica but in the entire world
During this period of growth it attracted the vast majority of those then living in the Valley of Mexico
Teotihuacan was completely dependent on agricultural activity primarily the cultivation of maize beans and squash the Mesoamerican agricultural trinity
However its political and economic hegemony was based on outside goods for which it enjoyed a monopoly Anaranjado ceramics produced in the PoblanoTlaxcalteca valley and the mineral deposits of the Hidalgan mountains
Both were highly valued throughout Mesoamerica and were exchanged for luxury merchandise of the highest caliber from places as far away as New Mexico and Guatemala
Because of this Teotihuacan became the hub of the Mesoamerican trade network
Its partners were Monte Albn and Tikal in the southeast Matacapan on the Gulf coast Altavista in the north and Tingambato in the west
Teotihuacan refined the Mesoamerican pantheon of deities whose origins dated from the time of the Olmec
Of special importance were the worship of Quetzalcoatl and Tlloc agricultural deities
Trade links promoted the spread of these cults to other Mesoamerican societies who took and transformed them
It was thought that Teotihuacan society had no knowledge of writing but as Duverger demonstrates the writing system of Teotihuacan was extremely pictographic to the point that writing was confused with drawing
The fall of Teotihuacan is associated with the emergence of city-states within the confines of the central area of Mexico
It is thought that these were able to flourish due to the decline of Teotihuacan though events may have occurred in the opposite order the cities of Cacaxtla Xochicalco Teotenango and El Tajn may have first increased in power and then were able to economically strangle Teotihuacan trapped as it was in the center of the valley without access to trade routes
This occurred around CE and even though people continued to live there for another century and a half the city was eventually destroyed and abandoned by its inhabitants who took refuge in places such as Culhuacn and Azcapotzalco on the shores of Lake Texcoco
The Maya created one of the most developed and best-known Mesoamerican cultures
Coe believe that the Mayan culture is completely different from the surrounding cultures many elements present in Maya culture are shared by the rest of Mesoamerica including the use of two calendars the base number system the cultivation of corn human sacrifice and certain myths such as that of the fifth sun and cultic worship including that of the Feathered Serpent and the rain god who in the Yucatec Maya language is called Chaac
The beginnings of Mayan culture date from the development of Kaminaljuyu in the Highlands of Guatemala during the middle Preclassic period
Hansen and others researchers the first true political states in Mesoamerica consisted of Takalik Abaj in the Pacific Lowlands and the cities of El Mirador Nakbe Cival and San Bartolo among others in the Mirador Basin and Peten
Archaeologists believe that this development happened centuries later around the st century BCE but recent research in the Petn basin and Belize have proven them wrong
The archaeological evidence indicates that the Maya never formed a united empire they were instead organized into small chiefdoms that were constantly at war
Lpez Austin and Lpez Lujn have said that the Preclassic Maya were characterized by their bellicose nature
They probably had a greater mastery of the art of war than Teotihuacan yet the idea that they were a peaceful society given to religious contemplation which persists to this day was particularly promoted by early- and mid-th century Mayanists such as Sylvanus G
Confirmation that the Maya practiced human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism came much later eg
Writing and the Maya calendar were quite early developments in the great Maya cities c
BCE and some of the oldest commemorative monuments are from sites in the Maya region
Archaeologists once thought that the Maya sites functioned only as ceremonial centers and that the common people lived in the surrounding villages
However more recent excavations indicate the Maya sites enjoyed urban services as extensive as those of Tikal believed to be as large as inhabitants at its peak circa Copan and others
Drainage aqueducts and pavement or Sakbe meaning white road united major centers since the Preclassic
The construction of these sites was carried out on the basis of a highly stratified society dominated by the noble class who at the same time were the political military and religious elite
The elite controlled agriculture practiced by means of mixed systems of ground-clearing and intensive platforms around the cities
As in the rest of Mesoamerica they imposed on the lowest classes taxes—in kind or in labor—that permitted them to concentrate sufficient resources for the construction of public monuments which legitimized the power of the elites and the social hierarchy
the Mayan political elite sustained strong ties to Teotihuacan and it is possible that Tikal may have been an important ally of Teotihuacan that controlled commerce with the Gulf coast and highlands
Finally it seems the great drought that ravaged Central America in the th century internal wars ecological disasters and famine destroyed the Mayan political system which led to popular uprisings and the defeat of the dominant political groups
Many cities were abandoned remaining unknown until the th century when descendants of the Maya led a group of European and American archaeologists to these cities which had been swallowed over the centuries by the jungle
The Postclassic period is the time between the year and the conquest of Mesoamrica by the Spaniards which occurred between and
It was a period in which military activity became of great importance
The political elites associated with the priestly class were relieved of power by groups of warriors
In turn at least a half-century before the arrival of the Spaniards the warrior class was yielding its positions of privilege to a very powerful group that was unconnected to the nobility the pochtecas merchants who obtained great political power by virtue of their economic power
The Postclassic period is divided into two phases
The first is the early Postclassic which includes the th to the th century and is characterized by the Toltec hegemony of Tula
The th century marks the beginning of the late Postclassic period which begins with the arrival of the Chichimec linguistically related to the Toltecs and the Mexica who established themselves in the Valley of Mexico in following a two-century pilgrimage from Aztln the exact location of which is unknown
Many of the social changes of this final period of Mesoamerican civilization are related to the migratory movements of the northern peoples
These peoples came from Oasisamerica Aridoamerica and the northern region of Mesoamerica driven by climate changes that threatened their survival
The migrations from the north caused in turn the displacement of peoples who had been rooted in Mesoamerica for centuries some of them left for Centroamerica
There were many cultural changes during that time
One of them was the expansion of metallurgy imported from South America and whose oldest remnants in Mesoamerica come from the West as is the case also with ceramics
The Mesoamericans did not achieve great facility with metals in fact their use was rather limited a few copper axes needles and above all jewelry
The most advanced techniques of Mesoamerican metallurgy were developed by the mixtecos who produced fine exquisitely handcrafted articles
Remarkable advances were made in architecture as well
The use of nails in architecture was introduced to support the sidings of the temples the mortar was improved and the use of columns and stone roofs was widespread—something that only the Maya had used during the Classic period
In agriculture the system of irrigation became more complex in the Valley of Mexico especially chinampas were used extensively by the Mexica who built a city of around them
The political system also underwent important changes
During the early Postclassic period the warlike political elites legitimized their position by means of their adherence to a complex set of religious beliefs that Lpez Austin called zuyuanidad
According to this system the ruling classes proclaimed themselves the descendants of Quetzalcoatl the Plumed Serpent one of the creative forces and a cultural hero in Mesoamerican mythology
They likewise declared themselves the heirs of a no less mythical city called Tollan in Nahuatl and Zuyu in Maya from which Lpez Austin derives the name for the belief system
Many of the important capitals of the time identified themselves with this name for example Tollan Xicocotitlan Tollan Chollollan Tollan Teotihuacan
The Tollan of myth was for a long time identified with Tula in Hidalgo state but Enrique Florescano and Lpez Austin have claimed that this has no basis
Florescano states that the mythical Tollan was Teotihuacan Lpez Austin argues that Tollan was simply a product of the Mesoamerican religious imagination
Another feature of the zuyuano system was the formation of alliances with other city-states that were controlled by groups having the same ideology such was the case with the League of Mayapn in Yucatn and the Mixtec confederation of Lord Eight Deer based in the mountains of Oaxaca
These early Postclassic societies can be characterized by their military nature and multi-ethnic populations
However the fall of Tula checked the power of the zuyuano system which finally broke down with the dissolution of the League of Mayapn the Mixtec state and the abandonment of Tula
Mesoamerica received new immigrants from the north and although these groups were related to the ancient Toltecs they had a completely different ideology than the existing residents
The final arrivals were the Mexica who established themselves on a small island on Lake Texcoco under the dominion of the Texpanecs of Azcapotzalco
This group would in the following decades conquer a large part of Mesoamerica creating a united and centralized state whose only rivals were the Tarascan state of Michoacn
Neither one of them could defeat the other and it seems that a type of non-aggression pact was established between the two peoples
When the Spaniards arrived many of the peoples controlled by the Mexica no longer wished to continue under their rule
Therefore they took advantage of the opportunity presented by the Europeans agreeing to support them thinking that in return they would gain their freedom and not knowing that this would lead to the subjugation of all of the Mesoamerican world
Of all prehispanic Mesoamerican cultures the best-known is the Mexica of the city-state of Tenochtitlan also known as the Aztecs
The Aztec Empire dominated central Mexico for close to a century before the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire
The Mexica people came from the north or the west of Mesoamerica
The Nayaritas believed that the mythic Aztln was located on the island of Mexcaltitn
Some hypothesize that this mythical island could have been located somewhere in the state of the Zacatecas and it has even been proposed that it was as far north as New Mexico
Whatever the case they were probably not far removed from the classic Mesoamerican tradition
In fact they shared many characteristics with the people of central Mesoamerica
The Mexicas spoke Nahuatl the same language spoken by the Toltecs and the Chichimecs who came before them
The date of the departure from Aztln is debated with suggested dates of and
After much wandering the Mexicas arrived at the basin of the Valley of Mexico in the th century
They established themselves at various points along the bank of the river for example Culhuacn and Tizapn before settling on the Islet of Mexico protected by Tezozmoc king of the Texpanecas
The city of Tenochtitlan was founded in as an ally of Azcapotzalco but less than a century later in the Mexicas joined with Texcoco and Tlacopan to wage war against Azcapotzalco and emerged victoriously
This gave birth to the Triple Alliance that replaced the ancient confederation ruled by the Tecpanecas which included Coatlinchan and Culhuacn
In the earliest days of the Triple Alliance the Mexica initiated an expansionist phase that led them to control a good part of Mesoamerica
During this time only a few regions retained their independence Tlaxcala Nahua Meztitln Otom Teotitln del Camino Cuicatec Tututepec Mixtec Tehuantepec Zapotec and the northwest ruled at that time by their rivals the Tarascans
The provinces controlled by the Triple Alliance were forced to pay a tribute to Tenochtitlan these payments are recorded in another codex known as the Matrcula de Los tributos Registry of Tribute
This document specifies the quantity and type of every item that each province had to pay to the Mexicas
The Mexica state was conquered by the Spanish forces of Hernn Corts and their Tlaxcalan and Totonac allies in
The defeat of Mesoamerica was complete when in Tayasal was burned and razed by the Spanish
With the destruction of the superstructure of the Aztec Empire in central Mexico was brought under the control of the Spanish Empire
Over the course of the succeeding decades virtually all of Mesoamerica was brought under Spanish control which resulted in a fairly uniform policies toward indigenous populations
Spaniards' established the fallen Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan as Mexico City the seat of government for the Viceroyalty of New Spain
The great initial project for Spanish conquerors was converting the indigenous peoples to Christianity the only permitted religion
This endeavor was undertaken by Franciscan Dominican and Augustinian friars immediately after conquest
Divvying up of the spoils of the war was of key interest to the Spanish conquerors
The major ongoing benefit to conquerors after the obvious material plunder was to appropriate the existing system of tribute and obligatory labor to the Spanish victors
This was done by the establishment of the encomienda which awarded the tribute and labor from individual indigenous polities to particular Spanish conquerors
In that way the economic and political arrangements at the level of the indigenous community were largely kept intact
The indigenous polity altepetl in the Nahua area cah in the Maya region was the key to cultural survival of indigenous under Spanish rule while at the same time also providing the structure for their economic exploitation
Spaniards classified all indigenous peoples as Indians indios a term that the indigenous peoples never embraced
They were classified legally as being under the jurisdiction of the Repblica de Indios
They were legally separated from the Repblica de Españoles which comprised Europeans Africans and mixed-race castas
In general indigenous communities in Mesoamerica kept much of their prehispanic social and political structures with indigenous elites continuing to function as leaders in their communities
These elites acted as intermediaries with the Spanish crown so long as they remained loyal
There were significant changes in Mesoamerican communities during the colonial era but during the entire colonial period Mesoamericans were the largest single non-Hispanic group in the colonial Mexico far larger than the entire Hispanic sphere
Although the Spanish colonial system imposed many changes on Mesoamerican peoples they did not force the acquisition of Spanish and Mesoamerican languages continued to flourish to the present day
Mexico became independent from Spain in with some participation of indigenous in decade-long political struggles but for their own motivations
With the fall of colonial government the Mexican state abolished distinctions between ethnic groups that is the separate governance for indigenous populations in the Repblica de Indios
The new sovereign country made in theory at least all Mexicans citizens of the independent nation-state rather than vassals of the Spanish crown with different legal standing
A long period of political chaos in the post-independence period among white elites largely did not affect indigenous peoples and their communities
Mexican conservatives were largely in charge of the national government and kept in place practices from the old colonial order
However in the s Mexican liberals gained power and attempted to formulate and implement reforms that did affect indigenous communities as well as the Catholic Church
The Mexican Constitution of abolished the ability of corporations to hold land which aimed at taking assets out of the hands of the Catholic Church in Mexico and forcing indigenous communities to divide their community-held lands
Liberals' aimed at turning indigenous community members pursuing subsistence farming into yeoman farmers holding their own land
Mexican conservatives repudiated the liberal reform laws since they attacked the Catholic Church but indigenous communities also participated in a three-year civil war
In the late nineteenth century liberal army general Porfirio Daz a Mestizo did much for modernizing Mexico and integrating it into the world economy but there were renewed pressures on indigenous communities and their lands
These exploded in certain areas of Mexico during the ten-year long civil war the Mexican Revolution
In the aftermath of the Revolution the Mexican government attempted simultaneously shore up indigenous culture while at the same time also attempting to integrate the indigenous as citizens of the nation turning indigenous into peasants campesinos
This has proved more difficult than policy planners imagined with resilient indigenous communities continuing to struggle for rights within the nation
