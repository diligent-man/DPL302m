polity wa generally independent although often formed alliance sometimes became vassal state other
main conflict period wa tikal calakmul fought series war course half millennium
postclassic period many great nation city classic era collapsed although continued oaxaca cholula maya yucatan chichen itza uxmal
however wa time technological advancement architecture engineering weaponry
metallurgy introduced c came use jewelry tool new alloy technique developed centuries
postclassic wa period rapid movement population growthespecially central mexico post-and experimentation governance
instance yucatan 'dual rulership' apparently replaced theocratic government classic time oligarchic council operated much central mexico
likewise appears wealthy pochteca merchant class military order became powerful wa apparently case classic times
toltec time dominated central mexico - century collapsed
oaxaca wa briefly united mixtec ruler - centuries
aztec empire arose early century appeared path asserting dominance valley mexico region seen since teotihuacan
century mayan 'revival' yucatan southern guatemala flourishing aztec imperialism evidently enabled renaissance fine art science
example include 'pueblan-mexica' style pottery codex illumination goldwork flourishing nahua poetry botanical institute established aztec elite
colonial period wa initiated spanish conquest ended hegemony aztec empire
wa accomplished spaniards' strategic alliance enemy empire especially tlaxcala also huexotzinco xochimilco even texcoco former partner aztec triple alliance
although part mesoamerica brought control spanish empire immediately defeat aztec marked dramatic beginning inexorable process conquest mesoamerica incorporation spain completed mid-seventeenth century
indigenous people disappear although number greatly reduced sixteenth century new infectious disease brought spanish invader suffered high mortality slave labor epidemics
fall tenochtitlan marked beginning three-hundred-year colonial period imposition spanish rule

growth city could happened without advance agricultural method strengthening trade network involving people mesoamerica also distant culture oasisamerica
especially notable mayan stele carved pillar exquisite monument commemorating story royal family rich corpus polychrome ceramic mural painting music
teotihuacan architecture made great advance classic style wa defined construction pyramidal base sloped upward step-wise fashion
teotihuacan architectural style wa reproduced modified city throughout mesoamerica clearest example zapotec capital monte alban kaminal juy guatemala

hansen others researcher first true political state mesoamerica consisted takalik abaj pacific lowland city el mirador nakbe cival san bartolo among others mirador basin peten
archaeologist believe development happened century later around st century bce recent research petn basin belize proven wrong
archaeological evidence indicates maya never formed united empire instead organized small chiefdoms constantly war
lpez austin lpez lujn said preclassic maya characterized bellicose nature
probably greater mastery art war teotihuacan yet idea peaceful society given religious contemplation persists day wa particularly promoted early- mid- century mayanists sylvanus g
confirmation maya practiced human sacrifice ritual cannibalism came much later eg
writing maya calendar quite early development great maya city c
archaeologist thought maya site functioned ceremonial center common people lived surrounding villages
however recent excavation indicate maya site enjoyed urban service extensive tikal believed large inhabitant peak circa copan others
drainage aqueduct pavement sakbe meaning white road united major center since preclassic
construction site wa carried basis highly stratified society dominated noble class time political military religious elite
elite controlled agriculture practiced mean mixed system ground-clearing intensive platform around cities
rest mesoamerica imposed lowest class taxesin kind laborthat permitted concentrate sufficient resource construction public monument legitimized power elite social hierarchy
mayan political elite sustained strong tie teotihuacan possible tikal may important ally teotihuacan controlled commerce gulf coast highlands
finally seems great drought ravaged central america century internal war ecological disaster famine destroyed mayan political system led popular uprising defeat dominant political groups
many city abandoned remaining unknown century descendant maya led group european american archaeologist city swallowed century jungle
postclassic period time year conquest mesoamrica spaniard occurred and
political elite associated priestly class relieved power group warriors
turn least half-century arrival spaniard warrior class wa yielding position privilege powerful group wa unconnected nobility pochtecas merchant obtained great political power virtue economic power
first early postclassic includes century characterized toltec hegemony tula
century mark beginning late postclassic period begin arrival chichimec linguistically related toltec mexica established valley mexico following two-century pilgrimage aztln exact location unknown
many social change final period mesoamerican civilization related migratory movement northern peoples
people came oasisamerica aridoamerica northern region mesoamerica driven climate change threatened survival
migration north caused turn displacement people rooted mesoamerica century left centroamerica
one wa expansion metallurgy imported south america whose oldest remnant mesoamerica come west case also ceramics
mesoamerican achieve great facility metal fact use wa rather limited copper ax needle jewelry
advanced technique mesoamerican metallurgy developed mixtecos produced fine exquisitely handcrafted articles
use nail architecture wa introduced support siding temple mortar wa improved use column stone roof wa widespreadsomething maya used classic period
agriculture system irrigation became complex valley mexico especially chinampas used extensively mexica built city around them
early postclassic period warlike political elite legitimized position mean adherence complex set religious belief lpez austin called zuyuanidad
according system ruling class proclaimed descendant quetzalcoatl plumed serpent one creative force cultural hero mesoamerican mythology
likewise declared heir le mythical city called tollan nahuatl zuyu maya lpez austin derives name belief system
many important capital time identified name example tollan xicocotitlan tollan chollollan tollan teotihuacan
tollan myth wa long time identified tula hidalgo state enrique florescano lpez austin claimed ha basis
florescano state mythical tollan wa teotihuacan lpez austin argues tollan wa simply product mesoamerican religious imagination
another feature zuyuano system wa formation alliance city-state controlled group ideology wa case league mayapn yucatn mixtec confederation lord eight deer based mountain oaxaca
early postclassic society characterized military nature multi-ethnic populations
however fall tula checked power zuyuano system finally broke dissolution league mayapn mixtec state abandonment tula
mesoamerica received new immigrant north although group related ancient toltec completely different ideology existing residents
final arrival mexica established small island lake texcoco dominion texpanecs azcapotzalco
group would following decade conquer large part mesoamerica creating united centralized state whose rival tarascan state michoacn
neither one could defeat seems type non-aggression pact wa established two peoples
spaniard arrived many people controlled mexica longer wished continue rule
therefore took advantage opportunity presented european agreeing support thinking return would gain freedom knowing would lead subjugation mesoamerican world
prehispanic mesoamerican culture best-known mexica city-state tenochtitlan also known aztecs
aztec empire dominated central mexico close century spanish conquest aztec empire
nayaritas believed mythic aztln wa located island mexcaltitn
hypothesize mythical island could located somewhere state zacatecas ha even proposed wa far north new mexico
whatever case probably far removed classic mesoamerican tradition
mexicas spoke nahuatl language spoken toltec chichimecs came them
much wandering mexicas arrived basin valley mexico century
established various point along bank river example culhuacn tizapn settling islet mexico protected tezozmoc king texpanecas
city tenochtitlan wa founded ally azcapotzalco le century later mexicas joined texcoco tlacopan wage war azcapotzalco emerged victoriously
gave birth triple alliance replaced ancient confederation ruled tecpanecas included coatlinchan culhuacn
earliest day triple alliance mexica initiated expansionist phase led control good part mesoamerica
time region retained independence tlaxcala nahua meztitln otom teotitln del camino cuicatec tututepec mixtec tehuantepec zapotec northwest ruled time rival tarascans
province controlled triple alliance forced pay tribute tenochtitlan payment recorded another codex known matrcula de los tributos registry tribute
document specifies quantity type every item province pay mexicas
mexica state wa conquered spanish force hernn corts tlaxcalan totonac ally in
defeat mesoamerica wa complete tayasal wa burned razed spanish
destruction superstructure aztec empire central mexico wa brought control spanish empire
course succeeding decade virtually mesoamerica wa brought spanish control resulted fairly uniform policy toward indigenous populations
spaniards' established fallen aztec capital tenochtitlan mexico city seat government viceroyalty new spain
great initial project spanish conqueror wa converting indigenous people christianity permitted religion
endeavor wa undertaken franciscan dominican augustinian friar immediately conquest
divvying spoil war wa key interest spanish conquerors
major ongoing benefit conqueror obvious material plunder wa appropriate existing system tribute obligatory labor spanish victors
wa done establishment encomienda awarded tribute labor individual indigenous polity particular spanish conquerors
way economic political arrangement level indigenous community largely kept intact
indigenous polity altepetl nahua area cah maya region wa key cultural survival indigenous spanish rule time also providing structure economic exploitation
spaniard classified indigenous people indian indios term indigenous people never embraced
legally separated repblica de espaoles comprised european african mixed-race castas
general indigenous community mesoamerica kept much prehispanic social political structure indigenous elite continuing function leader communities
elite acted intermediary spanish crown long remained loyal
significant change mesoamerican community colonial era entire colonial period mesoamerican largest single non-hispanic group colonial mexico far larger entire hispanic sphere
although spanish colonial system imposed many change mesoamerican people force acquisition spanish mesoamerican language continued flourish present day
mexico became independent spain participation indigenous decade-long political struggle motivations
fall colonial government mexican state abolished distinction ethnic group separate governance indigenous population repblica de indios
new sovereign country made theory least mexican citizen independent nation-state rather vassal spanish crown different legal standing
long period political chaos post-independence period among white elite largely affect indigenous people communities
mexican conservative largely charge national government kept place practice old colonial order
however mexican liberal gained power attempted formulate implement reform affect indigenous community well catholic church
mexican constitution abolished ability corporation hold land aimed taking asset hand catholic church mexico forcing indigenous community divide community-held lands
liberals' aimed turning indigenous community member pursuing subsistence farming yeoman farmer holding land
mexican conservative repudiated liberal reform law since attacked catholic church indigenous community also participated three-year civil war
late nineteenth century liberal army general porfirio daz mestizo much modernizing mexico integrating world economy renewed pressure indigenous community lands
exploded certain area mexico ten-year long civil war mexican revolution
aftermath revolution mexican government attempted simultaneously shore indigenous culture time also attempting integrate indigenous citizen nation turning indigenous peasant campesinos
ha proved difficult policy planner imagined resilient indigenous community continuing struggle right within nation
