After John heals Paul's severe bladder infection by touching him and later resurrects Mr Jingles Paul gradually realizes that John possesses a supernatural ability to heal others Suspecting that John is endowed with the power to perform divine miracles Paul doubts whether he is truly guilty of his crimes Meanwhile the officers are forced to deal with psychotic new inmate William Wild Bill Wharton who frequently causes trouble by assaulting the officers and racially abusing John forcing them to restrain him in the block's padded cell on more than one occasion
In exchange for resigning from the penitentiary and accepting a job at an insane asylum Percy is allowed to oversee Del's execution At the execution Percy deliberately avoids soaking the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head leading to Del suffering a gruesome and agonizing death with John forced to feel Del's pain as well Paul and the other officers bind and gag Percy as punishment for his actions and force him to spend a night in the padded cell While Percy is locked away they secretly smuggle John out of the prison so that he can use his powers to heal Warden Moores's wife Melinda of a brain tumor saving her life After Percy is released from the padded room the others threaten to report him for his various acts of misconduct if his behavior continues
Later John uses his powers to release Melinda's affliction into Percy's brain causing Percy to shoot Wild Bill to death Soon after John reveals in a vision to Paul that Wild Bill was the true culprit of the crimes for which he was wrongfully condemned releasing his supernatural energy into Paul in the process Having suffered a mental breakdown Percy is committed to the same insane asylum where he had planned to work after resigning from the prison
Finally realizing that John is innocent Paul is distraught at the thought of executing him and offers to let him go free John tells Paul that the execution would be an act of mercy as he views the world as a cruel place and is in constant pain from the suffering that people inflict upon each other Mentioning that he has never seen a movie before John watches Top Hat with the other officers as a last request When executed later that night he asks not to have a hood placed over his head as he is afraid of the dark The officers all watch in sadness visibly holding back tears as Coffey is executed Back in the present Paul tells Elaine that John's was the last execution that he and Brutal witnessed as they both subsequently resigned from the prison and took jobs in the juvenile system
Concluding his story Paul reveals that Del's mouse Mr Jingles is still alive having been blessed with a supernaturally long life thanks to John's healing touch He also reveals that he himself is now years old having been at the time of John's execution While Elaine sees Paul's long life as another of John's miracles Paul speculates that it may be a divine punishment and that he has been condemned to linger on Earth and outlive all of his loved ones for killing John Paul is later shown attending Elaine's funeral and muses on how much longer he has left to live

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film +‚ÅÑ out of stars writing The film is a shade over three hours long I appreciated the extra time which allows us to feel the passage of prison months and years it tells a story with beginning middle end vivid characters humor outrage and emotional release Writing for Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum also took note of the film's length but praised Tom Hanks' superior performance and Darabont's direction Darabont's style of picture making is well matched to King size yarn spinning The director isn't afraid to let big emotions and grand gestures linger she said San Francisco Chronicle's Edward Guthmann thought the cinematography was handsome and the music was florid and melodramatic He added Darabont is such a committed filmmaker and believes so earnestly and intensely in the stories he puts onscreen Desson Thomson of The Washington Post called the storytelling brilliant and said From its deceptively easygoing beginning to the heart wrenching finale The Green Mile keeps you wonderfully high above the cynical ground
However some critics had a less positive response Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter opined By inflating the simple story with a languorous pace pregnant pauses long reaction shots and an infinitely slow metabolism Darabont has burdened his movie version with more self importance than it can possibly sustain Whilst complimenting the production design and soundtrack the critic from Timeout magazine thought some scenes were tiresome and the film suffers from a surfeit of plot threads and characters Writing for the BBC Clark Collis took issue with some of the plot's unrealistic elements and thought the film was too long David Ansen of Newsweek thought The Green Mile was weaker than Darabont's previous film The Shawshank Redemption He stated The Green Mile is a lumbering self important three hour melodrama that defies credibility at every turn
