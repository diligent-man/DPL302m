Andrew Wells produced “More than Friends” and co-wrote it with Jason Mraz, Meghan Trainor and Jonathan Green
After Mraz initially finished his album Know., Wells suggested that he have a songwriting session with Trainor
Mraz agreed to this, but was unsure of what would come of it
"More than Friends" was written during this session, and led to him pushing back "a few departments and their deadlines" to accommodate it on the record
With the song, Trainor intended to create her own version of Mraz and Colbie Caillat's song "Lucky" (2009)
It was inspired by a conversation Mraz had with his wife, he said "My wife, she has these cute things she does, when I make her a cup of coffee, I'll be like, 'Is it good?' And she'll say, 'Oh, more than friends.' I thought that was so cute."
"More than Friends" is a "bubbly" and "quirky" acoustic love song
It is sung in a back-and-forth style with Mraz opening with "It feels like we've been friends forever and we always see eye-to-eye", and Trainor responds "At the risk of sounding foolish/ I don't wanna fool around no more/ So if we're gonna do this, then let's do this/ You could fix my broken heart if it's all yours." It has a "catchy" chorus and "summery, carefree vibes." The song was described as "breezy" and "ebullient" by some critics
It has lyrics about "wishing you could step out of the friend zone." A writer for iHeartRadio MMVAs said that it "gives off the vibe of a budding summer romance", noting that its lyrics recount "the feelings of a pair of friends who are interested in taking their relationship to the next level."
