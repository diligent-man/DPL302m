Zenz received a master's degree in development studies from the University of Auckland after which he managed development projects in China He later received a PhD in social anthropology from the University of Cambridge with a doctoral thesis on minority education job opportunities and the ethnic identity of young Tibetans in western China He is a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese

Zenz also serves as an advisor to the Inter Parliamentary Alliance on China
Zenz's most influential work has been his research on the mass detention of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities within China's Xinjiang internment camps Zenz was one of the first researchers to have revealed the existence size and scope of these camps
Since February Zenz has studied the mass detention of Uyghurs in internment camps in Xinjiang His work has been based on Chinese government budget plans bidding papers leaked documents spreadsheets and other official documents In a May report published by the Washington D C based Jamestown Foundation Zenz initially estimated the number of detained Muslims to range from to just over million Zenz based this estimate on documents published by Istiqlal a Turkey based Uyghur exile media organization which had reportedly been leaked by anonymous Chinese public security officials in the region along with two reports on Muslim detention quotas by Shohret Hoshur for Radio Free Asia He then extrapolated from these figures and incorporated information from former detainees and public Chinese government documents that gave indications of the sizes and numbers of the camps
Since then his estimate has been cited widely with many sources including experts on a United Nations human rights panel preferring to use the higher end of the estimate's range while other scholars have questioned its accuracy Later in March Zenz provided a higher speculative estimate to the United Nations that million Uyghurs had been detained in camps saying that his number accounted for both the increases in the size and scope of detention in the region and public reporting on the stories of Uyghur exiles with family in internment camps In July Zenz wrote in the Journal of Political Risk that he speculated that million Uyghurs had been extrajudicially detained which he described as being an equivalent to just under one in six adult members of a Turkic and predominantly Muslim minority group in Xinjiang In November Zenz estimated that the number of internment camps in Xinjiang had surpassed In July Zenz wrote in Foreign Policy that his estimate had increased since November estimating that a total of million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities had been extrajudicially detained in what he described as the largest incarceration of an ethnoreligious minority since the Holocaust arguing that the Chinese Government was engaging in policies in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
Zenz has also researched publicly available Chinese government documents that showed that the Chinese government has spent tens of millions of dollars since on a birth control surgery program that includes cash incentives for sterilization procedures Zenz's research showed that birth control violations are punishable by internment in the Xinjiang internment camps a conclusion that has been corroborated by an Associated Press investigation which also found that women in Xinjiang were forcibly sterilized and subject to forced abortions According to Zenz population growth rates in the two largest Uyghur prefectures in Xinjiang Kashgar and Hotan fell by between and due to forced sterilization contraception and abortions on Uyghurs
In June Zenz published a page study in Central Asian Survey arguing that China has carried population control in Xinjiang with the explicit long term intent to reduce population growth of the Uyghur ethnic minority
Zenz published the Xinjiang Police Files a collection of official police documents he received from anonymous hackers in early The files include instructions on operating the camps speeches and thousands of mug shots taken in
Zenz is the author of 'Tibetanness' Under Threat a study of the modern Tibetan education system In the book he examines the career prospects of students who major in Tibetan language studies and the notion that the greater market value of Chinese language education threatens Tibetan ethnocultural survival
In September Zenz authored a report that said that Tibetans mostly subsistence farmers and herders were trained in the first seven months of in military style training centres According to BBC News experts have said these centres are akin to labour camps
Zenz is a lapsed Catholic turned born again Christian and has stated that he feels led by God in his research on Chinese Muslims and other minority groups Zenz co authored a book in with his father in law Marlon L Sias titled Worthy to Escape Why All Believers Will Not Be Raptured Before the Tribulation
Zenz's work to expose human rights abuses in Xinjiang has been the subject of widespread international attention and has been widely cited in media reports
An analysis published by the Mercator Institute for China Studies in January said that estimates by Zenz and others that million Uyghurs had been subject to extrajudicial detention were credible but remain unavoidably imprecise and cited Zenz's study as one of two important studies that popularized this number Zenz's work has been described by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as delivering solid evidence for the extent of the repression that had only been previously known through anecdotal evidence
As a result of his work on Xinjiang Zenz has become a target for coordinated disinformation attacks from pro Beijing and Chinese state run media as well as other state affiliated entities Zenz and his work on Xinjiang have been criticized by the Chinese government which according to The Globe and Mail has called his findings 'lies' even when it confirmed them In March Chinese state media reported that Chinese companies have filed a lawsuit in Xinjiang against Zenz to recoup economic losses and restore their reputations in response to what Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described as Zenz's 'rumors' of forced labor in the region This lawsuit is one in a series of steps that the Chinese government is taking in order to attack critics of Chinese government policies in Xinjiang On April a court in Kashgar accepted the civil case brought by a textile company in Xinjiang against Zenz for defamation During an interview with The Daily Telegraph published in May Zenz defended himself against allegations of fabrication noting that of documents he has analyzed are publicly available government records Zenz has become the target of repeated cyber attacks receiving many attempted hacking attacks via email from people posing as Uyghurs
The European Union United States United Kingdom and Canada imposed coordinated sanctions against Chinese government officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in March The United States banned imports of cotton from Xinjiang shortly after Zenz published a report describing widespread use of forced labor in the region The Chinese government responded by imposing retaliatory sanctions against Zenz and others who had criticized the Chinese government for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang including nine other people five of whom are members of the European Parliament two European Union bodies the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation The sanctions against Zenz prohibit him from entering the People's Republic of China and restrict his ability to do business with Chinese firms
A article in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung described Zenz's research methods on Tibetans as unconventional and exciting little interest in the professional world The article stated that Zenz had analyzed job postings for security personnel in Tibet compared them with data on self immolation by Tibetans and then used that data to draw his conclusions about the Chinese government's policies of repression Development studies researcher Andrew Fischer described Zenz's early work as an excellent discussion of Tibetan education that included interesting ways of measuring and representing school outcomes and as offering a rare insight into Tibetan education with fascinating details and of immense value
In a report from Reuters wrote that the news agency had corroborated Zenz s findings and found additional policy documents company reports procurement filings and state media reports regarding a growing mass labor program in Tibet The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in response that workers were voluntary and strongly denied the involvement of forced labor
Robert Barnett the former Director of the Modern Tibetan Studies Program at Columbia University wrote in March that Zenz's work on Tibet is generally well regarded and noted that Zenz has been subject to unfair and abusive attacks from Chinese state media Barnett however criticized the methods used in creating a report written by Zenz and published in September by the Jamestown Foundation writing that the report had not been peer reviewed prior to publication did not refer to the findings of other Tibet researchers and had not been independently verified by field research Barnett also criticized the timing of and media coverage surrounding the report's publication arguing that it had been coordinated with a prominent media campaign and that prominent newspapers have misrepresented the report by overstating Zenz's conclusions regarding the existence of labor camps in Tibet
