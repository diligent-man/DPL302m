each of these units is formed of two coaches that have dimensions of m m ft in ft in and a top speed of mph km h
class units operate in multiple with class s
they were historically used as individual units on rural routes mainly the sheerness line between sittingbourne and sheerness displacing the class s which operated on this branch line and on the bromley north branch between grove park and bromley north
however owing to their non compliance with accessibility standards since january they may only run coupled to a class
the class s were also used on the medway valley line between strood maidstone west and tonbridge and in the leaf fall and winter season of the class s were doubled up to make car units on the medway valley line to help stop the poor adhesion along the line when only a single unit runs
they also ran doubled up or coupled with a class on the sheerness line during the winters of and
from the may timetable changes class s replaced the class s on the medway valley line and from december on the sheerness branch line
these two car emus are formed of a driving motor carriage dmos driving motor open standard and a driving trailer carriage dtosl driving trailer open standard lavatory all on board seating is standard accommodation
a solid state traction converter package controls phase ac traction motors which allows for rheostatic or regenerative dynamic braking
primary braking system is electro pneumatically actuated disc brakes which is blended with the dynamic brakes
speed probes on every axle of the unit provide for wheel slip slide protection
a solid state auxiliary converter provides v dc and v ac supplies this is the source of the loud buzzing noise which can be heard when the train is stationary
the aux converter is located on the driving trailer along with the toilet
the units use air operated sliding plug doors
some are scheduled to be replaced by class s with two hauled to worksop for store by harry needle railroad company in june
the s were repainted by wabtec rail at doncaster works into a variation of southeastern livery with lilac doors and midnight blue lower band
