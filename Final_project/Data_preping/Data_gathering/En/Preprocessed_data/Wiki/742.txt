stephen greek st phanos meaning wreath crown and by extension reward honor renown fame often given as a title rather than as a name hebrew stephanos haqadosh c
ad traditionally venerated as the protomartyr or first martyr of christianity was according to the acts of the apostles a deacon in the early church at jerusalem who angered members of various synagogues by his teachings
accused of blasphemy at his trial he made a speech denouncing the jewish authorities who were sitting in judgment on him and was then stoned to death
saul of tarsus later known as paul a pharisee and roman citizen who would later become a christian apostle participated in stephen s martyrdom
the only source for information about stephen is the new testament book of the acts of the apostles
stephen is mentioned in acts as one of the greek speaking hellenistic jews selected to participate in a fairer distribution of welfare to the greek speaking widows
the catholic anglican oriental orthodox eastern orthodox churches lutheran and the church of the east view stephen as a saint
artistic representations often show stephen with a crown symbolising martyrdom three stones martyr s palm frond censer and often holding a miniature church building
stephen is often shown as a young beardless man with a tonsure wearing a deacon s vestments
stephen is first mentioned in the acts of the apostles as one of seven deacons appointed by the apostles to distribute food and charitable aid to poorer members of the community in the early church
according to orthodox belief he was the eldest and is therefore called archdeacon
as another deacon nicholas of antioch is specifically stated to have been a convert to judaism it may be assumed that stephen was born jewish but nothing more is known about his previous life
the reason for the appointment of the deacons is stated to have been dissatisfaction among hellenistic that is greek influenced and greek speaking jews that their widows were being slighted in preference to hebraic ones in the daily distribution of food
since the name stephanos is greek it has been assumed that he was one of these hellenistic jews
stephen is stated to have been full of faith and the holy spirit and to have performed miracles among the people
it seems to have been among synagogues of hellenistic jews that he performed his teachings and signs and wonders since it is said that he aroused the opposition of the synagogue of the freedmen and of the cyrenians and of the alexandrians and of them that were of cilicia and asia
members of these synagogues had challenged stephen s teachings but stephen had bested them in debate
furious at this humiliation they suborned false testimony that stephen had preached blasphemy against moses and god
they dragged him to appear before the sanhedrin the supreme legal court of jewish elders accusing him of preaching against the temple and the mosaic law
stephen is said to have been unperturbed his face looking like that of an angel
in a long speech to the sanhedrin comprising almost the whole of acts chapter stephen presents his view of the history of israel
the god of glory he says appeared to abraham in mesopotamia thus establishing at the beginning of the speech one of its major themes that god does not dwell only in one particular building meaning the temple
stephen recounts the stories of the patriarchs in some depth and goes into even more detail in the case of moses
god appeared to moses in the burning bush and inspired moses to lead his people out of egypt
nevertheless the israelites turned to other gods
this establishes the second main theme of stephen s speech israel s disobedience to god
stephen faced two accusations that he had declared that jesus would destroy the temple in jerusalem and that he had changed the customs of moses
pope benedict xvi stated in that st
stephen appealed to the jewish scriptures to prove how the laws of moses were not subverted by jesus but instead were being fulfilled
stephen denounces his listeners as stiff necked people who just as their ancestors had done resist the holy spirit
was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute they even killed those who predicted the coming of the righteous one
and now you have betrayed and murdered him
thus castigated the account is that the crowd could contain their anger no longer
however stephen looked up and cried look i see heaven open and the son of man standing on the right hand of god he said that the recently resurrected jesus was standing by the side of god
the people from the crowd who threw the first stones laid their coats down so as to be able to do this at the feet of a young man named saul later known as paul the apostle
stephen prayed that the lord would receive his spirit and his killers be forgiven sank to his knees and fell asleep
saul approved of their killing him in the aftermath of stephen s death the remaining disciples fled to distant lands many to antioch
the exact site of stephen s stoning is not mentioned in acts instead there are two different traditions
one claimed by noted french archaeologists louis hugues vincent and f lix marie abel to be ancient places the event at jerusalem s northern gate while another one dated by vincent and abel to the middle ages and no earlier than the th century locates it at the eastern gate
of the numerous speeches in acts of the apostles stephen s speech to the sanhedrin is the longest
to the objection that it seems unlikely that such a long speech could be reproduced in the text of acts exactly as it was delivered some biblical scholars have replied that stephen s speech shows a distinctive personality behind it
there are at least five places where stephen s re telling of the stories of israelite history diverges from the scriptures where these stories originated for instance stephen says that jacob s tomb was in shechem but genesis says jacob s body was carried and buried in a cave in machpelah at hebron
some theologians argue that these may not be discrepancies but rather a condensing of historical events for people who were already familiar with them
that jacob s body was carried to a final resting place in shechem is not recorded in genesis though it does not exclude the possibility that his bones were transferred to shechem for a final burial place as was done with the bones of jacob s son joseph as described in joshua other scholars consider them as errors
still others interpret them as deliberate choices making theological points
another possibility is that the discrepancies come from an ancient jewish tradition which was not included in the scriptures or may have been popular among people of jerusalem who were not scribes
numerous parallels between the accounts of stephen in acts and the jesus of the gospels they both perform miracles they are both tried by the sanhedrin they both pray for forgiveness for their killers for instance have led to suspicions that the author of acts has emphasised in order to show the recipient that people become holy when they follow the example of christ or invented some or all of these
the criticism of traditional jewish belief and practice in stephen s speech is very strong when he says god does not live in a dwelling made by human hands referring to the temple he is using an expression often employed by biblical texts to describe idols
some people have laid the charge of anti judaism against the speech for instance the priest and scholar of comparative religion s
brandon who states the anti jewish polemic of this speech reflects the attitude of the author of acts
friedrich justus knecht lists the similarities of the martyrdom of stephen to jesus death on the cross
our blessed lord was sentenced to death on the charge of blasphemy because he had affirmed on oath i am the son of the living god and hereafter you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of god in the same manner stephen was stoned on the assumption that he was a blasphemer and because he professed his belief in the divinity of jesus and said i see heaven open and jesus standing at the right hand of god
both our blessed lord and st
stephen were treated as outcasts and put to death outside the city
both when dying prayed for their enemies father forgive them for they know not what they do lay not this sin to their charge
both before dying commended their souls to god father into thy hands i commend my spirit lord jesus receive my soul
acts says godly men buried stephen and mourned deeply for him but the location where he was buried is not specified
in a priest named lucian purportedly had a dream that revealed the location of stephen s remains at beit jimal
after that the relics of the protomartyr were taken in procession to the church of hagia sion on december making it the date for the feast of saint stephen
in the relics were translated to a new church north of the damascus gate built by the empress aelia eudocia in honor of saint stephen
this church was destroyed in the th century
a th century french catholic church saint tienne was built in its place while another the greek orthodox church of st stephen was built outside the eastern gate of the city which a second tradition holds to be the site of his martyrdom rather than the northern location outside damascus gate for the two traditions see here
the crusaders initially called the main northern gate of jerusalem saint stephen s gate in latin porta sancti stephani highlighting its proximity to the site of martyrdom of saint stephen marked by the church and monastery built by empress eudocia
a different tradition is documented from the end of the crusader period after the disappearance of the byzantine church as christian pilgrims were prohibited from approaching the militarily exposed northern city wall the name saint stephen s gate was transferred to the still accessible eastern gate which bears this name until this day
the relics of the protomartyr were later translated to rome by pope pelagius ii during the construction of the basilica of san lorenzo fuori le mura
they were interred alongside the relics of saint lawrence whose tomb is enshrined within the church
according to the golden legend the relics of lawrence moved miraculously to one side to make room for those of stephen
the imperial regalia of the holy roman empire includes a relic known as st
stephen s purse which is an elaborate gold and jewel encrusted box believed to contain soil soaked with the blood of st
stephen
the reliquary is likely a th century creation
in his book the city of god augustine of hippo describes the many miracles that occurred when part of the relics of saint stephen were brought to africa
part of the right arm of saint stephen is enshrined at trinity lavra of st
sergius in russia
in western christianity december is called saint stephen s day the feast of stephen mentioned in the english christmas carol good king wenceslas
it is a public holiday in many nations that are of historic catholic anglican and lutheran traditions including austria croatia the czech republic hungary ireland luxembourg slovakia poland italy germany norway sweden denmark finland catalonia and the balearic isles
in australia new zealand canada and the united kingdom the day is celebrated as boxing day
in the current norms for the liturgy of the roman catholic church the feast is celebrated at the eucharist but for the liturgy of the hours is restricted to the hours during the day with evening prayer being reserved to the celebration of the octave of christmas
historically the invention of the relics of saint stephen i e their reputed discovery was commemorated on august
the feasts of both december and august have been used in dating clauses in historical documents produced in england
stephen is remembered in the church of england with a festival on december
in the eastern orthodox church those eastern catholic churches which follow the byzantine rite and in oriental orthodox churches e g coptic syrian malankara saint stephen s feast day is celebrated on december
this day is also called the third day of the nativity because it is the third day of the christmas season
some orthodox churches particularly in the west follow a modified julian calendar that places date names identically with the standard gregorian calendar of widespread civil usage
in those churches then the date the feast is observed is generally known as december
however other orthodox churches including the oriental orthodox continue to use the original julian calendar
throughout the st century december gregorian will continue to fall on january in the julian calendar and that is the date on which they observe the feast
in the armenian apostolic and armenian catholic churches saint stephen s day falls on december the day on which the feast of the nativity of jesus christmas falls in all other churches
this is because the armenian churches maintain the decree of constantine which stipulated that the nativity and theophany of jesus were to be celebrated on january
in dioceses of the armenian church which use the julian calendar saint stephen s day falls on january and nativity theophany on january for the remainder of the st century julian
in the eucharistic celebration on this feast day it is traditional for all deacons serving at the altar to wear a liturgical crown armenian khooyr which is one of the vestments worn only by priests on all other days of the year the crown being in this instance a symbol of martyrdom
