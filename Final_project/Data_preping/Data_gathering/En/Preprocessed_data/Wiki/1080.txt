The College of Southern Nevada Coyotes compete in the Scenic West Athletic Conference of the NJCAA's Division I
 The school currently has five athletic programs—men's baseball, men's soccer, women's softball, women's volleyball, and women's soccer
Baseball's first season was in 2000, and softball began its first season in 2004
Volleyball was added in 2014
Men and Women's Soccer started in Fall of 2016 and campus-wide improvements will be coming to all three campuses (including the Henderson Campus, where Athletics will be headquartered).
The Coyotes baseball team was the first intercollegiate athletics program at CSN
 The Coyotes' home field, William R
Morse Stadium, is located at CSN's Henderson campus in Henderson, Nevada.
On March 18, 1999, CSN hired its first baseball coach—local legend Rodger Fairless, who coached former MLB pitchers Greg Maddux and Mike Maddux at Valley High School during the 1980s, and was more well known for coaching Green Valley High School to six consecutive Nevada state baseball championships from 1993 to 1998
 But, before Fairless would even conduct his first baseball practice at CSN, he stepped down on May 4, 1999, citing health reasons
 Fairless would be replaced by another local veteran coach, Tim Chambers, on July 8, 1999.
The Coyotes played their first-ever game on February 1, 2000, against Scottsdale Community College, and quickly grew into a perennial contender
 They joined the Scenic West Athletic Conference in 2002, quickly asserting themselves a place in the conference, becoming rivals with Dixie State College until the then Rebels moved up to NCAA Division II in 2006
 Since joining the SWAC, CSN has won six conference championships, two Region XVIII championships and two Western District championships
 Today, the Coyotes' rivals are the Western Nevada Wildcats, as they are the only two junior colleges in Nevada to have intercollegiate athletics, and also fueled by their fierce battles on the diamond.
On May 31, 2003, the Coyotes made history, defeating the heavily favored San Jacinto-North Gators 4–1 to win the 2003 National Junior College World Series in only their fourth year of existence
 It is CSN's only national championship in any sport to date.
In 2010, catcher Bryce Harper was selected first overall by the Washington Nationals in the Major League Baseball First Year Player Draft after a season in which he batted .443/.526/.987 (AVG/OBP/SLG) with 98 runs scored, 31 home runs, 98 RBIs, 20 SBs, and a 1.510 OPS, leading the team to a third-place finish at the National Junior College World Series
 He was selected as an outfielder.
On June 11, 2010, just one week after the Coyotes had been eliminated from the JUCO World Series, longtime head coach Tim Chambers took the head coaching job at UNLV
 There would be no vacancy for long though, as CSN hired former Bishop Gorman High School baseball coach Chris Sheff on July 9, 2010, to carry on the legacy that Chambers built.
Sheff would become the second baseball coach in CSN history to never coach a game
 Allegations of illegal activity in the eyes of the NJCAA and parents alike came up, and on November 3, 2010, the school decided to relieve Sheff of his duties.
Six days later, on November 9, 2010, CSN hired former Green Valley High School coach Nick Garritano as its head baseball coach
 Garritano, who was Fairless' successor at Green Valley, won two state championships during his 12 years at the helm, producing a 315-118-1 record
 He played sports at Chaparral High School and was inducted into the UNLV Hall of Fame as a former place-kicker for the football team.
On May 5, 2012, the baseball clubhouse was officially named after James B
Whiteaker in a dedication ceremony that took place prior to the final baseball game of the regular season
 Today, "Building D" is now known as the James B
Whiteaker Clubhouse.
2015 Coyotes Baseball was an exciting year of competition
 The Coyotes sported RHP – Phil Bickford (2015-drafted to SF Giants), SS – Tyler Brown (2015 – drafted to SF Giants), and OF-Matthew Waldren, who was a 2015 NJCAA Superior Academic-All-American.
Coyotes Athletic Programs pride themselves on maintaining very high individual and team academic standards
 Student-athletes at the College of Southern Nevada regularly attend and accomplish 17–21 credits per semester, averaging individual GPAs as high as 3.9.
Fall 2015 was the inaugural season hosting Women's Volleyball.
The College of Southern Nevada now houses Men's and Women's Division I Soccer; their first season was Fall of 2016.
Men's soccer is Coached by Geoffrey Hawkins, Esq., Christopher Burgess, and Julian Portugal
 In their first season of competition they made their way to the 2016 NJCAA DIV
I, Men's Soccer Championship in Tyler, TX
 They were defeated by #2 ranked Monroe College.
Women's soccer adopted Head Coach Rob Dahl of Utah to lead them to victory
 Rob is a championship collegiate-level ladies soccer coach and is planning for the ladies to head for the Finals during his first year of 2017
 The ladies are mixed with local Las Vegas and Utah talents.

NJCAA Junior College World Series: 2003The Coyotes softball team debuted in the spring of 2004
 The Coyotes' home field is located at the Russell Road Recreation Complex, a park operated by the City of Henderson
 Talks are in the works to build a softball stadium on the CSN Henderson campus, adjacent to the baseball stadium, with funding being its major obstacle.
The program's first coach was Ric Grenell, who previously had coached women's soccer at CSN from 2000 to 2002 before the sport was discontinued.
After a moderate first season record of 16–30, the 2005 softball team did less well, winning only six games
 Shortly after the 2006 season began, another rough start prompted Grenell to resign, and Ysidro Jimenez took over as interim head coach
 Jimenez would become the permanent head coach at season's end, and remained the head coach until June 2011.
Under Jimenez, CSN softball enjoyed five winning seasons from 2007 to 2011, including a record 38 wins in the 2011 season
 But, after failing to win a conference or region championship, then-assistant coach and former longtime Hawaii-Hilo softball coach Callen Perreira was announced as Jimenez's replacement, and officially took over the helm on July 1, 2011.
In Spring of 2017, CSN welcomed the addition of the new Lady Coyotes Softball Complex at the Henderson Campus
 Softball also welcomed Head Coach Jim Overturf and Olympian Lori Harrigan-Mack.
