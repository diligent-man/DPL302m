Payola in the music industry is the illegal practice of paying a commercial radio station to play a song without the station disclosing the payment
Under US law a radio station must disclose songs they were paid to play on the air as sponsored airtime
The number of times the songs are played can influence the perceived popularity of a song and payola may be used to influence these meters
The Federal Communications Commission FCC treats payola as a violation of the Sponsorship Identification Rules which requires any broadcast of paid material to include a disclosure
The term payola is a combination of pay and ola which is a suffix of product names common in the early th century such as Pianola Victrola Amberola Crayola Rock-Ola Shinola or brands such as the radio equipment manufacturer Motorola
Prior to the s there was little public scrutiny of the reasoning behind a song's popularity
The advertising agencies which sponsored NBC's radioTV show Your Hit Parade refused to reveal the specific methods that were used to determine top hits
Only general and vague statements were offered that determining top hits was based on readings of radio requests sheet music sales dance hall favorites and jukebox tabulations
Early attempts to stop payola were met with silence by publishers
Prosecution for payola in the s was in part a reaction of the traditional music establishment against newcomers
The emergence of hit radio had become a threat to the wages of song-pluggers and publisher's revenue streams
By the mid-s three-quarters of the records produced in the United States went into jukeboxes
Attempts were made to link all payola to rock-and-roll music
In the s independent record companies or music publishers frequently used payola to promote rock and roll on American radio
This practice promoted cultural diversity because disc jockeys DJs were less inclined to indulge their own personal and racial biases
While the amount of money involved remains largely unpublished Phil Lind of Chicago's WAIT disclosed in Congressional hearings that he had taken US to play a record
The first US Congressional Payola Investigations occurred in carried out by the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight into payola and prompted by a parallel investigation in the US Senate
DJ Alan Freed who was uncooperative in committee hearings was fired as a result
Dick Clark also testified before the committee but avoided repercussions partially due to the fact that he had divested his ownership interest in music-industry holdings
Following the investigation radio DJs were stripped of the authority to make programming decisions and payola became a misdemeanor offense
Programming decisions became the responsibility of station program directors
However this had the result of simplifying the process of payola instead of reaching numerous DJs record labels only had to persuade the station's program director
Labels could circumvent payola allegations by utilizing independent third parties see below
In inner-city urban soul DJ Frankie Crocker was indicted in a payola scandal causing him to leave New York radio where his influence was greatest
The charges were later dropped and he returned to New York hosting MTV's video jukebox
Following the creation of music sharing websites in the late s the power of independent promoters declined and labels returned to dealing with stations directly
Payola is used by record labels to promote their artists and can be in the form of monetary rewards or other types of reimbursement
This can include purchasing advertising requiring bands to play station-sponsored concerts or paying stations to hold meet the band contests
In exchange the band gains a place on a station's playlist or a lesser-known band of the label may gain air time
A loophole in US payola laws is for labels to utilize a third-party or independent promoter not to be confused with independent record label
The promoter would offer promotion payments to station directors for putting their client's artists on the station's playlist sidestepping Federal Communications Commission FCC regulations
As it was seen as falling outside the payola rules stations did not deem it necessary to report to authorities
This practice became widespread until a NBC News investigation called The New Payola instigated another round of Congressional investigations
In investigations by the office of then-New York District Attorney Eliot Spitzer uncovered evidence that executives at Sony BMG music labels had made deals with several large commercial radio chains
Spitzer's office settled out of court with Sony BMG Music Entertainment in July Warner Music Group in November and Universal Music Group in May
The three conglomerates agreed to pay million million and million respectively to New York State non-profit organizations that will fund music education and appreciation programs
Concerns about contemporary forms of payola in the US prompted an investigation during which the FCC established firmly that the loophole was still a violation of the law
In four companies CBS Radio Citadel Clear Channel and Entercom settled on paying million in fines and accepting tougher restrictions for three years although no company admitted any wrongdoing
Due to increased legal scrutiny some larger radio companies including industry giant Clear Channel now refuse to have any contact with independent promoters
Clear Channel Radio through iHeartRadio launched a program called On the Verge that required the stations to play a given song at least times in order to give a new artist exposure
Brand managers at the top of the Clear Channel chain after listening to hundreds of songs and filtering them down to about five or six favorites from various formats send those selections to program directors across the country
These program directors vote on which ones they think radio listeners will like the most
Songs that benefited with the exposure were Iggy Azalea's Fancy Tinashe's On Anthony Lewis' Candy Rain and Jhen Aiko's The Worst
Tom Poleman president of national programming platforms for the company stated that the acts selected are based solely on the quality of their music and not on label pressure
On Spotify labels can pay for tracks to appear in user play-lists as Sponsored Songs
It is possible for users to opt out of this in their account settings
In Mexico South America and some regions along the US southern border payola is used to launder money from illegal operations
In this practice unknown new artists will suddenly appear on multiple formats and be aggressively promoted by producers of dubious origin then disappear from the music scene or change their stage name
Congress held a hearing on hip hop music entitled From Imus to Industry The Business of Stereotypes and Degrading Images
In her testimony Lisa Fager Bediako co-founder and President of media watchdog group Industry Ears argued that misogynistic and racist stereotypes permeate hip hop music because record labels radio stations and music video channels profit from allowing such material to air while censoring other material
In Stan Freberg did a parody on the Payola Scandal by calling it Old Payola Roll Blues a two-sided single where the promoter gets an ordinary teenager named Clyde Ankle to record a song for Obscurity Records entitled High School OO OO and then tries to offer the song to a jazz radio station with phony deals that the disc jockey just won't buy it
It ends with an anti-rock song saying hello to jazz and swing and goodbye to amateur nights including rock and roll
The Vancouver new wave band the Payola chose their moniker during the punk explosion of the late s
The practice is criticized in the chorus of the Dead Kennedys song Pull My Strings a parody of the song My Sharona My Payola sung to a crowd of music industry leaders during a music award ceremony
The They Might Be Giants song Hey Mr
DJ I Thought You Said We Had a Deal is about the practice
It is narrated from the point of view of a naive and inexperienced musician who has been coerced by a disc jockey into paying for airplay the disc jockey then disappears and does not deliver on his promise
The practice is satirized in song Payola Blues by Neil Young from his album Everybody's Rockin'
It opens by saying This one's for you Alan Freed and then states 'Cause the things they're doing today would make a saint out of you implying that Payola corruption is bigger now or was bigger in the s than it was in the s
Payola is referenced in Billy Joel's song We Didn't Start the Fire during the verse dealing with the events of
radio station in the disc jockeys announced that they were debuting the Lou Bega song Mambo Number by saying that they had accepted a large amount of payola to play the song
Ironically if they had actually been paid to play the song on the air it would not have been payola because payola is the unannounced acceptance of a payment to run a song
If the song is identified before being played as being done because the talent or station is being paid to do so the playing of the song and acceptance of money to do so is perfectly legal and does not constitute payola
Payola was depicted in the film The Harder They Come released in where a record producer not the recording artist controls the airwaves
The portrayal of its protagonist Jimmy Cliff as an aspiring musician who is forced to sign away his rights to make a hit record depicts the role of record producers and radio DJs as a dominance the musician ends up with no aspirations or living the same lifestyle as in the case of the film Rockers
In an installment of Mathnet from PBS's Square One Television the detectives George Frankly and Pat Tuesday investigated a case of suspected payola by forming a fictitious group called The Googols and creating their own song titled Without Math
Payola was eventually ruled out as a cause of increased sales of particular songs at a company
The FCC and the Communications Act of both have strict requirements and rules regarding payola
These demand thatEven with these requirements in place however record companies have found loopholes within the phrasing of the regulations to continue the practice
These loopholes have created a situation which isolates independent artists from mainstream media
A current example of this is the lengths that artists Macklemore and Ryan Lewis went to get their music heard
Because Lewis and Macklemore belonged to an independent label they feared payola laws would interfere with their airtime
So they hired an independent arm of Warner Music Group the Alternative Distribution Alliance which assists independent acts to get their music on radio
Zach Quillen manager of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis discussed how they paid the alliance a flat monthly fee to help promote the album
One side effect of the vagueness of the law and the creation of the loophole is the expansion of the concept at the hands of online music sharing websites
In the website Jango created a plan to accept promotion fees legally by disclosing that they are paid to play the songs
For as little as a band can buy plays on the music-streaming service slotted in between established artists
The artists themselves choose what other music they'd like to be played next to
