the mali federation arabic was a federation in west africa linking the french colonies of senegal and the sudanese republic or french sudan for two months in
it was founded on april as a territory with self rule within the french community and became independent after negotiations with france on june
two months later on august the sudanese republic leaders in the mali federation mobilized the army and senegal leaders in the federation retaliated by mobilizing the gendarmerie national police this resulted in a tense stand off and led to the withdrawal from the federation by senegal the next day
the sudanese republic officials resisted this dissolution cut off diplomatic relations with senegal and defiantly changed the name of their country to mali
for the brief existence of the mali federation the premier was modibo ke ta who would later become the first president of mali and its government was based in dakar the eventual capital of senegal
after world war ii the colonies of french west africa began pushing significantly for increased self determination and to redefine their colonial relationships with france
following the may crisis the colonies of french west africa were given the chance to vote for immediate independence or to join a reorganized french community an arrangement which would grant the colonies some self determination while maintaining ties to france
only guinea voted for full independence and the other colonies of french west africa voted to join the french community
in the election to decide the issue of independence two major parties split the countries of west africa the african democratic rally french rassemblement d mocratique africain commonly known as the rda and the african regroupment party french parti du regroupement africain commonly known as the pra
the two regional groupings of parties struggled against one another on the issue of independence and the extent of ties with france
the rda was the governing party in the ivory coast colony the french sudan colony and guinea while the pra was a major governing party in senegal and had sizable majorities in many countries
the two parties also were part of coalition governments in french upper volta niger and french dahomey
both two parties struggled with each other to shape the political future of the region mauritania often became a neutral party that would break any deadlocks
the vote of revealed a number of divisions within the parties
the rda held a congress on november to discuss the recent election results and the division became clear with modibo ke ta from french sudan and doudou gueye from senegal arguing for primary federation which would include france and the colonies in a unified system and f lix houphou t boigny of the ivory coast dismissing that idea
the resulting deadlock was so severe that the meeting was officially said to have never taken place
in late november french sudan senegal upper volta and dahomey all declared the intention to join the french community and form a federation linking the four colonies together
french sudan and senegal despite longstanding divisions between their main political parties were the most enthusiastic pushers for the federation while dahomey and upper volta were more hesitant in their desire to join the federation
french sudan called for representatives of each of the four countries and mauritania as an observer to bamako on to december to discuss the formation of the federation
french sudan and senegal were the leaders at the congress with modibo ke ta named the president of the meeting and l opold s dar senghor of senegal being the key leader on many issues including developing the name mali federation for the proposed union
although upper volta and dahomey declared formal support for the federation and upper volta even approved the mali federation constitution on january political pressure from france and the ivory coast both of which opposed the federation although for very different reasons resulted in neither ratifying a constitution that would include them within the federation
the result is that only the colonies of french sudan now called the sudanese republic and senegal were engaged in the discussions of the formation of the federation by
elections in march in both french sudan and senegal cemented the power of the major parties pushing for the formation of a federation
ke ta s union soudanaise rassemblement d mocratique africain us rda won of the votes in french sudan and all of the seats in the territorial assembly
senghor s union progressiste s n galaise ups won of the vote and all of the seats in senegal s territorial assembly
although senghor won the elections by a large margin some conservative islamist marabouts supported the candidacy of cheikh tidjane sy
that challenge to senghor s party showed some of the weakness in senghor s domestic political base and required a complex system of alliances with various domestic constituencies both of which would become important as the federation progressed
sy was arrested on election day because of some rioting which was blamed on his party
after the elections the assemblies of senegal and french sudan approved the federation and began the process of constructing a political system to unite the two colonies
that involved three different political projects with the principle of parity even representation from both colonies enshrined in each a federal government united social movements a labour and youth movement and a shared political party for both countries
the federal government would have a federal assembly composed of members from each of the colonies in total a president set to be elected in august and six federal ministers with from each colony
until a president was elected the premier of the mali federation was to be ke ta and the vice premier and the person in charge of the armed forces was to be mamadou dia from senegal
furthermore as part of the parity principle any legislative initiatives required a signature by both the premier then later the president and the minister responsible for that issue
the colonies were to share the import and export taxes raised in the port of dakar between them to the advantage of french sudan which had almost a third of its budget provided by that tax income
at the same time the mali federation sought to create unified social organisations to facilitate the union between the countries
that involved creating labour movements and youth movements to operate at both the federal and national levels and a unified political party
the political party was the major project as the ruling parties in both colonies combined to form the parti de la f d ration africaine pfa
it was organised separately from the federal government but with many of the same members and leaders
senghor was the party president and ke ta was the secretary general
in addition to have a regional influence djibo bakary of niger and emile zinsou of dahomey were named the vice presidents of the party
as articulated at the first pfa congress in july by senghor it would be the single political party in the country and aim to unite across the different ethnic groups in the territory
in december france and the mali federation began negotiations regarding independence and sovereignty of the federation
the negotiations were formally started when french president charles de gaulle visited bamako on december and lasted until march
although the french had resisted the mali federation but after the two countries showed willingness to remain within the french community and the franc zone and to keep the french military bases within its territory the french supported the formation of the federation
the negotiations agreed upon june for the formal independence day of the mali federation
tensions quickly arose within the mali federation as planning for the implementation of the federation began in and early
unlike some other areas of french west africa french sudan and senegal did not have significant amounts of migration or intercultural movement during the colonial period although they were linked together in french economic policy and linked by a key railway
more serious than ethnic or linguistic differences however were some of the results of the design of the federation
while the parity principle allowed both countries to join together without fears of losing their sovereignty it also resulted in political spillover as political disputes moved from one arena to another
similarly the pfa tried to combine two political parties which were in very different situations with the french sudan political party having achieved political dominance but the senegal party needed an elaborate and complex arrangement of alliances to maintain authority
in addition some of the aspects left vague in the first discussions became key issues of debate between the political leaders of senegal and french sudan as their articulation became more important including armed forces development of an indigenous bureaucracy the strength of the federal government and the precise relationship with france
finally different visions for the colony between senghor and ke ta proved very difficult to mediate ke ta after the dissolution of the federation claimed that he pursued socialism but senghor pushed a bourgeoisie agenda
the disagreements remained manageable until april after negotiations with france for recognition of independence had finished
french sudan began to push for a single executive in the federation with significant independent authority
senegal preferred to maintain the parity principle as it had been developed in and to restrain the power of any president
when a pfa congress to decide the issue ended in a deadlock its members from outside the federation were called in to mediate and they recommended the creation of a single executive to be appointed by an equal number of representatives from senegal and french sudan but also that the taxation would no longer be widely shared between the two colonies a key senegal position
although that issue was resolved to the agreement of both parties a series of misunderstandings quickly followed
when french sudan attempted to remove a single military base within its territories it was interpreted as an attempt to eject the french from the entire territory which was viewed with suspicion by both senegal and france
tensions hit their high point in august in preparation for the election of the president of the mali federation
cheikh tidjane sy who had been released from prison and became a member of senghor s political party approached senghor and said that he had been approached by representatives from sudan who had expressed a preference for a muslim president of the mali federation like sy rather than a catholic president like senghor
an investigation by senghor s political allies found evidence that french sudan emissaries had visited sy s uncle who was a muslim political leader
about the same time ke ta as premier of the mali federation began meeting formally with many of the muslim political leaders of senegal although there is no evidence of any discussion of undermining senghor s leadership
on august senghor dia and other political leaders of senegal began to work on how to get senegal out of the federation
mamadou dia as the vice premier and person in charge of national defense began surveying the readiness of various military units in case the political situation were to become hostile
those questions to the various military units resulted in panic by ke ta and the french sudanese politicians
on august with reports of senegalese peasants arming in dakar ke ta dismissed dia as the defense minister declared a state of emergency and mobilized the armed forces
senghor and dia were able to get a political ally in the military to demobilize the military and then had the national gendarmerie which surrounded ke ta s house and the government offices
senegal declared independence from the mali federation at a midnight session on august
there was little violence and the french sudan officials were sent on a sealed train back to bamako on august
the federation may have been salvageable in spite of the crisis but by sending ke ta and the others back on a hot sealed train during august rather than a plane led ke ta to declare that the railroad be destroyed at the border after the trip
independent nations of senegal and the republic of mali were recognized by most countries by mid september and accepted into the united nations in late september
although the mali federation existed in name only in bamako for another month france and most other nations recognized the two colonies as separate independent countries on september
the sudanese union african democratic rally party in french sudan adopted the slogan le mali continue and at a meeting on september the party decided to rename the country mali and to sever ties with the french community
the admission to the united nations for both countries was delayed until late september as a result of the mali federation dispute
senghor and ke ta both ruled their countries at the time of the split from the mali federation and for a number of years senghor was president of senegal from until and ke ta from until
senghor suffered some domestic challenges after the split from the mali federation but after an armed fight between his supporters and those of mamadou dia s supporters in he had largely consolidated his rule
senghor became very wary of unification efforts after the failed experiment and despite attempts to create other federations in west africa and with senegal s neighbours senghor often restrained these efforts and they only progressed after his rule
in addition as the first failed unification experiment in africa the mali federation served as a lesson in future attempts at unification throughout the continent
ke ta became more assertive with pushing his ideology after the collapse of the federation and refused diplomatic relations with senegal for many years
nonetheless mali under ke ta still pursued the goal of west african unity but did so in a variety of different international connections
the railroad was reopened on june and senghor and ke ta embraced at the border
