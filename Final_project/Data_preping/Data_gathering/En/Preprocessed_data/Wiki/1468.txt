Comparison is a feature in the morphology or syntax of some languages whereby adjectives and adverbs are inflected to indicate the relative degree of the property they define exhibited by the word or phrase they modify or describe
In languages that have it the comparative construction expresses quality quantity or degree relative to some other comparators
The superlative construction expresses the greatest quality quantity or degree—ie
The associated grammatical category is degree of comparison
The usual degrees of comparison are the positive which simply denotes a property as with the English words big and fully the comparative which indicates greater degree as bigger and more fully and the superlative which indicates greatest degree as biggest and most fully
Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality called elative in Semitic linguistics
The comparative degrees are frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the -er suffix or modifying word more or less
Comparison can also however appear when no adjective or adverb is present for instance with nouns eg more men than women
However the usage of the word than between nouns simply denotes a comparison made and not degree of comparison comparing the intensity or the extent of the subjects
One preposition near also has comparative and superlative forms as in Find the restaurant nearest your house
Comparatives and superlatives may be formed in morphology by inflection as with the English and German -er and -est forms and Latin's -ior superior excelsior or syntactically as with the English more
Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms such as better and best from good and less and least from littlefew in English and meilleur from bon and mieux from the adverb bien in French
Most if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next
Comparatives are often used with a conjunction or other grammatical means to indicate to what the comparison is being made as with than in English als in German etc
In Russian and Greek Ancient Koine and Modern this can be done by placing the compared noun in the genitive case
With superlatives the population being considered may be explicitly indicated as in the best swimmer out of all the girls
Languages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs such as as
А few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs
One such language is Bulgarian where expressions like по̀ човек po chovek най човек nay chovek по-малко човек po malko chovek literally more person most person less person but normally better kind of a person best kind of person not that good kind of a person and по̀ обичам po obicham най-малко обичам nay malko obicham I like more I like the least are quite usual
In many languages including English traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number
For instance May the better man win would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing
However this rule is not always observed in informal usage the form May the best man win will often be used in that situation as is required if there were three or more competitors involved
However in some cases when two subjects with equal qualities are compared usage of superlative degree is not possible
For example Ram is as good as Shyam—positive degree Ram is not better than Shyam—comparative degree
Since Ram and Shyam are equally good neither is superior which negates the usage of the superlative
In some contexts such as advertising or political speeches absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in ways that invite comparison yet the basis of comparison is not explicit
This is a common rhetorical device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present
Although common such usage is sometimes considered ungrammatical
More doctors recommend itEnglish has two grammatical constructions for expressing comparison a morphological one formed using the suffixes -er the comparative and -est the superlative with some irregular forms and a syntactic one using the adverbs more most less and least
As a general rule words of one syllable require the suffix except for a few words such as fun real right wrong while words of three or more syllables require more or most
This leaves words of two syllables—these are idiomatic some requiring the morphological construction some requiring the syntactic and some able to use either eg polite can use politer or more polite with different frequencies according to context
The suffixes -er the comparative and -est the superlative are of Germanic origin and are cognate with the Latin suffixes -ior and -issimus and Ancient Greek -ῑ́ων -īōn and -ῐστος -istos
They are typically added to shorter words words of Anglo-Saxon origin and borrowed words fully assimilated into English vocabulary
Usually the words taking these inflections have fewer than three syllables
This system also contains a number of irregular forms some of which like good better and best contain suppletive forms
In syntactic construction inserting the words more or most before an adjective or adverb modifies the resulting phrase to express a relative specifically greater degree of that property
Similarly inserting the diminutives less or least before an adjective or adverb expresses a lesser degree
This system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than -ly eg beautiful and with longer technical or infrequent words
Absolute adjectivesSome adjectives' the absolute adjectives meanings are not exhibitable in degrees making comparative constructions of them inappropriate
Some qualities are either present or absent such as being cretaceous vs
igneous so it appears illogical to call anything very cretaceous or to characterize something as more igneous than something else
Some grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as full complete unique or empty which by definition already denote a totality an absence or an absolute
However such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing
This type of usage conveys more of a figurative than a literal meaning because in a strictly literal sense something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree
Many prescriptive grammars and style guides include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be non-gradable
Thus they reject expressions such as more perfect most unique and most parallel as illogical pleonasms after all if something is unique it is one of a kind so nothing can be very unique or more unique than something else
Other style guides argue that terms like perfect and parallel never apply exactly to things in real life so they are commonly used to mean nearly perfect nearly parallel and so on in this sense more perfect ie more nearly perfect closer to perfect and more parallel ie more nearly parallel closer to parallel are meaningful
In most Balto-Slavic languages such as Czech Polish Lithuanian and Latvian the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives
In Bulgarian comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics по- more and най- most
най-голям biggestIn Czech Polish Slovak Ukrainian Serbo-Croatian and Slovene the comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative
mlad młody mlad молодий mlad mlad young
mladš młodszy mladš молодший mlai mlajši younger
nejmladš najmłodszy najmladš наймолодший najmlai najmlajši youngestIn Russian comparative and superlative forms are formed with a suffix or with the words более more and самый most
добрейшийсамый добрый kindestIn contrast to English the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree the superlative which can be of two kinds comparative eg
French The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article la le or les or the possessive article mon ton son etc before plus or moins and the adjective determining the noun
For instance Elle est la plus belle femme → she is the most beautiful woman Cette ville est la moins chre de France → this town is the least expensive in France C'est sa plus belle robe → It is her most beautiful dress
It can also be created with the suffix -issime but only with certain words for example C'est un homme richissime → That is the most rich man
Its use is often rare and ironic
Spanish The comparative superlative like in French has the definite article such as las or el or the possessive article tus nuestra su etc followed by the comparative ms or menos so that el meñique es el dedo ms pequeño or el meñique es el ms pequeño de los dedos is the pinky is the smallest finger Irregular comparatives are mejor for bueno and peor for malo which can be used as comparative superlatives also by adding the definite article or possessive article so that nuestro peor error fue casarnos is our worst mistake was to get married
The absolute superlative is normally formed by modifying the adjective by adding -simo -sima -simos or -simas depending on the gender or number
Thus ¡Los chihuahuas son perros pequeñsimos is Chihuahuas are such tiny dogs Some irregular superlatives are mximo for grande psimo for malo nfimo for bajo ptimo for bueno acrrimo for acre pauprrimo for pobre celebrrimo for clebre
There is a difference between comparative superlative and absolute superlative Ella es la ms bella → she is the most beautiful Ella es bellsima → she is extremely beautiful
Portuguese and Italian distinguish comparative superlative superlativo relativo and absolute superlative superlativo absolutoassoluto
For the comparative superlative they use the words mais and pi between the article and the adjective like most in English
For the absolute superlative they either use muitomolto and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding issimo singular masculine issima singular feminine ssimosissimi plural masculine or ssimasissime plural feminine
Aquele avio velocssimoQuell'aeroplano velocissimo → That airplane is very fastThere are some irregular forms for some words ending in -re and -le deriving from Latin words ending in -er and -ilis that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one
In the first case words lose the ending -re and they gain the endings errimo singular masculine errima singular feminine rrimoserrimi plural masculine or rrimaserrime plural feminine in the second case words lose the -l-le ending and gain limoillimo singular masculine limaillima singular feminine limosillimi plural masculine or limasillime plural feminine the irregular form for words ending in -l-le is somehow rare and in Italian but not in Portuguese it exists only in the archaic or literary language
Acre acer in Latin which means acrid becomes acrrimoacerrimo acerrimus in Latin
Italian simile similis in Latin which means similar becomes in ancient Italian simillimo simillimus in Latin
Portuguese difcil harddifficult and fcil facileRomanian similar to Portuguese and Italian distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives
The comparative uses the word mai before the adjective which operates like more or -er in English
For example luminos → bright mai luminos → brighter
To weaken the adjective the word puțin little is added between mai and the adjective for example mai puțin luminos → less bright
For absolute superlatives the gender-dependent determinant cel precedes mai inflected as cel for masculine and neuter singular cei for masculine plural cea for feminine singular and cele for feminine and neuter plural
For example cea mai luminoas stea → the brightest star cele mai frumoase fete → the most beautiful girls cel mai mic morcov → the smallest carrot
Hindi-Urdu Hindustaniː When comparing two quantities makes use of the instrumental case-marker se से سے and the noun or pronoun takes the oblique case
Words like aur और اور more even more zyādā ज़्यादा زیادہ more and kam कम کم less are added for relative comparisons
When equivalence is to be shown the personal pronouns take the oblique case and add the genitive case-marker kā का کا while the nouns just take in the oblique case form and optionally add the genitive case-marker
The word zyādā ज़्यादा زیادہ more is optional while kam कम کم less is required so that in the absence of either more will be inferred
Superlatives are made through comparisons with sab all with the instrumental postposition se as the suffix
Comparisons using least are rare it is more common to use an antonym
In Sanskritised and Persianised registers of Hindustani comparative and superlative adjectival forms using suffixes derived from those languages can be found
Scottish Gaelic When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense the adjective is changed by adding an e to the end and i before the final consonants if the final vowel is broad
Then the adjective is preceded by nas to say more and as to say most The word na is used to mean than Adjectives that begin with f are lenited
Tha mi nas irde na mo pheathraichean
→ I am taller than my sisters
As in English some forms are irregular ie
nas fherr better nas miosa worse etc
In other tenses nas is replaced by na bu and as by a bu both of which lenite the adjective if possible
If the adjective begins with a vowel or an f followed by a vowel the word bu is reduced to b'
Bha mi na b' irde na mo pheathraichean
→ I was taller than my sisters
→ I was the tallestWelsh is similar to English in many respects
The ending -af is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English -est and with most long words mwyaf precedes it as in the English most
Also many of the most common adjectives are irregular
Unlike English however when comparing just two things the superlative must be used eg
of two people - John ydy'r talaf John is the tallest
In Welsh the equative is denoted by inflection in more formal registers with -ed being affixed to the adjective usually preceded but not obligatorily by cyn meaning 'as'
For example Mae Sin cyn daled fi Sin is as tall as me
Irregular adjectives have specific equative forms such as da ‘good’ cystal = 'as good as'
In Akkadian cuneiform on a paragraph clay tablet from the time period of the BC Amarna letters a roughly -year body of letters two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use
The first is the numeral as well as and The second is a verb-spacement adjustment
The term and means 'over and over'
The phrase itself is a superlative but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds more at the end of the phrase EA Oh to see the King-pharaoh
I fall at the feet of the king my lord
I fall at the feet of the king my lord and times more
The word 'more' is Akkadian mila and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'
The meaning in its letter context is over and over again overflowing as 'gushingly' or 'obsequiously' as an underling of the king
The numeral is used for ten times greater in EA Love and Gold one of King Tushratta's eleven letters to the Pharaoh-Amenhotep IV-Akhenaton
The following quote using also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g to accentuate the last sentence and the verb itself ie
the relational kingly topic of the paragraph
Now in keeping with our constant and mutual love you have made it times greater than the love shown my father
May the gods grant it and may Teššup my lord and Aman make flourish for evermore just as it is now this mutual love of oursThe actual last paragraph line contains three words 'may it be' 'flourish' and 'us'
The verb flourish from napāhu to light up to rise uses -e-le-n-ep-pi- and the spaces
The other two words on the line are made from two characters and then one may it be flourish-our relations
In Estonian the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways
One is a periphrastic construction with kige followed by the comparative form
For example the comparative form of sinine 'blue' is sinisem and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is kige sinisem
There is also a synthetic short superlative form which is formed by adding -m to the end of the plural partitive case
For sinine the plural partitive form is siniseid and so siniseim is the short superlative
The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and in contrast to the kige-form has a lot of exceptions
In Finnish the comparative of the adjective is formed by adding the suffix -mpi to the inflecting stem of the adjective
The superlative being itself an adjective it must be inflected to agree with the noun it modifies noting that the inflecting stem of the -mpi ending is -mma-mm depending on the vowel harmony of the adjective
Hence pieni talo small house yields pienemmn talon edess in front of the smaller house
There is a small set of exceptions the most noteworthy being the comparative of the adjective hyv good that becomes parempi
The comparative of the adverb is marked by the -mmin ending
The adverbial form hyvin of the adjective hyv good becomes paremmin meaning in a better way
The complement of the comparative can be indicated in two ways
if it is a nominal group it can be put in the partitive case in front of the adjective or adverb in the comparative
This house is bigger than that one
Tm lhtev juna kulkee seuraavaa junaa nopeammin
This departing train travels faster than the next one
in all cases the complement can be introduced by the word kuin as following the comparative
This house is bigger than that one
Tm lhtev juna kulkee nopeammin kuin seuraava
This departing train travels faster than the next one
Se on tapahtunut nopeammin kuin osaamme ennakoida
It all happened faster than we could anticipateAugmentative
