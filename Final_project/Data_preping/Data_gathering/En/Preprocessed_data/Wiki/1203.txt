The official language of Thalwil is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.
Thalwil is first mentioned around 1030 as Talwile villam, which is derived from Tellewilare, Tello's Farm, and indicates the early medieval origins of Thalwil as an Alemannic farmstead
Only a few graves remain from this period
 In 1133, it was mentioned as Telwil.
The parish of Thalwil originally comprised four Wachten (hamlets):
Ludretikon, the oldest hamlet (mentioned in 915), bordering Rüschlikon
Oberdorf (Upper Village), the area around the church
Unterdorf (Lower Village), the area roughly south of the railway station
Langnau, which separated from Thalwil around 1713In medieval times, the economy consisted mainly of farms, vineyards as well as a small amount of fishing, crafts and shipping (on the lake)
This estate was once owned by the Dukes of Habsburg and held by the Barons of Eschenbach
The Abbeys of Muri and Wettingen also had significant interests and owned 12 and 3 farms respectively.
Thalwil also boasts the oldest wood corporation in the Canton of Zurich, the Bannegg-Waldung

Today the corporation is owned by 16 members as well as by the Thalwil Gemeinde.

Thalwil is one of the oldest parishes on the shores of Lake Zurich
It also has one of the most spectacular church locations, with the Platte affording views of the lake and its surroundings from Zurich to the Alps.
The earliest recorded church was dedicated to St Martin in 1159
In medieval times it was a dependency of Wettingen Abbey
Although it was frequently hit by lightning and also looted and set on fire during the Old Zürich War (Alter Zürichkrieg), the original building survived for over six hundred years.
In 1845, the small and rather dilapidated chapel was demolished and replaced by a much larger church designed by Ferdinand Stadler
A fire set off during repairs on the tower burnt down the new church  almost 100 years later (1943) but the building was soon completely restored and has survived to this day.

In the late 1830s, the lakeside road (Seestrasse) was opened
It soon attracted large silk, cotton and other textile factories to the former farming village, some run by local families such as Schwarzenbach, Schmid, and Kölliker
This growth was boosted by the new railway lines from Zurich to Pfäffikon (1875) and Zug (1897)
Industrialisation brought new workers into the former farming village and increased the population from 1,318 (in 1833) to 6,791 (in 1900).

Today this industrial past has all but vanished
The economy of Thalwil is mainly supported by a variety of small and medium-sized businesses, many located in the Böhni commercial estate opened in 1971
This includes Unisys Switzerland, which is the largest employer in Thalwil (over 500 jobs)
There is also a range of shops, mainly located around the Gotthardstrasse.
The main source of Thalwil's current prosperity lies in the large number of commuters (ca
7 000) who live there but work in the economic centres of Greater Zurich
Today, Thalwil has mostly left its farming and industrial past behind and become a commuter base.
Thalwil is located along the A3 motorway from Zurich to Chur as well as on the main railway lines from Zurich to Chur, Lucerne and Italy
In the summer, there are regular boats to Zurich as well as along the lake to Rapperswil, run by the Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft
