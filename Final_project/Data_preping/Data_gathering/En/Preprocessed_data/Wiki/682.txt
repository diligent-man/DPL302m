the yuan dynasty was a mongol ruled chinese dynasty which existed from to
after the conquest of the western xia western liao and jin dynasties they allowed for the continuation of locally minted copper currency as well as allowing for the continued use of previously created and older forms of currency from previous chinese dynasties while they immediately abolished the jin dynasty s paper money as it suffered heavily from inflation due to the wars with the mongols
after the conquest of the song dynasty was completed the yuan dynasty started issuing their own copper coins largely based on older jin dynasty models though eventually the preferred yuan currency became the jiaochao and silver sycees as coins would eventually fall largely into disuse
although the mongols at first preferred to have every banknote backed up by gold and silver high government expenditures forced the yuan to create fiat money in order to sustain government spending
inscriptions on the obverses of the coins appeared both in traditional chinese characters and phags pa script and coins appeared in denominations of and even w n the larger denominations led to a debasement of the currency which caused inflation
after the mongol empire began their campaigns against the western liao western xia and jin dynasties they started to cast their own copper cash coins with the inscription da chao tong bao chinese
it is currently unknown if these coins were already cast under genghis khan or if production started under kublai khan during the yuan dynasty as these coins are undocumented and rare
production of yuan dynasty copper coins with the zhong tong yuan bao coins commissioned by kublai khan started concurrently with the issuance of paper money which was backed up by silver sycees
prior to the establishment of the yuan dynasty m ngke khan created the department of monetary affairs in to oversee the issuing and creation of paper money this was to ensure that the nobility would not cause more inflation by overprinting money
the yuan dynasty would see the introduction of the bimetallic standard copper would be used for short distance and silver for long distance transactions
kublai khan asked his advisor liu bingzhong about the usage of coinage and with a yin and yang metaphor bingzhong claimed that no peace could exist within the yuan empire if coins continued to be used and advised for the exclusive circulation of mulberry bark paper money
the zhongtong yuanbao coins were only cast for years to later coins would again be issued under kublai khan
in the year liu shirong advocated for the creation of the zhiyuan tongbao cash coins stating that the mongols should follow the examples of the han and tang dynasties in the production of copper alloy cash coins and that these cash coins should circulate concurrent with silk and paper money
for the entire duration of tem r khan coins were only symbolically cast for religious institutions
under k l g khan the yuan dynasty s treasury was almost completely depleted which eventually led to k l g khan issuing a new banknote called the zhi da yin jiaochao which coincided with the minting of zhida tongbao coins which are the most commonly cast yuan era coins
under k l g khan the levels of inflation rose to as the government kept printing more banknotes due and in order to ensure the government s control on the currency k l g khan banned the usage of silver and gold coins and stopped the circulation of silver certificates in favour of fiat banknotes
ayurbarwada buyantu khan completely ceased the production of coinage in favour of paper money and made it illegal to use coins for payment however the private production of copper cash coins would persist despite these laws
because the khans of the yuan dynasty were buddhists they allowed buddhist temples exemption from taxation and granted them special rights to cast bronze statues and mint their own coins for religious offerings
during the periods that paper money was considered to be less valuable due to inflation people would use these temple coins as substitute currency
for years the production of coins would not continue until the reign of toghon tem r who started casting coins again in alongside his new series of banknotes
there are three basic typed of the zhizheng tongbao cash coins
the first type has the earthly branch indicating the year of casting written in phags pa script located above the square centre hole situated on the reverse side of the cash coin
the zhizheng tongbao cash coins with the reverse inscription meaning in the chinese calendar are the rarest because they began to be cast in november meaning that their production period was relatively short
this type was cast in values of w n w n and w n
the phags pa words on these zhizheng tongbao cash coins represent the following years
in some variants reverse side of the cash coin displays the mongol word for the chinese cyclical calendar characters geng yin g ng y n which indicates that these cash coins were cast somewhere in the year
these cash coin typically have a diameter of millimeters and tend to have a weight of about grams
the second type of zhizheng tongbao cash coins have the earthly branch of their year of production above the square centre hole on the reverse side and the nominal value of the coin below the square centre hole
for example the words x sh would denote that the cash coin was produced in the year and a nominal value of w n
the denominations of this type were cast as w n w n w n and w n
the third type of zhizheng tongbao cash coins have the earthly branch representing the year of production above the square centre hole on the reverse side and the nominal weight of the coin below the square centre hole
for example the phags pa transliteration of the word h i written above the square centre hole to denote that the cash coin was produced in the year and the words y li ng ch ng inscribed below the square centre hole which translates as tael in weight
in chancellor toqto a attempted to reform the yuan dynasty currency by printing out more paper money and creating large zhizheng zhibao copper coins which were inscribed with the promise that these coins were backed in paper money qu n ch o which translates as equivalent to paper money and that these would be in equal value
the calligraphy of the inscription for the zhizheng zhibao cash coins was done by the court poet zhou boqi
the reverse side of the zhizheng zhibao cash coins have to the left of the square centre hole the traditional chinese characters indicating the nominal value of the coin for example the equivalent of w qi n qi n in paper money
as the paper money was made out of inferior material it would often be easily damaged making it hard for the people to redeem this led to rebellions in the southern regions which in turn caused the yuan government to quickly print more money in order to finance its military expenditures leading to a decreasing confidence in paper money causing hyperinflation
eventually entire carts filled with banknotes were needed for simple transactions leading to the people disregarding paper money as currency and eventually barter had become the norm as coinage had already become a rarity
after the rise of the ming dynasty the northern yuan dynasty didn t continue to produce cash coins
the usage of paper currency under the yuan further inspired other countries such as korea japan and various states of india to develop their own paper currencies
coins issued by the mongols before the creation of the yuan include the da chao tong bao da guan tong bao tai he tong bao and da ding tong bao these coins were all issued in the conquered lands of the former jin dynasty and are subsequently known as frontier or border area coins
after the song dynasty fell to the mongols new coins started being issued
list of coins issued by the mongols during yuan dynasty
during the red turban rebellion organised by the white lotus society many of its leaders proclaimed their own kingdoms and empires that ruled over different regions of china the most successful of these was zhu yuanzhang s ming dynasty which would unify china
though the majority of these countries were short lived some did produce their own coinage
