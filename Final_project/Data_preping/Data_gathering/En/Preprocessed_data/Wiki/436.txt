the history of capitalism is diverse
the concept of capitalism has many debated roots but fully fledged capitalism is generally thought by scholars to have emerged in northwestern europe especially in great britain and the netherlands
over the following centuries capital accumulated by a variety of methods at a variety of scales and became associated with much variation in the concentration of wealth and economic power
capitalism gradually became the dominant economic system throughout the world
much of the history of the past years is concerned with the development of capitalism in its various forms
the processes by which capitalism emerged evolved and spread are the subject of extensive research and debate among historians
debates sometimes focus on how to bring substantive historical data to bear on key questions
key parameters of debate include the extent to which capitalism is a natural human behavior versus the extent to which it arises from specific historical circumstances whether its origins lie in towns and trade or in rural property relations the role of class conflict the role of the state the extent to which capitalism is a distinctively european innovation its relationship with european imperialism whether technological change is a driver or merely a secondary byproduct of capitalism and whether or not it is the most beneficial way to organize human societies
the historiography of capitalism can be divided into two broad schools
one is associated with economic liberalism with the th century economist adam smith as a foundational figure
the other is associated with marxism drawing particular inspiration from the th century economist karl marx
liberals view capitalism as an expression of natural human behaviors that have been in evidence for millennia and the most beneficial way of promoting human well being
they see capitalism as originating in trade and commerce and freeing people to exercise their entrepreneurial natures
marxists view capitalism as a unique mode of production involving the bourgeoise and proletariat that emerged as a result of the fall of feudalism and the beginning of the industrial revolution
this rejects the notion that capitalism has existed for millennia and is a part of human nature
the origins of capitalism have been much debated and depend partly on how capitalism is defined
the traditional account originating in classical th century liberal economic thought and still often articulated is the commercialisation model
this sees capitalism originating in trade
in this reading capitalism emerged from earlier trade once merchants had acquired sufficient wealth referred to as primitive capital to begin investing in increasingly productive technology
this account tends to see capitalism as a continuation of trade arising when people s natural entrepreneurialism was freed from the constraints of feudalism partly by urbanisation
thus it traces capitalism to early forms of merchant capitalism practiced in western europe during the middle ages
a competitor to the commercialisation model is the agrarian model which explains the rise of capitalism by unique circumstances in english agrarianism
the evidence it cites is that traditional mercantilism focused on moving goods from markets where they were cheap to markets where they were expensive rather than investing in production and that many cultures including the early modern dutch republic saw urbanisation and the amassing of wealth by merchants without the emergence of capitalist production
the agrarian argument developed particularly through karl polanyi s the great transformation maurice dobb s studies in the development of capitalism and robert brenner s research in the s the discussion of which is known as the brenner debate
in the wake of the norman conquest the english state was unusually centralised
this gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means not least the threat of violence
england s centralisation also meant that an unusual number of english farmers were not peasants with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence but tenants renting their land
these circumstances produced a market in leases
landlords lacking other ways to extract wealth were motivated to rent to tenants who could pay the most while tenants lacking security of tenure were motivated to farm as productively as possible to win leases in a competitive market
this led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists unsuccessful ones became wage labourers required to sell their labour in order to live and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land not least through the enclosures
in this reading it was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism
the transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside and the transformation of england s trade and industry was result more than cause of england s transition to capitalism
the st century has seen renewed interest in the history of capitalism and history of capitalism has become a field in its own right with courses in history departments
in the s harvard university founded the program on the study of u s
capitalism cornell university established the history of capitalism initiative and columbia university press launched a monograph series titled studies in the history of u s
capitalism
this field includes topics such as insurance banking and regulation the political dimension and the impact on the middle classes the poor and women and minorities
these initiatives incorporate formerly neglected questions of race gender and sexuality into the history of capitalism
they have grown in the aftermath of the financial crisis of and the associated great recession
some other academic institutions such as the clemson institute for the study of capitalism reject the notion that race gender or sexuality have any significant relationship to capitalism at all and instead seek to show that laissez faire capitalism in particular provides the best and most numerous economic opportunities for all people
according to some historians the modern capitalist system originated in the crisis of the late middle ages a conflict between the land owning aristocracy and the agricultural producers or serfs
manorial arrangements inhibited the development of capitalism in a number of ways
serfs had obligations to produce for lords and therefore had no interest in technological innovation they also had no interest in cooperating with one another because they produced to sustain their own families
the lords who owned the land relied on force to guarantee that they received sufficient food
because lords were not producing to sell on the market there was no competitive pressure for them to innovate
finally because lords expanded their power and wealth through military means they spent their wealth on military equipment or on conspicuous consumption that helped foster alliances with other lords they had no incentive to invest in developing new productive technologies
the demographic crisis of the th century upset this arrangement
this crisis had several causes agricultural productivity reached its technological limitations and stopped growing bad weather led to the great famine of and the black death of led to a population crash
these factors led to a decline in agricultural production
in response feudal lords sought to expand agricultural production by extending their domains through warfare therefore they demanded more tribute from their serfs to pay for military expenses
in england many serfs rebelled
some moved to towns some bought land and some entered into favorable contracts to rent lands from lords who needed to repopulate their estates
the collapse of the manorial system in england enlarged the class of tenant farmers with more freedom to market their goods and thus more incentive to invest in new technologies
lords who did not want to rely on renters could buy out or evict tenant farmers but then had to hire free labor to work their estates giving them an incentive to invest in two kinds of commodity owners
one kind was those who had money the means of production and subsistence who were eager to valorize the sum of value they had appropriated by buying the labor power of others
the other kind was free workers who sold their own labor
the workers neither formed part of the means of production nor owned the means of production that transformed land and even money into what we now call capital
marx labeled this period the pre history of capitalism
in effect feudalism began to lay some of the foundations necessary for the development of mercantilism a precursor of capitalism
feudalism lasted from the medieval period through the th century
feudal manors were almost entirely self sufficient and therefore limited the role of the market
this stifled any incipient tendency towards capitalism
however the relatively sudden emergence of new technologies and discoveries particularly in agriculture and exploration facilitated the growth of capitalism
the most important development at the end of feudalism was the emergence of what robert degan calls the dichotomy between wage earners and capitalist merchants
the competitive nature meant there are always winners and losers and this became clear as feudalism evolved into mercantilism an economic system characterized by the private or corporate ownership of capital goods investments determined by private decisions and by prices production and the distribution of goods determined mainly by competition in a free market
england in the th century was already a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of medieval europe had been swept away
this centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and a disproportionately large capital city london
the capital acted as a central market for the entire country creating a large internal market for goods in contrast to the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the continent
the economic foundations of the agricultural system were also beginning to diverge substantially the manorial system had broken down by this time and land began to be concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates
the system put pressure on both the landlords and the tenants to increase agricultural productivity to create profit
the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try out better methods
the tenants also had an incentive to improve their methods to succeed in an increasingly competitive labour market
land rents had moved away from the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation and were becoming directly subject to economic market forces
an important aspect of this process of change was the enclosure of the common land previously held in the open field system where peasants had traditional rights such as mowing meadows for hay and grazing livestock
once enclosed these uses of the land became restricted to the owner and it ceased to be land for commons
the process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the english agricultural landscape during the th century
by the th century unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands
marxist and neo marxist historians argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit
this created a landless working class that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the north of england
for example in agriculture the years between and are the years of wholesale enclosure in which in village after village common rights are lost
enclosure when all the sophistications are allowed for was a plain enough case of class robbery
anthropologist jason hickel notes that this process of enclosure led to myriad peasant revolts among them kett s rebellion and the midland revolt which culminated in violent repression and executions
other scholars argue that the better off members of the european peasantry encouraged and participated actively in enclosure seeking to end the perpetual poverty of subsistence farming
we should be careful not to ascribe to enclosure developments that were the consequence of a much broader and more complex process of historical change t he impact of eighteenth and nineteenth century enclosure has been grossly exaggerated
while trade has existed since early in human history it was not capitalism
the earliest recorded activity of long distance profit seeking merchants can be traced to the old assyrian merchants active in mesopotamia the nd millennium bce
the roman empire developed more advanced forms of commerce and similarly widespread networks existed in islamic nations
however capitalism took shape in europe in the late middle ages and renaissance
an early emergence of commerce occurred on monastic estates in italy and france and in the independent city republics of italy during the late middle ages
innovations in banking insurance accountancy and various production and commercial practices linked closely to a spirit of frugality reinvestment and city life promoted attitudes that sociologists have tended to associate only with northern europe protestantism and a much later age
the city republics maintained their political independence from empire and church traded with north africa the middle east and asia and introduced eastern practices
they were also considerably different from the absolutist monarchies of spain and france and were strongly attached to civic liberty
modern capitalism only fully emerged in the early modern period between the th and th centuries with the establishment of mercantilism or merchant capitalism
early evidence for mercantilistic practices appears in early modern venice genoa and pisa over the mediterranean trade in bullion
the region of mercantilism s real birth however was the atlantic ocean
england began a large scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the elizabethan era
an early statement on national balance of trade appeared in discourse of the common weal of this realm of england we must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them the period featured various but often disjointed efforts by the court of queen elizabeth to develop a naval and merchant fleet capable of challenging the spanish stranglehold on trade and of expanding the growth of bullion at home
elizabeth promoted the trade and navigation acts in parliament and issued orders to her navy for the protection and promotion of english shipping
these efforts organized national resources sufficiently in the defense of england against the far larger and more powerful spanish empire and in turn paved the foundation for establishing a global empire in the th century
the authors noted most for establishing the english mercantilist system include gerard de malynes and thomas mun who first articulated the elizabethan system
the latter s england s treasure by forraign trade or the balance of our forraign trade is the rule of our treasure gave a systematic and coherent explanation of the concept of balance of trade
it was written in the s and published in
mercantile doctrines were further developed by josiah child
numerous french authors helped to cement french policy around mercantilism in the th century
french mercantilism was best articulated by jean baptiste colbert in office although his policies were greatly liberalised under napoleon
under mercantilism european merchants backed by state controls subsidies and monopolies made most of their profits from buying and selling goods
in the words of francis bacon the purpose of mercantilism was the opening and well balancing of trade the cherishing of manufacturers the banishing of idleness the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws the improvement and husbanding of the soil the regulation of prices similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in medieval towns
however under mercantilism given the contemporaneous rise of absolutism the state superseded the local guilds as the regulator of the economy
among the major tenets of mercantilist theory was bullionism a doctrine stressing the importance of accumulating precious metals
mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals
mercantilists asserted that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported
they promoted the idea that government subsidies such as granting monopolies and protective tariffs were necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods
proponents of mercantilism emphasized state power and overseas conquest as the principal aim of economic policy
if a state could not supply its own raw materials according to the mercantilists it should acquire colonies from which they could be extracted
colonies constituted not only sources of raw materials but also markets for finished products
because it was not in the interests of the state to allow competition to help the mercantilists colonies should be prevented from engaging in manufacturing and trading with foreign powers
mercantilism was a system of trade for profit although commodities were still largely produced by non capitalist production methods
noting the various pre capitalist features of mercantilism karl polanyi argued that mercantilism with all its tendency toward commercialization never attacked the safeguards which protected the two basic elements of production labor and land from becoming the elements of commerce thus mercantilist regulation was more akin to feudalism than capitalism
according to polanyi not until was a competitive labor market established in england hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date
the muscovy company was the first major chartered joint stock english trading company
it was established in with a monopoly on trade between england and muscovy
it was an offshoot of the earlier company of merchant adventurers to new lands founded in by richard chancellor sebastian cabot and sir hugh willoughby to locate the northeast passage to china to allow trade
this was the precursor to a type of business that would soon flourish in england the dutch republic and elsewhere
the british east india company and the dutch east india company launched an era of large state chartered trading companies
these companies were characterized by their monopoly on trade granted by letters patent provided by the state
recognized as chartered joint stock companies by the state these companies enjoyed lawmaking military and treaty making privileges
characterized by its colonial and expansionary powers by states powerful nation states sought to accumulate precious metals and military conflicts arose
during this era merchants who had previously traded on their own invested capital in the east india companies and other colonies seeking a return on investment
mercantilism declined in great britain in the mid th century when a new group of economic theorists led by adam smith challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines such as that the world s wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state
however mercantilism continued in less developed economies such as prussia and russia with their much younger manufacturing bases
the mid th century gave rise to industrial capitalism made possible by the accumulation of vast amounts of capital under the merchant phase of capitalism and its investment in machinery and the fact that the enclosures meant that britain had a large population of people with no access to subsistence agriculture who needed to buy basic commodities via the market ensuring a mass consumer market
industrial capitalism which marx dated from the last third of the th century marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing characterized by a complex division of labor between and within work processes and the routinization of work tasks
industrial capitalism finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production
during the resulting industrial revolution the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system which led to the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of artisans guilds and journeymen
also during this period capitalism transformed relations between the british landowning gentry and peasants giving rise to the production of cash crops for the market rather than for subsistence on a feudal manor
the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture
the productivity gains of capitalist production began a sustained and unprecedented increase at the turn of the th century in a process commonly referred to as the industrial revolution
starting in about in england there was a steady transition to new manufacturing processes in a variety of industries including going from hand production methods to machine production new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes improved efficiency of water power the increasing use of steam power and the development of machine tools
it also included the change from wood and other bio fuels to coal
in textile manufacturing mechanized cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of about due to the application of james hargreaves spinning jenny richard arkwright s water frame samuel crompton s spinning mule and other inventions
the power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over
the cotton gin increased the productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of
large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving wool and linen although they were not as great as in cotton
the growth of britain s industry stimulated a concomitant growth in its system of finance and credit
in the th century services offered by banks increased
clearing facilities security investments cheques and overdraft protections were introduced
cheques had been invented in the th century in england and banks settled payments by direct courier to the issuing bank
around they began meeting in a central location and by the th century a dedicated space was established known as a bankers clearing house
the london clearing house used a method where each bank paid cash to and then was paid cash by an inspector at the end of each day
the first overdraft facility was set up in by the royal bank of scotland
the end of the napoleonic war and the subsequent rebound in trade led to an expansion in the bullion reserves held by the bank of england from a low of under million pounds in to million pounds by late
older innovations became routine parts of financial life during the th century
the bank of england first issued bank notes during the th century but the notes were hand written and few in number
after they were partially printed but cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to a named person
in parliament passed the bank charter act tying these notes to gold reserves effectively creating the institution of central banking and monetary policy
the notes became fully printed and widely available from
growing international trade increased the number of banks especially in london
these new merchant banks facilitated trade growth profiting from england s emerging dominance in seaborne shipping
two immigrant families rothschild and baring established merchant banking firms in london in the late th century and came to dominate world banking in the next century
the tremendous wealth amassed by these banking firms soon attracted much attention
the poet george gordon byron wrote in who makes politics run glibber all the shade of bonaparte s noble daring jew rothschild and his fellow christian baring
the operation of banks also shifted
at the beginning of the century banking was still an elite preoccupation of a handful of very wealthy families
within a few decades however a new sort of banking had emerged owned by anonymous stockholders run by professional managers and the recipient of the deposits of a growing body of small middle class savers
although this breed of banks was newly prominent it was not new the quaker family barclays had been banking in this way since
at the height of the first french empire napoleon sought to introduce a continental system that would render europe economically autonomous thereby emasculating british trade and commerce
it involved such stratagems as the use of beet sugar in preference to the cane sugar that had to be imported from the tropics
although this caused businessmen in england to agitate for peace britain persevered in part because it was well into the industrial revolution
the war had the opposite effect it stimulated the growth of certain industries such as pig iron production which increased from tons in to by
in david ricardo james mill and robert torrens in the famous theory of comparative advantage argued that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong
in principles of political economy and taxation ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in economics
when an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently both countries benefit by the mid th century britain was firmly wedded to the notion of free trade and the first era of globalization began
in the s the corn laws and the navigation acts were repealed ushering in a new age of free trade
in line with the teachings of the classical political economists led by adam smith and david ricardo britain embraced liberalism encouraging competition and the development of a market economy
industrialization allowed cheap production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities
nineteenth century imperialism decisively shaped globalization in this period
after the first and second opium wars and the completion of the british conquest of india vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of european exports
during this period areas of sub saharan africa and the pacific islands were incorporated into the world system
meanwhile the european conquest of new parts of the globe notably sub saharan africa yielded valuable natural resources such as rubber diamonds and coal and helped fuel trade and investment between the european imperial powers their colonies and the united states
the global financial system was mainly tied to the gold standard during this period
the united kingdom first formally adopted this standard in
soon to follow was canada in newfoundland in and the united states and germany de jure in
new technologies such as the telegraph the transatlantic cable the radiotelephone the steamship and the railway allowed goods and information to move around the world at an unprecedented degree
the eruption of civil war in the united states in and the blockade of its ports to international commerce meant that the main supply of cotton for the lancashire looms was cut off
the textile industries shifted to reliance upon cotton from africa and asia during the course of the u s
civil war and this created pressure for an anglo french controlled canal through the suez peninsula
the suez canal opened in the same year in which the central pacific railroad that spanned the north american continent was completed
capitalism and the engine of profit were making the globe a smaller place
several major challenges to capitalism appeared in the early part of the th century
the russian revolution in established the first communist state in the world a decade later the great depression triggered increasing criticism of the existing capitalist system
one response to this crisis was a turn to fascism an ideology that advocated state capitalism
another response was to reject capitalism altogether in favour of communist or democratic socialist ideologies
the economic recovery of the world s leading capitalist economies in the period following the end of the great depression and the second world war a period of unusually rapid growth by historical standards eased discussion of capitalism s eventual decline or demise
the state began to play an increasingly prominent role to moderate and regulate the capitalistic system throughout much of the world
keynesian economics became a widely accepted method of government regulation and countries such as the united kingdom experimented with mixed economies in which the state owned and operated certain major industries
the state also expanded in the us in total government expenditures amounted to less than one tenth of gnp from the s they amounted to around one third
similar increases were seen in all industrialised capitalist economies some of which such as france have reached even higher ratios of government expenditures to gnp than the united states
a broad array of new analytical tools in the social sciences were developed to explain the social and economic trends of the period including the concepts of post industrial society and the welfare state
the long post war boom ended in the s amid the economic crises experienced following the oil crisis
the stagflation of the s led many economic commentators and politicians to embrace market oriented policy prescriptions inspired by the laissez faire capitalism and classical liberalism of the nineteenth century particularly under the influence of friedrich hayek and milton friedman
the theoretical alternative to keynesianism was more compatible with laissez faire and emphasised rapid expansion of the economy
market oriented solutions gained increasing support in the western world especially under the leadership of ronald reagan in the united states and margaret thatcher in the uk in the s
public and political interest began shifting away from the so called collectivist concerns of keynes s managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice called remarketized capitalism
although overseas trade has been associated with the development of capitalism for over five hundred years some thinkers argue that a number of trends associated with globalisation have acted to increase the mobility of people and capital since the last quarter of the twentieth century combining to circumscribe the room to manoeuvre of states in choosing non capitalist models of development
today these trends have bolstered the argument that capitalism should now be viewed as a truly world system burnham
however other thinkers argue that globalisation even in its quantitative degree is no greater now than during earlier periods of capitalist trade
after the abandonment of the bretton woods system in and the strict state control of foreign exchange rates the total value of transactions in foreign exchange was estimated to be at least twenty times greater than that of all foreign movements of goods and services eb
the internationalisation of finance which some see as beyond the reach of state control combined with the growing ease with which large corporations have been able to relocate their operations to low wage states has posed the question of the eclipse of state sovereignty arising from the growing globalization of capital
while economists generally agree about the size of global income inequality there is a general disagreement about the recent direction of change of it
in cases such as china where income inequality is clearly growing it is also evident that overall economic growth has rapidly increased with capitalist reforms
the book the improving state of the world published by the libertarian think tank cato institute argues that economic growth since the industrial revolution has been very strong and that factors such as adequate nutrition life expectancy infant mortality literacy prevalence of child labor education and available free time have improved greatly
some scholars including stephen hawking and researchers for the international monetary fund contend that globalization and neoliberal economic policies are not ameliorating inequality and poverty but exacerbating it and are creating new forms of contemporary slavery
such policies are also expanding populations of the displaced the unemployed and the imprisoned along with accelerating the destruction of the environment and species extinction
in the imf warned that inequality within nations in spite of global inequality falling in recent decades has risen so sharply that it threatens economic growth and could result in further political polarization
surging economic inequality following the economic crisis and the anger associated with it have resulted in a resurgence of socialist and nationalist ideas throughout the western world which has some economic elites from places including silicon valley davos and harvard business school concerned about the future of capitalism
by the beginning of the twenty first century mixed economies with capitalist elements had become the pervasive economic systems worldwide
the collapse of the soviet bloc in significantly reduced the influence of communism as an alternative economic system
leftist movements continue to be influential in some parts of the world most notably latin american bolivarianism with some having ties to more traditional anti capitalist movements such as bolivarian venezuela s ties to cuba
in many emerging markets the influence of banking and financial capital have come to increasingly shape national developmental strategies leading some to argue we are in a new phase of financial capitalism
state intervention in global capital markets following the financial crisis of was perceived by some as signalling a crisis for free market capitalism
serious turmoil in the banking system and financial markets due in part to the subprime mortgage crisis reached a critical stage during september characterised by severely contracted liquidity in the global credit markets posed an existential threat to investment banks and other institutions
according to some the transition to the information society involves abandoning some parts of capitalism as the capital required to produce and process information becomes available to the masses and difficult to control and is closely related to the controversial issues of intellectual property
some even speculate that the development of mature nanotechnology particularly of universal assemblers may make capitalism obsolete with capital ceasing to be an important factor in the economic life of humanity
various thinkers have also explored what kind of economic system might replace capitalism such as bob avakian and paul mason
women s historians have debated the impact of capitalism on the status of women
alice clark argues that when capitalism arrived in th century england it negatively impacted the status of women who lost much of their economic importance
clark argues that in th century england women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture
the home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms and in some trades and landed estates
their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands
however clark argues as capitalism expanded in the th century there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home and the wife reduced to unpaid household work
middle class women were confined to an idle domestic existence supervising servants lower class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs
capitalism therefore had a negative effect on women
by contrast ivy pinchbeck argues that capitalism created the conditions for women s emancipation
tilly and scott have emphasized the continuity and the status of women finding three stages in european history
in the preindustrial era production was mostly for home use and women produced many household needs
the second stage was the family wage economy of early industrialization
during this stage the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members including husband wife and older children
the third or modern stage is the family consumer economy in which the family is the site of consumption and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption
