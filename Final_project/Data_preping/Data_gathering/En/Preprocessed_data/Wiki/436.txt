concept capitalism ha many debated root fully fledged capitalism generally thought scholar emerged northwestern europe especially great britain netherlands
following century capital accumulated variety method variety scale became associated much variation concentration wealth economic power
capitalism gradually became dominant economic system throughout world
much history past year concerned development capitalism various forms
process capitalism emerged evolved spread subject extensive research debate among historians
debate sometimes focus bring substantive historical data bear key questions
key parameter debate include extent capitalism natural human behavior versus extent arises specific historical circumstance whether origin lie town trade rural property relation role class conflict role state extent capitalism distinctively european innovation relationship european imperialism whether technological change driver
one associated economic liberalism -century economist adam smith foundational figure
associated marxism drawing particular inspiration -century economist karl marx
liberal view capitalism expression natural human behavior evidence millennium beneficial way promoting human well-being
see capitalism originating trade commerce freeing people exercise entrepreneurial natures
marxist view capitalism unique mode production involving bourgeoise proletariat emerged result fall feudalism beginning industrial revolution
reject notion capitalism ha existed millennium part human nature
origin capitalism much debated depend partly capitalism defined
traditional account originating classical -century liberal economic thought still often articulated 'commercialisation model'
reading capitalism emerged earlier trade merchant acquired sufficient wealth referred 'primitive capital' begin investing increasingly productive technology
account tends see capitalism continuation trade arising people's natural entrepreneurialism wa freed constraint feudalism partly urbanisation
thus trace capitalism early form merchant capitalism practiced western europe middle ages
competitor 'commercialisation model' 'agrarian model' explains rise capitalism unique circumstance english agrarianism
evidence cite traditional mercantilism focused moving good market cheap market expensive rather investing production many culture including early modern dutch republic saw urbanisation amassing wealth merchant without emergence capitalist production
agrarian argument developed particularly karl polanyi's great transformation maurice dobb's study development capitalism robert brenner's research discussion known brenner debate
wake norman conquest english state wa unusually centralised
gave aristocrat relatively limited power extract wealth directly feudal underling political mean least threat violence
england's centralisation also meant unusual number english farmer peasant land thus direct access subsistence tenant renting land
landlord lacking way extract wealth motivated rent tenant could pay tenant lacking security tenure motivated farm productively possible win lease competitive market
led cascade effect whereby successful tenant farmer became agrarian capitalist unsuccessful one became wage-labourers required sell labour order live landlord promoted privatisation renting common land least enclosures

according historian modern capitalist system originated crisis late middle age conflict land-owning aristocracy agricultural producer serfs
serf obligation produce lord therefore interest technological innovation also interest cooperating one another produced sustain families
lord owned land relied force guarantee received sufficient food
lord producing sell market wa competitive pressure innovate
finally lord expanded power wealth military mean spent wealth military equipment conspicuous consumption helped foster alliance lord incentive invest developing new productive technologies
crisis several cause agricultural productivity reached technological limitation stopped growing bad weather led great famine black death led population crash
response feudal lord sought expand agricultural production extending domain warfare therefore demanded tribute serf pay military expenses
moved town bought land entered favorable contract rent land lord needed repopulate estates
collapse manorial system england enlarged class tenant farmer freedom market good thus incentive invest new technologies
lord want rely renter could buy evict tenant farmer hire free labor work estate giving incentive invest two kind commodity owners
one kind wa money mean production subsistence eager valorize sum value appropriated buying labor power others
worker neither formed part mean production owned mean production transformed land even money call capital
effect feudalism began lay foundation necessary development mercantilism precursor capitalism
feudal manor almost entirely self-sufficient therefore limited role market
however relatively sudden emergence new technology discovery particularly agriculture exploration facilitated growth capitalism
important development end feudalism wa emergence robert degan call dichotomy wage earner capitalist merchants
competitive nature meant always winner loser became clear feudalism evolved mercantilism economic system characterized private corporate ownership capital good investment determined private decision price production distribution good determined mainly competition free market
england century wa already centralized state much feudal order medieval europe swept away
centralization wa strengthened good system road disproportionately large capital city london
capital acted central market entire country creating large internal market good contrast fragmented feudal holding prevailed part continent
economic foundation agricultural system also beginning diverge substantially manorial system broken time land began concentrated hand fewer landlord increasingly large estates
system put pressure landlord tenant increase agricultural productivity create profit
weakened coercive power aristocracy extract peasant surplus encouraged try better methods
tenant also incentive improve method succeed increasingly competitive labour market
land rent moved away previous stagnant system custom feudal obligation becoming directly subject economic market forces
important aspect process change wa enclosure common land previously held open field system peasant traditional right mowing meadow hay grazing livestock
enclosed us land became restricted owner ceased land commons
process enclosure began widespread feature english agricultural landscape century
century unenclosed common become largely restricted rough pasture mountainous area relatively small part lowlands
marxist neo-marxist historian argue rich landowner used control state process appropriate public land private benefit
created landless working class provided labour required new industry developing north england
example agriculture year year wholesale enclosure village village common right lost
enclosure sophistication allowed wa plain enough case class robbery
anthropologist jason hickel note process enclosure led myriad peasant revolt among kett's rebellion midland revolt culminated violent repression executions
scholar argue better-off member european peasantry encouraged participated actively enclosure seeking end perpetual poverty subsistence farming
careful ascribe enclosure development consequence much broader complex process historical change impact eighteenth nineteenth century enclosure ha grossly exaggerated
