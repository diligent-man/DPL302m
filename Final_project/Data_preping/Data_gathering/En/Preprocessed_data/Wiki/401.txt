in australia long service leave lsl is a period of additional paid leave granted to employees who have completed an extended period of service with an employer
under australian law most employees are entitled to long service leave if they work for the same employer for a prolonged length of time the threshold usually being between seven and ten years
long service leave is separate from annual leave employees receiving long service leave continue to accrue annual leave as normal and at a minimum as prescribed by the national employment standards
currently there is no uniform national long service leave standard in australia the rules governing long service leave entitlements vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction or industrial instrument e g award or enterprise agreement
the qualifying period of service ranges from seven to fifteen years although as noted in most instances it is no higher than ten
the initial period of leave granted to eligible employees varies between around six and thirteen weeks
long service leave legislation in many of the states and territories goes on to provide further long service leave entitlements should the employee continue to work with the employer
long service leave taken or cashed out is generally paid at the employee s ordinary pay rate being the base hourly rate or salary stripped of any allowances penalties shift loading or overtime that they may otherwise be entitled to
unused long service leave is paid out to employees when terminated
normally employees who terminate before reaching the length of service required to access long service leave do not receive any payment related to long service leave notionally accrued during their employment
however some state legislation contains limited exceptions to this rule
the institute of actuaries of australia estimated that the total value of long service leave benefits in australia was around billion in
there has been a debate in australia about the protection of employee entitlements including long service leave in the event of employer insolvency with some high profile cases involving employees losing benefits that had been accrued
australian long service legislation is currently in a transitional state pending development of a uniform national standard
most employee s entitlements arise from state or territory legislation
for employees in industries or occupations covered by industrial awards long service leave entitlements are determined by the award if the award includes long service leave terms
if the award does not consider long service leave entitlements employees under this award should instead refer to state or territory legislation
note that only pre modern awards industrial awards which existed prior to january contain terms regarding entitlements
modern awards do not include long service leave content
as such these are being slowly phased out to allow for a new centralised system
for all other employees minimum entitlements are derived from the relevant state or territory long service leave laws

commonwealth applies to federal public servants months on full pay after years continuous service
however should a person join the commonwealth from a state government that provides lsl at a rate greater than the commonwealth and the person utilised that lsl before joining the commonwealth the commonwealth will permanently withhold some of the person s commonwealth lsl due to the way they interpret section of the lsl act

known as portable long service leave this is done mostly through specific legislated schemes which employers in those industries pay into and which administer the funds for employees
the australian senate has recently moved to inquire into portable long service leave schemes
the inquiry will be conducted by the education and employment references committee
the committee will consider how portable schemes might be structured and what role the australian federal government might play in helping to establish a scheme
the committee will also have to evaluate the effect that the differing state long service entitlements will have on a national scheme as the current state based long service leave provisions are all practically different
as of november the committee had yet to meet and set dates for submissions and reporting
long service leave is a benefit peculiar to australia and possibly some civil servants in india and arises from the colonial heritage of each country
there is also a similar system of sabbatical leave in finland
long service leave developed from the concept of furlough which stems from the dutch word verlof meaning leave and its usage originates in leave granted from military service
in australia the benefit was first granted to victorian and south australian public servants in the s
the nature of the leave allowed public servants after years service to sail home to england or elsewhere safe in the knowledge that they would be able to resume their positions upon their return to australia
section of the victorian public service act of reads where any officer desires to visit europe or some other distant country if he have continued in the civil service of the colony at least ten years and have not been reduced for misconduct or deprived of leave of absence under this act the governor in council may grant to him leave of absence upon half salary for a period not exceeding twelve months but for such period of absence such officer shall not be entitled to receive any annual increment
over the period from to the benefit spread beyond the public service mainly as a result of pressure from non government employees seeking comparability with public servants
in the th century furlough as a benefit as it is now known was a privilege granted by legislation to the colonial and indian services
