In Australia long service leave LSL is a period of additional paid leave granted to employees who have completed an extended period of service with an employer Under Australian law most employees are entitled to long service leave if they work for the same employer for a prolonged length of time the threshold usually being between seven and ten years Long service leave is separate from annual leave employees receiving long service leave continue to accrue annual leave as normal and at a minimum as prescribed by the National Employment Standards
Currently there is no uniform national long service leave standard in Australia the rules governing long service leave entitlements vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction or industrial instrument eg award or enterprise agreement The qualifying period of service ranges from seven to fifteen years although as noted in most instances it is no higher than ten The initial period of leave granted to eligible employees varies between around six and thirteen weeks Long service leave legislation in many of the states and territories goes on to provide further long service leave entitlements should the employee continue to work with the employer

There has been a debate in Australia about the protection of employee entitlements including long service leave in the event of employer insolvency with some high profile cases involving employees losing benefits that had been accrued

Most employee's entitlements arise from state or territory legislation
For employees in industries or occupations covered by industrial awards long service leave entitlements are determined by the award if the award includes long service leave terms If the award does not consider long service leave entitlements employees under this award should instead refer to state or territory legislation Note that only pre modern awards industrial awards which existed prior to January contain terms regarding entitlements Modern awards do not include long service leave content As such these are being slowly phased out to allow for a new centralised system
For all other employees minimum entitlements are derived from the relevant state or territory long service leave laws
