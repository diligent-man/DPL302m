sensorimotor social space human robot live large complex small part potentially learnable skill actually explored learnt within life-time
thus mechanism constraint necessary guide developmental organism development control growth complexity
several important family guiding mechanism constraint studied developmental robotics inspired human development
motivational system generating internal reward signal drive exploration learning two main types
extrinsic motivation push robotsorganisms maintain basic specific internal property food water level physical integrity light eg
intrinsic motivation push robot search novelty challenge compression learning progress per se thus generating sometimes called curiosity-driven learning exploration alternatively active learning exploration
social guidance human learn lot interacting peer developmental robotics investigates mechanism allow robot participate human-like social interaction
