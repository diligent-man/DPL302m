 The company continues to expand its catalog by acquiring new music collections and by producing over 100 new CDs of music each year.
In 2012, the company announced the Killer Tracks Artist Series which features original EPs of songs with lyrics from notable artists including Rev Theory and Alex Band, among others

The Killer Tracks catalog also includes original production music from well-known artists, composers and producers including Chuck D, Lamont Dozier, Jim Brickman, and others.
The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Universal Music Publishing Group
Until 2007, Killer Tracks was owned by production music division of BMG Music Publishing, which was sold alongside other operations of the company
On September 12, 2019, Killer Tracks rebranded as Universal Production Music.
