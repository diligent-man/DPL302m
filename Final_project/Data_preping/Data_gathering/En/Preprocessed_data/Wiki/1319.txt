The Vanderbilt Commodores baseball team is an American National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college baseball team
From Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, the team participates in the Eastern division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and plays its home games on campus at Hawkins Field
 The Commodores are coached by three-time National Coach of the Year and three-time SEC Coach of the Year, Tim Corbin
During Corbin's tenure as head coach, Vanderbilt has become one of the premier college baseball programs in the United States, responsible for 12 first-round picks in the MLB draft.
Vanderbilt first fielded a baseball team in 1886
Herbert Charles Sanborn, the chair of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology from 1921 to 1942, who was also the president of the Nashville German-American Society, coached the team in 1912–1913
Baseball became a scholarship sport in 1968.
The Commodores secured only three NCAA appearances in the 20th century—in 1973, 1974, and 1980
They had only three other winning seasons in SEC play in the first 35 years of the scholarship era
However, they have been to every NCAA Tournament but one since 2004
 The team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 according to Baseball America, made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and SEC tournament crowns
The Commodores were ranked first in most polls for a majority of the 2007 season and earned the #1 national seed for the 2007 NCAA tournament
Vanderbilt's victory over the University of Virginia in the finals of the 2014 NCAA tournament marks the program's first national title and second appearance in the College World Series, having first appeared in 2011
In 2019, Vanderbilt's fourth College World Series appearance, they beat Michigan two games to one in the finals, winning their second national title.
The original venue for the Commodores ball club was Dudley Field
Currently, the Commodores play their home games at Hawkins Field, which is an on-campus facility with a 3,700 seat capacity
Temporary outfield bleachers were installed for the 2007 Regionals and all of the 2008 season, bringing the capacity to 3,535
In May 2008, Vanderbilt announced extensive plans to upgrade its athletic facilities, including the addition of permanent seats down the first base line and outfield seats in both left-center and right field
These additions increased the size of Hawkins Field to its current capacity of 3,700 seats
It is adjacent to both Vanderbilt Stadium and Memorial Gymnasium  and is across the street from the McGugin Center
Hawkins Field opened in 2002 and is named after a donor who gave $2 million to help finance construction
The stadium was also the site of the first NCAA Baseball Tournament Regional that Vanderbilt ever hosted when it was the site of the Nashville Regional in 2007
Vanderbilt and Hawkins Field again hosted Regionals in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021, and hosted Super Regionals in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2021.
