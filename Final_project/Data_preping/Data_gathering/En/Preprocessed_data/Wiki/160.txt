St Michel du Valle is the parish church of Vale Guernsey
In January an Early Christian monument was unearthed outside the West door of the church This stone dates from the th or th century It is now situated outside the Baptistry resting against the wall This stone points to the presence of a Christian community on this site somewhere about AD It is possible that there was a Christian community in the Vale at an even earlier date A chapel dedicated to St Magloire stood in the Vale St Magloire was a nephew of St Samson of Dol and was born about the year The chapel in his name was mentioned in a bull of Pope Adrian IV as being in the patronage of Mont Saint Michel in Normandy all traces of the chapel have gone While the chapel would probably be of a much later date St Magloire the British missionary may well have set up a centre of Christian worship before AD
Somewhere around AD monks from the Benedictine monastery of Mont Saint Michel came to Guernsey to establish a community in the North of the Island It is likely that at one time a land bridge connected the two sections next to the Vale church before the sea broke through In it is reported that the Royal Court of Guernsey visited the Braye du Valle to replace boundary markers that had been washed away This area of Guernsey would form a separate island at high tide and continued to do so until The Priory of Mont Saint Michel was a dependency of the famous Abbey of Mont Saint Michel The last remaining stonework is a piece of buttressed wall to the South of the church by the roadside
According to tradition Robert II Duke of Normandy the father of William the Conqueror was journeying to England in to help Edward the Confessor He was obliged to take shelter in Guernsey and gave land now known as the Clos du Valle to the monks Furthermore in when pirates attacked and pillaged the Island a complaint was made to Duke William He sent over Sampson D'Anneville who succeeded with the aid of the monks in driving the pirates out For this service Sampson D' Anneville and the monks were rewarded with a grant of half the Island between them The portion going to the monastery being known as Le Fief St Michel and included the parishes of St Saviour St Pierre du Bois Ste Marie du Catel and the Vale The castle of Saint Michael or as it is now called Vale Castle was constructed to protect the population against pirates by providing a safe refuge In there was a large ceremony to celebrate the finalisation of major works
The Priory had the largest feudal court of all the Seigneuries consisting of a Seneschal eleven Vavasseurs a Greffier registrar six Bordiers and a Batonnier wand bearer
The official Seal of the Fief represented the Archangel Michael trampling Satan underfoot
The Court of the Priory was only second to the Royal Court of Guernsey in importance and retained its jurisdiction until
Although the Priors lived alongside the church there is nothing to show whether they themselves ministered to the spiritual needs of the parishioners or whether they appointed Vicars
In Henry Canon of Blanchelande was collated to the Vale Church by special dispensation as they could not find a secular priests to accept the charge This would imply that secular priests usually fulfilled this duty
After the then Prior of the Vale Guillaume Le Fievre became Abbot of Mont Saint Michel in Normandy The Priory was still functioning in though no longer under the Benedictine Order and a Franciscan friar was appointed by Edward IV
The site of the church makes it a landmark for seafarers and from many points in the North of the Island one can glimpse this building Prior to the church was reached by boat at high tide the Braye du Valle being navigable for small craft
The present church built alongside the Priory was dedicated in and belongs to the parish The Priory fell into disuse about some of its timbers being used to repair Castle Cornet
The church bears traces of monastic work in its architecture the
mouldings and capitals Another feature of the monastic influence is the irregularity of the layout No angles are square no walls are parallel and the main axis of the Chancel is out of line with the main axis of the Nave This deviation is well known being attributed to a desire to recall the tortured body of Jesus on the cross
On the South wall near the Chancel is a piscina one of four in the building
On the granite arch above the pulpit is the carving of a spaniel's head probably a mason's mark and of the same design as one at the Town Church
The masonry of the windows on the North side like the doorways at the West forms curious hood moulds to be seen from the outside of the buildings
