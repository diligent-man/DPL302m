michel du valle is the parish church of vale guernsey
in january an early christian monument was unearthed outside the west door of the church
this stone dates from the th or th century
it is now situated outside the baptistry resting against the wall
this stone points to the presence of a christian community on this site somewhere about a d
it is possible that there was a christian community in the vale at an even earlier date
a chapel dedicated to st magloire stood in the vale
st magloire was a nephew of st samson of dol and was born about the year
the chapel in his name was mentioned in a bull of pope adrian iv as being in the patronage of mont saint michel in normandy all traces of the chapel have gone
while the chapel would probably be of a much later date st magloire the british missionary may well have set up a centre of christian worship before a d
somewhere around a d
monks from the benedictine monastery of mont saint michel came to guernsey to establish a community in the north of the island
it is likely that at one time a land bridge connected the two sections next to the vale church before the sea broke through
in it is reported that the royal court of guernsey visited the braye du valle to replace boundary markers that had been washed away
this area of guernsey would form a separate island at high tide and continued to do so until
the priory of mont saint michel was a dependency of the famous abbey of mont saint michel
the last remaining stonework is a piece of buttressed wall to the south of the church by the roadside
according to tradition robert ii duke of normandy the father of william the conqueror was journeying to england in to help edward the confessor
he was obliged to take shelter in guernsey and gave land now known as the clos du valle to the monks
furthermore in when pirates attacked and pillaged the island a complaint was made to duke william
he sent over sampson d anneville who succeeded with the aid of the monks in driving the pirates out
for this service sampson d anneville and the monks were rewarded with a grant of half the island between them
the portion going to the monastery being known as le fief st michel and included the parishes of st saviour st pierre du bois ste
marie du catel and the vale
the castle of saint michael or as it is now called vale castle was constructed to protect the population against pirates by providing a safe refuge
in there was a large ceremony to celebrate the finalisation of major works
the priory had the largest feudal court of all the seigneuries consisting of a seneschal eleven vavasseurs a greffier registrar six bordiers and a batonnier wand bearer
the official seal of the fief represented the archangel michael trampling satan underfoot
the court of the priory was only second to the royal court of guernsey in importance and retained its jurisdiction until
although the priors lived alongside the church there is nothing to show whether they themselves ministered to the spiritual needs of the parishioners or whether they appointed vicars
in henry canon of blanchelande was collated to the vale church by special dispensation as they could not find a secular priests to accept the charge
this would imply that secular priests usually fulfilled this duty
after the then prior of the vale guillaume le fievre became abbot of mont saint michel in normandy
the priory was still functioning in though no longer under the benedictine order and a franciscan friar was appointed by edward iv
the site of the church makes it a landmark for seafarers and from many points in the north of the island one can glimpse this building
prior to the church was reached by boat at high tide the braye du valle being navigable for small craft
the present church built alongside the priory was dedicated in and belongs to the parish
the priory fell into disuse about some of its timbers being used to repair castle cornet
the church bears traces of monastic work in its architecture the
mouldings and capitals
another feature of the monastic influence is the irregularity of the layout
no angles are square no walls are parallel and the main axis of the chancel is out of line with the main axis of the nave
this deviation is well known being attributed to a desire to recall the tortured body of jesus on the cross
on the south wall near the chancel is a piscina one of four in the building
on the granite arch above the pulpit is the carving of a spaniel s head probably a mason s mark and of the same design as one at the town church
the masonry of the windows on the north side like the doorways at the west forms curious hood moulds to be seen from the outside of the buildings
in thomas de beaugy previously priest of lihou was in possession of the living of the vale he was the last roman catholic cur on the island and was present at the court of chief pleas in
in a protestant minister from france was appointed
in the pastor of st sampson took charge of both parishes and from this time the parishes continued to be united under the care of the same minister whose official title was rector of s
sampson s and vicar of the vale
in the crown ordered that the two parishes be held separately
the rev
thomas bell m a who had been a curate of the vale became rector
the mosaic reredos was erected in by the parishioners as a mark of esteem for thomas bell s th year in the parish he added another years
some of the services of the church were in the french language until the s
the parishes in guernsey were part of the diocese of coutances normandy until the latter part of the th century and were then transferred to the diocese of salisbury and then to the diocese of winchester soon afterwards where they remain
at the end of the last century a mission church was provided for the parish and in a church hall
the window over the altar at the parish church dedicated by the dean to the memory of the late mr
ingrouille son of mr
and mrs
ingrouille of la miellette vale
during the occupation mr
ingrouille jr was sentenced to imprisonment by the nazis for five years of which he served four years in various prisons the last being brandenberg germany
he was found by a british army officer and sent to hospital in brussels where he died on june
in his body was brought to guernsey and buried in the domaille cemetery at the vale church
a stained glass window in memory of mr
and mrs
robin was placed on the south side in
blue carpets curtains and cushions have been provided by the members of the mothers union and carpeting in the north aisle
in the heating system was completely replaced by a gas fired boiler and radiators
also in the old slates were removed from the roof and rafters felting and new slates supplied the work continued into
the vestry roof needed all new timbers and slates
whatever bells there were originally were replaced in the sixteenth century with three bells cast by the exeter bell foundry the tenor is said to have weighed about cwt
these were hung in the base of the spire
they were rung from the ground floor or perhaps the former gallery at the back of the church
their inscriptions are given in latin on the brass plate on the tower pillar and explain in french the reason for their gift by the rector the rev d
thomas a
bell who became rector of the vale in and continued in that post until his death in by which time he was the oldest active clergyman in the anglican church
his son arthur was born in and became a surgeon but died at digby s near exeter in and the
present bells were given in his memory by his parents
the inscription reads
eglise de s
michel du valle paques
cette eglise possedait autrefois trois cloches d une date tres ancienne mais inconnue elles portaient les inscriptions suivantes
me melior vere non est compana sub ere

the six new bells the largest weighing cwt in b flat all have the inscription recast by john warner sons london
they are hung for ringing in the base of the spire in a frame of iron castings bolted to timber foundation beams probably the same beams which supported the old bells
in the bells were sent to the whitechapel bell foundry to be retuned and rehung with new bearings and pulleys
in the year the bells were again removed from the frame so that it and the bell fittings could be refurbished
two rolled steel joists were installed to provide additional support to the bellframe
in dean bell had provided a ringing chamber below the bells reached by the iron ladder up the outside of the church not a pleasant approach on wet or windy days
however in the ringers were moved to the ground floor the bells are now rung in the presence
of the congregation from around the font
several peals have been rung on the bells the first in by a band from england
the first by local band was rung in as an th birthday compliment to queen elizabeth the queen mother
the clock with four faces was installed in the spire above the bells in to commemorate queen victoria s diamond jubilee the previous year
originally driven by weights it was electrified in
it has westminster chimes and strikes the hours

two chalices dated pour le service de l eglise du valle one chalice late th century
two patens and two salvers
