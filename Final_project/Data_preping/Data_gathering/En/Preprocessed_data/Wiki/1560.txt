John Venn FRS FSA August April was an English mathematician logician and philosopher noted for introducing Venn diagrams which are used in logic set theory probability statistics and computer science
In Venn published The Logic of Chance a ground-breaking book which espoused the frequency theory of probability arguing that probability should be determined by how often something is forecast to occur as opposed to educated assumptions
Venn then further developed George Boole's theories in the work Symbolic Logic where he highlighted what would become known as Venn diagrams
John Venn was born on August in Kingston upon Hull Yorkshire to Martha Sykes and Rev
Henry Venn who was the rector of the parish of Drypool
His mother died when he was three years old
Venn was descended from a long line of church evangelicals including his grandfather John Venn
Venn was brought up in a very strict atmosphere at home
His father Henry had played a significant part in the Evangelical movement and he was also the secretary of the ‘Society for Missions to Africa and the East’ establishing eight bishoprics overseas
His grandfather was pastor to William Wilberforce of the abolitionist movement in Clapham
He began his education in London joining Sir Roger Cholmeley's School now known as Highgate School with his brother Henry in September

He followed his family vocation and became an Anglican priest ordained in serving first at the church in Cheshunt Hertfordshire and later in Mortlake Surrey
In he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in moral science studying and teaching logic and probability theory and beginning around giving intercollegiate lectures
These duties led to his developing the diagram which would eventually bear his name
A certain machine was meant to bowl cricket balls
The machine was so fascinating that when Australian cricketers were visiting Cambridge the machines were used to entertain their arrival
The bowl cricket ball machine that Venn built actually bowled out the top ranked player of the team four times consecutively
In he married Susanna Carnegie Edmonstone with whom he had one son John Archibald Venn
His son entered the mathematics field as well
In he resigned from the clergy having concluded that Anglicanism was incompatible with his philosophical beliefs
