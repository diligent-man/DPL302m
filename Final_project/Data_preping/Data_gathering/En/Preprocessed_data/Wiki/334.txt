unbeknownst to jackie billy joins the ballet class
when jackie discovers this he forbids billy to take any more ballet classes

sandra tries to persuade jackie to let her pay for the audition but he replies that billy is his son and he does not need charity

billy s father is visibly moved by his performance
lee hall developed billy elliot from his play dancer which premiered as a rehearsed reading in at the live theatre in newcastle upon tyne
he was heavily influenced by photographer sirkka liisa konttinen s book step by step about a dancing school in nearby north shields
writing in hall said that almost every frame of billy elliot was influenced by step by step as every member of the design team carried around their own copy
hall met with director stephen daldry who was working at the royal court theatre at the time
at first daldry was not convinced with the script but said i liked the emotional honesty of billy elliot
also lee writes brilliant kids
and there s a series of themes in it i rather enjoyed grief finding means of self identification through some sort of creative act in this case dance and the miner s strike itself working title films approached daldry to become director and he accepted the offer
the bbc financed the project
thousands of boys were considered for the lead role
the producers were looking for a boy in a specific geographical area with a dance background
jamie bell had about seven auditions in total before eventually in mid it was announced that he would play the lead role in the film
peter darling the film s choreographer worked with bell for eight hours a day for three months finding out what drove him as a dancer julie walters accepted the role of sandra wilkinson
walters called the script moving explaining it was a diamond in the sand i loved the character and the fact that she was disappointed on every level possible
she was so grim and jaded
her relationship with the boy was so unusual
in preparation for filming gary lewis met with miners which he said was beneficial
lewis stated that his own personal experience of the miners strike made the role enjoyable
my family and i were very active in supporting the miners i stood in picket lines i raised money for the miners and i was involved in the whole campaign to stop closing the pits
basically it was the state that launched a complete attack on a section of the work force a section of the working class
lots of people responded with solidarity and that was a key element in the script solidarity working at different levels the collective solidarity the economic solidarity
principal photography lasted seven weeks beginning in august
most of the film including the interior of the elliot home at alnwick street was shot on location in the easington colliery area with the producers using over locals as extras

school scenes were filmed in langley park primary school
other filming locations include the green drive railway viaduct in seaham tees transporter bridge new wardour castle and theatre royal in haymarket
daldry remarked in an interview the shooting schedule was a nightmare we only had seven weeks
kids can only work nine to five and you can t work saturdays
and the kid had to dance the whole time
so it was tight producer jon finn spoke of the difficulties of seeking filming locations we didn t realise how hard it would be to find working pits

fittingly for a story about dance it doesn t put a foot wrong and is engrossing funny very sad very moving and very uplifting
some critics gave a mixed response
timeout magazine believes that daldry overuses the dance as a metaphor for escape and frustration and choreographer peter darling s grandstanding ballet numbers sit a little uneasily given the realist comedy pitch
scott of the new york times notes that there were patches of thinness and predictability and that the first half seems to acknowledge its own triteness
however he compliments the pacing of the scenes and the actors who inhabit their roles like second hand suits
mark holcomb writing for indiewire took issue with the odd unsuccessful mix of theatrical whimsy and social realism and a dance scene which he describes as a cringe inducing s style music video routine
poverty and social class have been seen as major themes of the film
author rebecca mahon observed the film has a realistic setting the early scenes emphasising the miners strike the death of billy s mother and the family s financial situation
daldry adds it doesn t matter where you are in the world people understand the idea that you re part of an industrial working class group that is being discarded
and its question of what happens to communities devastated by de industrialisation and privatisation
in addition to social class daldry states that the film is about finding a voice someone trying to express himself or herself
koller alonso writes that gender differences are expressed by showing girls attending ballet classes while their male counterparts are having boxing lessons
homosexuality a taboo subject in the s as well as police brutality are depicted and explored in the film
