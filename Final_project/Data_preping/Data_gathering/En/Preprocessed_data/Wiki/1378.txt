broadly speaking liberty is the ability to do as one pleases or a right or immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant i e
privilege
it is a synonym for the word freedom
in modern politics negative liberty is understood as the state of being free within society from control or oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one s way of life behavior or political views
whereas positive liberty is understood as the possession of the power and resources to act in an environment that overcomes the inequalities that divide us
in philosophy these distinctions between negative liberty and positive liberty require distinctions about the causative links that distinguish free will from determinism
in theology liberty is freedom from the effects of sin spiritual servitude or worldly ties
sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word freedom primarily if not exclusively to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do and using the word liberty to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints taking into account the rights of all involved
in this sense the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others
thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom
freedom is broader in that it represents a total lack of restraint or the unrestrained ability to fulfill one s desires
for example a person can have the freedom to murder but not have the liberty to murder as the latter example deprives others of their right not to be harmed
liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment
in many countries people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts
the word liberty is often used in slogans such as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness or liberty equality fraternity

philosophers from the earliest times have considered the question of liberty
roman emperor marcus aurelius ad wrote
according to compatibilist thomas hobbes
john locke rejected that definition of liberty
while not specifically mentioning hobbes he attacks sir robert filmer who had the same definition
according to locke
john stuart mill in his work on liberty was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion
in his book two concepts of liberty isaiah berlin formally framed the differences between two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty positive liberty and negative liberty
the latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from tyranny and the arbitrary exercise of authority while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self mastery the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear
the modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the greek concepts of freedom and slavery
to be free to the greeks was not to have a master to be independent from a master to live as one likes
that was the original greek concept of freedom
it is closely linked with the concept of democracy as aristotle put it
this then is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state
another is that a man should live as he likes
this they say is the privilege of a freeman since on the other hand not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave
this is the second characteristic of democracy whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none if possible or if this is impossible to rule and be ruled in turns and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality this applied only to free men
in athens for instance women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative
the populations of the persian empire enjoyed some degree of freedom
citizens of all religions and ethnic groups were given the same rights and had the same freedom of religion women had the same rights as men and slavery was abolished bc

in the maurya empire of ancient india citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to freedom tolerance and equality
the need for tolerance on an egalitarian basis can be found in the edicts of ashoka the great which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government
the slaughter or capture of prisoners of war also appears to have been condemned by ashoka
slavery also appears to have been non existent in the maurya empire
however according to hermann kulke and dietmar rothermund ashoka s orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning
roman law also embraced certain limited forms of liberty even under the rule of the roman emperors
however these liberties were accorded only to roman citizens
many of the liberties enjoyed under roman law endured through the middle ages but were enjoyed solely by the nobility rarely by the common man
the idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the age of enlightenment
the social contract theory most influentially formulated by hobbes john locke and rousseau though first suggested by plato in the republic was among the first to provide a political classification of rights in particular through the notion of sovereignty and of natural rights
the thinkers of the enlightenment reasoned that law governed both heavenly and human affairs and that law gave the king his power rather than the king s power giving force to law
this conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of montesquieu
the conception of law as a relationship between individuals rather than families came to the fore and with it the increasing focus on individual liberty as a fundamental reality given by nature and nature s god which in the ideal state would be as universal as possible
in on liberty john stuart mill sought to define the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual and as such he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus the prevailing question becomes how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control

in british representatives attempted to but were prevented from adding a legal framework to the universal declaration of human rights
it was not until that the international covenant on civil and political rights came into force giving a legal status to most of the declaration
according to the united states declaration of independence all people have a natural right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
but this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the institutionalization of legalized black slavery
slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount since it involved property their slaves and that blacks had no rights that any white man was obliged to recognize
the supreme court in the dred scott decision upheld this principle
it was not until following the civil war that the us constitution was amended to extend these rights to persons of color and not until that these rights were extended to women
by the later half of the th century liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices

connecticut justice william o
douglas argued that liberties relating to personal relationships such as marriage have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms

according to the concise oxford dictionary of politics liberalism is the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice
but they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals
every discussion of freedom depends on three key components who is free what they are free to do and what forces restrict their freedom

according to the encyclop dia britannica libertarians hold liberty as their primary political value
their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other
libertarianism is guided by the principle commonly known as the non aggression principle nap
the non aggression principle asserts that aggression against an individual or an individual s property is always an immoral violation of one s life liberty and property rights
utilizing deceit instead of consent to achieve ends is also a violation of the non aggression principle
therefore under the framework of the non aggression principle rape murder deception involuntary taxation government regulation and other behaviors that initiate aggression against otherwise peaceful individuals are considered violations of this principle
this principle is most commonly adhered to by libertarians
a common elevator pitch for this principle is good ideas don t require force
according to republican theorists of freedom like the historian quentin skinner or the philosopher philip pettit one s liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one s actions but as non domination
according to this view which originates in the roman digest to be a liber homo a free man means not being subject to another s arbitrary will that is to say dominated by another
they also cite machiavelli who asserted that you must be a member of a free self governing civil association a republic if you are to enjoy individual liberty
the predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the english civil war resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non interference in thomas hobbes leviathan
socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal
freedom is a state of being where individuals have agency to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system
freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom
the socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality
influenced by karl marx s concept of alienated labor socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation where alienated labor refers to work people are forced to perform and un alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests
for karl marx meaningful freedom is only attainable in a communist society characterized by superabundance and free access
such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities
this goes alongside marx s emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the realm of freedom or discretionary free time for each person
marx s notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic
while many anarchists see freedom slightly differently all oppose authority including the authority of the state of capitalism and of nationalism
for the russian revolutionary anarchist mikhail bakunin liberty did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others
in a positive sense liberty consists of the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being by education by scientific training and by material prosperity such a conception of liberty is eminently social because it can only be realized in society not in isolation
