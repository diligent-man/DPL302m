the bah world centre is the name given to the spiritual and administrative centre of the bah faith representing sites in or near the cities of acre and haifa israel
much of the international governance and coordination of the bah faith occurs at the bah world centre including global teaching plans and study and translation of the bah holy writings
the universal house of justice representing the supreme governing body of the bah faith resides in haifa
the bah world centre is also a major destination for religious tourism and the current destination for bah pilgrimage attracting annually about one million visitors
the location of the bah world centre originated in bah u ll h s banishment and imprisonment to the fortress of acre in by ottoman authorities
many of the locations at the bah world centre including the terraces and the shrine of the b b which constitute the north slope of mount carmel were inscribed on the world heritage list in july
the location of the administrative centre was a result of a successive number of banishments and imprisonments of bah u ll h founder of the bah faith
bah u ll h was banished from persia by nasser al din shah in at which time bah u ll h went to baghdad in the ottoman empire
later he was exiled by the sultan of the ottoman empire at the behest of the persian shah to territories further away from iran and finally to acre in ottoman syria in
bah u ll h lived out the rest of his life in the area and he communicated with his followers throughout the middle east central asia and india through special couriers and acre became the centre of the expanding network of bah groups
when bah u ll h s imprisonment was eased the area also became a centre of bah pilgrimage as bah s would travel the long distance to see bah u ll h
the location of the shrine of the b b on mount carmel was indicated by bah u ll h to his son abdu l bah during a visit to haifa
furthermore the establishing of the administrative centre of the bah faith on mount carmel was also indicated by bah u ll h in his tablet of carmel which is considered one of the charter documents of the bah administration
bah u ll h died in near acre and his resting place is in bahji
following his death bah u ll h s son abdu l bah was appointed to be the head of his father s faith and the condition of the area as the centre of bah activity continued
he continued to correspond with bah s all over the world including now bah s in the west
while he was still officially a prisoner and confined to acre abdu l bah also organized the transfer of the remains of the b b from iran to palestine
he organized the purchase of land on mount carmel that bah u ll h had instructed should be used to lay the remains of the b b and organized for the construction of the shrine of the b b
this process took another years and was completed in
in the young turks revolution freed all political prisoners in the ottoman empire and abdu l bah was freed from imprisonment
soon after the revolution he moved to live in haifa near the shrine of the b b and since then the administrative headquarters of the religion have been in haifa
during the final years of abdu l bah s life the increasing levels of correspondence led to the employment of a number of secretaries including some in western languages and the provision of a pilgrim house in the area
abdu l bah died in and was buried in a room of the shrine of the b b in haifa
after abdu l bah s death shoghi effendi was the head of the religion and he directed the development of a number of separate projects in the area
he renovated the house of bah u ll h in bahji in and in the s secured legal possession of the lands around the building creating a number of gardens
he also obtained possession of other sites around acre related to bah u ll h s life including the house of abbud
around haifa he expanded the shrine of the b b by developing its golden domed superstructure and purchased lands surrounding the shrine in order to create gardens
shoghi effendi had also decided that the buildings housing the institutions of the religion indicated in bah u ll h s tablet of carmel including the universal house of justice the as yet unestablished governing body of the worldwide bah community would be arranged in the shape of an arc surrounded by gardens
the fulcrum of this arc would be the monument gardens which hold the graves of members of the bah holy family
during his own lifetime he started the construction of one of the buildings comprising the arc the international archives building
he also negotiated tax exempt status for all baha i properties
the religion s situation in israel was clarified in an agreement signed in by then vice premier and foreign minister shimon peres in which the government formally acknowledged the bah faith as a recognized religious community in israel declared its friendly relations with the bah world community noted that the holiest places of the bah faith are located in israel and confirmed that the universal house of justice is the trustee of the bah international community over the holy places of the bah faith in israel and over the bah endowments in israel
the other buildings of the arc the seat of the universal house of justice the centre for the study of the sacred texts and the seat of the international teaching centre were completed in and respectively
the fifth and yet to be built building the international bah library is planned to be eventually built at the eastern end of the arc and is anticipated as a center for knowledge in all fields including scientific investigation
the terraces around the shrine of the b b were also completed in
much of the international governance and coordination of the bah faith occurs at the bah world centre
these include decisions that affect the religion on a global level and the study and translation of the bah holy writings
the universal house of justice representing the supreme governing body of the bah faith resides in haifa along with the international teaching centre which coordinates the activities between the continental counsellors and works as a liaison between them and the house of justice
during shoghi effendi s time as the head of the bah faith the british mandate of palestine was dealing with a growing conflict between zionists and arabs in the region of palestine
with the end of the mandate in and the resulting arab israeli war the majority of the bah s in israel left the country and only shoghi effendi and a few others remained behind
in the first universal house of justice was elected with its seat in haifa and since then the number of support staff in haifa has grown to several hundred support staff from over sixty countries
the increase in staff was due to the international growth of the bah community and the increased range of work which is done at the bah world centre the staff include the house of justice s specialized departments such as the secretariat research finance statistics and others which tend to the maintenance of the gardens and buildings
additionally select individuals are approinted to other bah bodies such as the international teaching centre and the bah international development organization and as such serve at the bah world centre
uniquely despite the presence of several hundred volunteer staff in haifa and acre there is no formal community of bah s in israel in the sense that there are no nineteen day feasts spiritual assemblies etc
additionally since the days of bah u ll h bah s have observed a self imposed ban on teaching their religion to the local population of israel
formal declarations of faith by israelis are not accepted
in a letter dated the bah universal house of justice wrote
in the finance ministry of israel threatened to invalidate a status agreement between the baha i world center and the israeli government
the baha is were told to hire more israelis at their centers in the haifa region
the local israelis and the staff of the bah world centre have little contact with each other
even the staff members who have lived in israel for many years usually do not speak hebrew or arabic
mothers with small children who are married to the staff members and iranian bah s with jewish backgrounds are somehow connected to the israeli society
some faculty at the university of haifa conducted interviews with people from haifa who were affected by the expansions at the bah world centre beginning in the late s and continuing throughout the s
the construction included gardens terraces the center for the study of texts the international teaching center and the expansion of the archives
this culminated in an opening in
the interviewees perceived the site as a symbol of the city excellently managed and maintained and post construction residents recognized the advantages of financial contribution to the neighborhood community center and to arab students in the city increased property values and improved environmental quality however they also felt alienated and increasingly distanced from the site due to fencing and access control and inequality when they compared the site s esthetically impressive well cultivated appearance to their own neighboring neighborhoods
the city of haifa and others supported the site s establishment and promoted the projects for their inter religious tolerance esthetics economic growth tourism and boosting the international status of the city of haifa
the interviews suggested that the expansion created conflicts with some locals who perceived the construction as misleading and or overly aggressive and exerting undue power and political influence over decision makers
disputes emerged not around values but primarily around questions of physical planning and local nuisances the interviewees who felt that they were treated unfairly wanted any time unfettered access to the bah properties after opening but the properties had controlled access with open hours and guided tours
some regarded haifa as a city that became sacred as a result of the slightly strange and mysterious baha i religion
