the right wing included two battalions of the th line infantry and single battalions of the th light th th and th line infantry
there were national guard battalions plus the th dragoons and nd chasseurs cheval
the french government dismissed the previous army commander but none of the generals wanted the post because they had seen such generals as adam philippe custine and jean nicolas houchard sent to the guillotine
in desperation the representatives on mission selected jean pascal carlenc a good cavalry officer but incompetent as commander in chief
to add more trouble on october the army s chief of staff henri jacques guillaume clarke was dismissed for suspected sympathy with aristocrats
in the midst of this chaos the strong coalition army under dagobert sigmund von wurmser attacked on october
dubois did not distinguish himself withdrawing from his position when it was unnecessary
carlec refused to order a counterattack unless authorized to do so by the political representatives so the army fell back almost to strasbourg
dubois was replaced by louis desaix
the army of the moselle also suffered from disruptive changes of army leaders
on october lazare hoche replaced its acting commander
the new leader was handicapped by the arrest and dismissal of so many generals
evidently hoche thought favorably toward dubois because he wrote at this time jean ren moreaux and dubois have just arrived douard huet and fran ois joseph lefebvre recently promoted have begun work these four generals will much relieve me dubois led the army s advance guard in the battle of kaiserslautern on november
his force consisted of field guns in two horse artillery companies four squadrons each of the st carabiniers cheval and st dragoons three squadrons of the rd hussars one squadron of the th hussars five infantry companies and three half squadrons from various cavalry units
water logged roads kept hoche s main body out of action on the th but dubois joined one of jean jacques ambert s brigades in a morning assault on november
after suffering many casualties the french crossed the otterbach stream and advanced against the main prussian position
over the next two days the french attacks failed and hoche was compelled to order a retreat
dubois was hit in the leg by a musket ball in the battle of froeschwiller on december
in this engagement the army of the moselle turned wurmser s right flank and forced him to retreat from his defenses at haguenau and along the river moder
dubois was provisionally appointed general of division on march
this promotion was confirmed on march
he arrived at guise to take command of the cavalry brigades from the divisions of antoine balland and jacques gilles henri goguet
dubois attempted to impose discipline on the unruly and riotous regiments
unfortunately the organizations were changing constantly preventing him from accomplishing much
after goguet was assassinated by his own troops on april dubois took over the division
on may dubois division counted soldiers and was posted at boh ries abbey near guise
balland s man division and dubois division made up the center of the army of the north under jacques ferrand

hautpoul led the th dragoons nd hussars and th chasseurs cheval while soland led the th cavalry and th cavalry
on june jean baptiste jourdan s army crossed the sambre river and the austrian held fortress of charleroi was placed under siege
the cavalry of dubois accompanied the infantry divisions of jean tienne championnet and antoine morlot and took post at ransart
the battle of lambusart was fought on june and resulted in a french defeat
prince william of orange who commanded the coalition army attacked the french in four columns with the main weight in the st and nd columns against the french right flank
the french left flank troops were successful against the th column
as the rd column under peter vitus von quosdanovich deployed in front of morlot s division jourdan ordered the cavalry to attack
accordingly dubois led the th cavalry of morlot s division and th chasseurs cheval in a brilliant cavalry charge capturing enemy soldiers and seven cannons
unfortunately jourdan soon received news that his right flank had collapsed causing him to order a withdrawal
undeterred jourdan spent one day reorganizing his defeated army and then advanced across the sambre on june reinvesting charleroi
the prince of orange s troops took position at rouveroy to the west of charleroi while johann peter beaulieu s division blocked the road to the north at quatre bras
the overall coalition commander prince josias of saxe coburg saalfeld dithered over what to do then finally decided to help the prince of orange
when coburg s man army reached the scene it was too late charleroi had surrendered to the french
as on the th jourdan s troops formed a semi circle around charleroi
in the battle of fleurus on june coburg formed his army into five attacking columns
dubois cavalry was positioned near ransart behind the center together with jacques maurice hatry s infantry division
again jourdan s right flank was swept away by the coalition attack
lefebvre wheeled back the right flank of his division and placed it under the orders of jean de dieu soult
some soldiers and cannons from the routed right wing rallied on it
jourdan issued orders for a retreat but finding that lefebvre was still holding on he countermanded the order
championnet s division had just begun pulling out
jourdan directed dubois cavalry to charge the enemy the horsemen were repulsed but championnet s foot soldiers attacked next and regained their former positions
after a see saw struggle on the left flank the french managed to hold their ground there also
coburg in person hurled his battalions at lefebvre but every assault was beaten back
that evening coburg conceded victory to the french and retreated to braine l alleud
on and july dubois led his troopers in clashes against the coalition forces
he fought in the battle of aldenhoven on october where he led the strong cavalry reserve
he got into an argument with the supply department which caused a rupture with jourdan
he left the army early in

in paris at the time dubois was given command of the capital s cavalry on the st
the next day soldiers under jean charles pichegru crushed the revolt
dubois returned to the army of the north where he commanded the jemappes department
chafing at this inactive role he asked for a transfer to the army of italy to replace the slain am d e emmanuel fran ois laharpe the request was granted
on september dubois was hit by three musket balls while leading his horsemen at the battle of rovereto
the fatally wounded general gasped out to napoleon bonaparte i die for the republic
