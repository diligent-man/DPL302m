He enlisted in a French infantry regiment in and transferred into the cavalry in
Thereafter he served in several different cavalry and infantry regiments
From sous-lieutenant in he served in the Army of the Moselle and was rapidly promoted to general of brigade by August
After briefly commanding an infantry division in the Army of the Rhine at Wissembourg he switched back to the Army of the Moselle to fight at Kaiserslautern before being wounded at Froeschwiller in December
Promoted to general of division in March Dubois led a cavalry division in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse at Lambusart Fleurus and Aldenhoven
In May he helped put down the Revolt of Prairial Year III
After garrison duty he was able to get transferred to Italy
He was fatally hit while leading the cavalry at the Battle of Rovereto and died the same day

Dubois was born on January at Guise in what later became the Aisne department in France
He joined the Lyonnais Infantry Regiment of French Royal Army on August
He transferred into the Monsieur Dragoon Regiment on June followed by subsequent moves into the Royal-Normandie Cavalry Regiment on December and the th Chevau-lger Regiment on May

He was promoted to sous-lieutenant on March first lieutenant on June and captain on August the same year

The First Battle of Wissembourg found Dubois in command of the Right Wing of the Army of Rhine
His brigade commanders were Claude Ignace Franois Michaud and Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand
The Right wing included two battalions of the th Line Infantry and single battalions of the th Light th th and th Line Infantry
There were National Guard battalions plus the th Dragoons and nd Chasseurs Cheval
The French government dismissed the previous army commander but none of the generals wanted the post because they had seen such generals as Adam Philippe Custine and Jean Nicolas Houchard sent to the guillotine
In desperation the representatives on mission selected Jean Pascal Carlenc a good cavalry officer but incompetent as commander-in-chief
To add more trouble on October the army's chief of staff Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke was dismissed for suspected sympathy with aristocrats
In the midst of this chaos the -strong Coalition army under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser attacked on October
Dubois did not distinguish himself withdrawing from his position when it was unnecessary
Carlec refused to order a counterattack unless authorized to do so by the political representatives so the army fell back almost to Strasbourg
The Army of the Moselle also suffered from disruptive changes of army leaders
On October Lazare Hoche replaced its acting commander
The new leader was handicapped by the arrest and dismissal of so many generals
Evidently Hoche thought favorably toward Dubois because he wrote at this time Jean Ren Moreaux and Dubois have just arrived douard Huet and Franois Joseph Lefebvre recently promoted have begun work these four generals will much relieve me Dubois led the army's Advance Guard in the Battle of Kaiserslautern on November
His force consisted of field guns in two horse artillery companies four squadrons each of the st Carabiniers--Cheval and st Dragoons three squadrons of the rd Hussars one squadron of the th Hussars five infantry companies and three half-squadrons from various cavalry units
Water-logged roads kept Hoche's main body out of action on the th but Dubois joined one of Jean-Jacques Ambert's brigades in a morning assault on November
After suffering many casualties the French crossed the Otterbach stream and advanced against the main Prussian position
Over the next two days the French attacks failed and Hoche was compelled to order a retreat
Dubois was hit in the leg by a musket ball in the Battle of Froeschwiller on December
In this engagement the Army of the Moselle turned Wurmser's right flank and forced him to retreat from his defenses at Haguenau and along the river Moder
Dubois was provisionally appointed general of division on March
He arrived at Guise to take command of the cavalry brigades from the divisions of Antoine Balland and Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet
Dubois attempted to impose discipline on the unruly and riotous regiments
Unfortunately the organizations were changing constantly preventing him from accomplishing much
After Goguet was assassinated by his own troops on April Dubois took over the division
On May Dubois' division counted soldiers and was posted at Bohries Abbey near Guise
Balland's -man division and Dubois' division made up the center of the Army of the North under Jacques Ferrand
After May the brigade of Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul was sent to the right wing of the Army of the North
On May Dubois left with a second cavalry brigade to join the right wing at Maubeuge
He took command of a cavalry division assembled at Ham-sur-Heure on June
The troopers were divided into brigades under Hautpoul and Guillaume Soland each with a horse artillery battery attached
Hautpoul led the th Dragoons nd Hussars and th Chasseurs--Cheval while Soland led the th Cavalry and th Cavalry
On June Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army crossed the Sambre River and the Austrian-held fortress of Charleroi was placed under siege
The cavalry of Dubois accompanied the infantry divisions of Jean tienne Championnet and Antoine Morlot and took post at Ransart
The Battle of Lambusart was fought on June and resulted in a French defeat
Prince William of Orange who commanded the Coalition army attacked the French in four columns with the main weight in the st and nd Columns against the French right flank
The French left flank troops were successful against the th Column
As the rd Column under Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich deployed in front of Morlot's division Jourdan ordered the cavalry to attack
Accordingly Dubois led the th Cavalry of Morlot's division and th Chasseurs--Cheval in a brilliant cavalry charge capturing enemy soldiers and seven cannons
Unfortunately Jourdan soon received news that his right flank had collapsed causing him to order a withdrawal
Undeterred Jourdan spent one day reorganizing his defeated army and then advanced across the Sambre on June reinvesting Charleroi
The Prince of Orange's troops took position at Rouveroy to the west of Charleroi while Johann Peter Beaulieu's division blocked the road to the north at Quatre Bras
The overall Coalition commander Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld dithered over what to do then finally decided to help the Prince of Orange
When Coburg's -man army reached the scene it was too late Charleroi had surrendered to the French
As on the th Jourdan's troops formed a semi-circle around Charleroi
In the Battle of Fleurus on June Coburg formed his army into five attacking columns
Dubois' cavalry was positioned near Ransart behind the center together with Jacques Maurice Hatry's infantry division
Again Jourdan's right flank was swept away by the Coalition attack
Lefebvre wheeled back the right flank of his division and placed it under the orders of Jean-de-Dieu Soult
Some soldiers and cannons from the routed right wing rallied on it
Jourdan issued orders for a retreat but finding that Lefebvre was still holding on he countermanded the order
Championnet's division had just begun pulling out
Jourdan directed Dubois' cavalry to charge the enemy the horsemen were repulsed but Championnet's foot soldiers attacked next and regained their former positions
After a see-saw struggle on the left flank the French managed to hold their ground there also
Coburg in person hurled his battalions at Lefebvre but every assault was beaten back
That evening Coburg conceded victory to the French and retreated to Braine-l'Alleud
On and July Dubois led his troopers in clashes against the Coalition forces
He fought in the Battle of Aldenhoven on October where he led the -strong cavalry reserve
He got into an argument with the supply department which caused a rupture with Jourdan
The Revolt of Prairial Year III broke out on May when a crowd of armed people burst into the National Convention and assassinated a deputy
In Paris at the time Dubois was given command of the capital's cavalry on the st
The next day soldiers under Jean-Charles Pichegru crushed the revolt
Dubois returned to the Army of the North where he commanded the Jemappes department
Chafing at this inactive role he asked for a transfer to the Army of Italy to replace the slain Amde Emmanuel Franois Laharpe the request was granted
On September Dubois was hit by three musket balls while leading his horsemen at the Battle of Rovereto
The fatally wounded general gasped out to Napoleon Bonaparte I die for the Republic
Do I have the time to know if the victory is complete DUBOIS is on Column of the Arc de Triomphe
