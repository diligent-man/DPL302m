Jaffna (Tamil: யாழ்ப்பாணம், romanized: Yāḻppāṇam, Sinhala: යාපනය, romanized: Yāpanaya) is the capital city of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka
It is the administrative headquarters of the Jaffna District located on a peninsula of the same name
With a population of 88,138 in 2012, Jaffna is Sri Lanka's 12th most populous city
Jaffna is approximately six miles (9.7 kilometres) from Kandarodai which served as an emporium in the Jaffna peninsula from classical antiquity
Jaffna's suburb Nallur, served as the capital of the four-century-long medieval Jaffna Kingdom.
Prior to the Sri Lankan Civil War, it was Sri Lanka's second most populous city after Colombo
The 1980s insurgent uprising led to extensive damage, expulsion of part of the population, and military occupation
Since the end of civil war in 2009, refugees and internally displaced people began returning to homes, while government and private sector reconstruction started taking place
Historically, Jaffna has been a contested city
It was made into a colonial port town during the Portuguese occupation of the Jaffna peninsula in 1619 who lost it to the Dutch, only to lose it to the British in 1796
During the civil war, the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) occupied Jaffna in 1986
The Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) briefly occupied the city in 1987
The LTTE again occupied the city from 1989 until 1995, when the Sri Lankan Army regained control.
The majority of the city's population are Sri Lankan Tamils with a significant number of Sri Lankan Moors, Indian Tamils and other ethnic groups present in the city prior to the civil war
Most Sri Lankan Tamils are Hindus followed by Christians, Muslims and a small Buddhist minority
The city is home to number of educational institutions established during the colonial and post-colonial period
It also has number of commercial institutions, minor industrial units, banks, hotels and other government institutions
It is home to many historical sites such as the popular Jaffna library that was burnt down and rebuilt and the Jaffna fort which was rebuilt during the Dutch colonial period.
Jaffna is known in Tamil as Yalpanam and earlier known as Yalpanapattinam
A 15th century inscription of the Vijayanagara Empire mentions the place as Yalpaanayanpaddinam
The name also occurs on copper plates issued by Sethupathi kings of the same era
The suffix -pattinam indicates the place to have been a seaport town.
The origin of the name can be traced to a legend about the town's etymology
A king (supposedly Ukkirasinghan) was visited by the blind Panan musician, who was an expert in vocal music and one skilled in the use of instrument called Yal
The king who was delighted to the music played with the Yal by the Panan, presented him a sandy plain
The Panan returned to India and introduced some members of his tribe as impecunious as himself to accompany to this land of promise, and it is surmised that their place of settlement was that part of the city which is known at present as Passaiyoor and Gurunagar
The Columbuthurai Commercial Harbor situated at Colombuthurai and the harbor known as ‘Aluppanthy’ situated previously at the Gurunagar area seem as its evidences.
Jaffna is a corrupted version of Yalpanam
The colloquial form of Yalpanam is Yappanam
The Ya and Ja including pp and ff are easily interchangeable
As soon as it went into foreign language, it lost the Tamil ending m and consequently stood as Jaffna.
Megalithic excavations reveal settlements of an early period in this region
The bronze Anaikoddai seal with Tamil-Brahmi and Indus script indicates a clan-based settlement of the last phase of the Iron Age in the Jaffna region
Iron Age urn burials including other Tamil-Brahmi inscribed potsherds found in Kandarodai, Poonakari and Anaikoddai in the Jaffna region, reflects the burial practices of older times
Excavated ceramic sequences in Kandarodai, similar to Arikamedu, revealed South Indian black and red ware, potteries and fine grey ware from 2nd to 5th BCE
Excavations of black and red wares (1000 BCE – 100 CE), grey wares (500 BCE – 200 CE), Sasanian–Islamic wares (200 BCE – 800 CE), Yue green wares (800 – 900 CE), Dusun stone wares (700 –1100 CE) and Ming Porcelains (1300 – 1600CE) conducted at the Jaffna Fort hints to maritime trade between the Jaffna Peninsula and South Asia, Arabian Peninsula and the Far East.
Jaffna and surrounding region was part of the chiefdom of Naga Nadu mentioned in the 5th century AD Tamil epic Manimekalai and the Pali chronicle Mahavamsa as inhabited by tribal Naga people, surmised as one of the earliest tribes of Sri Lanka
They had according to scholars fully assimilated to Tamil language and culture by the 9th century AD or earlier.
During the medieval times, the Kingdom of Aryacakravarti came into existence in the 13th Century as an ally to the Pandyan Empire in South India
When the Pandyan Empire became weak due to Muslim invasions, successive Aryacakravarti rulers made the Jaffna kingdom independent and a regional power to reckon with in Sri Lanka
Nallur a suburb of Jaffna served as the capital of the kingdom.
Politically, it was an expanding power in the 13th and 14th century with all regional kingdoms paying tribute to it
However, it met with simultaneous confrontations with the Vijayanagar empire that ruled from Vijayanagara, southern India, and a rebounding Kotte Kingdom from the southern Sri Lanka
This led to the kingdom becoming a vassal of the Vijyanagar Empire as well as briefly losing its independence under the Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467
The kingdom was re-established with the disintegration of Kotte kingdom and the fragmentation of Viyanagara Empire
It maintained very close commercial and political relationships with the Thanjavur Nayakar kingdom in southern India as well as the Kandyan and segments of the Kotte kingdom
This period saw the building of Hindu temples in the peninsula and a flourishing of literature, both in Tamil and Sanskrit.
The Portuguese established Jaffna city in 1621 as their colonial administrative center
Prior to the military capitulation to the Portuguese Empire in 1619, the capital of the local Jaffna Kingdom, also known as the Kingdom of the Aryacakravarti was Nallur, which is close to the city limits of Jaffna
The capital city was known in royal inscriptions and chronicles as Cinkainakar and in other sources as Yalpaanam in Tamil and Yapaapatuna in Sinhalese.
From 1590, Portuguese merchants and Catholic missionaries were active within the Jaffna kingdom
Impetus for a permanent fortified settlement happened only after 1619, when the expeditionary forces of the Portuguese Empire led by Filipe de Oliveira captured Cankili II, the last native king
De Oliveira moved the center of political and military control from Nallur to Jaffnapatao (variously spelt as Jaffnapattan or Jaffnapattam), the Portuguese rendition of the native name for the former Royal capital
Jaffnapatao was attacked number of times by A local rebel Migapulle Arachchi and his allied Thanjavur Nayakar expeditionary forces attacked Jaffnapatao a number of times, but the Portuguese defence of the city withstood the attacks
Jaffnapatao was a small town with a fort, a harbour, Catholic chapels, and government buildings
Portuguese merchants took over the lucrative trade of elephants from the interior and monopolised the import of goods from Colombo and India, disfranchising the local merchants
The Portuguese era was a time of population movement to the Vannimais in the south, religious change, and as well as the introduction to the city of European education and health care.
In 1658, Portuguese lost Jaffapatao to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) after a three-month siege
During the Dutch occupation, the city grew in population and size
The Dutch were more tolerant towards native mercantile and religious activities than the Portuguese had been
Most of the Hindu temples that the Portuguese had destroyed were rebuilt
A community of mixed Eurasian Dutch Burghers grew up
The Dutch rebuilt the fort and expanded it considerably
They also built Presbyterian churches and government buildings, most of which survived until the 1980s, but suffered damage or destruction during the subsequent civil war
During the Dutch period, Jaffna also became prominent as a trading town in locally grown agricultural products with the native merchants and farmers profiting as much as the VOC merchants.
Great Britain took over the Dutch possessions in Sri Lanka from 1796
Britain maintained many of the Dutch mercantile, religious, and taxation policies
During the British colonial period, almost all the schools that eventually played role in the high literacy achievement of the Jaffna residents were built by missionaries belonging to American Ceylon Mission, Weslyan Methodist Mission, Saivite reformer Arumuka Navalar and others
Under British rule, Jaffna enjoyed a period of rapid growth and prosperity, as the British built the major roads and railway line connecting the city with Colombo, Kandy and the rest of the country
The prosperity of the city's citizens enabled them to underwrite the building of temples and schools, and the library and museum.
After Sri Lanka became independent in 1948 from Britain, the relationship between majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils worsened
Residents of Jaffna city along with the rest of Tamil population of Sri Lanka were in the fore front of the political mobilisation behind Tamil nationalist parties
After the Tamil conference incident in 1974, the then mayor of Jaffna Alfred Duraiappah was assassinated by the leader of rebel LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran in 1975
Following further deterioration of political discourse, the Jaffna library was burnt down in 1981 by Police and other miscreants
Failure of the political class to find an adequate compromise led to full-scale civil war starting in 1983 soon after the Black July pogrom
Sri Lankan military and police were using the Dutch era fort as their encampment which was surrounded by various Tamil militant groups
 Bombardment from air and land of the city led to damage to civic and civilian properties, death and injury to civilians and destruction the economic potential of the city
In 1986, the Sri Lankan military withdrew from the city and it came under the full control of the LTTE.
In 1987, the Indian forces brought to Sri Lanka under the auspices of the Indo- Sri Lankan peace accord led an operation to take the city from the rebels
It led to incidents like the Jaffna University Helidrop and Jaffna hospital massacre in which patients and medical workers were killed by the Indian Army
More than 200 civilians were also killed during attempt to take the city over by the IPKF
After the departure of the Indians, the city came under the control of the LTTE once more, but they were ousted in 1995 after a 50-day siege
The economic embargo of the rebel controlled territories in general also had a negative impact in Jaffna including lack of power, critical medicines and food
During the period of LTTE occupation, all Muslim residents were expelled in 1990 and forced evacuated all residents in 1995
Since the end of civil war in 2009, refugees have begun to return and visible reconstruction has taken place
The Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora and business interests from Colombo have invested in commercial enterprises
 Countries in Europe, US and India have shown an interest in investing in infrastructure projects and other economic activities.
The city is surrounded by Jaffna Lagoon to its west and south, Kokkuvil and Thirunelveli to the north, and Nallur to the east
Jaffna peninsula is made of limestone as it was submerged under sea during the Miocene period
The limestone is grey, yellow and white porous type
The entire land mass is flat and lies at sea level
Within one mile (1.6 kilometres) of the city center is the island of Mandativu which is connected by a causway
Palmyrah groves can be seen where land has not been used for construction
Other notable vegetation is a leafless shrub called talai (alae africana) and koddanai (oleander).
Jaffna features a tropical savanna climate with a dry season between February and August, and a wet season between September and January
Jaffna has the highest average temperature in Sri Lanka of 83 °F (28 °C)
The temperature is highest in the months of April – May and August – September
The temperature is coolest in December – January
The annual rainfall is brought in by the North East monsoon and it varies from one place to the other and also from year to year

The Jaffna Municipal Council governs the City of Jaffna
It was established under the Municipalities Ordinance Act of 1865
Although other cities such as Kandy, Galle and Colombo had elected municipal councils soon after the 1865 ordinance, Jaffna did not have an elected municipal council for many years
This reflected the desire of the British bureaucrats to govern the city directly rather than share power with a highly literate electorate
The first elected mayor was Cathiravelu Ponnambalam
Number of subsequent mayors were assassinated such as Alfred Duraiappah, Sarojini Yogeswaran and Pon Sivapalan
There were 15 years without elections after 1983.
The post civil war elections were held in 2009 after a gap of 11 years
The municipal council consists of 29 members
As the original municipal council building was destroyed during the civil war, a new building is to be constructed for the current municipal council in 2011.
Historically residents of Jaffna city were Tamils, Moors (Muslims), Europeans and Eurasian Burghers
Over time the composition changed with Tamils and Moors predominating and Europeans and Burghers either assimilating or moving away
Europeans and the natives lived in separate sections of the city
Most houses were modest in size and the streets were kept clean
After the 1900s the population increased and Sinhalese from the south also settled in Jaffna
Prior to the civil war there were Moors, Sinhalese, Indian Tamils and other ethnic groups living in Jaffna.
During colonial times Jaffna was Ceylon's (Sri Lanka) second largest city
Post-independence the city was overtaken by the growth of settlements near Colombo
But even in 1981 Jaffna was the largest city outside the Greater Colombo area
The population of Jaffna, like the rest of the North and East, has been heavily affected by the civil war
Many of its Tamil residents have emigrated to the West or moved to the relative safety of Colombo
The city's small Moor and Sinhalese population have either been forcibly expelled or fled
As a consequence the city's population is significantly lower than it was 30 years ago
Many of the city's residents who left during the civil war have settled down elsewhere and are unlikely to return
There have been reports, particularly after the end of the civil war in 2009, about resettling those residents who wish to return to Jaffna but there hasn't been any substantive effort to do so yet.

Jaffna city was founded as a trading town by European merchants
Although a historic port used by the native Jaffna kingdom was already in existence when the Portuguese arrived, it was the European mercantile activity that made it prominent
In colonial times, production of clothes, items of gold and silver, processing of tobacco, rice and other related activities formed an important part of the economic activities
In modern times, the port was its principal source of revenue but it has declined drastically
Currently it survives as a fishing port
The city had a wide range of industries, including food processing, packaging, making of household items, and salt processing, but most ceased after 1995
Since then, most industrialists, entrepreneurs, and business people have relocated to the rest of Sri Lanka and abroad
After 2009, foreign governments within the EU, US, India, and investors from the south of the island and the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora have shown an interest in making investments in Jaffna district in general and Jaffna city in particular
Shopping malls such as the Cargills Square and hotels such as Jetwing Jaffna, Tilko Jaffna City Hotel have been built boosting the tourism industry in the city.

These early journals were followed by number popular newspapers in Tamil such as Eelakesari and Eelanadu
Jaffna was also the seen the publication of journals committed to the growth of modernistic and socially purposive literature such as Bharati and Marumalarchi in 1946
Now defunct English weekly Saturday Review was an influential news magazine that came out of Jaffna.
During the civil war many publishers, authors and journalists were assassinated or arrested and the media heavily censored
Since the 2000s Jaffna is served by newspapers such as Uthayan, Yarl Thinakkural and Valampurii.
Most historic buildings such as Temples, Saraswathy Mahal library and palaces in the royal city of Nallur and the rest of Jaffna peninsula were destroyed by the Portuguese colonials
Materials from destroyed buildings were used in the construction of the Jaffna fort and other fortifications
