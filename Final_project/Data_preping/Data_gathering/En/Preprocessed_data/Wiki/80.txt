The name also occurs on copper plates issued by Sethupathi kings of the same era

A king supposedly Ukkirasinghan was visited by the blind Panan musician who was an expert in vocal music and one skilled in the use of instrument called Yal
The king who was delighted to the music played with the Yal by the Panan presented him a sandy plain
The Panan returned to India and introduced some members of his tribe as impecunious as himself to accompany to this land of promise and it is surmised that their place of settlement was that part of the city which is known at present as Passaiyoor and Gurunagar
The Columbuthurai Commercial Harbor situated at Colombuthurai and the harbor known as ‘Aluppanthy’ situated previously at the Gurunagar area seem as its evidences
