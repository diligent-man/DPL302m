the king who was delighted to the music played with the yal by the panan presented him a sandy plain
the panan returned to india and introduced some members of his tribe as impecunious as himself to accompany to this land of promise and it is surmised that their place of settlement was that part of the city which is known at present as passaiyoor and gurunagar
the columbuthurai commercial harbor situated at colombuthurai and the harbor known as aluppanthy situated previously at the gurunagar area seem as its evidences

during the medieval times the kingdom of aryacakravarti came into existence in the th century as an ally to the pandyan empire in south india
when the pandyan empire became weak due to muslim invasions successive aryacakravarti rulers made the jaffna kingdom independent and a regional power to reckon with in sri lanka
nallur a suburb of jaffna served as the capital of the kingdom
politically it was an expanding power in the th and th century with all regional kingdoms paying tribute to it
however it met with simultaneous confrontations with the vijayanagar empire that ruled from vijayanagara southern india and a rebounding kotte kingdom from the southern sri lanka
