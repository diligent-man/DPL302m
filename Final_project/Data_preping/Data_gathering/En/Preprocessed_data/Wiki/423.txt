Rutgers–Newark is one of three regional campuses of Rutgers University, New Jersey's State University
It is located in Newark
 Rutgers, founded in 1766 in New Brunswick, is the eighth oldest college in the United States and a member of the Association of American Universities
 In 1945, the state legislature voted to make Rutgers University, then a private liberal arts college, into the state university and the following year merged the school with the former University of Newark (1936–1946), which became the Rutgers–Newark campus
 Rutgers also incorporated the College of South Jersey and South Jersey Law School, in Camden, as a constituent campus of the university and renamed it Rutgers–Camden in 1950.
Rutgers–Newark offers undergraduate (bachelors) and graduate (masters, doctoral) programs to more than 12,000 students

News & World Report, Rutgers–Newark is the most diverse national university in the United States.
Rutgers–Newark officially came into existence in 1946, when the New Jersey State Legislature voted to make the University of Newark part of Rutgers University
The roots of Rutgers University, Newark, however, date back to 1908 when the New Jersey Law School first opened its doors
That law school, along with four other educational institutions in Newark — Dana College, the Newark Institute of Arts & Sciences, the Seth Boyden School of Business, and the Mercer Beasley School of Law — formed a series of alliances over the years
A final merger in 1936 resulted in the establishment of the University of Newark
A decade later, the University of Newark was absorbed into Rutgers University and became the school's Newark campus.
As a constituent unit of Rutgers University, ultimate authority for Rutgers–Newark rests with the central administration of the university, including its president and governing boards.

McCormick changed the title of the chief executive to chancellor.
