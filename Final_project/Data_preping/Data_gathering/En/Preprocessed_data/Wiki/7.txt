Six years later the United States' first streetcars powered only by electricity began operating in the city
David Spencer a local Baptist minister later proclaimed Scranton as the Electric City
The city's industrial production and population peaked in the s and s fueled by demand for coal and textiles especially during World War II
But while the national economy boomed after the war demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular which also harmed the rail industry
Foreseeing the decline city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in to diversify the local economy beyond coal but the city's economy continued to decline

More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late th and early th centuries after the American Revolutionary War as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter
They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow
People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania
Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the Pennamite Wars where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states
This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence
Though anthracite coal was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were iron and steel
Scranton who had worked at Oxford Furnace in Oxford New Jersey founded what became Lackawanna Iron Coal later developing as the Lackawanna Steel Company
It initially started producing iron nails but that venture failed due to low-quality iron
The Erie Railroad's construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England
The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing T-rails for the Erie the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads
In the Scrantons built the Lackawanna and Western Railroad LW northward with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor to meet the Erie Railroad in Great Bend Pennsylvania
Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest
They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations and to market it to businesses
In they expanded the railroad eastward as the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad DLW in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market
This railroad with its hub in Scranton was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years

Twelve years later in the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed as did Luzerne's
The law appeared to enable the creation of Lackawanna County and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process
Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly formed county which was also established as a separate judicial district with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October
This was the last county in the state to be organized

Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs
