scranton was incorporated on february as a borough in luzerne county and as a city on april
it became a major industrial city and a center of mining and railroads it attracted thousands of new immigrants
it was the site of the scranton general strike in
people in northern luzerne county sought a new county in but the wilkes barre area resisted losing its assets
lackawanna county did not gain independent status until
under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory voters favored the new county by a proportion of to with scranton residents providing the major support
the city was designated as the county seat when lackawanna county was established in and a judicial district was authorized in july
the city s nickname electric city began when electric lights were introduced in at the dickson manufacturing company
six years later the united states first streetcars powered only by electricity began operating in the city
david spencer a local baptist minister later proclaimed scranton as the electric city
the city s industrial production and population peaked in the s and s fueled by demand for coal and textiles especially during world war ii
but while the national economy boomed after the war demand for the region s coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular which also harmed the rail industry
foreseeing the decline city leaders formulated the scranton plan in to diversify the local economy beyond coal but the city s economy continued to decline
the knox mine disaster of essentially ended coal mining in the region
scranton s population dropped from its peak of in the census to in the census
the city now has large health care academic and manufacturing sectors
scranton is miles km north of allentown miles km north northwest of philadelphia and miles km west of new york city
present day scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native lenape tribe from whose language lackawanna or lac a wa na meaning stream that forks is derived
in isaac tripp the area s first known white settler built his home here it still stands in north scranton formerly a separate town known as providence
more settlers from connecticut came to the area in the late th and early th centuries after the american revolutionary war as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter
they gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as slocum hollow
people in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their new england settlers which were somewhat different from most of pennsylvania
some area settlers from connecticut participated in what was known as the pennamite wars where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states
this claim between connecticut and pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence
though anthracite coal was being mined in carbondale to the north and wilkes barre to the south the industries that precipitated the city s early rapid growth were iron and steel
in the s brothers selden t
and george w
scranton who had worked at oxford furnace in oxford new jersey founded what became lackawanna iron coal later developing as the lackawanna steel company
it initially started producing iron nails but that venture failed due to low quality iron
the erie railroad s construction in new york state was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from england
the scrantons firm decided to switch its focus to producing t rails for the erie the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads
in the scrantons built the lackawanna and western railroad l w northward with recent irish immigrants supplying most of the labor to meet the erie railroad in great bend pennsylvania
thus they could transport manufactured rails from the lackawanna valley to new york and the midwest
they also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations and to market it to businesses
in they expanded the railroad eastward as the delaware lackawanna and western railroad dl w in order to tap into the new york city metropolitan market
this railroad with its hub in scranton was scranton s largest employer for almost one hundred years
the pennsylvania coal company built a gravity railroad in the s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal
the gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in by the erie and wyoming valley railroad later absorbed by the erie railroad
the delaware and hudson d h canal company which had its own gravity railroad from carbondale to honesdale built a steam railroad that entered scranton in
during this short period of time the city rapidly transformed from a small agrarian based village of people with new england roots to a multicultural industrial based city
from to the city s population increased more than tenfold
most new immigrants such as the irish italians jewish and south germans and polish were catholic a contrast to the majority protestant early settlers of colonial descent
national ethnic religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations with many new immigrants joining the democratic party and for a time in the late s the greenbacker labor party
in the borough of scranton was officially incorporated
it was incorporated as a city of in in luzerne county when the surrounding boroughs of hyde park now part of the city s west side and providence now part of north scranton were merged with scranton
twelve years later in the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county s population surpassed as did luzerne s
the law appeared to enable the creation of lackawanna county and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process
scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly formed county which was also established as a separate judicial district with state judges moving over from luzerne county after courts were organized in october
this was the last county in the state to be organized
creation of the new county which enabled both more local control and political patronage helped begin the scranton general strike of
this was in part due to the larger great railroad strike in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in martinsburg west virginia
the national economy had lagged since the panic of and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work
in scranton mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job as did others
a protest of strikers ended in violence with a total of four men killed and to injured including the mayor
he had established a militia but called for help from the governor and state militia
governor john hartranft eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike
the workers gained nothing in wages but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power
the nation s first successful continuously operating electrified streetcar trolley system was established in the city in inspiring the nickname the electric city
in the city s various streetcar companies were consolidated into the scranton railway company which ran trolleys until
by three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city including the erie railroad the central railroad of new jersey and finally the new york ontario and western railway nyo w
as the vast rail network spread above ground an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground
miners who in the early years were typically welsh and irish were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons
the workers endured low pay long hours and unsafe working conditions
children as young as eight or nine worked hour days separating slate from coal in the breakers
often the workers were forced to use company provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies
with hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions
later miners came from italy and eastern europe which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs
business was booming at the end of the th century
the tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year as did the steel manufactured by the lackawanna steel company
at one point the company had the largest steel plant in the united states and it was still the second largest producer at the turn of the th century
by the city had a population of more than
in the late s scranton was home to a series of early international league baseball teams
given its industrial basis scranton has had a notable labor history various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal mining era to improve working conditions raise wages and guarantee fair treatment for workers
the panic of and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business
as the economy contracted the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes while sometimes reserving raises for their top management
a major strike of railroad workers in august part of the great railroad strike attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well and developed as the scranton general strike
four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike after the mayor mustered a militia
with violence suppressed by militia and federal troops workers finally returned to their jobs not able to gain any economic relief
william walker scranton from the prominent family was then general manager of lackawanna iron and coal
he later founded scranton steel company
the labor issues and growth of industry in scranton contributed to lackawanna county being established by the state legislature in with territory taken from luzerne county
scranton was designated as the county seat
this strengthened its local government
the unions failed to gain higher wages that year but in they elected labor leader terence v
powderly of the knights of labor as mayor of scranton
after that he became national leader of the kol a predominately catholic organization that had a peak membership of circa
while the catholic church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid th century by the late s with the influence of archbishop james gibbons of baltimore maryland it supported the knights of labor as representing workingmen and union organizing
the landmark coal strike of was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the united mine workers under john mitchell
the strike was settled by a compromise brokered by president theodore roosevelt
a statue of john mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the lackawanna county courthouse in scranton the site of the coal strike of negotiations in which president roosevelt participated
because of the significance of these negotiations the statue and the courthouse were added to the national register of historic places in
john mitchell is buried in cathedral cemetery in scranton
by the united states census of the population of scranton was about making it the third largest city in pennsylvania and th largest u s
at the turn of the th century wealthy businessmen and industrialists built impressive victorian mansions in the hill and green ridge sections of the city
most were descended from colonists and belonged to the republican party
the industrial workers who tended to be later immigrants from ireland and southern and eastern europe were predominately catholic
with a flood of immigrants in the market they suffered poor working conditions and wages
in the dwindling local iron ore supply labor issues and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded
the lackawanna steel company and many of its workers were moved to lackawanna new york developed on lake erie just south of buffalo
with a port on the lake the company could receive iron ore shipped from the mesabi range in minnesota which was being newly mined
scranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry
attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by italian and eastern european immigrants who brought their foods cultures and religions
many of the immigrants joined the democratic party
their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city
several catholic and orthodox churches were founded and built during this period
a substantial jewish community was also established with most members coming from the russian empire and eastern europe
working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as john mitchell who led the united mine workers
the sub surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods however damaging homes schools and businesses when the land collapsed
in the state passed the davis act to establish the bureau of surface support in scranton
because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies citizens organized the scranton surface protection association chartered by the court of common pleas on november to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the city of scranton and the streets of said city from injury loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves
in and the city and commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases
north main avenue and boulevard avenue both entitled to surface support caved in as a result of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations
the case of penman v
jones came out differently
the lackawanna iron coal co
had leased coal lands to the lackawanna iron steel co an allied interest which passed the leases on to the scranton coal co
areas of central scranton the hill section south side pine brook green ridge and hyde park were affected by their mining activities
penman was the private property owner in the case
the coal operators were defeated in this case
the public transportation system began to expand beyond the trolley lines pioneered by predecessors of the scranton railways system
the lackawanna and wyoming valley railroad commonly referred to as the laurel line was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to wilkes barre
its scranton station offices powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the lackawanna steel company and operations started in
beginning in scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of clarks summit and dalton
they could travel to lake winola and montrose using the northern electric railroad
after the s no new trolley lines were built but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs
in scranton railways was re incorporated as the scranton transit company reflecting that shift in transportation modes
starting in the early s the scranton button company founded in and a major maker of shellac buttons became one of the primary makers of phonograph records
they pressed records for emerson whom they bought in as well as regal cameo romeo banner domino conqueror
in july the company merged with regal cameo banner and the u s
branch of path makers of path and perfect to become the american record corporation
by the scranton company was also pressing records for brunswick melotone and vocalion
in the company was acquired by capitol records which continued to produce phonograph records through the end of the vinyl era
by the mid s the city population had swelled beyond due to growth in the mining and silk textile industries
world war ii created a great demand for energy which led to the highest production from mining in the area since world war i
after world war ii coal lost favor to oil and natural gas as a heating fuel largely because the latter types were more convenient to use
while some u s
cities prospered in the post war boom the fortunes and population of scranton and the rest of lackawanna and luzerne counties began to diminish
coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the s causing a loss of jobs
in worthington scranton and his wife marion margery scranton contributed one million dollars to establish the scranton foundation now the scranton area community foundation which was launched to support charitable and educational organizations in the city of scranton
the knox mine disaster of january virtually ended the mining industry in northeastern pennsylvania
the waters of the susquehanna river flooded the mines
the dl w railroad nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of hurricane diane merged in with the erie railroad
demand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles
in the laurel line ceased passenger service
the scranton transit company whose trolleys had given the city its nickname transferred all operations to buses as the holiday season approached by the end of it ceased all operations
the city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the lackawanna county government formed colts which began operations in late with s era gm busses from new jersey
scranton had been the hub of its operations until the erie lackawanna merger after which it no longer served in this capacity
this was another severe blow to the local labor market
the nyo w railroad which depended heavily on its scranton branch for freight traffic was abandoned in
mine subsidence was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail cave ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes
the area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures strip mines and massive culm dumps some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts
in the secretary of mines for pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath scranton that it would be more economical to abandon the city than make them safe
in the last mine operations in lackawanna county which were in what is now mcdade park and another on the scranton dickson city line were closed
