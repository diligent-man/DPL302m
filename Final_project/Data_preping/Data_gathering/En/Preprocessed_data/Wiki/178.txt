On July he demanded the recall of Necker whose dismissal by the king had aroused great excitement in Paris
In the Constituent Assembly he moved the abolition of the death penalty of the galleys and of branding and the substitution of beheading for hanging

While in the Convention Le Peletier focused mainly on revolutionary reform of education promoting a Spartan education
It called for both males and females to be taught in state-run schools and taught revolutionary ideas instead of the customary history science mathematics language and religion
His educational plan was supported by Robespierre and his ideas were borrowed in later schemes notably by Jules Ferry
On January the eve of the king's execution Le Peletier was assassinated in a restaurant in the Palais Royal
His murderer Philippe Nicolas Marie de Pris a member of the Garde du Corps entered the restaurant approached Le Peletier and said You voted for the King's death Monsieur Le Peletier Le Peletier replied saying I voted according to my conscience
What has that to do with you Pris proceeded to plunge a saber that he had hidden under his cloak into Le Peletier's chest

Pris fled to Normandy where on the point of being discovered he supposedly shot himself in the head
Other sources claim the real murderer fled to England where he died years later

The painter Jacques-Louis David represented his death in a famous painting Les Derniers moments de Michel Lepeletier or Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau sur son lit de mort
David described his painting of Le Peletier's face as Serene that is because when one dies for one's country one has nothing with which to reproach oneself This painting known only through a drawing made by a pupil of David is considered by scholars the first official painting of the French Revolution a rehearsal for David's later achievement The Death of Marat
