sam kydd inmatemany of the same team had just made jazz boat
the monthly film bulletin noted a sequel to jazz boat with the same leading characters and production team in the nick is cast very much in the same mould easy going mixture of farce and fantasy loose and ingenuous scripting excellent if bizarre team playing
james booth stands out for his genuinely observed portrait of spider bernie winters appears to be one of those rare comedians who can keep his moronic style of clowning free from offensiveness and niall macginnis governor harry andrews chief officer and ian hendry rival mobsters all catch the eye
anthony newley is rather at sea as a psychiatrist but plays with a likable modesty and warmth and an improved anne aubrey discretely burlesques jayne mansfield
there is much in this film that is conventionally weak and structurally uneven yet it gets closer to contemporary feeling than numerous more ambitious comedies
the dialogue particularly strikes an authentic note and ken hughes debt to frank norman who wrote the original story seems considerable while tv guide noted though there are some genuinely funny moments in the film newley is miscast as the compassionate psychologist
though relatively straightforward for its first half the plot becomes convoluted and the motivations are twisted in the second half
