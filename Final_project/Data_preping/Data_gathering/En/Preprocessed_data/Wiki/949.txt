The golden age of Jewish culture in Spain which coincided with the Middle Ages in Europe was a period of Muslim rule during which intermittently Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious cultural and economic life flourished
The nature and length of this Golden Age has been debated as there were at least three periods during which non Muslims were oppressed A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as the Muslim conquest of Iberia Others date it from during the rule of Abd al Rahman III The end of the age is variously given as when the Caliphate of C rdoba ended the date of the Granada massacre when the Almoravids invaded or the mid th century when the Almohads invaded
Having invaded southern Spain and coming to rule in a matter of seven years Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic rule of a non Islamic society The coexistence of Muslims Jews and Christians during this time is revered by many writers Al Andalus was a key center of Jewish life during the early Middle Ages As Sefarad al Andalus was the capital of world Judaism
Mar a Rosa Menocal a specialist in Iberian literature at Yale University claims that tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society Menocal's book The Ornament of the World argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the Caliphate were allowed fewer rights than Muslims but were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to al Andalus where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe they were not just tolerated but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytisation and sometimes on synagogue construction
Bernard Lewis takes issue with this view calling it ahistorical and exaggerated He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality or even pretend that it did and argues that it would have been both a theological as well as a logical absurdity However he also states
Mark R Cohen Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University in his Under Crescent and Cross calls the idealized interfaith utopia a myth that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as Heinrich Graetz in the th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews This myth was met with the counter myth of the neo lachrymose conception of Jewish Arab history by Bat Ye'or and others which also cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality
Prior to the Jewish population of Spain was tolerated by its Arian Visigoth rulers and placed on equal footing with the other ethnic and religious communities of the region The Arians may have preferred the Jewish population to the Catholic one as they did not fear political enmity from the Jews The Visigoths were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper After the Visigoths joined the Catholic Church they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population and later persecuted them severely It is possible that Jews welcomed the Muslim Arab and mainly Berber conquerors in the th century
A period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula Their number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest Immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population and made Muslim Spain probably the largest centre of contemporary Jews Especially after during the reign of Abd al Rahman III and his son Al Hakam II the Jews prospered culturally and some notable figures held high posts in the Caliphate of C rdoba Jewish philosophers mathematicians astronomers poets and rabbinical scholars composed highly rich cultural and scientific work Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy composing many of the most valuable texts of Jewish philosophy Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim Al Andalus Jewish economic expansion was unparallelled In Toledo after the Christian reconquest in Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so called Toledo School of Translators as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts to Arabic Jews also contributed to botany geography medicine mathematics poetry and philosophy
'Abd al Rahman's court physician and minister was Hasdai ibn Shaprut the patron of Menahem ben Saruq Dunash ben Labrat and other Jewish scholars and poets In following centuries Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as Samuel Ha Nagid Moses ibn Ezra Solomon ibn Gabirol and Judah Halevi During 'Abd al Rahman's term of power the scholar Moses ben Hanoch was appointed rabbi of C rdoba and as a consequence al Andalus became the center of Talmudic study and C rdoba the meeting place of Jewish savants
It was a time of partial Jewish autonomy As dhimmis protected non Muslims Jews in the Islamic world paid the jizya which was administered separately from the zakat paid by Muslims The jizya has been viewed variously as a head tax as payment for non conscription in the military as non Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training or as a tribute Jews had their own legal system and social services monotheist religions of the People of the Book were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith such as bells and processions were discouraged
Comparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe the Jews were far more integrated in the political and economic life of Islamic society and usually faced far less violence from Muslims but there were some instances of persecution in the Islamic world as well from the th century The Islamic world classified Jews and Christians as dhimmis and allowed Jews to practice their religion more freely than they could in Christian Europe
Other authors criticize the modern notion of Al Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a myth Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics and the relationship between the groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility In the Granada massacre of much of the Jewish population of the city the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogromes in the Rhineland slightly later The notable Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides was forced to flee from Al Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads In Letter to Yemen Maimonides wrote
With the death of Al Hakam II in the caliphate began to dissolve and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms The first major persecution was the Granada massacre which occurred on December in which a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada crucified the Jewish Vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city According to one source more than Jewish families numbering persons fell in one day It was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule
Beginning in the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the Almoravids a puritan Muslim sect from Morocco Even under the Almoravids some Jews prospered although far more so under Ali III than under his father Yusuf ibn Tashfin Among those who held the title of vizier or nasi in Almoravid times were the poet and physician Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al Mu'allam Abraham ibn Me r ibn Kamnial Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar and Solomon ibn Farusal The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in but the region was again invaded this time by the even more puritanical Almohads
During the reign of the Berber dynasties many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim controlled portion of Iberia for the city of Toledo which had been reconquered in by Christian forces
The major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the Alhambra Decree of and a similar decree by Portugal in
