A duck named Ferdinand who crows as roosters are said to every morning to wake people so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten persuades Babe to help him destroy the alarm clock that threatens his mission Despite succeeding in this they wake Duchess the Hoggetts' cat and in the confusion accidentally destroy the living room At the barn meeting Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand and the house Sometime later when Fly's puppies are put up for sale Babe asks if he can call her his mother

One morning Babe finds a trio of feral dogs attacking the sheep Although he manages to scare them off Maa is mortally injured and dies as a result Hoggett arrives and thinking that Babe killed her prepares to shoot him Fly is so anxious to find out whether he is guilty or innocent that instead of barking orders at the sheep she talks to them to find out what happened Learning the truth she barks to distract Hoggett delaying him until Esme informs him about the dogs' attacks on neighboring farms she learned from the authorities and asks him why he has taken his shotgun out
When Esme leaves on a trip Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheepherding competition As it is raining the night before Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house However Duchess scratches him when he tries to speak to her so Hoggett immediately confines her outside When she is let back in later she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans eat pigs Horrified he runs out to the barn and learns from Fly that this is true The next morning Fly discovers that Babe has run away She and Rex alert Hoggett and they all search for him Rex finds him in a cemetery and Hoggett brings him home However he is still demoralized and refuses to eat Hoggett gives him a drink from a baby bottle sings to him If I Had Words and dances a jig for him This restores Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection and he begins eating again
At the competition Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding but they ignore his attempts to speak to them As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do They give him a secret password first extracting a promise that he will treat them better from now on He returns in time to convey the password to Babe and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly Amid the crowd's acclamation he is unanimously given the highest score While he sits down next to the farmer Hoggett praises him with the standard command to sheep dogs that their job is done That'll do Pig That'll do

Babe is an adaptation of Dick King Smith's novel The Sheep Pig also known as Babe The Gallant Pig in the US which tells the story of a pig raised as livestock who wants to do the work of a sheepdog The main animal characters are played by a combination of real and animatronic pigs and Border Collies The breed of pig used was a Large White which grows rapidly On account of this piglets of the required size were used during the course of the filming as well as the animatronic model for special effects
The film is divided into six chapters to preserve the storybook like feel of the original novel although none of the film's chapters are the same as the book's The film's mice characters were subsequently added to read the chapters aloud after a test screening in which producer George Miller noted that younger audiences had trouble reading them needing help from the adults
After seven years of development Babe was filmed in Robertson New South Wales Australia The talking animal visual effects were done by Rhythm Hues Studios and Jim Henson's Creature Shop The film was both a box office and critical success grossing million worldwide and earning seven Oscar nominations including a win for Best Visual Effects
According to actor James Cromwell there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan Noonan later complained I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for Babe tried to exclude me from any credit and it made me very insecure It was like your guru has told you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting
Miller shot back Chris said something that is defamatory that I took his name off the credits on internet sites which is just absolutely untrue You know I'm sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my life than worry about that when it comes to Babe the vision was handed to Chris on a plate
In a sequel directed by Miller Babe Pig in the City was released In a video game of the same name based on the film was published by Mastertronic for the PlayStation
The musical score for Babe was composed by Nigel Westlake and performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Classical orchestral music by th century French composers is used throughout the film but is disguised in a variety of ways and often integrated by Westlake into his score The theme song If I Had Words lyrics by Jonathan Hodge sung by Hoggett near the film's conclusion is an adaptation of the Maestoso final movement of the Organ Symphony by Camille Saint Sa ns and was originally performed in by Scott Fitzgerald and Yvonne Keeley This tune also recurs throughout the film's score

Because of its subject being a piglet Babe was initially banned from Malaysia in order to avoid upsetting or annoying Muslims who view pigs as haram The ruling was overturned almost a year later and the film was released direct to video
When Babe was released in the US it is reported that activists around the country staked out movie theatres with flyers documenting the real life abuses of pigs The film had a marked effect on the growth of vegetarianism particularly among the young It also promoted a more sympathetic view of the intellectual emotional and social capacities of animals James Cromwell became an ethical vegan as a result of starring as Farmer Hoggett saying I decided that to be able to talk about this movie with conviction I needed to become a vegetarian In he went on to organize a vegetarian dinner for the Los Angeles homeless at a Compassionate Christmas event in order to reverse the barnyard view that Christmas is carnage
