pandurang vasudeo sukhatme was an indian statistician
he is known for his pioneering work of applying random sampling methods in agricultural statistics and in biometry in the s
he was also influential in the establishment of the indian agricultural statistics research institute
as a part of his work at the food and agriculture organization in rome he developed statistical models for assessing the dimensions of hunger and future food supplies for the world
he also developed methods for measuring the size and nature of the protein gap
his other major contributions included applying statistical techniques to the study of human nutrition
one of his ideas the sukhatme margen hypothesis suggested that at low calorie intake levels stored energy in the body is used with greater metabolic efficiency and that the metabolic efficiency decreases as the intake increases above the homeostatic range
this involved paying attention to intra individual variability that was found to be more than the inter individual variability in protein or calorie intake
he gave a genetic interpretation of the intra individual variation jointly with p
narain
he was awarded the padma bhushan by the government of india in
sukhatme was born in a deshastha brahmin family on july in village budh district satara in the state of maharashtra in india
he graduated in from fergusson college with mathematics as principal subject and physics as subsidiary subject
from to he studied at university college london where he was awarded a ph d
in and a d sc
in for his work on bi partitional functions
with j
neyman and e
pearson he made significant contributions in the statistical theory of sampling which was instrumental in his subsequent research in sampling theory of survey and improvement of agricultural statistics in india
