civil law notaries or latin notaries are lawyers of noncontentious private civil law who draft take and record legal instruments for private parties provide legal advice and give attendance in person and are vested as public officers with the authentication power of the state
as opposed to most notaries public their common law counterparts civil law notaries are highly trained licensed practitioners providing a full range of regulated legal services and whereas they hold a public office they nonetheless operate usually but not always in private practice and are paid on a fee for service basis
they often receive generally the same education as attorneys at civil law with further specialized education but without qualifications in advocacy procedural law or the law of evidence somewhat comparable to solicitor training in certain common law countries
civil law notaries are limited to areas of private law that is domestic law which regulates the relationships between individuals and in which the state is not directly concerned
the most common areas of practice for civil law notaries are in residential and commercial conveyancing and registration contract drafting company formation successions and estate planning and powers of attorney
ordinarily they have no authority to appear in court on their client s behalf their role is limited to drafting authenticating and registering certain types of transactional or legal instruments
in some countries such as the netherlands france italy or qu bec canada among others they also retain and keep a minute copy of their instruments in the form of memoranda in notarial protocols or archives
notaries generally hold undergraduate degrees in civil law and graduate degrees in notarial law
notarial law involves expertise in a broad spectrum of private law including family law estate and testamentary law conveyancing and property law the law of agency and contract and company law
student notaries must complete a long apprenticeship or articled clerkship as a trainee notary and usually spend some years as a junior associate in a notarial firm before working as a partner or opening a private practice
any such practice is usually tightly regulated and most countries parcel out areas into notarial districts with a set number of notary positions
this has the effect of making notarial appointments very limited
as a lawyer a civil law notary draws up and executes legal instruments called notarial instruments fr acte notari sp instrumento notarial it atto notarile du notari le akte ger notarielle urkunde notariatsurkunde
to be valid a notarial instrument must be signed contemporaneously uno contextu by the appearer s parties to the instrument sometimes in the presence of attesting witnesses before the notary who also signs and officiates the signing ceremony
notarial instruments if prima facie duly executed are
presumed valid and regular
self authenticating
probative i e proof of their contents
public
self executing and
have a data certa i e a fixed unalterable effective date traditionally notarial instruments trigger a pr sumptio veritatis et solemnitatis entailing two consequences regularity and probativity
first being an official act a presumption of regularity attaches to the instrument meaning all prescribed formalities have been carried out including the reading over of the instrument
second a notarial instrument is self authenticating and probative i e it constitutes full proof of the agreement it contains as against the parties their heirs and successors
it also means the notary s firsthand ex propriis sensibus narrations of fact are conclusively presumed true and correct whereas secondhand narrations appearers representations are merely assertio notarii which are rebuttably presumed valid
while all notarial instruments are official documents they are not all necessarily public most instruments are in public form meaning an original is retained in publica custodia by the notary in his or her protocol or recorded with a public registry but some are in private form that is a single original is issued directly to the appearer s
in either case the appearer always walks away with an instrument that is self executing that is it requires no further implementing action to be effective and enforceable just like a court order
finally notarial instruments have a fixed effective or signature date data certa that cannot be ante or postdated or left blank and filled in after signing
notarial instruments cannot be altered or overridden by prior or subsequent instruments under hand e g simple contracts
in other words for example a notarial will could not be amended or superseded by a non notarial codicil or will
they also estop preclude an appearer as contract denier from raising most affirmative defenses as to enforceability including non est factum the contents do not correctly express the appearers intentions and defenses against formation e g ultra vires lack of capacity improper execution etc
one thing that distinguishes a civil law notary s instruments from those of a common lawyer is the fact that under common law legal systems drafts and non identical copies are considered separate documents while under civil law public documents may be proved by secondary evidence
an unexecuted minute is deemed firsthand proof of an instrument and considered the original whereas the engrossment is not
the minute is therefore the authenticum or original instrument of writing as distinguished from the self executing copy or instrumentum
a notarial instrument s valid portions are open to direct rebuttal but the conclusive portions can in some jurisdictions only be rebutted by an action of improbation fr inscription de faux it querela di falso germ f lschungsklage in which a challenger must bring a collateral attack against the instrument proving a willful material error by strong clear and positively convincing proof rather than the ordinary preponderance of evidence standard in civil actions
legally a successful challenge must overcome the praesumptio iustae causa which attaches to a notarial instrument the result of which is that said instrument is presumed to have been made or formed with a iusta causa that is sufficient legal consideration causa
this presumption stems from the fact that a notary is expected to verify the facts assertions or events mentioned in his act thereby assuming liability for and giving warrant to its contents
a successfully improbated instrument is null and set aside
nowadays a public form instrument is prepared first as an unexecuted original called a minute fr minute it minuta sp matriz du minuut ger urschrift
the minute is archived in the draftsman notary s protocol fr protocole it protocollo sp protocolo ger urkundenrolle
the instrument s particulars appearer fees subject matter witnesses date and so forth are noted or minuted in a register or logbook
from the minute the notary extends a fully engrossed execution copy known as an engrossment fr du grosse it rogito sp testimonio copia autorizada ger ausfertigung which is self executing since it contains not only the material terms but also solemn and statutory notarial wording and in some jurisdictions enacting clauses like those found on court orders
it is also the only copy that has fresh signatures and seals on it
the engrossed copy is issued directly to the appearer s
however appearers are generally only entitled to one engrossment so any other copy issued thereafter is a notarial exemplified copy which does not contain the appearers fresh signatures and lacks the formalities of the engrossment exemplified copies fr exp dition it copia conforme sp copia certificada copia simple du uitgift authentiek afschrift ger beglaubigte abschrift are therefore only for reference purposes
certain types of instruments are passed in private form that is only one copy the original is made and issued to the appearer while the draftsman notary does not retain a copy
private form instruments are usually unilateral have short term legal effect and do not benefit third parties such as certificates of good standing powers of attorney certificates of dishonor statutory declarations verifications of fact rent and pay receipts and pension and annuity arrears documents
additionally some jurisdictions especially those influenced by the austrian civil code divide notarial instruments into three types
operative aust notariatsakt du partij akte sp escritura p blica memorializes and effects irrevocable legal business includes all transactional and governing instruments
declaratory aust notariatsprotokoll du proces verbaal akte sp acta notarial records or notifies legal actions facts or rights includes statutory declarations company minutes and registry memorials
certificatory germ notarielle beglaubigung du notari le waarmerking sp certificaci n notarial attests personal status details includes life certificates certificates of good standing copy certifications signature attestations save for louisiana puerto rico and quebec a civil law notary should not be confused with a notary public in the united states and canada who has none of the legal powers notaries enjoy at civil law
rather notaries public only have the power to administer oaths take affidavits declarations or depositions from witnesses acknowledge and attest signatures and certify copies usually in conjunction with some legal process
the same does not apply to notaries public in the united kingdom australia new zealand and many other common law countries
there the notary public is a lawyer and often holds a secondary legal qualification such as solicitor or barrister
the aspiring notary public usually has to take additional exams or undertake post graduate study to become a notary public
in louisiana puerto rico and quebec private law is traditionally based on the french and spanish civil codes giving notaries greater legal powers including the right to prepare wills conveyances and generally all contracts and instruments in writing
for this reason immigrants from civil law countries where civil law notaries exist particularly those from latin america are often confused by the office of notary public and have been defrauded by dishonest notaries misrepresenting themselves as having legal powers
thus in some states there have been ongoing efforts to prohibit notaries public from listing themselves as notario p blico
such a law has existed for more than fifteen years in california
similar laws now exist in colorado florida georgia illinois tennessee and texas
florida and alabama have enacted statutes and regulations based on the model civil law notary act allowing for the appointment of florida or alabama attorneys as civil law notaries with the power to authenticate documents facts and transactions
this is not the same as a notary public appointment
attorneys with a minimum of years of bar membership are appointed after specialized training and state examination
acts of florida and alabama civil law notaries are given both domestic and international effect under their enabling statutes
notaries in italy are independent public officials paid on a fee for service or should they not earn enough money by the national notarial trust cassa del notariato a public body funded by the notaries themselves which also manages their pensions upon retirement
in order to become a notary in italy an applicant must win a public examination open to all italian citizens who
are in possession of their full citizenship rights and have not been convicted of any criminal charges
have successfully completed a university degree in law laurea magistrale in giurisprudenza
have successfully completed an months period of training with a qualified notary a notary who has served as such for more than years
have less than years of age
did not fail previous attempts at the notary public examination the public examination is composed of two parts a written test and an oral examination
the written test consists of the redaction of three full notarial acts atto notarile the explanation of the choices made in those acts spiegazione and a theoretical part about the topics covered in the exam parte teorica
the three tests are about the three most important areas of expertise of a notary a testament mortis causa a contract inter vivos and act involving legal persons diritto commerciale
if a candidate achieves a sufficient score in the written test he or she are then admitted to the oral examination where other subjects such as fiscal laws are introduced
a national score is published afterwards and notaries are assigned to a geographical province based on their choices and their performance on the examination
after receiving the personal seal which is the symbol of the profession and the legal instrument alongside the signature certifying the acts a notary has to complete a months period of further training with a qualified notary
given the difficulty of the national examination almost all candidates attend special schools meant to train future notaries
those schools are fully private institutions and are by no means mandatory but virtually all successful applicants have at some point attended one or more
an average person requires about years years of university months of training an average of years to pass the national examination and further months of training of continuous studies in order to become a notary
as such notaries are among the most trained legal professionals in italy and are considered in extremely high regard both professionally and socially
after completed the studies a notary usually opens a private office studio notarile in the city assigned by the state
after one year they are allowed to open a second study in the same region
the law mandates a minimum of three half days to be allocated at the primary office but makes no references to a minimum or maximum fee that can be applied
given the relatively small number of notaries about and the high volume of work they are required to do notaries are usually very expensive professionals and consistently rank first among the best paid professional category in italy
notaries are required by law whenever real estate bene immobile is donated whenever a legal person has a change in the statute or whenever relevant property such as automobiles is donated
notary acts are legally binding publicly available and considered to be certain for any claim unless proven false pubblica fede fino a prova di falso
the assumption of legal validity unless proven false and the public availability are the two main aspects of the notarial act as opposed to barrister acts or contracts among private citizens
every dutch civil law notary dutch notaris is part of the royal society of notaries koninklijke notari le beroepsorganisatie knb lit royal professional organization of notaries formerly the royal brotherhood of notaries koninklijke notari le broederschap until october and occupy a special position relative to other legal practitioners such as attorneys court bailiffs and tax advisors
this is apparent first and foremost from the fact that notaries are public officers appointed for life by the crown and provide regulated legal services
as a qualified lawyer a notary takes on clients is paid on a fee for service basis
life appointment is designed to safeguard the independence needed by notaries to discharge their functions
notaries are independent and disinterested
unlike attorneys or legal advisors a notary does not represent or act in the interest of any one party
instead under the dutch legal system notaries are required to act impartially on behalf of all parties to a contract or transaction
for example when real property is conveyed notaries act for both the seller and buyer also as an escrow agent
they are subject to legal professional privilege and are therefore duty bound not to betray client confidentiality thereby giving them the right to withhold information in court as would an attorney or doctor
in cases where a notary acts as legal advisor to a particular interested party the advising notary must counsel all parties including third party beneficiaries
all notaries are law graduates
not only are they experts in family estate company and property laws but they must also stay up to date about pertinent cases and certain aspects of tax legislation
if necessary a dutch notary will instruct and call on the services of other legal practitioners
however under no circumstances may a notary represent clients in court
apart from advising a notary also draws executes and retains instruments either by statute or at the parties request
under dutch law a notarially executed instrument is probative as of the data certa vaste datum and subscription of the parties
notaries archive the minute protocol copy dutch minuut and issue exemplifications authentiek afschrift to the parties
the only fully executed copy known as the engrossment grosse is prima facie demonstrative evidence of its contents similar to a court order
there is therefore no need for the party to or custodian of a notarial instrument to provide extraneous evidence to verify the instrument s probativity
and under dutch law for instruments to be self executing they must be drawn up as public instruments which is why any instrument drafted by a common law lawyer which is never public is not self executing in the netherlands
the new notaries act wet op het notarisambt commenced in october years after the original act reinforces the official position of notaries but also expands on and adds to their traditional services
the consolidation of the notary s official position is for example reflected in the way the requirements of impartiality and independence have been enshrined in law the many regulations a notary and notary s clerk are required to adhere to and the fact that a notary is prohibited from acting as an attorney
market forces have widened the possibility for notary s clerks to become notaries and for competition
however the act did not make substantial changes to the profession
while dutch notaries are public officers and their instruments are public instruments they are not government employees and instead act as independent private practitioners
the new law makes it easier for notaries clerks to set up a practice and gives notaries more freedom in determining their fees for services
the act has provided for the establishment of an external committee of experts if notary s clerks submit a sound business plan to the committee they have a greater chance to be approved to set up their own practice
greater freedom in the fees a notary can charge implies that the royal society of notaries no longer fixes fees or prescribes rates
since july notaries have been free to establish their own fees
maximum rate caps fixed by authorities now apply only to family law services in certain circumstances
every indonesian civil law notary indonesian notaris directly derived from the dutch is a member of the indonesian union of notaries ikatan notaris indonesia ini and are very similar to its dutch counterparts
however agrarian reforms which started in the promulgation of a land law itself replaced the dutch east indian agrarische wet of commonly referred to the act that started the dutch east indian liberal period de jure deprived them from executing all legal affairs related to land
all legal affairs related to land are now de jure executed by land deed making officers indonesian pejabat pembuat akta tanah ppat appointed by the national land agency id in comparison civil law notaries are appointed by the ministry of law and human rights however most notaries often have dual status as ppats

a notarial instrument also fixes the date at which its parties are bound without prior delivery and acceptance as opposed to a deed or contract under common law and the data certa date certaine of the act s execution so as to safeguard against third party claims

in france when a notarial act is passed before one notary subscribing it is said to be ordinaire or in simple form and when before two notaries with the second attesting then it is solennel or in solemn form
acts may be drawn up in public or private form said en minute and en brevet respectively
when drawn in private form the single executed original is issued to the client and its particulars are logged in the notary s register
when in public form one un executed minute copy minute is retained of record in the notary s protocol thereby constituting a public instrument and a fully engrossed execution copy called a grosse and now termed copie ex cutoire is issued to the client and is headed and footed with the same formule ex cutoire or enactment clause used on court orders and writs

all french notaries are jointly and severally liable for professional errors in the performance of their duties

notaries are also required to attend regular continuing education courses and seminars in spain a notario is both a civil servant and a private and highly specialised lawyer
thus although they hold a private practice depending on the role they professionally exercise they may be acting as public officers for instance when working with governmental agencies and departments or when certifying notarial instruments in a court of law or as private practitioners for instance when paying their own staff s taxes and salaries or assuming the running costs of their own notarial practice
spanish notaries are charged with writing and authorising notarial instruments that gather either perceptible facts from which some legal right might be derived for instance holding witness or validating a document or juridical business of any sort both in private and commercial law that in one way or another require collecting the will of all parties involved as would be for instance mortgage contracts or powers of attorney poder notarial
notaries are regulated by the ley de de mayo de del notariado de espa a law of may of notaries of spain
access to the profession is restricted to spanish and eu citizens over the age of and who hold an undergraduate and a postgraduate degree in law or rarely a phd in law
in order to become a notary the candidate has to sit a highly competitive public examination consisting of parts covering all legal and practical aspects of spanish private law
this oposici n p blica is usually called once a year to cover arising vacancies in the notarial jurisdictions
because very few openings take place the success rate for this exam is extremely low under gain a position and preparing for the examination typically takes potential candidates to years
spanish notaries exercise their notarial instruments known in general as fe p blica notarial in a dual manner
when discussing matters of fact what a spanish notary sees hears or perceives is held to have full evidentiary value and executory force and is therefore proof of the matter of fact
when discussing matters of the law notarial instruments hold the authenticity and probatory force of the wills declared by the parties appearing in it as private practitioners spanish notaries are also obliged by law to offer legal counsel to all those that may require or demand it and advise them on the most appropriate legal means they may need to reach their goals so long as the latter are licit
unlike in common law jurisdictions spanish notaries are actively involved in drafting the notarial instruments and contracts usually if so needed as advised by the signing parties
in that manner they act as private practitioners
however inasmuch as public officers notaries are obliged to ensure that the notarial instruments and contracts are law abiding and upon notarising the instrument calificaci n notarial the instrument has the full power of the law
because of this the validity and truthfulness of notarial instruments are a priori held to be true and therefore had probatory value in the courts were disputes to arise
the three main notarial instruments a spanish notary holds are
escrituras p blicas public writs which refer to all contracts and declarations that involve the assent of two or more parties
this includes house deeds
actas notariales notarial acts
these are notarial statements whereby the notary bears witness to something he or she has physically been part of
they may be employed by lawyers requiring an independent third party the notary to witness something the presence of some individual somewhere or the drawing of a specific prize by lot the validity of a translation
p lizas intervenidas intervened policies
these are typically commercial contracts such as mortgage and insurance policies where one of the parties grants some right say a loan to another finally spanish notaries offer testimonies and certifications for instance when certifying that the copy of a document is a faithful copy to the original
notaries sign firman and stamp sellan giving faith dar fe on each page of the notarial instrument which are bound together with their archival number and page and held in a practice
the notarial instrument is always written in certified paper papel timbrado special paper issued and numbered by the royal mint and bound alongside all other notarial instruments yearly to be archived by the notarial practice
the original document is known as the matriz and must be physically held by the notary
the notary may issue certified copies of the matriz which have the same validity as the latter
notarial practices are limited by law to a specific territorial range where the notary typically has his or her notar a
each notar a is held by a single notario and tends to employ a number of clerks pasantes and administrators
these notar as are private practices and are self funded with the fees that the notary is allowed to charge
notarial fees are regulated by law
each notarial instrument has a moderate cost on its own added to which the notary charges per page drafted per copy emitted etc a legally set amount
the notary is also obliged to collect whichever taxes may be involved in the transactions they notarise for instance the stamp duty or vat costs
although regulated in a different manner in each country notaries in the spanish americas operate in a very similar manner to spanish notaries
as a general rule countries who formerly were colonies or viceroyalties of spain france or portugal have retained a civil law tradition and accordingly a civil law notarial profession
this is the case with most latin american and french speaking african countries but not so of asian countries
most of the countries which have civil law notaries are members of the international union of notaries uinl

scribes have existed since recorded history but the notary s authentication tools were first invented in the fertile crescent where in babylon the use of signatures and distinct signs in clay tablets was required
egypt innovated the use of papyrus and the calame added legalistic formalism to document preparation and had specialized notary scribes called sesh n pero pharaoh s scribe or sesh n po scribe of the nome agoranomos in ptolemaic times who gave authenticity to instruments without the need for witnesses
in ancient israel there existed a similar institution of the notary scribe known as the sof r
greek city states lacked uniformity but universally public instruments usually deeds and conveyances were kept in official registers and drafted by scribal mnemone or basiliki ipographi king s scribes who were tied to a certain district and whose written acts trumped oral testimony
these innovations would be combined and adopted under the roman empire
in rome scribes scribae acted as court recorders and copyists of instruments whereas the notarius took dictation and raw minutes or memoranda notae of proceedings in shorthand
different kinds of notarius existed some recorded proceedings others transcribed state papers some supplied magistrates with legal forms and others registered judgements and decrees
a number were involved with the noncontentious jurisdiction of the courts by drawing up deeds wills and conveyances which could then be sealed before the presiding magistrate and affixed with the official seal of the court thereby rendering them public and probative acts
otherwise most instruments were in private form
one type of notarius was the exceptor who emerged as the official clerk attached to all bureaus and courts and required at all municipal meetings of curiae
yet drawing up private documents was more the preserve of the tabellio a professional scrivener who held no public office
the tabellio used clerks to take shorthand notes and wrote them out in minute form
this was then engrossed into an extended act duly attested by witnesses and endorsed with a completio or eschatocol docquet
early on and like the notarius a tabellio s instrument lacked probativity
only by attaching copies of the judicial proceedings wherein one party petitions the second party to either contest or accept the act in open court could the instrument be made probative i e imbued with fides publica public faith and credit
in later years it became possible to register and deposit the acts of a tabellio in public archives to make them probative
both exceptores and tabelliones were organized into civil guilds collegia scholae to ensure the official recording of both public and private acts
though tabelliones were of lower social status the position had high mobility and official posts often drew young nobles
by the late roman period notarius came to denote registrars attached to the courts of provincial governors secretaries of emperors and the highest class of officials in the privy council and the imperial chancery
in the church they were administrative secretaries for bishops and monasteries and were important as correspondents in the doctrinal battles of the rd and th centuries
constantine himself created guilds of notarii for bishops and their courts
tabelliones were nicknamed runners cursores because of their quick drafting speed and their cursive minute hand
they were also sometimes known as forenses and publici from their presence in public places before being subsumed under the functions of the tabulairus or notary clerk
lawyers or juris prudense or juris consulte also often acted as scriveners
with the degeneration of public administration and its assumption by the church in the west as well as the replacement of roman legal writing culture with a germanic oral legal system based on witness testimony and open court proceedings secular scribes and scriveners became obsolete
in a select group of urban areas such as in northern italy and southern france roman law tended to be preserved at least for civil matters and there the secular notarius or tabellio lived on mostly as a scrivener
ecclesiastical notaries notarius ecclesiaie in the main perfected a number of common notarial devices namely the use of ribbons seals manual signs signum and the form of the eschatocol during this time
they also came to be called scrinarius
pope gregory the great r
organized papal notarii or scrinarii into a schola gregory s registers show that they were responsible for recording correspondence ordinations privileges donations synodal acts and matters related to the patrimony of saint peter as well as serving as papal advisors diplomats and envoys
similarly the papal chancery archive and library were organized around their efforts
in northern italy during the ostrogothic and lombard periods the offices of exceptor and tabellio were carried out by scriptores and notaries
the notarius civitatis or urban notary served lombard kings and nobles in their courts notarii ecclesiae continued to aid bishops abbots and some of the public
these two kinds of notaries attended the same episcopal schools and the existence of ecclesiastical notaries led to the demand for secular ones
unorganized and unregulated publici notarii or lay notaries handled private matters since the lombards did not practice insinuation
from the late th century on important notaries societies and probably notarial education existed in pavia cremona milan lucca rome and ravenna
in merovingian france ecclesiastical notaries continuing late imperial practice were attached to county courts as clerks of court who recorded proceedings and prepared and engrossed instruments and process which were later sealed before the count with the court s official seal to render them public and authentic
otherwise it was not until the th century when charlemagne in an effort to reform the county court system began to appoint notaries to accompany itinerant royal commissioners during their assize circuit which notaries were called royal notaries
by the th century they had become permanent clerks of court and came to greatly outnumber and then absorb the comital notaries into their corps
this system was preserved by the holy roman empire
charlemagne also raised ecclesiastical notaries to the status of deacon or priest
as a result the office of notary became a stepping stone to higher church office
they continued to serve the public as well before being made obsolete by the full emergence of a lay notarial profession in the th century
charlemagne ordered that every bishop abbot and count employ a notary appointed by himself if necessary
he therefore accepted and altered lombard practice formalized it and spread it to the rest of the empire
his own notarial secretaries were the cancellarii
one notary in particular paul the deacon played a pivotal role in the carolingian renaissance
paul was trained at pavia was chancellor to the lombard king desierius taught at the frankish palace school and may have been responsible for reforming the notarial system
the famous missi dominici oversaw the work of comital counts and episcopal notaries who under louis the pious were drawn specifically from the noble class
under lothair i imperial law regulated notarial practice of both episcopal and comital cancellarii and private notaries and limited a notary s geographic jurisdiction
in the east however the tabularius called symbolaiographos and the juris the nomikos continued to thrive
to stem fraud justinian reforms codified cf
th and th novellae new precautionary measures for giving a document probativity such as
the actual presence of the attesting tabellio and the recording of other witnesses names
the obligatory presence and signatures of witnesses to an act s signing
dating by regnal and consular year and indiction
inclusion of an eschatocol in which the tabellio claimed responsibility for the document
recitation before a judge before recordation a process known as insinuatio some measures proved untenable and with the short supply of administrators and half loss of the empire early th century notaries became a primarily urban phenomenon with somewhat relaxed standards of practice
still they remained the highest ranking lawyer and instrumental to the legal and court process as germanic type oral proceedings were unknown and roman legalistic traditions survived intact
from the mid th century a large body of centuries old legal texts was given force of law and became widely circulated
similarly the importance of law court officials declined as did lawsuits in regular civil courts and this in turn allowed private settlements mediated by notaries at lower cost to flourish
in time all notarial functions clerical and law officer were concentrated into the law trained nomikos though the church would provide notarial services in town and rural settings
the church also retained the old separation between symbolaiographos or notary draftsman notarios or notary scribe and the clerical nomikos or notary lawyer
by the th century secular nomikoi had been organized into a regulatory guild were attached to the state appointed by the emperor and ranked among the highest of legal officers
the introductory portions of their acts also tended to invoke god and crosses and christian insignia were often applied to the face of an act
notarial practice would be slightly westernized under venetian occupation but remained substantially unchanged until the end of the empire
imperial ravenna retained separate scholae of imperial notaries ecclesiastical notaries and tabelliones
however with the fall of the exarchate imperial notaries disappeared with unauthorized tabelliones absorbing most of their legal jurisdiction and function
during the th century and the early th century attempts to bring the tabellionate under imperial purview were resisted and failed at ravenna though by the th century many professionals styled themselves notarius et tabellio combining both functions in their practice
by the th century even the ravennati adopted the title notary by imperial authority and the retrograde tabellionate slowly dissolved
the ecclesiastical notariate in ravenna retained its position until the th century but did not interfere in the sphere of the secular notariate
during the th century the lay tabellionate absorbed most of the functions of the church notary even running ravenna s episcopal chancery by
elsewhere in italy where it had survived the independent ecclesiastical notariate likewise slowly disappeared in lucca the comital notariate replaced it during the carolingian period and in bologna home of the revived imperial legal tradition the bishop s last clerical notary died in
even in rome lay notaries gained in importance and in pope innocent iii declared that no notary in a church court could hold major orders
in southern italy when sicily fell to the arabs it lost the notarial tradition while other areas such as apulia calabria and lucania held on to greco byzantine practices
areas retaining the latin lombard traditions used the notarius but he may have been attached to and authorized through a palace church monastery or even city or sometimes he was itinerant and without official authority
during the th century naples maintained a clear organization of notaries curiali in a collegio under a primarius aided by a tabularius
documents were often drawn up by discipuli apprentices but only the notary could apply the eschatocol
amalfi followed a looser organization scribae civitatis scriveners were called curiali by c
many may have worked only part time and there was no clear caste of discipuli
gaeta retained the scriba civitatis though mixing greek with latin traditions and clerical with secular functions and statuses
in the th and th centuries titles included presbyter priest et notarius civitatis and leo greco latinus presbyter et scriba civitatis though by the early th century a simple notarius civitatis would do
the southern italian tradition was for the most part replaced by the carolingian tradition when the region was conquered by the normans
as northern italy came to free itself in the late th century from imperial rule and episcopal authority it established municipal authorities known as consulates who with the increase in literacy came to rely heavily on the lay notary to produce archive and standardize public instruments under municipal seal
in addition the venetian pillaging of byzantine libraries revived bookish learning and led to the founding of law schools such as at the university of bologna which trained notaries at law
similarly as schools for notaries relied on byzantine law and came to determine the development of the notarial corps by the th century the carolingian and the byzantine traditions were no longer distinguishable
the italian notarial profession was transmitted from lombardy to southern france through trade first to languedoc and eventually northward to bruges flemish belgium and on to the eastern mediterranean
