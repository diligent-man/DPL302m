Jagger visited Los Angeles on a vaudeville show with Irene Rich
While there, he made his film debut in The Woman from Hell (1929) with Mary Astor
 "My good notices," he later recalled, "had a reverse effect on the industry, which was suddenly revolutionized by sound pictures
With the one film to my credit, I was considered part of that group of untouchables-silent film stars." He followed it with Handcuffed (1929).

Before he left the show to have a major medical operation, though, he was less than happy with the series, clashing repeatedly with the writers and directors and describing "the Mr
Novak company" afterwards as "a mishmash of unbelievable amateurishness."
"It is unforgivable how bad TV is today," he said in 1965
"The people doing it have succumbed to the cliché that there is no time to be good in TV, or that we doing it are lucky to get one good episode out of three
Why?"
