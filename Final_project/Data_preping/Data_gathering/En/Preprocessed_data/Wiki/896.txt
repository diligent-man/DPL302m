peshischa yiddish was an important hasidic school of thought based out of przysucha poland founded by yaakov yitzchak rabinowicz which flourished during the late th to early th century
its teachings are the foundation for kotzk hasidism ger hasidism amshinov hasidism zychlin hasidism aleksander hasidism vurka hasidism sochatchov hasidim porisov hasidim biala hasidim and izhbitza radzin hasidism
yaakov yitzchak rabinowicz preached an elitist rationalistic hasidism that centered on talmudic study and formed a counterpoint to the miracle centered hasidism of lublin
his immediate successor simcha bunim of peshischa brought peshischa to its highest point and kickstarted a counter revolutionary movement which challenged the hasidic norm
while under the leadership of rabinowicz peshischa was closer to a philosophy whereas under simcha bunim it was transformed into a religious movement
under simcha bunim s leadership centers were created across poland that held ideologically alliance to peshischa
these centers preached simcha bunim s ideals of rationalism radical personhood independence and the constant quest for authenticity
he outwardly challenged the dynastic nature of hasidic rebbes which led to several unsuccessful attempts by contemporary hasidic leadership to excommunicate peshischa
after his death in peshischa split into two factions those of his more radical followers who supported menachem mendel of kotzk as simcha bunim s successor and those of his less radical followers who supported the succession of simcha bunim s son avraham moshe bonhardt
however after avraham moshe s death a year later in the community almost unanimously followed menachem mendel who gradually incorporated most of the community into kotzk
after his death in peshischa ceased to exist as a separate movement yet its ideals still exist as the foundation for a large percentage of modern hasidism
