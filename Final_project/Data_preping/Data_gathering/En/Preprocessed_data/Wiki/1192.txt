a beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles
the particles composing a beach are typically made from rock such as sand gravel shingle pebbles etc or biological sources such as mollusc shells or coralline algae
sediments settle in different densities and structures depending on the local wave action and weather creating different textures colors and gradients or layers of material
though some beaches form on freshwater locations most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments
erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes like wave action and extreme weather events
where wind conditions are correct beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach
however these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates
some estimates describe as much as percent of the earth s sandy beaches disappearing by due to climate change driven sea level rise
sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines
these beaches are popular for recreation playing important economic and cultural roles often driving local tourism industries
to support these uses some beaches have man made infrastructure such as lifeguard posts changing rooms showers shacks and bars
they may also have hospitality venues such as resorts camps hotels and restaurants nearby or housing both for permanent and seasonal residents
human forces have significantly changed beaches globally direct impacts include bad construction practices on dunes and coastlines while indirect human impacts include water pollution plastic pollution and coastal erosion from sea level rise and climate change
some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment
wild beaches also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches are not developed for tourism or recreation
preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins
preserved beaches and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human infrastructure
although the seashore is most commonly associated with the word beach beaches are also found by lakes and alongside large rivers
beach may refer to
small systems where rock material moves onshore offshore or alongshore by the forces of waves and currents or
geological units of considerable size the former are described in detail below the larger geological units are discussed elsewhere under bars
there are several conspicuous parts to a beach that relate to the processes that form and shape it
the part mostly above water depending upon tide and more or less actively influenced by the waves at some point in the tide is termed the beach berm
the berm is the deposit of material comprising the active shoreline
the berm has a crest top and a face the latter being the slope leading down towards the water from the crest
at the very bottom of the face there may be a trough and further seaward one or more long shore bars slightly raised underwater embankments formed where the waves first start to break
the sand deposit may extend well inland from the berm crest where there may be evidence of one or more older crests the storm beach resulting from very large storm waves and beyond the influence of the normal waves
at some point the influence of the waves even storm waves on the material comprising the beach stops and if the particles are small enough sand size or smaller winds shape the feature
where wind is the force distributing the grains inland the deposit behind the beach becomes a dune
these geomorphic features compose what is called the beach profile
the beach profile changes seasonally due to the change in wave energy experienced during summer and winter months
in temperate areas where summer is characterised by calmer seas and longer periods between breaking wave crests the beach profile is higher in summer
the gentle wave action during this season tends to transport sediment up the beach towards the berm where it is deposited and remains while the water recedes
onshore winds carry it further inland forming and enhancing dunes
conversely the beach profile is lower in the storm season winter in temperate areas due to the increased wave energy and the shorter periods between breaking wave crests
higher energy waves breaking in quick succession tend to mobilise sediment from the shallows keeping it in suspension where it is prone to be carried along the beach by longshore currents or carried out to sea to form longshore bars especially if the longshore current meets an outflow from a river or flooding stream
the removal of sediment from the beach berm and dune thus decreases the beach profile
if storms coincide with unusually high tides or with a freak wave event such as a tidal surge or tsunami which causes significant coastal flooding substantial quantities of material may be eroded from the coastal plain or dunes behind the berm by receding water
this flow may alter the shape of the coastline enlarge the mouths of rivers and create new deltas at the mouths of streams that had not been powerful enough to overcome longshore movement of sediment
the line between beach and dune is difficult to define in the field
over any significant period of time sediment is always being exchanged between them
the drift line the high point of material deposited by waves is one potential demarcation
this would be the point at which significant wind movement of sand could occur since the normal waves do not wet the sand beyond this area
however the drift line is likely to move inland under assault by storm waves
beaches are the result of wave action by which waves or currents move sand or other loose sediments of which the beach is made as these particles are held in suspension
alternatively sand may be moved by saltation a bouncing movement of large particles
beach materials come from erosion of rocks offshore as well as from headland erosion and slumping producing deposits of scree
a coral reef offshore is a significant source of sand particles
some species of fish that feed on algae attached to coral outcrops and rocks can create substantial quantities of sand particles over their lifetime as they nibble during feeding digesting the organic matter and discarding the rock and coral particles which pass through their digestive tracts
the composition of the beach depends upon the nature and quantity of sediments upstream of the beach and the speed of flow and turbidity of water and wind
sediments are moved by moving water and wind according to their particle size and state of compaction
particles tend to settle and compact in still water
once compacted they are more resistant to erosion
established vegetation especially species with complex network root systems will resist erosion by slowing the fluid flow at the surface layer
when affected by moving water or wind particles that are eroded and held in suspension will increase the erosive power of the fluid that holds them by increasing the average density viscosity and volume of the moving fluid
coastlines facing very energetic wind and wave systems will tend to hold only large rocks as smaller particles will be held in suspension in the turbid water column and carried to calmer areas by longshore currents and tides
coastlines that are protected from waves and winds will tend to allow finer sediments such as clay and mud to precipitate creating mud flats and mangrove forests
the shape of a beach depends on whether the waves are constructive or destructive and whether the material is sand or shingle
waves are constructive if the period between their wave crests is long enough for the breaking water to recede and the sediment to settle before the succeeding wave arrives and breaks
fine sediment transported from lower down the beach profile will compact if the receding water percolates or soaks into the beach
compacted sediment is more resistant to movement by turbulent water from succeeding waves
conversely waves are destructive if the period between the wave crests is short
sediment that remains in suspension when the following wave crest arrives will not be able to settle and compact and will be more susceptible to erosion by longshore currents and receding tides
the nature of sediments found on a beach tends to indicate the energy of the waves and wind in the locality
constructive waves move material up the beach while destructive waves move the material down the beach
during seasons when destructive waves are prevalent the shallows will carry an increased load of sediment and organic matter in suspension
on sandy beaches the turbulent backwash of destructive waves removes material forming a gently sloping beach
on pebble and shingle beaches the swash is dissipated more quickly because the large particle size allows greater percolation thereby reducing the power of the backwash and the beach remains steep
compacted fine sediments will form a smooth beach surface that resists wind and water erosion
during hot calm seasons a crust may form on the surface of ocean beaches as the heat of the sun evaporates the water leaving the salt which crystallises around the sand particles
this crust forms an additional protective layer that resists wind erosion unless disturbed by animals or dissolved by the advancing tide
cusps and horns form where incoming waves divide depositing sand as horns and scouring out sand to form cusps
this forms the uneven face on some sand shorelines
white sand beaches look white because the quartz or eroded limestone in the sand reflects or scatters sunlight without absorbing other colors
the composition of the sand varies depending on the local minerals and geology
some of the types of sand found in beaches around the world are
white sand mostly made of quartz and limestone it can also contain other minerals like feldspar and gypsum
light colored sand this sand gets its color from quartz and iron and is the most common sand color in southern europe and other regions of the mediterranean basin such as tunisia
tropical white sand on tropical islands the sand is composed of calcium carbonate from the shells and skeletons of marine organisms like corals and mollusks as found in aruba
pink coral sand like the above is composed of calcium carbonate and gets its pink hue from fragments of coral such as in bermuda and the bahama islands
black sand black sand is composed of volcanic rock like basalt and obsidian which give it its gray black color
hawaii s punaluu beach madeira s praia formosa and fuerteventura s ajuy beach are examples of this type of sand
red sand this kind of sand is created by the oxidation of iron from volcanic rocks
santorini s kokkini beach or the beaches on prince edward island in canada are examples of this kind of sand
orange sand orange sand is high on iron
it can also me a combination of orange limestone crushed shells and volcanic deposits
ramla bay in gozo malta or porto ferro in sardinia are examples of each respectively
green sand in this kind of sand the mineral olivine has been separated from other volcanic fragments by erosive forces
a famous example is hawaii s papakolea beach which has sand containing basalt and coral fragments
olivine beaches have high potential for carbon sequestration and artificial greensand beaches are being explored for this process by project vesta beaches are changed in shape chiefly by the movement of water and wind
any weather event that is associated with turbid or fast flowing water or high winds will erode exposed beaches
longshore currents will tend to replenish beach sediments and repair storm damage
tidal waterways generally change the shape of their adjacent beaches by small degrees with every tidal cycle
over time these changes can become substantial leading to significant changes in the size and location of the beach
changes in the shape of the beach may undermine the roots of large trees and other flora
many beach adapted species such as coconut palms have a fine root system and large root ball which tends to withstand wave and wind action and tends to stabilize beaches better than other trees with a lesser root ball
erosion of beaches can expose less resilient soils and rocks to wind and wave action leading to undermining of coastal headlands eventually resulting in catastrophic collapse of large quantities of overburden into the shallows
this material may be distributed along the beach front leading to a change in the habitat as sea grasses and corals in the shallows may be buried or deprived of light and nutrients
coastal areas settled by man inevitably become subject to the effects of man made structures and processes
over long periods of time these influences may substantially alter the shape of the coastline and the character of the beach
beachfront flora plays a major role in stabilizing the foredunes and preventing beach head erosion and inland movement of dunes
if flora with network root systems creepers grasses and palms are able to become established they provide an effective coastal defense as they trap sand particles and rainwater and enrich the surface layer of the dunes allowing other plant species to become established
they also protect the berm from erosion by high winds freak waves and subsiding floodwaters
over long periods of time well stabilized foreshore areas will tend to accrete while unstabilized foreshores will tend to erode leading to substantial changes in the shape of the coastline
these changes usually occur over periods of many years
freak wave events such as tsunami tidal waves and storm surges may substantially alter the shape profile and location of a beach within hours
destruction of flora on the berm by the use of herbicides excessive pedestrian or vehicle traffic or disruption to freshwater flows may lead to erosion of the berm and dunes
while the destruction of flora may be a gradual process that is imperceptible to regular beach users it often becomes immediately apparent after storms associated with high winds and freak wave events that can rapidly move large volumes of exposed and unstable sand depositing them further inland or carrying them out into the permanent water forming offshore bars lagoons or increasing the area of the beach exposed at low tide
large and rapid movements of exposed sand can bury and smother flora in adjacent areas aggravating the loss of habitat for fauna and enlarging the area of instability
if there is an adequate supply of sand and weather conditions do not allow vegetation to recover and stabilize the sediment wind blown sand can continue to advance engulfing and permanently altering downwind landscapes
sediment moved by waves or receding floodwaters can be deposited in coastal shallows engulfing reed beds and changing the character of underwater flora and fauna in the coastal shallows
burning or clearance of vegetation on the land adjacent to the beach head for farming and residential development changes the surface wind patterns and exposes the surface of the beach to wind erosion
farming and residential development are also commonly associated with changes in local surface water flows
if these flows are concentrated in stormwater drains emptying onto the beach head they may erode the beach creating a lagoon or delta
dense vegetation tends to absorb rainfall reducing the speed of runoff and releasing it over longer periods of time
destruction by burning or clearance of the natural vegetation tends to increase the speed and erosive power of runoff from rainfall
this runoff will tend to carry more silt and organic matter from the land onto the beach and into the sea
if the flow is constant runoff from cleared land arriving at the beach head will tend to deposit this material into the sand changing its color odor and fauna
the concentration of pedestrian and vehicular traffic accessing the beach for recreational purposes may cause increased erosion at the access points if measures are not taken to stabilize the beach surface above high water mark
recognition of the dangers of loss of beach front flora has caused many local authorities responsible for managing coastal areas to restrict beach access points by physical structures or legal sanctions and fence off foredunes in an effort to protect the flora
these measures are often associated with the construction of structures at these access points to allow traffic to pass over or through the dunes without causing further damage
beaches provide a filter for runoff from the coastal plain
if the runoff is naturally dispersed along the beach water borne silt and organic matter will be retained on the land and will feed the flora in the coastal area
runoff that is dispersed along the beach will tend to percolate through the beach and may emerge from the beach at low tide
the retention of the freshwater may also help to maintain underground water reserves and will resist salt water incursion
if the surface flow of the runoff is diverted and concentrated by drains that create constant flows over the beach above the sea or river level the beach will be eroded and ultimately form an inlet unless longshore flows deposit sediments to repair the breach
once eroded an inlet may allow tidal inflows of salt water to pollute areas inland from the beach and may also affect the quality of underground water supplies and the height of the water table
some flora naturally occurring on the beach head requires freshwater runoff from the land
diversion of freshwater runoff into drains may deprive these plants of their water supplies and allow sea water incursion increasing the saltiness of the groundwater
species that are not able to survive in salt water may die and be replaced by mangroves or other species adapted to salty environments
beach nourishment is the importing and deposition of sand or other sediments in an effort to restore a beach that has been damaged by erosion
beach nourishment often involves excavation of sediments from riverbeds or sand quarries
this excavated sediment may be substantially different in size and appearance to the naturally occurring beach sand
in extreme cases beach nourishment may involve placement of large pebbles or rocks in an effort to permanently restore a shoreline subject to constant erosion and loss of foreshore
this is often required where the flow of new sediment caused by the longshore current has been disrupted by construction of harbors breakwaters causeways or boat ramps creating new current flows that scour the sand from behind these structures and deprive the beach of restorative sediments
if the causes of the erosion are not addressed beach nourishment can become a necessary and permanent feature of beach maintenance
during beach nourishment activities care must be taken to place new sediments so that the new sediments compact and stabilize before aggressive wave or wind action can erode them
material that is concentrated too far down the beach may form a temporary groyne that will encourage scouring behind it
sediments that are too fine or too light may be eroded before they have compacted or been integrated into the established vegetation
foreign unwashed sediments may introduce flora or fauna that are not usually found in that locality
brighton beach on the south coast of england is a shingle beach that has been nourished with very large pebbles in an effort to withstand the erosion of the upper area of the beach
these large pebbles made the beach unwelcoming for pedestrians for a period of time until natural processes integrated the naturally occurring shingle into the pebble base
even in roman times wealthy people spent their free time on the coast
they also built large villa complexes with bathing facilities so called maritime villas in particularly beautiful locations
excavations of roman architecture can still be found today for example on the amalfi coast near naples and in barcola in trieste
the development of the beach as a popular leisure resort from the mid th century was the first manifestation of what is now the global tourist industry
the first seaside resorts were opened in the th century for the aristocracy who began to frequent the seaside as well as the then fashionable spa towns for recreation and health
one of the earliest such seaside resorts was scarborough in yorkshire during the s it had been a fashionable spa town since a stream of acidic water was discovered running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town in the th century
the first rolling bathing machines were introduced by
the opening of the resort in brighton and its reception of royal patronage from king george iv extended the seaside as a resort for health and pleasure to the much larger london market and the beach became a centre for upper class pleasure and frivolity
this trend was praised and artistically elevated by the new romantic ideal of the picturesque landscape jane austen s unfinished novel sanditon is an example of that
later queen victoria s long standing patronage of the isle of wight and ramsgate in kent ensured that a seaside residence was considered as a highly fashionable possession for those wealthy enough to afford more than one home
the extension of this form of leisure to the middle and working classes began with the development of the railways in the s which offered cheap fares to fast growing resort towns
in particular the completion of a branch line to the small seaside town of blackpool from poulton led to a sustained economic and demographic boom
a sudden influx of visitors arriving by rail led entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle of growth throughout the s and s
the growth was intensified by the practice among the lancashire cotton mill owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery
these became known as wakes weeks
each town s mills would close for a different week allowing blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer
a prominent feature of the resort was the promenade and the pleasure piers where an eclectic variety of performances vied for the people s attention
in the north pier in blackpool was completed rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for upper class visitors
central pier was completed in with a theatre and a large open air dance floor
many of the popular beach resorts were equipped with bathing machines because even the all covering beachwear of the period was considered immodest
by the end of the century the english coastline had over large resort towns some with populations exceeding
the development of the seaside resort abroad was stimulated by the well developed english love of the beach
the french riviera alongside the mediterranean had already become a popular destination for the british upper class by the end of the th century
in the first railway to nice was completed making the riviera accessible to visitors from all over europe
by residents of foreign enclaves in nice most of whom were british numbered
the coastline became renowned for attracting the royalty of europe including queen victoria and king edward vii
continental european attitudes towards gambling and nakedness tended to be more lax than in britain so british and french entrepreneurs were quick to exploit the possibilities
in charles iii prince of monaco and fran ois blanc a french businessman arranged for steamships and carriages to take visitors from nice to monaco where large luxury hotels gardens and casinos were built
the place was renamed monte carlo
commercial sea bathing spread to the united states and parts of the british empire by the end of the th century
the first public beach in the united states was revere beach which opened in
during that same time henry flagler developed the florida east coast railway which linked the coastal sea resorts developing at st
augustine fl and miami beach fl to winter travelers from the northern united states and canada on the east coast railway
by the early th century surfing was developed in hawaii and australia it spread to southern california by the early s
by the s cheap and affordable air travel led to the growth of a truly global tourism market which benefited areas such as the mediterranean australia south africa and the coastal sun belt regions of the united states
beaches can be popular on warm sunny days
in the victorian era many popular beach resorts were equipped with bathing machines because even the all covering beachwear of the period was considered immodest
this social standard still prevails in many muslim countries
at the other end of the spectrum are topfree beaches and nude beaches where clothing is optional or not allowed
in most countries social norms are significantly different on a beach in hot weather compared to adjacent areas where similar behavior might not be tolerated and might even be prosecuted
in more than thirty countries in europe south africa new zealand canada costa rica south america and the caribbean the best recreational beaches are awarded blue flag status based on such criteria as water quality and safety provision
subsequent loss of this status can have a severe effect on tourism revenues
beaches are often dumping grounds for waste and litter necessitating the use of beach cleaners and other cleanup projects
more significantly many beaches are a discharge zone for untreated sewage in most underdeveloped countries even in developed countries beach closure is an occasional circumstance due to sanitary sewer overflow
in these cases of marine discharge waterborne disease from fecal pathogens and contamination of certain marine species are a frequent outcome
some beaches are artificial they are either permanent or temporary for examples see copenhagen hong kong manila monaco nottingham paris rotterdam singapore tianjin and toronto
the soothing qualities of a beach and the pleasant environment offered to the beachgoer are replicated in artificial beaches such as beach style pools with zero depth entry and wave pools that recreate the natural waves pounding upon a beach
in a zero depth entry pool the bottom surface slopes gradually from above water down to depth
another approach involves so called urban beaches a form of public park becoming common in large cities
urban beaches attempt to mimic natural beaches with fountains that imitate surf and mask city noises and in some cases can be used as a play park
beach nourishment involves pumping sand onto beaches to improve their health
beach nourishment is common for major beach cities around the world however the beaches that have been nourished can still appear quite natural and often many visitors are unaware of the works undertaken to support the health of the beach
such beaches are often not recognized by consumers as artificial
a famous example of beach nourishment came with the replenishment of waik k beach in honolulu hawaii where sand from manhattan beach california was transported via ship and barge throughout most of the th century in order to combat waikiki s erosion problems
the surfrider foundation has debated the merits of artificial reefs with members torn between their desire to support natural coastal environments and opportunities to enhance the quality of surfing waves
similar debates surround beach nourishment and snow cannon in sensitive environments
public access to beaches is restricted in some parts of the world
for example most beaches on the jersey shore are restricted to people who can purchase beach tags
many beaches in indonesia both private and public require admission fees
some beaches also restrict dogs for some periods of the year
private beaches may belong to owners of abutting land or neighborhood associations
signs are usually posted the entrance
a permit or special use occasion event may be granted upon executing the proper channels to legally obtain one
in some places such as florida it is not always clear which parts of a beach are public or private
the first public beach in the united states opened on july in the town of revere massachusetts with over people attending on the opening day
the beach was run bay the metropolitan parks commission and the new beach had a bandstand public bathhouses shade pavilions and lined by a broad boulevard that ran along the beach
public access to beaches is protected by law in the u s
state of oregon thanks to a state law the oregon beach bill which guaranteed public access from the columbia river to the california state line so that the public may have the free and uninterrupted use
public access to beaches in hawaii other than those owned by the federal government is also protected by state law
beach access is an important consideration where substantial numbers of pedestrians or vehicles require access to the beach
allowing random access across delicate foredunes is seldom considered good practice as it is likely to lead to destruction of flora and consequent erosion of the fore dunes
a well designed beach access should
provide a durable surface able to withstand the traffic flow
aesthetically complement the surrounding structures and natural landforms
be located in an area that is convenient for users and consistent with safe traffic flows
be scaled to match the traffic flow i e
wide and strong enough to safely carry the size and quantity of pedestrians and vehicles intended to use it
be maintained appropriately and
be signed and lit to discourage beach users from creating their own alternative crossings that may be more destructive to the beachhead a concrete ramp should follow the natural profile of the beach to prevent it from changing the normal flow of waves longshore currents water and wind
a ramp that is below the beach profile will tend to become buried and cease to provide a good surface for vehicular traffic
a ramp or stair that protrudes above the beach profile will tend to disrupt longshore currents creating deposits in front of the ramp and scouring behind
concrete ramps are the most expensive vehicular beach accesses to construct requiring use of a quick drying concrete or a cofferdam to protect them from tidal water during the concrete curing process
concrete is favored where traffic flows are heavy and access is required by vehicles that are not adapted to soft sand e g
road registered passenger vehicles and boat trailers
concrete stairs are commonly favored on beaches adjacent to population centers where beach users may arrive on the beach in street shoes or where the foreshore roadway is substantially higher than the beach head and a ramp would be too steep for safe use by pedestrians
a composite stair ramp may incorporate a central or side stair with one or more ramps allowing pedestrians to lead buggies or small boat dollies onto the beach without the aid of a powered vehicle or winch
concrete ramps and steps should be maintained to prevent a buildup of moss or algae that may make their wet surfaces slippery and dangerous to pedestrians and vehicles
a corduroy road or beach ladder or board and chain is an array of planks usually hardwood or treated timber laid close together and perpendicular to the direction of traffic flow and secured at each end by a chain or cable to form a pathway or ramp over the sand dune
corduroys are cheap and easy to construct and quick to deploy or relocate
they are commonly used for pedestrian access paths and light duty vehicular access ways
they naturally conform to the shape of the underlying beach or dune profile and adjust well to moderate erosion especially longshore drift
however they can cease to be an effective access surface if they become buried or undermined by erosion by surface runoff coming from the beach head
if the corduroy is not wide enough for vehicles using it the sediment on either side may be displaced creating a spoon drain that accelerates surface runoff and can quickly lead to serious erosion
significant erosion of the sediment beside and under the corduroy can render it completely ineffective and make it dangerous to pedestrian users who may fall between the planks
fabric ramps are commonly employed by the military for temporary purposes where the underlying sediment is stable and hard enough to support the weight of the traffic
a sheet of porous fabric is laid over the sand to stabilize the surface and prevent vehicles from bogging
fabric ramps usually cease to be useful after one tidal cycle as they are easily washed away or buried in sediment
a foliage ramp is formed by planting resilient species of hardy plants such as grasses over a well formed sediment ramp
the plants may be supported while they become established by placement of layers of mesh netting or coarse organic material such as vines or branches
this type of ramp is ideally suited for intermittent use by vehicles with a low wheel loading such as dune buggies or agricultural vehicles with large tyres
a foliage ramp should require minimal maintenance if initially formed to follow the beach profile and not overused
a gravel ramp is formed by excavating the underlying loose sediment and filling the excavation with layers of gravel of graduated sizes as defined by john loudon mcadam
the gravel is compacted to form a solid surface according to the needs of the traffic
gravel ramps are less expensive to construct than concrete ramps and are able to carry heavy road traffic provided the excavation is deep enough to reach solid subsoil
gravel ramps are subject to erosion by water
if the edges are retained with boards or walls and the profile matches the surrounding beach profile a gravel ramp may become more stable as finer sediments are deposited by percolating water
amongst the world s longest beaches are
eighty mile beach kilometres mi in north west australia
praia do cassino kilometres mi in brazil
padre island beach about kilometres mi in gulf of mexico texas
ninety mile beach victoria kilometres mi in victoria australia
cox s bazar bangladesh kilometres mi unbroken
playa novillera beach about kilometres mi in mexico

fraser island beach about kilometres mi in queensland australia
troia sines beach kilometres mi in portugal
the jersey shore km miles and
long beach washington which is about kilometres mi a beach is an unstable environment that exposes plants and animals to changeable and potentially harsh conditions
some animals burrow into the sand and feed on material deposited by the waves
crabs insects and shorebirds feed on these beach dwellers
the endangered piping plover and some tern species rely on beaches for nesting
sea turtles also bury their eggs in ocean beaches
seagrasses and other beach plants grow on undisturbed areas of the beach and dunes
ocean beaches are habitats with organisms adapted to salt spray tidal overwash and shifting sands
some of these organisms are found only on beaches
examples of these beach organisms in the southeast us include plants like sea oats sea rocket beach elder beach morning glory ipomoea pes caprae and beach peanut and animals such as mole crabs hippoidea coquina clams donax ghost crabs and white beach tiger beetles
