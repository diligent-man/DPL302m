although seashore commonly associated word beach beach also found lake alongside large rivers
small system rock material move onshore offshore alongshore force wave current or
geological unit considerable sizethe former described detail larger geological unit discussed elsewhere bars
several conspicuous part beach relate process form shape it
part mostly water depending upon tide le actively influenced wave point tide termed beach berm
berm ha crest top facethe latter slope leading towards water crest
bottom face may trough seaward one long shore bar slightly raised underwater embankment formed wave first start break
sand deposit may extend well inland berm crest may evidence one older crest storm beach resulting large storm wave beyond influence normal waves
point influence wave even storm wave material comprising beach stop particle small enough sand size smaller wind shape feature
wind force distributing grain inland deposit behind beach becomes dune
beach profile change seasonally due change wave energy experienced summer winter months
temperate area summer characterised calmer sea longer period breaking wave crest beach profile higher summer
gentle wave action season tends transport sediment beach towards berm deposited remains water recedes
conversely beach profile lower storm season winter temperate area due increased wave energy shorter period breaking wave crests
higher energy wave breaking quick succession tend mobilise sediment shallow keeping suspension prone carried along beach longshore current carried sea form longshore bar especially longshore current meet outflow river flooding stream
removal sediment beach berm dune thus decrease beach profile
storm coincide unusually high tide freak wave event tidal surge tsunami cause significant coastal flooding substantial quantity material may eroded coastal plain dune behind berm receding water
flow may alter shape coastline enlarge mouth river create new delta mouth stream powerful enough overcome longshore movement sediment
drift line high point material deposited wave one potential demarcation
would point significant wind movement sand could occur since normal wave wet sand beyond area
however drift line likely move inland assault storm waves
beach result wave action wave current move sand loose sediment beach made particle held suspension
alternatively sand may moved saltation bouncing movement large particles
beach material come erosion rock offshore well headland erosion slumping producing deposit scree
specie fish feed algae attached coral outcrop rock create substantial quantity sand particle lifetime nibble feeding digesting organic matter discarding rock coral particle pas digestive tracts
composition beach depends upon nature quantity sediment upstream beach speed flow turbidity water wind
sediment moved moving water wind according particle size state compaction
established vegetation especially specie complex network root system resist erosion slowing fluid flow surface layer
affected moving water wind particle eroded held suspension increase erosive power fluid hold increasing average density viscosity volume moving fluid
coastline facing energetic wind wave system tend hold large rock smaller particle held suspension turbid water column carried calmer area longshore current tides
coastline protected wave wind tend allow finer sediment clay mud precipitate creating mud flat mangrove forests
shape beach depends whether wave constructive destructive whether material sand shingle
wave constructive period wave crest long enough breaking water recede sediment settle succeeding wave arrives breaks
fine sediment transported lower beach profile compact receding water percolate soak beach
compacted sediment resistant movement turbulent water succeeding waves
sediment remains suspension following wave crest arrives able settle compact susceptible erosion longshore current receding tides
nature sediment found beach tends indicate energy wave wind locality
constructive wave move material beach destructive wave move material beach
season destructive wave prevalent shallow carry increased load sediment organic matter suspension
sandy beach turbulent backwash destructive wave remove material forming gently sloping beach
pebble shingle beach swash dissipated quickly large particle size allows greater percolation thereby reducing power backwash beach remains steep
compacted fine sediment form smooth beach surface resists wind water erosion
hot calm season crust may form surface ocean beach heat sun evaporates water leaving salt crystallises around sand particles
crust form additional protective layer resists wind erosion unless disturbed animal dissolved advancing tide
