Rock Band is a series of rhythm games developed by Harmonix principally for home video game consoles Based on their previous development work from the Guitar Hero series the main Rock Band games has players use game controllers modeled after musical instruments and microphones to perform the lead guitar bass guitar keyboard drums and vocal parts of numerous licensed songs across a wide range of genres though mostly focusing on rock music by matching scrolling musical notes patterns shown on screen Certain games support the use of Pro instruments that require special controllers that more closely mimic the playing of real instruments providing a higher challenge to players Players are scored for successfully hit notes while may fail a song if they miss too many notes The series has featured numerous game modes and supports both local and online multiplayer modes where up to four players in most modes can perform together
Harmonix had worked with Red Octane for the Guitar Hero series first released in when Red Octane was acquired by Activision to continue Guitar Hero in MTV Games a division of Viacom at the time acquired Harmonix to expand the concept to Rock Band and served as the game's publisher and manufacturer for the instrument controllers with distribution handled by Electronic Arts In due to saturation of the rhythm game market sales of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band dropped Harmonix's investors were able to buy the company from Viacom and making Harmonix an independent company giving them more flexibility in options for the series Harmonix transitioned to Mad Catz in for the publication and instrumentation controller manufacture By Harmonix stopped producing downloadable content DLC for the current Rock Band though stated that it would consider its options for the series upon the arrival of the next generation of consoles Following the release of the PlayStation and Xbox One Harmonix released Rock Band in for the new consoles While Mad Catz initially manufactured the new instrument controllers the game was not as financially successfully a partial cause for Mad Catz to declare bankruptcy and requiring Harmonix to switch production to Performance Designed Products PDP for ongoing instrument controller manufacture
To date there have been four main games in the series two band specific spin offs including The Beatles Rock Band and several additional spin off titles and Track Packs Harmonix has continued to supported Rock Band through a persistent DLC model with routine releases of new songs on a weekly basis as well as the ability for players to import songs from previous games into newer ones and as of May the latest title Rock Band supports over songs from this approach Harmonix had also offered the Rock Band Network to allow bands and labels to publish their songs as Rock Band tracks that can be purchased by players though the service has since been discontinued at the height of this service over tracks from artists were available for Rock Band players
By over million copies of Rock Band titles have been sold netting more than billion in total sales Over million downloadable song purchases have been made by
Prior to Guitar Hero and Rock Band Harmonix had already established itself as a company that made game products that focused on music interactivity Born out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab the first product made by Harmonix was The Axe Titans of Classic Rock for DOS based computers challenging the player to use four keys on the keyboard to match notes in several songs Looking to find a place for this type of game Harmonix' founders Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy looked to Japan where music games like PaRappa the Rapper were becoming popular This led to the creation of Frequency and its sequel Amplitude for the PlayStation both games featured the concept of matching notes for specific instrument tracks along lanes However in retrospect Harmonix found that players had difficulty initially understanding the game as the presentation was an abstract concept that did not immediately connect the gameplay to the music The idea of making an easy connection between the game and the music was used as a basis for their Karaoke Revolution games which including using avatars singing and dancing in time to the music to strengthen the connection this series was financially successful and helped grow the company
Harmonix was approached by RedOctane to help develop the software for the first Guitar Hero game itself based on Japanese games like Guitar Freaks Harmonix used their previous experience in note matching techniques from Frequency and Amplitude as well as the lessons learned in developed Karaoke Revolution to create the Guitar Hero software Harmonix was less concerned on developing gameplay and instead more on connecting the player to the music working to track the notes of the songs appropriately on the five button controller as to make the player feel like they are playing the real instrument Guitar Hero would go on to be a major success and found the basis of the Guitar Hero series
As the success of the Guitar Hero series grew Harmonix and RedOctane were purchased by MTV Games and Activision respectively in MTV paid million to acquire Harmonix RedOctane continued to publish the Guitar Hero series bringing Neversoft on board for development duties Harmonix was contractually committed to completing one final title Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the s during and after the purchase negotiations
With MTV Games a subsidiary of Viacom Harmonix took their experience from developing Guitar Hero and Karaoke Revolution to create the Rock Band series According to Harmonix Vice President of Product Development Greg LoPiccolo the Harmonix team had already envisioned the possibility of different instruments before they were finished with the Guitar Hero series Rigopulos noted that the Guitar Hero work was only a partial approach to this limited to what they could do on a shoe string budget Harmonix also embraced the idea of Rock Band as a platform rather than a software title and took steps to incorporate downloadable content to extend players' music libraries without having them need to buy a new software disk Rock Band was considered a success leading to the development of sequels and spinoff titles Viacom under the terms of the acquisition paid out M in performance based bonuses to Harmonix in early for their results and were planning on a similar amount by the end of The Rock Band series scored what was considered a major coup by journalists when it successfully negotiated the rights to use the music of The Beatles in a video game long considered a holy grail for music games
By the market for rhythm games in general started to fall The market had become saturated with titles mostly from Activision's expansion of the Guitar Hero series and consumers affected by the late s recession were less likely to buy costly instrument controllers Viacom had already reported significant losses on the Rock Band series and sales of The Beatles Rock Band did not meet their expectation Viacom sought a refund on the million already paid for the bonuses following its reassessment of the series' performance Harmonix anticipating the slowness of the market developed Rock Band with the introduction of several new features most notably including the capability to connect real MIDI keyboards MIDI guitars and MIDI electronic drum kits to create a disruptive game in the ailing rhythm game market by expanding to include real instruments
Though Viacom continued to support the series throughout it announced that it was seeking a buyer for Harmonix citing the series' continued profit losses and Viacom's inexperience at being a video game publisher Harmonix was eventually sold at the end of to Harmonix SBE Holdings LLC an affiliate of investment firm Columbus Nova LLC that included Harmonix shareholders Though the net liability of the sale was valued at nearly million including existing unsold inventory and ongoing music license fees analysts believe that Harmonix SBE paid only for the company taking on the total financial liability that Viacom was able to write off in their books The MTV Games division at Viacom was later closed
As a shareholder held company Harmonix retained the rights to the Rock Band and Dance Central franchises and continued to support and develop the games The company still faced some fallout from the sale laying off about of its staff in February In the same month Activision announced that it abandoned ongoing development of planned Guitar Hero titles which many journalists considered to signal the end of peripheral based rhythm games Though Harmonix considered the closure of Guitar Hero as discouraging they affirmed that they would continue to develop Rock Band and Dance Central and support their downloadable content for the immediate future Other journalists believed that without competition Harmonix no longer needed to develop under the same pressure allowing them to polish and innovate for future titles in the series bringing a likely future resurgence of the market
In March Harmonix affirmed that it had no plans for a fourth major release title within the year but was still strongly supporting the game through downloadable content through the year By early the company stated that while they may come back to Rock Band at a future time they were shifting resources to develop new titles and later announced that it would discontinue its regular downloadable content for the series after providing over continuous weeks of such content
Rigopulos stated at his keynote at the Penny Arcade Expo East that the studio had plans to bring Rock Band to eighth generation consoles at some point and with guns blazing Rigopulos states that the studio was waiting for just the right moment in the new generation of consoles to bring it back Following two sets of unexpected DLC releases in early as a survey sent to Rock Band fans the industry started to speculate that Harmonix was looking to revive the series Bloomberg reported that Harmonix was currently working on a new version of Rock Band for the next generation of consoles in late February
Rock Band was officially announced in March for release later in October on the PlayStation and Xbox One Rock Band supported nearly all previous content released for the series including imports from the Rock Band and all prior official DLC Initially Rock Band was released in partnership with Mad Catz for production of the instrument peripherals but the game did not sell as well as expected leading to a US million loss for Mad Katz who subsequently terminated the agreement by June and temporarily had entered a period of bankruptcy Harmonix switched to Performance Designed Products PDP to continue hardware manufacturing with the release of the Rivals expansion for Rock Band Harmonix attempted to crowdfund the development of Rock Band for personal computers through Fig which Harmonix's Rigopulos had become a board member of but this failed to meet the target goal though Harmonix had not ruled out other means to bring the series to personal computers through other means Harmonix continues to support Rock Band with weekly DLC and with the introduction of its Rivals gameplay mode eight week seasonal challenges for players to earn new cosmetics and as of April supports over songs
A separate Rock Band VR title was developed for the Oculus VR virtual reality system and released in March
Harmonix has released four mainline titles in the Rock Band series Rock Band Rock Band Rock Band and Rock Band Each game provides from to songs on disc with support for additional songs to be purchased as downloadable content The games feature a variety of modes including single player career modes offline and online cooperative modes as part of a band and competitive modes Most songs from earlier iterations can be exported for play in future versions for a small licensing fee However premium or upgraded DLC content cannot be transferred to Rock Band
In October Harmonix along with MTV Games announced an exclusive agreement with Apple Corps Ltd to produce a standalone title titled The Beatles Rock Band based on the Rock Band premise and featuring the music of The Beatles The game was released on September coinciding with the release of remastered collections of the Beatles' albums and features a visual and musical history of the Beatles with United Kingdom released versions of songs from their albums Please Please Me through Abbey Road The game also has been supported by downloadable content with three full albums Abbey Road Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rubber Soul available to purchase Though branded as a Rock Band game the title remains as a standalone game in the series It includes a function to add new songs to the game disc
Following on the success of The Beatles Rock Band Green Day Rock Band was released in June It includes the band's songs including full albums for Dookie American Idiot and st Century Breakdown avatars of the band's members and venues after real life performances of the group The track list is fully exportable to other Rock Band games
Several bands stated they were seeking to or working with Harmonix to develop band specific content for the series The band Pearl Jam worked with Harmonix and MTV Games along with Rhapsody on a Rock Band related project that was to be released in allowing for users to vote for their favorite live versions of the band's music In August it was rumoured that the Pearl Jam related project would be released as downloadable content but Harmonix spokesman John Drake later clarified that while a Pearl Jam based game was deep in development it was ultimately cancelled
The band U after declining an option to place themselves in a Rock Band game in were reconsidering their stance after seeing the success of The Beatles Rock Band according to bassist Adam Clayton Similarly Queen were in behind the scenes talks about a possible title for their group within Rock Band according to Brian May Even though no game based on the band was released Lego avatars of the band members appeared in Lego Rock Band Roger Daltrey of The Who had stated that a Rock Band title based on his group's music would be available in however no such title was released in or after that year for that matter Though Janie Hendrix had stated she allowed for Jimi Hendrix's works to be used for a Rock Band game to be released in this was later clarified as licensing several full albums from Hendrix to be made as downloadable content Harmonix had also considered standalone band games for Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin but neither project proceeded past developing concept art and cinematics
Harmonix and MTV Games have worked with TT Fusion and Traveller's Tales developers of the various Lego themed video game titles such as Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment to create Lego Rock Band The game includes songs that are suitable for younger audiences The game also includes the fun customization and humor of the Lego videogame franchise by allowing players to create their own Lego style avatars The game added a new super easy gameplay mode in order to accommodate younger players The game which was released on November on the Xbox PlayStation and Wii consoles supports all existing Rock Band instruments The game is able to utilize selected existing downloadable content for the other Rock Band games that have been deemed acceptable for the game's audience except on the Nintendo Wii
Harmonix had planned to release a spin off of Rock Band for Japanese audiences in co development with Q Entertainment The title initially announced in would have featured J pop music and would have been the first US originated rock music game to be heavily localized for the Japanese market Japanese artists had expressed interest in the venture such as X Japan Harmonix has since stated that this project has been discontinued but have considered the inclusion of popular Japanese music within Rock Band's regular downloadable content Alex Rigopulos later clarified that they found it difficult to license Japanese music for such a release and had considered both the cost of manufacturing and shipping instrument controllers to Japan and the limited space that many Japanese players would have in their homes
Rock Band Blitz is a downloadable title in the series released for the Xbox and PlayStation in October It is similar to Rock Band Unplugged using gameplay similar to Frequency and Amplitude The game included songs new to the series and two that were previously unavailable to export due to licensing issues but can use any previously downloaded song in the player's library the songs were also available to be played within Rock Band Unlike the previous games in the series Blitz is designed for use with a standard console controller using buttons on the controller to switch tracks and match notes The single player game is designed with numerous arcade elements including a number of power ups that make it more a score attack game than previous titles Released alongside the game was a Facebook application Rock Band World that connected to players' games offering challenges and tracking players scores in both Blitz and Rock Band
Shortly after release of Rock Band Harmonix began work on Rock Band Sessions Instead of matching notes as in the main games Sessions would have players making their own music in songs where several of the other instrument tracks were already completed one example given by Daniel Sussman was to complete a bass line atop existing guitar drums and vocal tracks If the player opted they would have been able to allow the pre existing track to be played instead and only provide their own music in certain sections of the song Sessions was originally conceived as a multiplayer title but Harmonix found that having multiple players attempt to make their own music at the same time was too chaotic and instead reworked it as a single player game with the player able to work each track separately and eventually bring them together in a final song Though Harmonix had developed a working prototype for the game they found that it would not adapt well to their existing licensed song library and would be difficult to use in future Rock Band games and that they did not feel this was a type of game they could sell to their player base at full price Sessions has been shelved though some of the lessons they learned were used to help develop Rock Band and may come back to the title at a later date
Harmonix also was involved with BandFuse Rock Legends released in November which for a time was referred to as Rock Band
In Oculus VR announced at The Game Awards that they would be partnering with Harmonix to make a virtual reality Rock Band game for the Rift titled Rock Band VR to be released in Harmonix began work on the title in October The game focused solely on guitar players uses the Oculus Rift Touch controllers in addition to the headset one which is attached to the guitar controller These provide the player with a first person view of their guitarist on stage which reacts to the player's movements In a demonstration at the Game Developers Conference the game was set up so that the player could see the note tracks located on the floor monitors on the virtual stage requiring the player to look down to track them but Harmonix stated they were exploring other means to provide this input The player can engage other actions in the VR world by looking at certain stage elements such as by keeping their focus on a foot pedal they can activate pyrotechnics on the virtual stage The game was released on March and shipped with songs on release and has DLC songs It was nominated for Best Game Audio Article Publication or Broadcast Steve Pardo Creating Rock Band VR and Best VR Audio at the th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards
Rock Band Unplugged was developed by Backbone Entertainment and was released for the PlayStation Portable in North America on June and later that year in Europe The game uses the PSP's Wi Fi capabilities to provide an online store for additional downloadable content from music providers The gameplay is similar to the previous Harmonix games Frequency and Amplitude with the player using the face buttons on the PSP to match notes after completing a length of a phrase on a given instrument that instrument will then play by itself for a while allowing the player to switch to another instrument The DS versions of Lego Rock Band and Rock Band use a similar gameplay system to Rock Band Unplugged
A mobile phone version of Rock Band was developed by EA Mobile to work with various phones the game was released to Verizon users on September The game features many of the same modes as the main Rock Band series including the ability to play with other users through the software The game offers the ability to play any of the four instruments on songs selected from the existing Rock Band library A version simply titled Rock Band for iOS was also released in October with gameplay described as similar to Tap Tap Revenge and allowing up to four people to play together with Bluetooth connections Rock Band Reloaded was released on December
The Rock Band games are score based music video games that combine elements of two of Harmonix' previous efforts Guitar Hero and Karaoke Revolution allowing up to four players to play on lead and bass guitar drums and vocals Rock Band expands this number to seven including a keyboardist and two harmony vocalists Players use these instruments to play scrolling musical notes on screen in time with music
Rock Band titles' gameplay and on screen interface use a combination of elements from Guitar Hero and Karaoke Revolution Rock Band has up to three tracks of vertically scrolling colored music notes one section each for lead guitar drums and bass The colored notes on screen correspond to buttons on the guitar and drum peripherals For lead and bass guitar players play their notes by holding down colored fret buttons on the guitar peripheral and pushing the controller's strum bar for drums players must strike the matching colored drumhead or step on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes Along the top of the screen is the vocals display which scrolls horizontally similar to Karaoke Revolution The lyrics display beneath green bars which represent the pitch of the individual vocal elements When singing vocals the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals A pitch indicator displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch by moving up or down to indicate high or low pitches respectively The Beatles Rock Band introduces three part harmonies using three separate microphones a feature later carried over into Green Day Rock Band and Rock Band If any part is not being played its interface does not appear on screen The remainder of the screen is used to display the band's virtual characters as they perform in concert
During cooperative play as a band all players earn points towards a common score though score multipliers and Overdrive an accumulated bonus that is the equivalent of Guitar Hero's Star Power are tracked separately for each player The bass guitar player's multiplier can reach as high as x compared to a x multiplier for the other players and achieve Bass Groove Overdrive is collected during select portions of a song by successfully playing all white notes within that section guitar and bass players can also use the guitar controller's whammy bar to extract Overdrive from white sustained notes Once the Energy Meter is filled halfway players can deploy their Overdrive resulting in the Band Meter which tracks how well each player is doing changing more dramatically This allows players to strategically use Overdrive to raise the Band Meter and pass portions of a song they otherwise might have failed Overdrive can be used to activate score multipliers which vary based on a player's note streak In solo play deploying Overdrive doubles the player's score multiplier However in band play activating Overdrive instead increases the score multiplier of the entire band by two Additionally players can deploy Overdrive independently of each other Guitar Hero games prior to World Tour require players in Co Operative mode to deploy Star Power simultaneously as well as collect additional Overdrive while it is deployed and draining
Each band member can choose the difficulty at which they play spanning Easy Medium Hard and Expert a Super Easy difficulty is also present in Lego Rock Band for younger players Furthermore with Rock Band players can select the Pro mode of their instrument if they have the appropriate controller for it Pro mode challenges guitar bass drums and keyboards to play their controllers closer to the real life instrument note for note If a player does not play well enough and falls to the bottom of the Band Meter they will fail out of the song and their instrument will be muted from the audio mix However any active player can activate their Overdrive to bring failed players back into the song saving the band member However a band member can only be saved twice after the third failure they cannot be brought back for that song Failed players continuously drag the band's Band Meter down until they are saved If the player is not saved before the Band Meter reaches the bottom the band fails the song Special portions of songs are labeled as Unison Phrases which reward the band with a score and Overdrive bonus if each player can play their parts perfectly during the phrase Select songs end with a special Big Rock Ending which gives the players a chance to improvise and earn extra points If each player successfully plays the final notes of the song following the freestyle portion of the Big Rock Ending the band earns all of the Big Rock Ending points Otherwise the bonus is lost
As the song progresses the screen shows a meter with the current accumulated score for the game as well as the number of stars earned so far based on their score and the progress towards the next star indicated by a partially filled ring Players can earn up to five stars with the chance of getting gold stars by getting a very high score with all players on the Expert difficulty The performance's star rating will influence the monetary reward and number of fans for the song within the various game modes or in the case of Rock Band the number of fans earned and speed progress towards the virtual band's Career Mode goals
Rock Band features instrument controllers designed for the game However Harmonix and other companies have attempted to provide compatibility between competing instrument controllers and music games allowing Rock Band to be playable without use of specific controllers and to reuse Rock Band controllers in other music games Prior to Rock Band most instrument controllers were made by MTV Games and Harmonix with several third party vendors supply alternate versions On January video game peripherals manufacturer Mad Catz announced it had reached an agreement with MTV and Harmonix to produce peripherals for Rock Band This agreement also gives MadCatz the ability to bundle and sell their products with Rock Band game titles Mad Catz continued to support the series for the release of Rock Band in but in early announced financial difficulties due to weak sales of Rock Band Harmonix subsequently announced that starting in Precision Designed Products will be producing and supporting instrument hardware for Rock Band
The guitar controller for Rock Band modeled after a Fender Stratocaster is used for lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay It has several features akin to Guitar Hero's controller as it features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar which correspond to on screen notes a strum bar and a whammy bar To use the guitar controller players must hold the fret button that corresponds to the scrolling colored note on screen while simultaneously pushing the strum bar In addition five smaller fret buttons are located further down on the neck These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos denoted by the note track turning blue as hammer ons and pull offs without the need to strum The whammy bar can be used to distort the sound of held notes A special effects switch can be used to toggle between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods ranging from wah wah flange chorus echo distortion doubler slap back echo medium echo and long echo however this switch was removed from the Rock Band edition of the guitar Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the Select Back button The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions Rock Band games allow players to apply a Lefty Flip setting supporting left handed guitar players The second version of the controller distributed with Rock Band introduced quieter fret buttons a more reliable strum bar and optical sensor and microphone to help the player calibrate the video and audio output from their television stereo system's setup
Rock Band introduces Pro Mode to the Rock Band franchise for both guitar and bass players where players finger specific strings and frets instead of colored buttons in Easy to Medium mode while on Expert mode players are required to play the actual guitar chords and solos note for note Two completely new guitar controllers were developed for use in this mode both of them legitimate MIDI guitars The first one MadCatz created was based on the bass version of the Fender Mustang featuring buttons each representing every spot possible on the neck up to frets and a string box where the player strums strings it was made of plastic and can be a step up from the legacy five lane controllers The second takes an authentic actual Squier Stratocaster guitar by Fender the complete guitar with strings and up to the standard frets added a string box near the strumming area for hit detection and rebuilt the neck to have a fret sensing feature in order to tell the game where the player's fingers are on the fret board There is also a mute bar built into the guitar which can be raised or lowered in the raised position the strings of the guitar are softly muted so as to not ring out This mute bar is what allows the string box to detect and translate individual string hits for the game In the lowered position the guitar strings won't be muted and therefore lets the strings ring out for normal guitar playing outside of the Rock Band game Tuning this specialized guitar is not necessary for playing Rock Band as for the game the guitar functions in MIDI mode and the guitar's sound comes from sound files of the actual guitar playing in the songs painstakingly designed from audio master stems of each song for the game Both of these officially made MIDI guitars utilize Pro Mode allowing for accurate fingering while playing with the added effect of learning how to play the song for real on guitar either alone or with friends playing the song with you on any other instrument or controller even online Of the two Pro guitars only the MadCatz Mustang model with buttons was capable of playing legacy lane guitar or bass charts The Mustang was the first available unit with the Squier becoming available in March
The drum set for Rock Band features four rubber drum pads and a bass pedal The pads have colored rings around the edges that correspond to the colored notes on screen These pads generally represent a snare drum red hi hat tom tom yellow ride cymbal tom blue and crash cymbals floor tom green though some songs may use the pads for other percussion instruments The pedal represents the bass drum orange with on screen notes represented as orange horizontal lines across the on screen drum track To use the drum controller players must strike the pads with drum sticks and press the bass pedal to match the scrolling notes on screen Drummers can improvise in special freestyle drum fill sections of songs indicated by the on screen columns for each note turning a solid color The four pads will commonly change functionality to represent other drums depending on the requirements of a song The default pad order can be reversed using the Lefty Mode option in the game The legs of the drum peripheral can adjust in height or be detached if the player wishes to place it on a table top The drum controller also features standard controller buttons in the middle of the peripheral for navigating in game menus Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal green note for right handed configuration that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill The second version of the controller distributed with Rock Band introduced quieter velocity sensitive drum pads a reinforced bass pedal wireless capabilities and compatibility with separately sold cymbals ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit
Pro mode for drums was introduced in Rock Band requiring players to equip the existing drum set with up to three cymbal units The game marks cymbal notes as circles in contrast to the regular rectangular pad notes and the drum player is required to hit the cymbals instead of the pads for these notes when they occur Electronic drum kits could also be used through a MIDI connection
The microphone is a standard USB microphone Players can use most other USB microphones while Xbox users can substitute their console's headset if they wish though the option to use a headset over a microphone is absent in Rock Band and The Beatles Rock Band For the most part singers are judged on how closely they match the relative pitch of the song's vocalist During talking parts that do not judge pitch a phoneme detector picks up individual vowels and consonants of the spoken lyrics songs that contain unclean vocals growled or screamed vocals are also judged in this way Some sections without vocals will display circle notes allowing for the microphone to be used as a tambourine and cowbell by tapping it or making vocal cues Overdrive for singers can be deployed by making a brief sound through the microphone during sections of songs denoted by yellow artwork in the background of the vocals interface
A keyboard instrument was introduced with Rock Band Using a special adapter players can use any MIDI compatible electronic keyboard to play such parts with the game A special MIDI compatible key keyboard is manufactured by Mad Catz and is bundled with sales of the new game This unit is shaped like a keytar and is possible to play both sitting down or standing up The unit's neck contains the Overdrive activation button and a touchstrip that acts as an effects bar to alter the tone of the instrument The keyboard unit is not necessary to play non Pro keyboard parts in Rock Band as any compatible guitar controller can also be used similarly the keyboard can be used to play any non Pro guitar or bass parts However a keyboard unit is required for the Pro versions of keyboard parts and can only be played by a keyboard
The primary mode of play in both games is a Band World Tour mode renamed Tour for Rock Band in the first Rock Band this was limited to a band of two or more players playing locally but Rock Band expanded this to any number of players locally or online After choosing a band name and hometown city the band members can create their own rock characters as well as a band logo Once setup is complete the band can begin playing concerts in small venues in their hometown until they unlock vans tour buses and private jets which unlock more cities and different continents Unlocking and completing new gigs unlocks additional songs for play across all game modes Successful performances also earn the band fans used as a metric of measuring the band's popularity stars which accumulate based on the success of each individual song performed and in game cash which each player can spend at the Rock Shop Most cities and larger venues require the band to achieve a certain number of fans and stars before they are unlocked In the process bands can loop through cities multiple times eventually playing larger venues in cities they have already visited In game venues are inspired by real life venues and often display local art styles from each of the represented cities
Players complete unique sets of activities at each venue Performances consist of single songs multiple song sets make your own setlists and mystery setlists Players are also faced with decisions that Harmonix refers to as risk versus reward Bands need to choose which sized venue they perform at carefully as a poor performance at a larger venue poses a greater threat of the band losing fans For certain performances bands are faced with an optional challenge that requires the band to average a certain number of stars for their gig in order to reap the rewards Bands can also choose to perform a benefit concert earning no in game money but gaining more fans or sell out earning more in game money but losing fans Additionally for certain gigs bands can compete for band managers roadies security personnel and sound guys as well as a recording deal with a record label The Endless Setlist allows players to experience an all day concert atmosphere as the setlist requires playing the entire game disc's setlist from beginning to end
Rock Band introduced two new modes Challenges allow a band to play through pre determined setlists arranged via difficulty to earn in game money These Challenges include those based on songs on disc as well as through additional songs from the first Rock Band or from downloadable content A Battle of the Bands mode consists of limited time online tournaments updated on a daily basis Each specific Battle of the Band challenge will have a number of songs and may have specific requirements or limitations for example a challenge may require a vocalist or that the band cannot use Overdrive for the challenge The goal in these challenges is to achieve the best score which may be the numerical score the number of stars earned or the longest streak of consecutive notes played correctly This score is tracked on global leaderboards and allow the players to compare their performance to their friends and others Battle of the Bands challenges utilize both on disc content and other songs the players may have available
The first Rock Band features a more traditional Career mode for a single player on either lead guitar drums or vocals dividing the on disk songs into nine tiers arranged by difficulty of the song for that instrument Each subsequent tier would only be unlocked after completing the songs in the previous tier The player would earn in game money based on their performance This was removed in Rock Band for the improved Tour mode
Quickplay mode allows up to four players to play any song that has been unlocked Single players may play head to head with another player on the same instrument either through Score Battles both playing at the same time to earn the highest score or Tug of War each trading off sections of a song trying to outplay the other Also included are Tutorial Mode which allows players to learn how to play each instrument and Practice Mode which allows players to practice songs for each instrument A more complete Drum Trainer mode was added to Rock Band to help players learn basic drum patterns and drum fills at various speeds
Players can create and customize their own in game character complete with adjustable hair body physique clothing tattoos onstage movements and instruments The PlayStation versions and the Wii version of the original Rock Band do not have this feature Using cash earned within the game the player may purchase items at the in game Rock Shop with which they can customize their rock star The game features an art maker where players can combine different clip art elements to create custom face paint tattoos clothing designs instrument artwork and band logos Bands themselves can create their own logo and in Rock Band players can assign any generated character to stand in for parts that are not presently being played
With the release of Rock Band players are able to use the official Rock Band website to create physical merchandise of their characters and band including posters T shirts as well as six inch tall figurines The official website was well received receiving Webby Award nominations for Best Games Related website and winning the Webby in this category for TheBeatlesRockBand com The custom merchandise service ended on March
The Customization features were overhauled for the release of Rock Band adding additional details to facial customization as opposed to having access only to the game's previous small selection of preset head models and changing the method of unlocking clothing instruments and other accessories to the completion of several Career Goals which are typically score based and range across the variety of instruments including Pro Mode game play modes and songs from the RB release previous titles and downloadable content There is no monetary system in RB however the players still earn fans as in the previous installments
Rock Band Rock Band Rock Band and Rock Band featured soundtracks containing and songs respectively spanning many genres of rock music from the s to s and including licensed music from both well known artists as well as independent groups The majority of songs for Rock Band are master recordings with a handful of cover versions mainly used in Rock Band's early stages while all the music from Rock Band onwards are master recordings
