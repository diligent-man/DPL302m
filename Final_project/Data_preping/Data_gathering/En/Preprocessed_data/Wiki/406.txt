how would you characterize the bank s standing now as against at the time it was incorporated
founded with a capital of us million techcombank was a very small operation with a very strong entrepreneurial spirit to serve vietnam s growing private sector
through the years the bank s capital has grown to around us billion one of the highest in the country
what has remained consistent from the very beginning is techcombank s entrepreneurial spirit and culture
as vietnam s economy grew and became more dynamic techcombank was a pioneer spearheading its development
the founding fathers of the bank came from very strong engineering backgrounds and were not traditional bankers
therefore as an institution techcombank has always used technology as an enabler and has always done things a bit differently compared to other banks
looking back i think that while we are now very different as a leading bank from how we were at the start much bigger much stronger and definitely much more profitable some of the core elements of technology and entrepreneurship have continued
what were some of the most significant challenges the bank encountered in its year journey
between and the whole industry was quite challenged
techcombank was probably the first to come out of that crisis having cleaned up its credit book and being very strong on the capital side
it was a very formative experience for what you are seeing right now and we have strong risk management capabilities and are well capitalized as a result
therefore we need to do things a bit more daringly and break the mold on a regular basis
whenever we think we are done it is actually just the beginning of something new
if you work with us you will see that we are never content always on the move and always trying to do something differently to meet the rapidly changing banking needs of customers as the country the sector and people s living standards evolve
in a way that poses a never ending challenge as movement needs to be managed
but ultimately it s part of our dna and one of our biggest strengths
as you approach your fourth year as ceo of techcombank what do you regard as your most notable achievements
i would say that one of the strategies that we have pushed forward over the last three years is digital transformation
a lot of investments were made to transform the bank and its capabilities
at the same time our customer growth has accelerated
our aspiration is not just to be one of the largest private banks but to shape the transformation of the vietnamese banking industry and be one of the leading banks in the region
to achieve this we needed a different technology platform and to transform into an even more digitally enabled bank focusing on talent data and technology
what are the distinctive architectural design and workspace attributes of your two iconic towers in hanoi and hcmc the two new head office buildings and their significance
while the buildings are very beautiful from the outside we put in a lot of work from the inside
the aim is to create a different work experience for our employees
we tried to answer these questions for the workforce of the future what is required what do people like what are they expecting
for a lot of people employment is not just about money but also the environment they work in
we put ourselves in their shoes and asked if we were in silicon valley singapore or london and decided to come back to vietnam what kind of atmosphere would we expect to find
we then gave this job to fosters partners one of the world s most renowned architectural firms which built the apple headquarters in cupertino
and the spectacular buildings you see now are the result

the headquarters in hanoi was designed with a mindset of fusion between old and new with some of the elements being inspired by the old quarter
on the outside there s a lot of brown and gold and on the inside you come across wooden doors and gold framing
these are typical colors and features of the old quarter
particularly there is a break between the sixth floor and everything upward with the height of the sixth floor matching the old quarter s usual height
on top of that everything has a distinct style building upon the foundation of the old and incorporating new elements
as we put a lot of thought into the architectural design it carries the message we want to convey
it is important for us to be on the one hand a vietnamese bank inheriting vietnamese cultural values but on the other breaking through and doing something new and innovative
these buildings were very much about customer centricity innovation and collaboration with all the working spaces built to accommodate agile ways of working
our employees don t have a specific seat they can work on any floor and at any table
at meetings we can easily reconfigure our staff and bring people together for new teams during breakouts
and while these buildings are a lot about digital enablement and digital tools they are also built with a focus on sustainability and energy efficiency making sure that we don t waste resources but make the most of them
it was outlined at the annual general meeting that techcombank will place greater emphasis on its retail segment while diminishing its dependence on corporate clients
has there been any deviation from this
we are still very clear that we want to do more retail and sme lending and that we don t want to expand our corporate exposure as a proportion of the total bank wide book
however as we operate a need based model and a customer centric approach this may not hold during certain periods
for example based on our quarterly analysis we need to watch what is happening in the market right now
in the retail segment credit demand has been soft due to high interest rates
in addition when we look at smes manufacturing and some other areas there is not a lot of demand for credit
even if we had given away money at much lower rates these companies would not have taken it
in this environment the big companies and corporations are usually the ones who fare better because they have much more diversified cash flow streams
so as we were looking at where the needs were and where the risk adjusted returns were better it was on the corporate side
that being said it does not mean we won t reallocate funds back into retail and focus on smes which is actually our desired direction
when you examine our financial data you will notice that some figures particularly on the corporate side represent short term working capital financing
this flexibility allows us to transition relatively quickly to other segments and sectors
so i believe our strategy remains intact our primary focus is still on retail
however in the current circumstances we might continue to emphasize corporate lending because it appears to be less risky
nevertheless as the market evolves we will gradually shift our focus back to retail and smes
this is more of a timing issue than a strategy issue
can we expect techcombank to offer a dividend gift to shareholders to celebrate its th anniversary as its chairman said at the agm
the chairman s directive years ago was to not pay dividends for years and so now is the time to revisit that statement
in essence we always look at the optimization of capital and one of the key areas is to maintain a capital adequacy ratio in line with prudent banking practices
in addition we want to make sure we can continue a earnings growth trajectory
to date we have maintained this through our own retained earnings with no need to tap the markets for more capital
when we issued the policy years ago we were in a very different position
after a decade of delivering strong results techcombank has grown to become the private sector bank in vietnam with a strong retail banking focus and best in market digital banking capabilities
today the bank generates over vnd trillion million in profits annually the highest among private sector banks in vietnam
now as we look at the bank s earnings potential and the changes in upcoming regulations we believe that we can maintain that trajectory of earnings growth and car while still paying regular cash dividends to reward the bank s shareholders
as we are analyzing whether we can maintain such a policy for the next five to years it is important to note that we make our decision from a capital management perspective and not just as a birthday gift
when the board decides if there will be a change in our dividend policy i am sure they will make the proper announcements
but from the current analysis it seems that we clearly have options

can you elaborate on techcombank s strategy for sustainability and responsible banking since the former is becoming an increasingly important factor in the banking and finance world
when it comes to sustainability a lot of people interpret it only as green financing or keeping climate neutral
while these are important elements for me creating a sustainable business means building it with a solid foundation and making sure it can last through the natural boom bust cycles of the economy
that principle has always run deep in our hearts
on the business side we try to help our customers gain clarity on what and how they can build their own sustainable companies
with the help of organizations like usaid and the adb we work to provide financing solutions and are committed to providing around billion in financing for sustainable projects
at the moment there is probably not enough demand in the industry as people still consider sustainability a nice to have
we are shifting away from that mentality gradually and techcombank has built in house capabilities to channel green financing to our customers but there is still more work to be done
internally within our daily operations all the rooms in our new buildings are closely monitored electrically
we have installed significant sensor technology in our offices to optimize our energy efficiency
if there is not enough movement lights and air conditioners will be automatically turned down
if we can keep our costs down we will be able to provide our products and services at a better price for our customers
personally i think we should not think about sustainability as a do good exercise
rather it needs to be integrated deeply with economic sense and increasingly people will start to understand and internalize that concept
