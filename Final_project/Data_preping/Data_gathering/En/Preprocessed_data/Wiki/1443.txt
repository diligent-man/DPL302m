the inquisition was a group of institutions within the catholic church whose aim was to combat heresy conducting trials of suspected heretics
studies of the records have found that the overwhelming majority of sentences consisted of penances but that cases of repeat unrepentant heretics were handed over to the secular courts which generally resulted in execution or life imprisonment
the inquisition had its start in the th century kingdom of france with the aim of combating religious deviation e g
apostasy or heresy particularly among the cathars and the waldensians
the inquisitorial courts from this time until the mid th century are together known as the medieval inquisition
other groups investigated during the medieval inquisition which primarily took place in france and italy include the spiritual franciscans the hussites and the beguines
beginning in the s inquisitors were generally chosen from members of the dominican order replacing the earlier practice of using local clergy as judges
during the late middle ages and the early renaissance the scope of the inquisition grew significantly in response to the protestant reformation and the catholic counter reformation
during this period the inquisition conducted by the holy see was known as the roman inquisition
the inquisition also expanded to other european countries resulting in the spanish inquisition and the portuguese inquisition
the spanish and portuguese inquisitions focused particularly on the anusim people who were forced to abandon judaism against their will and on muslim converts to catholicism
the scale of the persecution of converted muslims and converted jews in spain and portugal was the result of suspicions that they had secretly reverted to their previous religions although both religious minority groups were also more numerous on the iberian peninsula than in other parts of europe
during this time spain and portugal operated inquisitorial courts not only in europe but also throughout their empires in africa asia and the americas
this resulted in the goa inquisition the peruvian inquisition and the mexican inquisition among others
with the exception of the papal states the institution of the inquisition was abolished in the early th century after the napoleonic wars in europe and the spanish american wars of independence in the americas
the institution survived as part of the roman curia but in it was renamed the supreme sacred congregation of the holy office
in it became the congregation for the doctrine of the faith
the term inquisition comes from the medieval latin word inquisitio which described any court process based on roman law which had gradually come back into use during the late middle ages
today the english term inquisition can apply to any one of several institutions that worked against heretics or other offenders against canon law within the judicial system of the roman catholic church
although the term inquisition is usually applied to ecclesiastical courts of the catholic church it refers to a judicial process not an organization
inquisitors were called such because they applied a judicial technique known as inquisitio which could be translated as inquiry or inquest in this process which was already widely used by secular rulers henry ii used it extensively in england in the twelfth century an official inquirer called for information on a specific subject from anyone who felt he or she had something to offer
the inquisition as a church court had no jurisdiction over muslims and jews as such
generally the inquisition was concerned only with the heretical behaviour of catholic adherents or converts
the overwhelming majority of sentences seem to have consisted of penances like wearing a cross sewn on one s clothes going on pilgrimage etc
when a suspect was convicted of unrepentant heresy canon law required the inquisitorial tribunal to hand the person over to secular authorities for final sentencing
a secular magistrate the secular arm would then determine the penalty based on local law
those local laws included proscriptions against certain religious crimes heresy etc and the punishments included death by burning although the penalty was more usually banishment or imprisonment for life which was generally commuted after a few years
thus the inquisitors generally knew the fate which expected anyone so remanded
the edition of the directorium inquisitorum a standard inquisitorial manual spelled out the purpose of inquisitorial penalties
quoniam punitio non refertur primo per se in correctionem bonum eius qui punitur sed in bonum publicum ut alij terreantur a malis committendis avocentur translation
for punishment does not take place primarily and per se for the correction and good of the person punished but for the public good in order that others may become terrified and weaned away from the evils they would commit
before the catholic church suppressed what they believed to be heresy usually through a system of ecclesiastical proscription or imprisonment but without using torture
and seldom resorting to executions
such punishments were opposed by a number of clergymen and theologians although some countries punished heresy with the death penalty
pope siricius ambrose of milan and martin of tours protested against the execution of priscillian largely as an undue interference in ecclesiastical discipline by a civil tribunal
though widely viewed as a heretic priscillian was executed as a sorcerer
ambrose refused to give any recognition to ithacius of ossonuba not wishing to have anything to do with bishops who had sent heretics to their death
in the th century to counter the spread of catharism prosecution of heretics became more frequent
the church charged councils composed of bishops and archbishops with establishing inquisitions the episcopal inquisition
the first inquisition was temporarily established in languedoc south of france in
the murder of pope innocent s papal legate pierre de castelnau in sparked the albigensian crusade
the inquisition was permanently established in council of toulouse run largely by the dominicans in rome and later at carcassonne in languedoc
historians use the term medieval inquisition to describe the various inquisitions that started around including the episcopal inquisition s and later the papal inquisition s
these inquisitions responded to large popular movements throughout europe considered apostate or heretical to christianity in particular the cathars in southern france and the waldensians in both southern france and northern italy
other inquisitions followed after these first inquisition movements
the legal basis for some inquisitorial activity came from pope innocent iv s papal bull ad extirpanda of which explicitly authorized and defined the appropriate circumstances for the use of torture by the inquisition for eliciting confessions from heretics
however nicholas eymerich the inquisitor who wrote the directorium inquisitorum stated quaestiones sunt fallaces et ineficaces interrogations via torture are misleading and futile
by inquisitors were given absolution if they used instruments of torture
in the th century pope gregory ix reigned assigned the duty of carrying out inquisitions to the dominican order and franciscan order
by the end of the middle ages england and castile were the only large western nations without a papal inquisition
most inquisitors were friars who taught theology and or law in the universities
they used inquisitorial procedures a common legal practice adapted from the earlier ancient roman court procedures
they judged heresy along with bishops and groups of assessors clergy serving in a role that was roughly analogous to a jury or legal advisers using the local authorities to establish a tribunal and to prosecute heretics
after a grand inquisitor headed each inquisition
grand inquisitions persisted until the mid th century
with the sharpening of debate and of conflict between the protestant reformation and the catholic counter reformation protestant societies came to see use the inquisition as a terrifying other while staunch catholics regarded the holy office as a necessary bulwark against the spread of reprehensible heresies
while belief in witchcraft and persecutions directed at or excused by it were widespread in pre christian europe and reflected in germanic law the influence of the church in the early medieval era resulted in the revocation of these laws in many places bringing an end to traditional pagan witch hunts
throughout the medieval era mainstream christian teaching had denied the existence of witches and witchcraft condemning it as pagan superstition
however christian influence on popular beliefs in witches and maleficium harm committed by magic failed to entirely eradicate folk belief in witches
the fierce denunciation and persecution of supposed sorceresses that characterized the cruel witchhunts of a later age were not generally found in the first thirteen hundred years of the christian era
the medieval church distinguished between white and black magic
local folk practice often mixed chants incantations and prayers to the appropriate patron saint to ward off storms to protect cattle or ensure a good harvest
bonfires on midsummer s eve were intended to deflect natural catastrophes or the influence of fairies ghosts and witches
plants often harvested under particular conditions were deemed effective in healing
black magic was that which was used for a malevolent purpose
this was generally dealt with through confession repentance and charitable work assigned as penance
early irish canons treated sorcery as a crime to be visited with excommunication until adequate penance had been performed
in pope alexander iv ruled that inquisitors should limit their involvement to those cases in which there was some clear presumption of heretical belief
the prosecution of witchcraft generally became more prominent in the late medieval and renaissance era perhaps driven partly by the upheavals of the era the black death the hundred years war and a gradual cooling of the climate that modern scientists call the little ice age between about the th and th centuries
witches were sometimes blamed
since the years of most intense witch hunting largely coincide with the age of the reformation some historians point to the influence of the reformation on the european witch hunt
dominican priest heinrich kramer was assistant to the archbishop of salzburg
in kramer requested that pope innocent viii clarify his authority to prosecute witchcraft in germany where he had been refused assistance by the local ecclesiastical authorities
they maintained that kramer could not legally function in their areas
the papal bull summis desiderantes affectibus sought to remedy this jurisdictional dispute by specifically identifying the dioceses of mainz k ln trier salzburg and bremen
some scholars view the bull as clearly political
the bull failed to ensure that kramer obtained the support he had hoped for
in fact he was subsequently expelled from the city of innsbruck by the local bishop george golzer who ordered kramer to stop making false accusations
golzer described kramer as senile in letters written shortly after the incident
this rebuke led kramer to write a justification of his views on witchcraft in his book malleus maleficarum hammer against witches
in the book kramer stated his view that witchcraft was to blame for bad weather
the book is also noted for its animus against women
despite kramer s claim that the book gained acceptance from the clergy at the university of cologne it was in fact condemned by the clergy at cologne for advocating views that violated catholic doctrine and standard inquisitorial procedure
in the spanish inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the malleus said
portugal and spain in the late middle ages consisted largely of multicultural territories of muslim and jewish influence reconquered from islamic control and the new christian authorities could not assume that all their subjects would suddenly become and remain orthodox roman catholics
so the inquisition in iberia in the lands of the reconquista counties and kingdoms like le n castile and aragon had a special socio political basis as well as more fundamental religious motives
in some parts of spain towards the end of the th century there was a wave of violent anti judaism encouraged by the preaching of ferrand martinez archdeacon of cija
in the pogroms of june in seville hundreds of jews were killed and the synagogue was completely destroyed
the number of people killed was also high in other cities such as c rdoba valencia and barcelona
one of the consequences of these pogroms was the mass conversion of thousands of surviving jews
forced baptism was contrary to the law of the catholic church and theoretically anybody who had been forcibly baptized could legally return to judaism
however this was very narrowly interpreted
legal definitions of the time theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament but confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force
a person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert and accordingly forbidden to revert to judaism
after the public violence many of the converted felt it safer to remain in their new religion
thus after a new social group appeared and were referred to as conversos or new christians
king ferdinand ii of aragon and queen isabella i of castile established the spanish inquisition in
in contrast to the previous inquisitions it operated completely under royal christian authority though staffed by clergy and orders and independently of the holy see
it operated in spain and in most spanish colonies and territories which included the canary islands the kingdom of sicily and all spanish possessions in north central and south america
it primarily focused upon forced converts from islam moriscos conversos and secret moors and from judaism conversos crypto jews and marranos both groups still resided in spain after the end of the islamic control of spain who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or of having fallen back into it
in all jews who had not converted were expelled from spain those who converted became nominal catholics and thus subject to the inquisition
in the americas king philip ii set up three tribunals each formally titled tribunal del santo oficio de la inquisici n in one in mexico cartagena de indias in modern day colombia and peru
the mexican office administered mexico central and southeastern mexico nueva galicia northern and western mexico the audiencias of guatemala guatemala chiapas el salvador honduras nicaragua costa rica and the spanish east indies
the peruvian inquisition based in lima administered all the spanish territories in south america and panama
the portuguese inquisition formally started in portugal in at the request of king jo o iii
manuel i had asked pope leo x for the installation of the inquisition in but only after his death in did pope paul iii acquiesce
at its head stood a grande inquisidor or general inquisitor named by the pope but selected by the crown and always from within the royal family
the portuguese inquisition principally focused upon the sephardi jews whom the state forced to convert to christianity
spain had expelled its sephardi population in many of these spanish jews left spain for portugal but eventually were subject to inquisition there as well
the portuguese inquisition held its first auto da f in
the portuguese inquisitors mostly focused upon the jewish new christians i e
conversos or marranos
the portuguese inquisition expanded its scope of operations from portugal to its colonial possessions including brazil cape verde and goa
in the colonies it continued as a religious court investigating and trying cases of breaches of the tenets of orthodox roman catholicism until
king jo o iii reigned extended the activity of the courts to cover censorship divination witchcraft and bigamy
originally oriented for a religious action the inquisition exerted an influence over almost every aspect of portuguese society political cultural and social
according to henry charles lea between and tribunals in lisbon porto coimbra and vora resulted in the burning of persons the burning of another in effigy and the penancing of
but documentation of out of autos da f has disappeared so these numbers may slightly understate the activity
the goa inquisition began in at the order of john iii of portugal
it had originally been requested in a letter in the s by jesuit priest francis xavier because of the new christians who had arrived in goa and then reverted to judaism
the goa inquisition also focused upon catholic converts from hinduism or islam who were thought to have returned to their original ways
in addition this inquisition prosecuted non converts who broke prohibitions against the public observance of hindu or muslim rites or interfered with portuguese attempts to convert non christians to catholicism
aleixo dias falc o and francisco marques set it up in the palace of the sabaio adil khan
the inquisition was active in colonial brazil
the religious mystic and formerly enslaved prostitute rosa egipc aca was arrested interrogated and imprisoned both in the colony and in lisbon
egipc aca was the first black woman in brazil to write a book this work detailed her visions and was entitled sagrada teologia do amor divino das almas peregrinas
with the protestant reformation catholic authorities became much more ready to suspect heresy in any new ideas
including those of renaissance humanism previously strongly supported by many at the top of the church hierarchy
the extirpation of heretics became a much broader and more complex enterprise complicated by the politics of territorial protestant powers especially in northern europe
the catholic church could no longer exercise direct influence in the politics and justice systems of lands that officially adopted protestantism
thus war the french wars of religion the thirty years war massacre the st
bartholomew s day massacre and the missional and propaganda work by the sacra congregatio de propaganda fide of the counter reformation came to play larger roles in these circumstances and the roman law type of a judicial approach to heresy represented by the inquisition became less important overall
in pope paul iii established the congregation of the holy office of the inquisition as a permanent congregation staffed with cardinals and other officials
it had the tasks of maintaining and defending the integrity of the faith and of examining and proscribing errors and false doctrines it thus became the supervisory body of local inquisitions
arguably the most famous case tried by the roman inquisition was that of galileo galilei in
the penances and sentences for those who confessed or were found guilty were pronounced together in a public ceremony at the end of all the processes
this was the sermo generalis or auto da f
penances not matters for the civil authorities might consist of a pilgrimage a public scourging a fine or the wearing of a cross
the wearing of two tongues of red or other brightly colored cloth sewn onto an outer garment in an x pattern marked those who were under investigation
the penalties in serious cases were confiscation of property by the inquisition or imprisonment
this led to the possibility of false charges to enable confiscation being made against those over a certain income particularly rich marranos
following the french invasion of the new authorities sent chests containing over inquisition documents to france from rome
by decree of napoleon s government in the inquisition in venice was abolished in
in portugal in the wake of the liberal revolution of the general extraordinary and constituent courts of the portuguese nation abolished the portuguese inquisition in
the wars of independence of the former spanish colonies in the americas concluded with the abolition of the inquisition in every quarter of hispanic america between and
the last execution of the inquisition was in spain in
this was the execution by garroting of the school teacher cayetano ripoll for purportedly teaching deism in his school
in spain the practices of the inquisition were finally outlawed in
in italy the restoration of the pope as the ruler of the papal states in brought back the inquisition to the papal states
it remained active there until the late th century notably in the well publicised mortara affair
in the name of the congregation became the sacred congregation of the holy office which in further changed to congregation for the doctrine of the faith as retained to the present day
beginning in the th century historians have gradually compiled statistics drawn from the surviving court records from which estimates have been calculated by adjusting the recorded number of convictions by the average rate of document loss for each time period
gustav henningsen and jaime contreras studied the records of the spanish inquisition which list cases of which resulted in executions in person and in effigy i e
a straw dummy was burned in place of the person
william monter estimated there were executions between and between and
jean pierre dedieu studied the records of toledo s tribunal which put people on trial
for the period prior to henry kamen estimated there were about executions in all of spain s tribunals
italian renaissance history professor and inquisition expert carlo ginzburg had his doubts about using statistics to reach a judgment about the period
in many cases we don t have the evidence the evidence has been lost said ginzburg
in the monty python comedy team s spanish inquisition sketches an inept inquisitor group repeatedly bursts into scenes after someone utters the words i didn t expect a kind of spanish inquisition screaming nobody expects the spanish inquisition the inquisition then uses ineffectual forms of torture including a dish drying rack soft cushions and a comfy chair
