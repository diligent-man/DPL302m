the american species survival plan or ssp program was developed in by the american association of zoos and aquariums to help ensure the survival of selected species in zoos and aquariums most of which are threatened or endangered in the wild
ssp programs focus on animals that are near threatened threatened endangered or otherwise in danger of extinction in the wild when zoo and zoology conservationists believe captive breeding programs will aid in their chances of survival
these programs help maintain healthy and genetically diverse animal populations within the aza accredited zoo community
aza accredited zoos and aza conservation partners that are involved in ssp programs engage in cooperative population management and conservation efforts that include research conservation genetics public education reintroduction and in situ or field conservation projects
there are currently species covered by ssp programs throughout north america
the ssp has been met with widespread success in ensuring that should a species population become functionally extinct in its natural habitat a viable population still exists within a zoological setting
this has also led to aza species reintroduction programs examples of which include the black footed ferret the california condor the northern riffleshell the golden lion tamarin the karner blue butterfly the oregon spotted frog the palila finch the red wolf and the wyoming toad
an ssp master plan is a document produced by the ssp coordinator generally a zoo professional under the guidance of an elected management committee for a certain species
this document sets ex situ population goals and other management recommendations to achieve the maximum genetic diversity and demographic stability for a species given transfer and space constraints
