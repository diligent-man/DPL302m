oahu o hu hawaiian o ahu pronounced o hu also known as the gathering place is the third largest of the hawaiian islands
it is home to roughly one million people over two thirds of the population of the u s
state of hawaii
the island is within honolulu county and the state capital honolulu is on oahu s southeast coast
the island of oahu constitutes the bulk of honolulu county and had a population of according to the u s
census up from people in approximately of the total population of hawaii with approximately of those living in or near the honolulu urban area
the island of o ahu in hawaii is often nicknamed or translated as the gathering place
it appears that o ahu grew into this nickname it is currently the most populated hawaiian island however in ancient times o ahu was not populous and was outranked by the status of other islands
the translation of gathering place was suggested as recently as by hawaiian almanac author thomas thrum
it has been speculated that thrum ignored or misplaced the okina because the hawaiian phrase o ahu could be translated as gathering of objects o is a subject marker and ahu means to gather
the term o ahu has no confirmed meaning in hawaiian other than that of the place itself
the city of honolulu largest city state capital and main deepwater marine port for the state of hawai i is located here
as a jurisdictional unit the entire island of oahu is in honolulu county although as a place name honolulu occupies only a portion of the southeast end of the island
well known features found on oahu include waikiki pearl harbor diamond head hanauma k ne ohe bay kailua bay north shore and the resort destination ko olina
while the island is designated the city and county of honolulu excluding the minor northwestern hawaiian islands residents identify settlements using town names generally those of the census designated places and consider the island to be divided into various areas which may overlap
the most commonly accepted areas are the city town or town side which is the urbanized area from halawa to the area below diamond head residents of the island north of the ko olau mountains consider the town side to be the entire southern half west oahu which goes from pearl harbor to kapolei ewa and may include the m kaha and wai anae areas the north shore northwestern coast the windward side northeastern coast from kahuku to k ne ohe the east side or east coast the eastern portion of the island from k ne ohe on the northeast around the tip of the island to include much of the area east of diamond head and the valley or central oahu which runs northwest from pearl harbor toward hale iwa
these terms are somewhat flexible depending on the area in which the user lives and are used in a mostly general way but residents of each area identify strongly with their part of the island especially those outside of widely known towns
for instance if locals are asked where they live they would usually reply windward oahu rather than laie
the island has been inhabited since at least the rd century a d
the year old kingdom of o ahu was once ruled by the most ancient ali i in all of the hawaiian islands
the first great king of o ahu was ma ilik kahi the lawmaker who was followed by many generation of monarchs
kuali i was the first of the warlike kings and so were his sons
in the throne fell upon kahahana the son of elani of ewa
in kahekili ii king of maui conquered o ahu and deposed the reigning family and then made his son kalanik pule king of o ahu turning o ahu into a puppet state
kamehameha the great would conquer in the mountain kalanik pule s force in the battle of nu uanu
kamehameha founded the kingdom of hawai i with the conquest of o ahu in
hawai i would not be unified until the islands of kaua i and ni ihau surrendered under king kaumuali i in
kamehameha iii moved his capital from l hain maui to honolulu o ahu in
iolani palace built later by other members of the royal family is still standing and is the only royal palace on american soil
oahu was apparently the first of the hawaiian islands sighted by the crew of hms resolution on january during captain james cook s third pacific expedition
escorted by hms discovery the expedition was surprised to find high islands this far north in the central pacific
oahu was not actually visited by europeans until february when captain charles clerke aboard hms resolution stepped ashore at waimea bay
clerke had taken command of the ship after james cook was killed at kealakekua bay island of hawai i on february and was leaving the islands for the north pacific
with the discovery of the hawaiian islands came the introduction of disease mosquitoes and aggressive foreign animals
although indirect the simple exposure to these foreign species caused permanent damage to the native hawaiian people and environment
the imperial japanese navy s attack on pearl harbor oahu on the morning of december brought the united states into world war ii
the surprise attack was aimed at destroying the american will to fight and make them sue for peace immediately by attacking the pacific fleet of the united states navy and its defending army air forces and marine air forces
the attack damaged or destroyed twelve american warships destroyed aircraft and resulted in the deaths of american servicemen and civilians of those were the result of the destruction of the uss arizona alone
today oahu has become a tourism and shopping haven
over five million visitors mainly from the contiguous united states and japan flock there every year to enjoy the island
visitors should be aware that some of the police vehicles on oahu and on the big island of hawai i are unmarked except for the blue lights mounted on their roofs

being roughly diamond shaped surrounded by ocean and divided by mountain ranges directions on oahu are not generally described with the compass directions found throughout the world
locals instead use directions originally using honolulu as the central point
to go ewa means traveling toward the western tip of the island diamond head is toward the eastern tip mauka is inland toward the central ko olau mountain range north of honolulu and makai toward the sea
when these directions became common diamond head was the eastern edge of the primary populated area
today with a much larger populace and extensive development the mountain itself is often not actually to the east when directions are given and is not to be used as a literal point of reference to go diamond head is to go to the east from anywhere on the island
