The Island of O ahu in Hawaii is often nicknamed or translated as The Gathering Place It appears that O ahu grew into this nickname it is currently the most populated Hawaiian Island however in ancient times O ahu was not populous and was outranked by the status of other islands The translation of gathering place was suggested as recently as by Hawaiian Almanac author Thomas Thrum It has been speculated that Thrum ignored or misplaced the okina because the Hawaiian phrase o ahu could be translated as gathering of objects o is a subject marker and ahu means to gather The term O ahu has no confirmed meaning in Hawaiian other than that of the place itself
