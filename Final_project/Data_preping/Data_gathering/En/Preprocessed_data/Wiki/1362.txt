Oahu oʊˈɑːhuː Hawaiian Oʻahu pronounced oˈʔɐhu also known as The Gathering Place is the third-largest of the Hawaiian Islands
It is home to roughly one million people—over two-thirds of the population of the US
The island is within Honolulu County and the state capital Honolulu is on Oahu's southeast coast
The island of Oahu constitutes the bulk of Honolulu County and had a population of according to the US
Census up from people in approximately of the total population of Hawaii with approximately of those living in or near the Honolulu urban area
The Island of Oʻahu in Hawaii is often nicknamed or translated as The Gathering Place
It appears that Oʻahu grew into this nickname it is currently the most populated Hawaiian Island however in ancient times Oʻahu was not populous and was outranked by the status of other islands
The translation of gathering place was suggested as recently as by Hawaiian Almanac author Thomas Thrum
It has been speculated that Thrum ignored or misplaced the ʻokina because the Hawaiian phrase ʻo ahu could be translated as gathering of objects ʻo is a subject marker and ahu means to gather
The term Oʻahu has no confirmed meaning in Hawaiian other than that of the place itself
The city of Honolulu—largest city state capital and main deepwater marine port for the State of Hawaiʻi—is located here
As a jurisdictional unit the entire island of Oahu is in Honolulu County although as a place name Honolulu occupies only a portion of the southeast end of the island
Well-known features found on Oahu include Waikiki Pearl Harbor Diamond Head Hanauma Kāneʻohe Bay Kailua Bay North Shore and the resort destination Ko Olina
While the island is designated the City and County of Honolulu excluding the minor Northwestern Hawaiian Islands residents identify settlements using town names generally those of the census-designated places and consider the island to be divided into various areas which may overlap
The most commonly accepted areas are the City Town or Town side which is the urbanized area from Halawa to the area below Diamond Head residents of the island north of the Koʻolau Mountains consider the Town Side to be the entire southern half West Oahu which goes from Pearl Harbor to Kapolei ʻEwa and may include the Mākaha and Waiʻanae areas the North Shore northwestern coast the Windward Side northeastern coast from Kahuku to Kāneʻohe the East Side or East Coast the eastern portion of the island from Kāneʻohe on the northeast around the tip of the island to include much of the area east of Diamond Head and The Valley or Central Oahu which runs northwest from Pearl Harbor toward Haleʻiwa
These terms are somewhat flexible depending on the area in which the user lives and are used in a mostly general way but residents of each area identify strongly with their part of the island especially those outside of widely-known towns
For instance if locals are asked where they live they would usually reply Windward Oahu rather than Laie
The island has been inhabited since at least the rd century AD
The -year-old Kingdom of Oʻahu was once ruled by the most ancient aliʻi in all of the Hawaiian Islands
The first great king of Oʻahu was Maʻilikūkahi the lawmaker who was followed by many generation of monarchs
Kualiʻi was the first of the warlike kings and so were his sons
In the throne fell upon Kahahana the son of Elani of Ewa
In Kahekili II King of Maui conquered Oʻahu and deposed the reigning family and then made his son Kalanikūpule king of O'ahu turning O'ahu into a puppet state
Kamehameha the Great would conquer in the mountain Kalanikūpule's force in the Battle of Nuʻuanu
Kamehameha founded the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi with the conquest of Oʻahu in
Hawaiʻi would not be unified until the islands of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau surrendered under King Kaumualiʻi in
Kamehameha III moved his capital from Lāhainā Maui to Honolulu Oʻahu in
ʻIolani Palace built later by other members of the royal family is still standing and is the only royal palace on American soil
Oahu was apparently the first of the Hawaiian Islands sighted by the crew of HMS Resolution on January during Captain James Cook's third Pacific expedition
Escorted by HMS Discovery the expedition was surprised to find high islands this far north in the central Pacific
Oahu was not actually visited by Europeans until February when Captain Charles Clerke aboard HMS Resolution stepped ashore at Waimea Bay
Clerke had taken command of the ship after James Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay island of Hawaiʻi on February and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific
With the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands came the introduction of disease mosquitoes and aggressive foreign animals
Although indirect the simple exposure to these foreign species caused permanent damage to the Native Hawaiian people and environment
The Imperial Japanese Navy's attack on Pearl Harbor Oahu on the morning of December brought the United States into World War II
The surprise attack was aimed at destroying the American will to fight and make them sue for peace immediately by attacking the Pacific Fleet of the United States Navy and its defending Army Air Forces and Marine Air Forces
The attack damaged or destroyed twelve American warships destroyed aircraft and resulted in the deaths of American servicemen and civilians of those were the result of the destruction of the USS Arizona alone

Oahu is miles km long and miles km across
Including small associated islands such as Ford Island plus those in Kāneʻohe Bay and off the eastern windward coast its area is square miles km making it the th-largest island in the United StatesThe windward side is known for some of the most beautiful beaches in the world
Lanikai Beach on the windward coast of Oahu has been consistently ranked among the best beaches in the world
The island is composed of two separate shield volcanoes the Waiʻanae and Koʻolau Ranges with a broad valley or saddle the central Oahu Plain between them
The highest point is Kaʻala in the Waiʻanae Range rising to feet m above sea level
Being roughly diamond-shaped surrounded by ocean and divided by mountain ranges directions on Oahu are not generally described with the compass directions found throughout the world
Locals instead use directions originally using Honolulu as the central point
To go ʻewa means traveling toward the western tip of the island Diamond Head is toward the eastern tip mauka is inland toward the central Koʻolau Mountain range north of Honolulu and makai toward the sea
When these directions became common Diamond Head was the eastern edge of the primary populated area
Today with a much larger populace and extensive development the mountain itself is often not actually to the east when directions are given and is not to be used as a literal point of reference—to go Diamond Head is to go to the east from anywhere on the island
