white slavery also white slave trade or white slave trafficking refers to the slavery of europeans whether by non europeans such as west asians and north africans or by other europeans for example naval galley slaves or the vikings thralls
slaves of european origin were present in ancient rome and the ottoman empire
many different types of white people were enslaved
on the european continent under feudalism there were various forms of status applying to people such as serf bordar villein vagabond and slave who were indentured or forced to labor without pay
under muslim rule the arab slave trades that included caucasian captives were often fueled by raids into european territories or were taken as children in the form of a blood tax from the families of citizens of conquered territories to serve the empire for a variety of functions
in the mid th century the term white slavery was used to describe the christian slaves that were sold into the barbary slave trade
the modern legal term applies more narrowly to sexual slavery forced prostitution and human trafficking with less focus on the race of victims or perpetrators
the phrase white slavery was used by charles sumner in to describe the slavery of christians throughout the barbary states and primarily in algiers the capital of ottoman algeria
it also encompassed many forms of slavery including the european concubines cariye often found in turkish harems
the term was also used by clifford g
roe from the beginning of the twentieth century to campaign against the forced prostitution and sexual slavery of girls who worked in chicago brothels
similarly countries of europe signed in paris in an international agreement for the suppression of the white slave traffic aimed at combating the sale of women who were forced into prostitution in the countries of continental europe
the volga trade route was established by the varangians vikings who settled in northwestern russia in the early th century
about km mi south of the volkhov river entry into lake ladoga they established a settlement called ladoga old norse aldeigjuborg
it connected northern europe and northwestern russia with the caspian sea via the volga river
the rus used this route to trade with muslim countries on the southern shores of the caspian sea sometimes penetrating as far as baghdad
the route functioned concurrently with the dnieper trade route better known as the trade route from the varangians to the greeks and lost its importance in the th century
saqaliba originally was used to denote slavic people however later it came to denote all european slaves in some muslim regions like spain including those abducted from raids on christian kingdoms of spain
the franks started buying slaves from the slavs and avar khaganate while muslims also came across slaves in the form of mercenaries serving the byzantine empire and settlers in addition to among the khazars
most slavic slaves were imported to the muslim world through the border between christian and islamic kingdoms where castration centres were also located instead of the direct route
from there they were sent into islamic spain and other muslim ruled regions especially north africa
the saqaliba gained popularity in umayyad spain especially as warriors
after the collapse of the umayyads they also came to rule over many of the taifas
with the conversion of eastern europe the trade declined and there isn t much textual information on saqaliba after th century
central europe was the most favoured destination for importation of slaves alongside central asia and bilad as sudan though slaves from northwestern europe were also valued
this slave trade was controlled mostly by european slave traders
france and venice were the routes used to send slavic slaves to muslim lands and prague served as a major centre for castration of slavic captives
the emirate of bari also served as an important port for this trade
due to the byzantine empire and venice blocking arab merchants from european ports they later started importing in slaves from the caucasus and the caspian sea
the saqaliba were also imported as eunuchs and concubines to muslim states
the slavery of eunuchs in the muslim world however was expensive and they thus were given as gifts by rulers
the saqaliba eunuchs were prominent at the court of aghlabids and later fatimids who imported them from spain
the fatimids also used other saqaliba slaves for military purposes
in the time of the crimean khanate crimeans engaged in frequent raids into the danubian principalities poland lithuania and muscovy
for each captive the khan received a fixed share sav a of percent or percent
the campaigns by crimean forces categorize into sefers declared military operations led by the khans themselves and apuls raids undertaken by groups of noblemen sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers
for a long time until the early th century the khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the ottoman empire and the middle east
caffa was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets
crimean tatar raiders enslaved between and million slaves from russia and poland lithuania over the period
caffa city on crimean peninsula was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets
in a last major tatar raid resulted in the capture of russian and ruthenian slaves
slave markets flourished on the barbary coast of north africa in what is modern day morocco algeria tunisia and western libya between the th and middle of the th century
these markets prospered while the states were nominally under ottoman suzerainty though in reality they were mostly autonomous
the north african slave markets traded in european slaves which were acquired by barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from italy to spain portugal france england the netherlands and as far afield as the turkish abductions in iceland
men women and children were captured to such a devastating extent that vast numbers of sea coast towns were abandoned
according to robert davis between million and million europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa and ottoman empire between the th and th centuries
however to extrapolate his numbers davis assumes the number of european slaves captured by barbary pirates was constant for a year period stating
davis s numbers have been challenged by other historians such as david earle who cautions that the true picture of european slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non christian whites from eastern europe and black people from west africa
a second book by davis holy war and human bondage tales of christian muslim slavery in the early modern mediterranean widened its focus to related slavery
it is also worth noting that there were wide fluctuations from year to year particularly in the th and th centuries and also given the fact that prior to the s there are no consistent records
middle east expert john wright cautions that modern estimates are based on back calculations from human observation
such observations across the late s and early s observers account for around european christian slaves held throughout this period on the barbary coast across tripoli and tunis but mostly in algiers
the majority were sailors particularly those who were english taken with their ships but others were fishermen and coastal villagers
however most of these captives were people from lands close to africa particularly spain and italy
from bases on the barbary coast of north africa the barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of africa plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured
from at least the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of italy spain france england the netherlands and as far away as iceland capturing men women and children
on some occasions settlements such as baltimore ireland were abandoned following the raid only being resettled many years later
between and england alone had merchant ships lost to barbary pirates
while barbary corsairs looted the cargo of ships they captured their primary goal was to capture people for sale as slaves or for ransom
those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive but not obliged to work the most famous of these was the author miguel de cervantes who was held for almost five years
others were sold into various types of servitude
attractive women or boys could be used as sex slaves
captives who converted to islam were generally freed since enslavement of muslims was prohibited but this meant that they could never return to their native countries
moroccan sultan moulay ismail ben sharif controlled a fleet of corsairs based at sal le vieux and sal le neuf now rabat which supplied him with christian slaves and weapons through their raids in the mediterranean and all the way to the black sea
moulay ismail was nicknamed the bloody king by the europeans due to his extreme cruelty and exaction of summary justice upon his christian slaves
he is also known in his native country as the warrior king
th and th century customs statistics suggest that istanbul s additional slave import from the black sea may have totaled around million from to
the markets declined after the loss of the barbary wars and ended in the s when the region was conquered by france
during the al andalus also known as islamic iberia the moors controlled much of the peninsula
muslim spain imported christian slaves from the th century until the reconquista in the late th century
the slaves were exported from the christian region of spain as well as from eastern europe sparking significant reaction from many in christian spain and many christians still living in muslim spain
soon after muslims were successful taking christian captives from spain
in the eighth century slavery lasted longer due to frequent cross border skirmishes interspersed between periods of major campaigns
by the tenth century in the eastern mediterranean byzantine christians were captured by muslims
many of the raids designed by muslims were created for a fast capture of prisoners
therefore muslims restricted the control in order to keep captives from fleeing
the iberian peninsula served as a base for further exports of slaves into other muslim regions in northern africa
slavery was a legal and a significant part of the ottoman empire s economy and society
the main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in africa eastern europe and circassia and georgia in the caucasus
it has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations
enslavement of europeans was banned in the early th century while enslavement of other groups was permitted
even after several measures to ban slavery in the late th century the practice continued largely unabated into the early th century
as late as female slaves were still sold in the ottoman empire
sexual slavery was a central part of the ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution
in the arauco war a long running conflict between spanish and mapuches in chile both sides engaged in slavery of the enemy population among other atrocities
much like the spanish had captured mapuche people the mapuches had also captured spaniards often women and traded their ownership among them
indeed with the destruction of the seven cities mapuches are reported to have taken spanish women captive holding them as slaves
it was not uncommon for captive spanish women to have changed owner several times
as late as in the s alleged shipwreck survivor elisa bravo was said to be living as wife to a mapuche cacique in what is described as the most brutal forced coexistence resulting in children of mixed blood
a report dating from said that her captors fearing vengeance from spaniards sold her to the warlord calfucur in puelmapu for a hundred mares but that she had died after three years
in the roman republic and later roman empire slaves accounted for most of the means of industrial output in roman commerce
slaves were drawn from all over europe and the mediterranean including gaul hispania north africa syria germania britannia the balkans and greece
generally slaves in italy were indigenous italians with a minority of foreigners including both slaves and freedmen born outside of italy estimated at of the total in the capital where their number was largest at its peak
slaves numbering in the tens of thousands were compelled to work in the mines or quarries where conditions were notoriously brutal
damnati in metallum those condemned to the mine were convicts who lost their freedom as citizens libertas forfeited their property bona to the state and became servi poenae slaves as a legal penalty
their status under the law was different from that of other slaves they could not buy their freedom be sold or be set free
they were expected to live and die in the mines
imperial slaves and freedmen the familia caesaris worked in mine administration and management
in the late republic about half the gladiators who fought in roman arenas were slaves though the most skilled were often free volunteers
successful gladiators were occasionally rewarded with freedom
however gladiators being trained warriors and having access to weapons were potentially the most dangerous slaves
at an earlier time many gladiators had been soldiers taken captive in war
spartacus who led a slave rebellion of bc was a rebel gladiator
the slaves imported in italy were native europeans and very few of them were from outside europe
this has been confirmed by biochemical analysis of skeletons from three imperial era cemeteries in the vicinity of rome where the bulk of the slaves lived which shows that only one individual came from outside of europe north africa and another two possibly did but results are inconclusive
in the rest of the italian peninsula the fraction of non european slaves was much lower than that
the pen ik or pen yek tax meaning one fifth was a taxation based on a verse of the quran whereby one fifth of the spoils of war belonged to god to muhammad and his family to orphans to those in need and to travelers
this eventually included slaves and war captives were given to soldiers and officers to help motivate their participation in wars
christians and jews known as people of the book in islam were considered dhimmis in territories under muslim rule a status of second class citizens that were afforded limited freedoms legal protections personal safety and were allowed to practice their religion subject to certain conditions and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy in return for paying the jizya and kharaj taxes
if a dhimmi broke his agreement and left muslim territory for enemy land he was liable to be enslaved unless the dhimmi had left muslim territory because he suffered injustice there
dhimmis were protected persons who could not be enslaved unless they violated the terms of protection
such violations normally included rebellion or treason according to some authorities this could also include failure to pay due taxes
failure to pay tax could also result in imprisonment
the devshirme was a blood tax largely imposed in the balkans and anatolia in which the ottoman empire sent military to collect christian boys between the ages of to who were taken from their families and raised to serve the empire
the tax was imposed by murad i in the mid s and lasted until the reign of ahmet iii in the early s
from the mid to late th through early th centuries the dev irme janissary system enslaved an estimated to one million non muslim adolescent males
these boys would attain a great education and high social standing after their training and forced conversion to islam
basilike papoulia wrote that the devsirme was the forcible removal in the form of a tribute of children of the christian subjects from their ethnic religious and cultural environment and their transportation into the turkish islamic environment with the aim of employing them in the service of the palace the army and the state whereby they were on the one hand to serve the sultan as slaves and freedmen and on the other to form the ruling class of the state
in the th to th centuries many white people in britain ireland and european colonies in north america were indentured servants
sterling professor of history at yale university david brion davis wrote that
from barbados to virginia colonists long preferred english or irish indentured servants as their main source of field labor during most of the seventeenth century they showed few scruples about reducing their less fortunate countrymen to a status little different from chattel slaves a degradation that was being carried out in a more extreme and far more extensive way with respect to the peasantry in contemporary russia
the prevalence and suffering of white slaves serfs and indentured servants in the early modern period suggests that there was nothing inevitable about limiting plantation slavery to people of african origin between and percent of white immigrants to the american colonies from the s and american revolution had traveled under indenture
many women brought to the colonies were poor some were abandoned or young girls born out of wedlock others prostitutes or criminals
one ship s captain reportedly described them as a villainous and demoralized lot
many were transported against their will and for profit to virginia and maryland
the french transported women from the salp tri re prison for the homeless insane and criminal to new orleans
women held at salp tri re were bound in chains flogged and lived in generally poor and unsanitary conditions
female inmates some of whom were sick with venereal disease were forced to attend confessions three times each day where they would be whipped if their demeanor and behaviors were not acceptably penitent
in addition to salp tri re the french transported women from other almshouses and hospitals including bic tre h pital g n ral de paris and piti
the international agreement for the suppression of the white slave traffic is a series of anti human trafficking treaties the first of which was first negotiated in paris in
it was one of the first multilateral treaties to address issues of slavery and human trafficking
the slavery servitude forced labour and similar institutions and practices convention of and the international convention for the suppression of the traffic in women of full age of are similar documents
in the us congress passed the white slave traffic act better known as the mann act which made it a felony to transport women across state borders for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery or for any other immoral purpose the act was applied to a wide variety of offences many of which were consensual in nature
while women were indeed victims of trafficking in the us the public outcry about white slavery was mostly in response to racial anxieties about interracial contact
local prosecutors in new york were the first to convict a defendant for white slavery case using the mann act
in people v
moore an all white jury convicted bella moore a mixed race woman from new york for the compulsory prostitution of two white women alice milton and belle woods
another notable court case involved jack johnson
using the mann act federal prosecutors convicted johnson of transporting his white girlfriend across state lines
during the first half of the th century authorities disproportionately prosecuted women who were poor and or racial ethnic minorities using the mann act
an attempt was made to introduce a similar law into the uk between and as the criminal law amendment act
arthur lee would state in the house of commons
the united kingdom and particularly england is increasingly becoming a clearing house and depot and dispatch centre of the white slave traffic and the headquarters of the foreign agents engaged in the most expensive and lucrative phase of the business south america was stated as the main destination for the trafficked girls
the spectator commented that the bill has been blocked by a member alluding to frederick handel booth or members who for various reasons consider that it is not a measure which ought to be placed upon the statute book as it would affect the liberty of the individual
