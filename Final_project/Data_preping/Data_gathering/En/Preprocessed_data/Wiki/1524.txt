A combination square is a multi purpose measuring and marking tool used in metalworking woodworking and stonemasonry It is composed of a rule and one or more interchangeable heads that can be attached to the rule Other names for the tool include adjustable square combo square and sliding square
The most common head is the standard head which is used as a square for marking and testing and angles The other common types of head are the protractor head and the centre finder head
Combination square rules are made of steel and can be purchased with gradations in metric imperial or both metric and imperial Both faces of the rule have markings providing four different sets of markings This allows different sides to have different graduations eg mm or mm markings or units ie metric and imperial The rule typically comes in lengths between mm and mm or between inches and inches
The heads occasionally called anvils are attached to the rule by sliding the rule into a slot in the side of the head The head is then tightened in place via a lock bolt or lock nut which engages with a channel running the full length of the rule allowing the head to be tightened on at any point along the rule
The standard or square head has three adjacent flat faces two of them meet square to one another and the third face is angled away at When attached one face is parallel to the rule one face is perpendicular and one face is at The standard head usually incorporates a small spirit level and a small removable scriber
The protractor head has a flat reference edge which is attached to an adjustable protractor or sometimes called a turret with a graduated scale in both directions for reading both the angle or the compliment angle The protractor head sometimes includes a small spirit level
The centre finder head has two faces meeting at when attached one edge of the rule bisects the two faces at
The heads are manufactured from either forged steel cast iron die cast aluminium die cast zinc or plastic Aluminium and zinc heads are cheaper than steel and iron but less durable and more prone to inaccuracy Cast iron and steel heads are also notably heavier The heads are usually painted except for the flat machined reference faces
As well as being used as a regular standalone rule or straightedge the rule is used in combination with the different heads
The standard head can be used as a
Square for marking and referencing angles and checking if surfaces are flat and square to one another
Mitre square for marking and referencing angles such as in woodworking for mitre joints
Spirit level to check if a surface is level or similarly if a surface or edge is plumb vertical
Depth gauge or height gauge
Form of marking gauge for marking lines parallel to an edge by setting the head to a certain distance from the end of the rule
Reference for directly transferring dimensions without needing to take a measurement minimising measurement errors and inaccuracies The protractor head can be used for
Measuring and checking angles between surfaces edges and markings
Marking angles from an edge
Directly transferring angles like a bevel gauge sliding T gauge to minimise measurement errors and inaccuracies
Measuring and marking angles relative to the horizontal by using the spirit level The centre finder head can be used for
Marking lines through the centre of circular or square objects such as dowels Making multiple marks at different angles can be used to identify the point at the centre of the circle
Marking lines perpendicular to a curved edge normal lines
Bisecting square corners to mark a angle Though some earlier th century tools were called combination squares the modern combination square was invented in the late s by American inventor Laroy S Starrett and patented in In he founded the L S Starrett Company in Athol Massachusetts United States The tool was originally designed for machinists but over time became commonly used in other trades such as woodworking
