analogy prohibition extended transaction activity agricultural work administration
among sunni muslim qiyas ha accepted secondary source sharia law along ijm primary source quran sunnah
late modern sunni jurisprudence regard analogical reason secondary source islamic law along binding consensus following quran prophetic tradition
muslim scholarship later period traditionally claimed analogy existed islamic jurisprudence since religion's inception modern scholarship generally point muslim scholar abu hanifa first incorporate analogical reason secondary source law
since inception analogical reason ha subject extensive study regard proper place islamic law proper application
among sunni tradition still range attitude regarding validity analogy method jurisprudence
imam bukhari ahmad ibn hanbal dawud al-zahiri example rejected use analogical reason outright arguing rely personal opinion law-making would mean individual would ultimately form subjective conclusions
wei one today's foremost expert islamic law philosophy explains analogical reason wa accepted fourth source law later generation validity wa foregone conclusion among earlier muslim jurists
thus status fourth source law wa accepted majority later modern muslim jurist wa case inception muslim jurisprudence field
ibrhm al-ujaj imam muhammad ibn saud islamic university explains opposition qiyas coming multiple angles
one argument given light wa delving method intellectually repugnant right
another argument wa islamic legal ruling based human well-being one know human well-being except one gave u sacred law

declared salafism better understood method thinking approach authoritative source distinct school thought includes elevation quran sound hadith expense opinion attributed eponym four sunni school rejection sever curtailment qiyasimam bukhari maintained negative position towards qiyas held view aligned zahiris time
scott lucas state bukharis rejection qiyas wa placed within context bukhari perceived invalid technique ijtihad included religious innovation bida ray tamthil
lucas also point common mistake scholar make analyzing bukharis position qiyas
biggest source confusion scholar fact rejecting qiyas bukhari accepts idea tashbih comparison seems similar analogy
however case tashbih comparison used explanation metaphor whereas qiyas applies specific legal ruling another case
bukhari also known criticism say prophet used qiyas devoted section sahih topic
prophet wa asked something received revelation either said know reply received revelation
reply mean ray qiyas due quranic verse accordance god ha shown ahmad's view christopher melchert state ahmad fellow traditionalist ninth century expressly condemned hanafi exercise qiyas compared dawud al-zahiri's intensely negative stance towards qiyas melchert also state ahmad ibn hanbal
ahmad ibn hanbal ha quoted saying qiyas sunnah example made it
early support validity analogical reason jurisprudence came abu hanifa student abu yusuf
al-shafi'i wa proponent analogical reasoning well though usage wa le frequent abu hanifa
acceptance analogical reason gradually increased within muslim world
malikite hanbalite school eventually granting full acceptance hanafites shafi'ites already done overwhelming majority sunni jurist late period onward affirmed validity
japanese scholar islam kojiro nakamura defined orthodox sunni school regard eventual acceptance analogy descending order acceptance hanafis malikis shafi'is hanbalis zahiris
much work wa performed detail proper analogy major figure al-qastallani al-baqillani al-juwayni al-amidi shafi'ite school ibn abidin hanafite school providing rule guideline still used day
sunni scholar baghawi gave commonly accepted definition analogy islamic law analogical reasoning knowledge one learns method deriving ruling quran prophetic tradition

order qiyas used islamic law three thing necessary
first must new case quran sunnah prophet provide clear ruling

within twelver shii legal tradition fourth source deriving legal principle qiys rather intellect 'aql
twelver shia regard ulama scholar authority legal religious matter occultation ghayba imamah mahdi
return hidden imam responsibility ulma deputy provide guidance worldly matters
modern interpretation twelver shiism revered learned scholar styled reference emulation marja taqld
system deriving legal principle effectively replaces sunni notion consensus ijm deductive analogy qiys
accordingly chapter knowledge twelver collection prophetic tradition kitab al-kafi one find many tradition cited imam forbid use qiys example
among notable ismaili thinker bu ishaq quhistani regarded notion subjective opinion qiys completely contradictory islamic notion tawhd unity ultimately gave rise countless divergent conclusion besides exercised deductive analogy relied little imperfect individual intellects
according bu ishaq must supreme intellect every age muhammad wa time
without would impossible ordinary individual attain knowledge divine using mere speculation
bu ishaq quhistani referred quranic tale adam eve support argument necessity perfect teacher could provide spiritual edification talm place felt subjective whim wayward personal opinion ray
commenting quranic foundational narrative bu ishaq explains god taught adam name thing adam wa commanded teach angel sura al-baqara ayah
spiritual instruction therefore root quran however satan arrogance refused bow adam
created fire clay thus first use deductive analogy wa none satan reasoning challenging command god prostrate
wa reason satan wa punished eternity fell favor final day
ismaili thought therefore truth lay subjective opinion ray analogy qiys rather teaching bearer truth muhiqq imam time
supreme teacher therefore exists time imperfect human intellect submit taslm proclaimed divine dictate

mu'tazilite scholar abu'l husayn al-basri major contributor early muslim jurisprudence said order jurist perform analogical reason must posse thorough knowledge rule procedure allows application revealed law unprecedented case addition basic knowledge quran prophetic tradition
al-nazzam particular denied validity analogical reason wholesale preferring rely pure reason instead
