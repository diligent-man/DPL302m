tristan and iseult is a medieval chivalric romance based on a celtic legend told in numerous variations since the th century
tristan is also written tristram or tristrem and isolde is also written iseult isolt or yseult
the story has had a lasting impact on western culture
the tale is a tragedy about the illicit love between the cornish knight tristan and the irish princess iseult
the story depicts tristan s mission to escort iseult from ireland to cornwall to marry his uncle king mark of cornwall
on the journey tristan and iseult ingest a love potion which instigates a forbidden love affair between them
different versions of the legend have been recorded in many texts in various languages across medieval europe
the earliest instances of the tale take two primary forms known as the courtly branch and the common branch the former beginning with th century poems of thomas of britain and b roul the latter reflecting a now lost original version
a subsequent version emerged in the th century in the wake of the greatly expanded prose tristan merging the romance of tristan with the legend of king arthur
in the wake of revived interest in the medieval era under the influence of romantic nationalism the story has continued to be popular in the modern era notably wagner s operatic adaptation
the story and character of tristan vary between versions
the spelling of his name also varies although tristan is the most common modern spelling
there are two main traditions of the tristan legend
the early tradition comprised the french romances of thomas of britain and b roul two poets from the second half of the th century
later traditions come from the vast prose tristan c which was markedly different from the earlier tales written by thomas and b roul
after defeating the irish knight morholt the young prince tristan travels to ireland to bring back the fair iseult isolde isolt or yseult for his uncle king mark of cornwall to marry
they ingest a love potion along the way which causes the pair to fall madly in love
in the legend s courtly branch the potion s effects last a lifetime but in the common branch the potion s effects wane after three years
in some versions they ingest the potion accidentally
in others the potion s maker gives it to iseult to share with mark but she deliberately gives it to tristan instead
although iseult marries mark the spell forces her and tristan to seek each other as lovers
the king s advisors repeatedly endeavour to try the pair for adultery but they uses trickery to preserve their fa ade of innocence
in b roul s version the love potion eventually wears off and the two lovers make their own choice to continue their adulterous relationship
like the arthur lancelot guinevere love triangle in the medieval courtly love motif tristan king mark and iseult all love one another
tristan honours and respects his uncle king mark as his mentor and adopted father iseult is grateful for mark s kindness to her mark loves tristan as his son and iseult as a wife
but every night each has horrible dreams about the future
mark eventually learns of the affair and seeks to entrap his nephew and wife
simultaneously the endangerment of a fragile kingdom and the cessation of war between ireland and cornwall dumnonia is taking place
mark acquires what seems to be proof of their guilt and resolves to punish them tristan by hanging and iseult by burning at the stake
he changes his mind about iseult and lodges her in a leper colony
tristan however escapes on his way to the gallows makes a miraculous leap from a chapel and rescues iseult
the lovers escape into the forest of morrois and take shelter there until they are later discovered by mark
they make peace with mark after tristan agrees to return iseult to mark and leave the country
tristan then travels to brittany where he marries for her name and beauty iseult of the white hands daughter of hoel of brittany and sister of kahedin
in some versions including b roul and folie tristan d oxford tristan returns in disguise to woo iseult of ireland but the behaviour of their dog husdent betrays his identity
the earliest surviving tristan poems include references to king arthur and his court with mentions of tristan and iseult also found in some early arthurian texts
the connection between the story and the arthurian legend was expanded over time
shortly after the completion of the vulgate cycle the lancelot grail in the first half of the th century two authors created the prose tristan which fully establishes tristan as a knight of the round table
here he is characterized as one of the greatest members of the round table a former enemy turned friend of lancelot and a participant in the quest for the holy grail
the prose tristan then became the common medieval tale of tristan and iseult incorporated into the post vulgate cycle
two centuries later it would be the main source for thomas malory s seminal arthurian compilation le morte d arthur
in the popular extended version of the prose tristan and the works derived from it including malory s tristan is attacked by king mark while he plays a harp for iseult
mark strikes tristan with an enchanted lance mortally wounding him
the poetic treatments of the tristan legend however offer a very different account of the hero s death
in thomas account tristan is wounded by a poisoned lance while attempting to rescue a young woman from six knights
tristan sends his friend kahedin to find iseult of ireland the only person who can heal him
tristan tells kahedin to sail back with white sails if he is bringing iseult and black sails if he is not an echo of the greek myth of theseus
iseult agrees to return to tristan with kahedin but tristan s jealous wife iseult of the white hands lies to tristan about the color of the sails
tristan dies of grief thinking iseult has betrayed him and iseult dies over his corpse
the short version of the prose tristan and some later works also use the traditional account of tristan s death as found in the poetic versions
in french sources such as the ones chosen in the english translation by hilaire belloc in it is stated that a bramble briar grows out of tristan s grave growing so thickly that it forms a bower and roots itself into iseult s grave
the story continues that king mark tries to have the branches cut three separate times and each time the branches grow back and intertwine
later tellings embellish this aspect of the story with the intertwining of a briar above tristan s grave and a rose tree from iseult s
further variants refine the details of the intertwining trees replacing the two plants with hazel and honeysuckle
later stories record that the lovers had a number of children
in some stories they produced a son and a daughter they named after themselves
the children come to have adventures of their own
in the th century french romance ysa e le triste ysa e the sad the eponymous hero is the son of tristan and iseult
he becomes involved with the fairy king oberon and marries a girl named martha who bears him a son named mark
spanish tristan el joven also included tristan s son referred to as tristan of leonis
there are several theories about the tale s origins though historians disagree over which is the most accurate
the mid th century drustanus stone monument in southeast cornwall close to castle dore has an inscription seemingly referring to drustan son of cunomorus mark
however not all historians agree that the drustan referred to is the archetype of tristan
the inscription is now heavily eroded but the earliest records of the stone starting from the th century all agree on some variation of cirvivs cirusius as the name inscribed
it was first read as some variation of drustanus in the late th century
the optimistic reading corresponds to the th century popular revival of medieval romance
a study using d scanning techniques supported the initial ci reading rather than the backward facing d
there are references to march ap meichion mark and trystan in the welsh triads some of the gnomic poetry the mabinogion stories and the th century hagiography of illtud
a character called drystan appears as one of king arthur s advisers at the end of the dream of rhonabwy an early th century tale in the middle welsh prose collection known as the mabinogion
iseult is listed along with other great men and women of arthur s court in another much earlier mabinogion tale culhwch and olwen
possible irish antecedents to the tristan legend have received much scholarly attention
an ill fated triant n an ghr or love triangle features in several irish works most notably in the text called t raigheacht dhiarmada agus ghr inne the pursuit of diarmuid and gr inne
in the story the aging fionn mac cumhaill takes the young princess gr inne to be his wife
at the betrothal ceremony however she falls in love with diarmuid ua duibhne one of fionn s most trusted warriors
gr inne gives a sleeping potion to all present but him and she convinces him to elope with her
the fugitive lovers are then pursued all over ireland by fianna
another irish analogue is sc la cano meic gartn in preserved in the th century yellow book of lecan
in this tale cano is an exiled scottish king who accepts the hospitality of king marcan of ui maile
his young wife credd drugs all present and then convinces cano to be her lover
they try to keep a tryst while at marcan s court but they are frustrated by courtiers
in the end credd kills herself and cano dies of grief
the ulster cycle includes the text clann uisnigh or deirdre of the sorrows in which naoise mac usnech falls for deirdre
she was imprisoned by king conchobar mac nessa due to a prophecy that ulster would plunge into civil war due to men fighting for her beauty
conchobar had pledged to marry deirdre himself to avert war and takes his revenge on clann uisnigh
the death of naoise and his kin leads many ulstermen to defect to connacht including conchobar s stepfather and trusted ally fergus mac r ich eventually precipitating the t in b c ailnge
some scholars suggest that the th century persian story vis and r min must have been the model for the tristan legend because the similarities are too significant to be coincidental
the evidence for the persian origin of tristan and iseult is very circumstantial and there are several theories as to how this persian story could have reached the west
some suggested it resulted from story telling exchanges during the crusades in a syrian court and minstrels who had free access to both crusader and saracen camps in the holy land
some believe ovid s pyramus and thisbe and the story of ariadne at naxos may have contributed to the development of the tristan legend
the sequence in which tristan and iseult die and become interwoven trees also parallels ovid s love story of baucis and philemon in which two lovers are transformed in death into two different trees sprouting from the same trunk
however this also occurs in the saga of deidre of the sorrows making the link more tenuous
it also ignores the now lost oral traditions of preliterate societies relying only on written records which are known to have been damaged especially during the dissolution of the monasteries during the development of modern nation states such as england and france
the earliest representation of the common branch is b roul s le roman de tristan
the first part is generally dated between and and the latter between and
the branch is so named due to its representation of an earlier non chivalric non courtly tradition of story telling making it more reflective of the dark ages than of the refined high middle ages
in this respect the works in this branch are similar to layamon s brut and the perlesvaus
as with thomas works knowledge of b roul s work is limited
a few substantial fragments of his works were discovered in the th century and the rest was reconstructed from later versions
beroul s version is the oldest known version of the tristan romances
it is commonly considered the closest presentation of all the raw events in the romance with no explanation or modifications
therefore beroul s version is an archetype for later common branch editions
a more substantial illustration of the common branch is the german version by eilhart von oberge
eilhart was popular but paled in comparison with the later gottfried
one aspect of the common branch that differentiates significantly from the courtly branch is the depiction of the lovers time in exile from mark s court
while the courtly branches describe tristan and iseult as sheltering in a cave of lovers and living in happy seclusion thus keeping with the tradition of courtly and chivalric writing the common branches emphasize the extreme suffering that tristan and iseult endure
in the common branch the exile is a true punishment that highlights the couple s departure from courtly norms and emphasizes the impossibility of their romance
french medievalist joseph b dier thought all the tristan legends could be traced to a single original a cornish or breton poem
he dubbed this hypothetical original the ur tristan he wrote his still popular romance of tristan and iseult as an attempt to reconstruct what this might have been like incorporating material from other versions to make a cohesive whole
a new english translation of b dier s roman de tristan et iseut by edward j
gallagher was published in by hackett publishing company
a translation by hilaire belloc first published in was published in as a caedmon audio recording read by claire bloom and republished in
the earliest representation of what scholars name the courtly branch of the tristan legend is in the work of thomas of britain dating from
only ten fragments of his tristan poem representing six manuscripts have been located the manuscripts in turin and strassburg are now lost leaving two in oxford one in cambridge and one in carlisle
in his text thomas names another trouv re who also sang of tristan though no manuscripts of this earlier version have been discovered
there is also a passage describing iseult writing a short lai out of grief that sheds light on the development of an unrelated legend concerning the death of a prominent troubadour as well as the composition of lais by noblewomen of the th century
the following essential text for knowledge of the courtly branch of the tristan legend is the abridged translation of thomas made by brother robert at the request of king haakon haakonson of norway in
king haakon had wanted to promote angevin norman culture at his court so he commissioned the translation of several french arthurian works
the nordic version presents a complete direct narrative of the events in thomas tristan with the telling omission of his numerous interpretive diversions
it is the only complete representative of the courtly branch in its formative period
chronologically preceding the work of brother robert is the tristan and isolt of gottfried von strassburg written circa
the poem was gottfried s only known work and was left incomplete due to his death with the retelling reaching halfway through the main plot
the poem was later completed by authors such as heinrich von freiberg and ulrich von t rheim but with the common branch of the legend as the ideal source
contemporary with b roul and thomas marie de france presented a tristan episode in one of her lais chevrefoil
it concerns another of tristan s clandestine returns to cornwall in which the banished hero signals his presence to iseult through an inscription on a hazelnut tree branch placed on a road she was to travel
the title refers to the symbiosis of the honeysuckle and hazelnut tree which die when separated similar to tristan and iseult ni vous sans moi ni moi sans vous neither you without me nor me without you
this moment is reminiscent of one in the courtly branch when tristan uses wood shavings put in a stream as signals to meet in the garden of mark s palace
there are also two th century folies tristan old french poems identified as the berne and the oxford versions which relate tristan s return to marc s court under the guise of a madman
besides their importance as episodic additions to the tristan story and masterpieces of narrative structure these relatively short poems significantly contributed to the restoration of the missing parts of b roul s and thomas incomplete texts
chr tien de troyes claims to have written a tristan story though no part of it has ever been found
he mentions this in the introduction to clig s a romance that many see as a kind of anti tristan with a happy ending
some scholars speculate his tristan was ill received prompting chr tien to write clig s a story with no celtic antecedent to make amends
after b roul and thomas the most noteworthy development in french tristania is a complex grouping of texts known broadly as the prose tristan
extremely popular in the th and th centuries the narratives of these lengthy versions vary in detail from manuscript to manuscript
modern editions run twelve volumes for the extended version including tristan s participation in the quest for the holy grail or five volumes for a shorter version without the grail quest
it significantly influenced later medieval literature and inspired parts of the post vulgate cycle and the roman de palamedes
the earliest complete source of the tristan material in english was sir tristrem a romance of some lines written circa
it is preserved in the famous auchinleck manuscript at the national library of scotland
the narrative largely follows the courtly branch tradition
as is true with many medieval english adaptations of french arthuriana the poem s artistic achievement can only be described as average
however some critics have tried to rehabilitate it claiming it is a parody
its first editor walter scott provided a line ending to the story which has been printed with the romance in every subsequent edition
the only other medieval handling of the tristan legend in english is thomas malory s the book of sir tristram de lyones a shortened translation of the french prose tristan included in his compilation le morte d arthur
in malory s version tristram is the son of the king of lyonesse
since the winchester manuscript surfaced in there has been much scholarly debate on whether the tristan narrative like all the episodes in le morte d arthur was initially intended to be an independent piece or part of a larger work
in italy there were many cantari or oral poems performed in the public square either about tristan or frequently referencing him
they included cantari di tristano due tristani quando tristano e lancielotto combattiero al petrone di merlino ultime imprese e morte tristano and vendetta che fe messer lanzelloto de la morte di messer tristano among others
there are also four different versions of the prose tristan in medieval italy most named after their place of composition or library in which they are currently found tristano panciaticchiano tristano riccardiano and tristano veneto
the exception to this is the tavola ritonda
in the first third of the th century arcipreste de hita wrote his version of the tristan story carta enviada por hiseo la brunda a trist n
respuesta de trist n is a unique th century romance written in the form of imaginary letters between the two lovers
libro del muy esforzado caballero don trist n de leon s y de sus grandes hechos en armas a spanish reworking of the prose tristan was first published in valladolid in
the popularity of brother robert s version spawned a unique parody saga af tristram ok sodd as well as the poem tristrams kv i
in the collection of old norse prose translations of marie de france s lais called strengleikar stringed instruments two lais with arthurian content have been preserved one of them being the chevrefoil translated as geitarlauf
a line fragment of a dutch version c of thomas of britain s tristan exists
it is kept in the austrian national library in vienna series nova
a short tristan narrative perhaps related to the b roul text exists in six welsh manuscripts dating from the late th to the mid th century
a th century verse romance exists in czech based on the german tristan poems by gottfried heinrich and eilhart
it is the only known verse representative of the tristan story in slavic languages
the old belarusian prose povest o tryshchane represents the furthest eastern advance of the legend and composed in the s is considered by some critics to be the last medieval tristan or arthurian text period
its lineage goes back to the tristano veneto
the republic of venice at that time controlled large parts of the serbo croatian language area engendering a more active literary and cultural life there than in most of the balkans during this period
the manuscript of the povest states that it was translated from a lost serbian intermediary
scholars assume that the legend must have journeyed from venice through its balkan colonies finally reaching a last outpost in this slavic language
the story of tristan has been represented in various art forms during the medieval era from ivory mirror cases to the th century sicilian tristan quilt
many of the literary versions are illuminated with miniatures
later the legend became a popular subject for romanticist painters of the late th and early th centuries some of these works are illustrated in this article
in english the tristan story generally suffered the same fate as the matter of britain
after mainly being ignored for about three centuries a renaissance of original arthurian literature mostly narrative verse took place in the late th and early th centuries
revival material regarding the story includes alfred tennyson s the last tournament one of his idylls of the king matthew arnold s tristram and iseult and algernon charles swinburne s epic poem tristram of lyonesse
later most tristan texts were written in the form of prose novels or short stories
by the th century tristan legends spread across the nordic world from denmark to the faroe islands
these stories however diverged immensely from their medieval precursors
for instance in one danish ballad tristan and iseult are made brother and sister
other unconventional innovations occur in two popular danish chapbooks of the late th century tristans saga ok inionu and en tragoedisk historie om den dle og tappre tistrand in which iseult is made the princess of india
the popularity of these chapbooks inspired icelandic poets sigur ur brei fj r and n els j nsson to write r mur long verse narratives inspired by the tristan legend
cornish writer arthur thomas quiller couch q started castle dor a retelling of the tristan and iseult myth in modern circumstances
he designated an innkeeper in the role of king mark his wife as iseult and a breton onion seller as tristan

thomas hardy s one act play the famous tragedy of the queen of cornwall at tintagel in lyonnesse was published in
rutland boughton s opera the queen of cornwall was based on thomas hardy s play
swiss composer frank martin wrote the chamber opera le vin herb between and after being influenced by wagner twentieth century composers have often used the legend with wagnerian overtones in their compositions
for instance hans werner henze s orchestral composition tristan borrowed freely from the wagnerian version as well as retellings of the legend
inspired by hardy s play english composer rutland boughton composed the music drama the queen of cornwall
the first performance took place at the glastonbury festival in
already famous for the immortal hour and bethlehem boughton s growth as a unique and powerful operatic composer is evident in this treatment of the tristram and isolde legend
feeling that hardy s play offered too much unrelieved grimness he received the playwright s permission to import a handful of lyrics from his early poetical works
the result is an impressive and compelling work thought by many as boughton s masterpiece in this genre
in it was recorded on the dutton epoch label

however an evil dwarf tricks them into drinking a love potion and the familiar plot ensues
the film was made in france during the vichy regime under german domination
elements of the movie reflect national socialist ideology with the beautiful blonde hero and heroine off set by the untermensch dwarf
the dwarf is given a more prominent role than in most interpretations of the legend its conniving rains havoc on the lovers much like the jews of nazi stereotypes
the spanish film tristana is only tangentially related to the story
the role of tristan is assumed by the female character tristana who is forced to care for her aging uncle don lope though she wishes to marry horacio
