The owner of Dudley Castle the Third Earl of Dudley decided to create a zoo in the castle grounds in the s The initial Board of the Dudley Zoological Society was made up of the earl Ernest Marsh director of Marsh and Baxter and Captain Frank Cooper owner of Oxford Zoo who wanted to sell his animals and it was Oxford Zoo which closed in that supplied Dudley with the majority of its initial collection of animals The zoo was built between and with Dr Geoffrey Vevers the Superintendent at London Zoo acting as an advisor Thirteen zoo buildings were designed by Berthold Lubetkin and engineering was carried out by Ove Arup The steepness of much of the terrain and the presence of caverns produced by limestone mining in previous centuries presented the architects and builders with a number of difficulties Further constraints were presented by the castle being a scheduled monument its structure and immediate surroundings being protected by a government department the Office of Works
The architects chose a deliberately modern style for the animal enclosures entrance and visitor refreshment facilities making no attempt to match the appearance of the castle ruins The main material chosen for the construction was pre stressed reinforced concrete which gave the possibility of forming curved structures and projecting platforms It was decided to avoid cages where possible and to display the animals in a deliberately artificial manner rather than create an imitation of natural surroundings
The zoo opened on May The opening day was a great success with over people recorded as visiting the zoo on its opening day in its first year
The opening weeks of the zoo were not always so positive though as on June a Malayan Brown Bear escaped from the zoo bit a Dudley resident was struck by a policeman's truncheon and spent a few hours in local gardens before recapture Just days later the animal made another escape this time being shot dead in the castle grounds
Elephant rides were one of the attractions of the zoo from the beginning as it was reported in April that two Indian elephants had been brought to Dudley with that purpose in mind
A miniature railway was added in with two locomotives constructed by G S Light Engineering of Stourbridge The locomotives ran on a track about mile long carrying up to passengers
In a chair lift was introduced to take visitors from near the entrance up the steep grass bank to near the elephant house The chair lift was opened on May by the comedian Richard Hearne
The zoo was bought by the Scotia leisure group in In the zoo went into receivership but was bought by Dudley Metropolitan Council Finally in a charity The Dudley and West Midlands Zoological Society was set up to run the zoo although the council still owns the grounds
In the Penguin Pool had to be demolished because of damage to the concrete caused by the salty water This was the one major original animal enclosure to be lost
On October zoo staff shot dead an year old snow leopard named Margaash after he had left his enclosure when a keeper failed to secure it In a post to its website on November the zoo confirmed that it was closed with no visitors on site at the time of the incident and there is no suggestion that Margaash posed any immediate threat to any human The zoo described the killing as euthanasia Protests followed as outraged locals strongly disagreed with the killing of Margaash describing it as needless killing
In in common with other urban zoos Dudley parted with their two female African elephants so that they could benefit from more spacious surroundings The remaining large animals include giraffes tigers lions reindeer wallabies and three snow leopards the latest being born in May Primates are well represented and there are several aviaries and a reptile house The zoo has over animals from over species most of these are endangered and are the product of captive breeding programmes
There was a time where the Dudley Zoo housed polar bears and Southern elephant seals Cuddles a male orca was housed at the zoo from until his death in February The dolphin and whale pools were modified seal and sea lions pools with the walls being built up to create more depth However these plans fell foul of the local planning laws and the zoo was ordered to return the pools to the original state As the zoo was not prepared to invest in new purpose built pools the whale Cuddles was put up for sale but died before being moved from long term gastro intestinal problems The pools were returned to their original design and now house sea lions
The zoo buildings include twelve listed buildings seven Grade II and five Grade II erected in by Berthold Lubetkin's Tecton Group which employed among others structural engineer Ove Arup Most of the zoo buildings are in the International Style architecture

In January newly released construction proposals indicated the entrance to the zoo would connect with the Black Country Museum and the Dudley Canal Trust creating a single entrance for the three attractions The new entrance was completed in September Focus will then shift to the bear pits which zoo officials say will be renovated to provide a dramatic backdrop in the landscape This was the subject of an investigation by the Born Free Foundation in
In November a £ million expansion of the zoo was announced where tunnels running underneath the Castle Hill site from the Second World War could be brought back so that visitors can glimpse the mining history of Dudley The zoo's iconic s Tecton buildings could also be refurbished with this £ million expansion This work is expected to begin in
