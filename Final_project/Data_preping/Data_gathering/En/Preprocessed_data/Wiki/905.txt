dudley zoological gardens is a acre ha zoo located within the grounds of dudley castle in the town of dudley in the black country region of the west midlands england
the zoo opened to the public on may
it contains modernist animal enclosures and other buildings designed by the architect berthold lubetkin and the tecton group
the zoo went into justin receivership in and was purchased by dudley metropolitan council
dudley zoo is now operated by dudley and west midlands zoological society founded in and a registered charity
the gardens also hosts multiple events
the owner of dudley castle the third earl of dudley decided to create a zoo in the castle grounds in the s
the initial board of the dudley zoological society was made up of the earl ernest marsh director of marsh and baxter and captain frank cooper owner of oxford zoo who wanted to sell his animals and it was oxford zoo which closed in that supplied dudley with the majority of its initial collection of animals
the zoo was built between and with dr geoffrey vevers the superintendent at london zoo acting as an advisor
thirteen zoo buildings were designed by berthold lubetkin and engineering was carried out by ove arup
the steepness of much of the terrain and the presence of caverns produced by limestone mining in previous centuries presented the architects and builders with a number of difficulties
further constraints were presented by the castle being a scheduled monument its structure and immediate surroundings being protected by a government department the office of works
the architects chose a deliberately modern style for the animal enclosures entrance and visitor refreshment facilities making no attempt to match the appearance of the castle ruins
the main material chosen for the construction was pre stressed reinforced concrete which gave the possibility of forming curved structures and projecting platforms
it was decided to avoid cages where possible and to display the animals in a deliberately artificial manner rather than create an imitation of natural surroundings
the zoo opened on may
the opening day was a great success with over people recorded as visiting the zoo on its opening day in its first year
the opening weeks of the zoo were not always so positive though as on june a malayan brown bear escaped from the zoo bit a dudley resident was struck by a policeman s truncheon and spent a few hours in local gardens before recapture
just days later the animal made another escape this time being shot dead in the castle grounds
elephant rides were one of the attractions of the zoo from the beginning as it was reported in april that two indian elephants had been brought to dudley with that purpose in mind
a miniature railway was added in with two locomotives constructed by g s light engineering of stourbridge
the locomotives ran on a track about mile long carrying up to passengers
in a chair lift was introduced to take visitors from near the entrance up the steep grass bank to near the elephant house
the chair lift was opened on may by the comedian richard hearne
the zoo was bought by the scotia leisure group in
in the zoo went into receivership but was bought by dudley metropolitan council
finally in a charity the dudley and west midlands zoological society was set up to run the zoo although the council still owns the grounds
in the penguin pool had to be demolished because of damage to the concrete caused by the salty water
this was the one major original animal enclosure to be lost
on october zoo staff shot dead an year old snow leopard named margaash after he had left his enclosure when a keeper failed to secure it
in a post to its website on november the zoo confirmed that it was closed with no visitors on site at the time of the incident and there is no suggestion that margaash posed any immediate threat to any human
the zoo described the killing as euthanasia
protests followed as outraged locals strongly disagreed with the killing of margaash describing it as needless killing
in in common with other urban zoos dudley parted with their two female african elephants so that they could benefit from more spacious surroundings
the remaining large animals include giraffes tigers lions reindeer wallabies and three snow leopards the latest being born in may
primates are well represented and there are several aviaries and a reptile house
the zoo has over animals from over species most of these are endangered and are the product of captive breeding programmes
there was a time where the dudley zoo housed polar bears and southern elephant seals
cuddles a male orca was housed at the zoo from until his death in february
the dolphin and whale pools were modified seal and sea lions pools with the walls being built up to create more depth
however these plans fell foul of the local planning laws and the zoo was ordered to return the pools to the original state
as the zoo was not prepared to invest in new purpose built pools the whale cuddles was put up for sale but died before being moved from long term gastro intestinal problems
the pools were returned to their original design and now house sea lions
the zoo buildings include twelve listed buildings seven grade ii and five grade ii erected in by berthold lubetkin s tecton group which employed among others structural engineer ove arup
most of the zoo buildings are in the international style architecture
in the zoo announced refurbishment and renovation plans for the zoo s listed buildings and parts of the zoo itself totalling million
initial funding for the project has been met by the heritage lottery fund
in january newly released construction proposals indicated the entrance to the zoo would connect with the black country museum and the dudley canal trust creating a single entrance for the three attractions
the new entrance was completed in september
focus will then shift to the bear pits which zoo officials say will be renovated to provide a dramatic backdrop in the landscape
this was the subject of an investigation by the born free foundation in
in november a million expansion of the zoo was announced where tunnels running underneath the castle hill site from the second world war could be brought back so that visitors can glimpse the mining history of dudley
the zoo s iconic s tecton buildings could also be refurbished with this million expansion
this work is expected to begin in
in february dudley zoo s director derek grove has announced plans to renovate animal enclosures and improve visitor facilities
