At the same time that the duo Sonny Cher were debuting on Atco Records Sonny Bono arranged a solo deal for Cher on the Imperial label After the success of Sonny Cher's I Got You Babe single Bono decided to promote his wife as a solo act producing her first full length album himself The album was Cher's first solo project since the release of her two unsuccessful singles Ringo I Love You and Dream Baby released under the pseudonyms Bonnie Jo Mason and Cherilyn respectively All I Really Want to Do like the debut album by Sonny Cher Look at Us contains many covers The album includes recordings of contemporary uptempo rock songs but it also has a somewhat folky slant to it in order to differentiate it from the musical style of Sonny Cher's records
On the album Cher covered three songs written and performed by Bob Dylan All I Really Want to Do Blowin' in the Wind and Don't Think Twice It's All Right The album contains the Bono penned Needles and Pins which was a hit for the British band The Searchers in The album also included Ray Davies' I Go to Sleep which was later a hit in the UK for The Pretenders and Cher's version of the traditional song See See Rider arranged by Sonny Bono Charles Greene and Robert Stone Other covers on the album are She Thinks I Still Care The Bells of Rhymney and Come and Stay With Me During the album recording sessions Cher recorded a song written by Bono titled I'm Gonna Love You which did not appear on the album but was issued as the B side of the All I Really Want to Do single The song was later included on the Sonny Cher soundtrack album Good Times
The song All I Really Want to Do was the only single to be taken from the album and reached on the Billboard Hot and on the UK singles chart The song also entered the Canadian Dutch and Swedish single charts All I Really Want to Do was the first single to be released by Cher under that name and was also her first solo hit The album also contained the Bono penned song Dream Baby which had been released as a single in by Cher under the pseudonym of Cherylin
The initial idea to cover All I Really Want to Do came when Cher heard the Los Angeles folk rock band The Byrds perform it during their pre fame residency at Ciro's nightclub on the Sunset Strip in March A minor controversy between Cher and The Byrds ensued when it was alleged by Columbia Records The Byrds' record label that Cher and Sonny Bono had taped one of The Byrds' appearances at Ciro's without permission in order to use some of the band's repertoire All I Really Want to Do and The Bells of Rhymney on Cher's own album Although The Byrds planned to issue All I Really Want to Do as a single themselves they were largely unconcerned with the imminent release of Cher's recording feeling that there was enough room in the charts for both versions In a retaliatory attempt to bury Cher's version Columbia rush released The Byrds' All I Really Want to Do single and both versions entered the Billboard Hot during the same week A chart battle ensued largely instigated by Columbia Records and the music press but ultimately The Byrds' version stalled at on the U S charts while Cher's cover reached In the UK however both versions reached the top the Byrds' version reaching and Cher's recording peaking at
All I Really Want to Do has received positive reviews from music critics with Tim Sendra of the Allmusic website giving the album four stars Sendra also noted that the album features Sonny Bono using his Spector derived production skills to create rich chiming backgrounds for Cher to sing over and described the record as one of the stronger folk pop records of the era Sendra went on to note that Cher isn't the most subtle singer but she sounds young and full of life on these tracks like she really believes in what she is singing a feeling you don't always get on her more lightweight material
All I Really Want to Do peaked at number on the Billboard chart in the United States The album entered the chart while the debut album by Sonny Cher Look at Us was still at number two The album also entered the UK Albums Chart debuting at number in early October and peaking at two weeks later The album remained in the UK chart for nine weeks between early October and late November Although All I Really Want to Do reached the UK Album Chart it failed to chart in Europe
