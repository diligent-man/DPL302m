Cultural history combines the approaches of anthropology and history to examine popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience
It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past matter encompassing the continuum of events occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future about a culture
Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the social cultural and political milieu of or relating to the arts and manners that a group favors
Jacob Burckhardt helped found cultural history as a discipline
Cultural history studies and interprets the record of human societies by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration
Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity such as ceremony class in practices and the interaction with locales
Many current cultural historians claim it to be a new approach but cultural history was referred to by nineteenth-century historians such as the Swiss scholar of Renaissance history Jacob Burckhardt
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of histoire des mentalits Philippe Poirrier and the so-called new history and in the US
it is closely associated with the field of American studies
As originally conceived and practiced in the th century by Burckhardt in relation to the Italian Renaissance cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety with regard not only to its painting sculpture and architecture but to the economic basis underpinning society and to the social institutions of its daily life
Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the th century can be seen in Johan Huizinga's The Waning of the Middle Ages
Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society such as carnival festival and public rituals performance traditions of tale epic and other verbal forms cultural evolutions in human relations ideas sciences arts techniques and cultural expressions of social movements such as nationalism
Cultural history also examines main historical concepts as power ideology class culture cultural identity attitude race perception and new historical methods as narration of body
Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to mass media television radio newspapers magazines posters etc from print to film and now to the Internet culture of capitalism
Its modern approaches come from art history Annales Marxist school microhistory and new cultural history
Common theoretical touchstones for recent cultural history have included Jrgen Habermas's formulation of the public sphere in The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere Clifford Geertz's notion of 'thick description' expounded in for example The Interpretation of Cultures and the idea of memory as a cultural-historical category as discussed in Paul Connerton's How Societies Remember
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a paradigm is the revisionist history of the French Revolution dated somewhere since Franois Furet's massively influential essay Interpreting the French Revolution
The revisionist interpretation is often characterized as replacing the allegedly dominant allegedly Marxist social interpretation which locates the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics
The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on political culture
Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as gender ritual and ideology in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture
Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are Roger Chartier Robert Darnton Patrice Higonnet Lynn Hunt Keith Baker Joan Landes Mona Ozouf and Sarah Maza
Of course these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution
Colin Jones for example is no stranger to cultural history Habermas or Marxism and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead but can be revivified after all Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding
Meanwhile Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of so-called modernity and that the problematic notion of modernity has itself attracted scant attention
Cultural studies is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars
It combines political economy geography sociology social theory literary theory filmvideo studies cultural anthropology philosophy and art historycriticism to study cultural phenomena in various societies
Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of ideology nationality ethnicity social class andor gender
The term was coined by Richard Hoggart in when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies
It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall who succeeded Hoggart as Director
The BBC has produced and broadcast a number of educational television programmes on different aspects of human cultural history in Civilisation in The Ascent of Man in The Triumph of the West and in Andrew Marr's History of the World
