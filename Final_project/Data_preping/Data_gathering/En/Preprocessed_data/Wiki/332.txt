first half huxley's career palaeontologist marked rather strange predilection 'persistent types' seemed argue evolutionary advancement sense major new group animal plant wa rare absent phanerozoic
vein tended push origin major group bird mammal back palaeozoic era claim order plant ever gone extinct
much paper ha consumed historian science ruminating strange somewhat unclear idea
huxley wa wrong pitch loss order phanerozoic low estimate number new order evolved
persistent type sat rather uncomfortably next darwin's fluid idea despite intelligence took huxley surprisingly long time appreciate implication evolution
however gradually huxley moved away conservative style thinking understanding palaeontology discipline developed
huxley's detailed anatomical work wa always first-rate productive
work fossil fish show distinctive approach whereas pre-darwinian naturalist collected identified classified huxley worked mainly reveal evolutionary relationship groups
lobed-finned fish coelacanth lung fish paired appendage whose internal skeleton attached shoulder pelvis single bone humerus femur

funded uncle george peabody marsh made remarkable discovery huge cretaceous aquatic bird hesperornis dinosaur footprint along connecticut river worth trip horse fossil really special
week marsh fossil huxley wrote excitedly collection fossil wonderful thing ever saw
collection time went small four-toed forest-dwelling orohippus eocene three-toed specie miohippus specie like modern horse
looking teeth could see size grew larger toe reduced teeth changed browser grazer
change could explained general alteration habitat forest grassland

modern account evolution horse ha many member overall appearance tree descent like bush straight line
horse series also strongly suggested process wa gradual origin modern horse lay north america eurasia
something must happened horse north america since none european arrived
experience marsh wa enough huxley give credence darwin's gradualism introduce story horse lecture series
however marsh carefully showed huxley complete sequence fossils
marsh put huxley informed wa new fact demonstrated evolution horse beyond question first time indicated direct line descent existing animal
generosity true greatness gave opinion face new truth took conclusion basis famous new york lecture horse
huxley wa originally persuaded development theory evolution wa called
seen savage review robert chambers' vestige natural history creation book contained quite pertinent argument favour evolution
huxley also rejected lamarck's theory transmutation basis wa insufficient evidence support it
scepticism wa brought together lecture royal institution made darwin anxious enough set effort change young huxley's mind
wa kind thing darwin closest scientific friend must particular intuition huxley wa account impressive person even young man
huxley wa therefore one small group knew darwin's idea published group included joseph dalton hooker charles lyell
first publication darwin idea came wallace sent darwin famous paper natural selection wa presented lyell hooker linnean society alongside excerpt darwin's notebook darwin letter asa gray
huxley's famous response idea natural selection wa extremely stupid thought however never conclusively made mind whether natural selection wa main method evolution though admit wa hypothesis wa good working basis
logically speaking prior question wa whether evolution taken place all
publication completely convinced huxley evolution wa doubt admiration darwin's way amassing using evidence formed basis support darwin debate followed book's publication
huxley's support started anonymous favourable review origin time december continued article several periodical lecture royal institution february
time richard owen whilst writing extremely hostile anonymous review origin edinburgh review also primed samuel wilberforce wrote one quarterly review running words
authorship latter review wa known sure wilberforce's son wrote biography
said darwin groomed huxley owen groomed wilberforce proxy fought public battle behalf principal much themselves
though know exact word oxford debate know huxley thought review quarterly
since lord brougham assailed dr young world ha seen specimen insolence shallow pretender master science remarkable production one exact observer cautious reasoner candid expositor age held scorn flighty person endeavour prop utterly rotten fabric guess speculation whose mode dealing nature
sobriquet appears huxley's invention although unknown date wa current lifetime
second half darwin's life wa lived mainly within family younger combative huxley operated mainly world large
letter huxley ernst haeckel november state dog snapping darwin's heel much late
famously huxley responded wilberforce debate british association meeting saturday june oxford university museum
huxley's presence encouraged previous evening met robert chamber scottish publisher author vestige wa walking street oxford dispirited state begged assistance
debate followed presentation paper john william draper wa chaired darwin's former botany tutor john stevens henslow
darwin's theory wa opposed bishop oxford samuel wilberforce supporting darwin included huxley mutual friend hooker lubbock
platform featured brodie professor beale robert fitzroy captain hm beagle darwin's voyage spoke darwin
wilberforce track record evolution far back previous oxford ba
challenging task opposing origin implication man descended ape assiduously coached richard owenowen stayed night debate
day wilberforce repeated argument quarterly review article written yet published ventured onto slippery ground
famous jibe huxley whether huxley wa descended ape mother's side father's side wa probably unplanned certainly unwise
huxley's reply effect would rather descended ape man misused great talent suppress debatethe exact wording certainwas widely recounted pamphlet spoof play
letter alfred newton include one brother giving eyewitness account debate written le month afterwards
eyewitness one two exception hooker especially thought made best point give similar account varying date event
general view wa still huxley got much better exchange though wilberforce thought done quite well
absence verbatim report differing perception difficult judge fairly huxley wrote detailed account darwin letter doe survive however letter friend frederick daniel dyster doe survive account three month event
one effect debate wa hugely increase huxley's visibility amongst educated people account newspaper periodicals
another consequence wa alert importance public debate lesson never forgot
third effect wa serve notice darwinian idea could easily dismissed contrary would vigorously defended orthodox authority
fourth effect wa promote professionalism science implied need scientific education
fifth consequence wa indirect wilberforce feared defence evolution undermine literal belief old testament especially book genesis
many liberal clergy meeting quite pleased outcome debate supporter perhaps controversial essay reviews
thus side science religion debate wa important outcome significant
huxley wilberforce remained courteous term debate able work together project metropolitan board education say something men whereas huxley owen never reconciled
nearly decade work wa directed mainly relationship man apes
led directly clash richard owen man widely disliked behaviour whilst also admired capability
huxley's croonian lecture delivered royal society theory vertebrate skull wa start
rejected owen's theory bone skull spine homologous opinion previously held goethe lorenz oken
huxley developed idea presenting lecture working men student general public followed publication
also series talk working men wa printed lecture lecture pamphlet later bound little green book first copy went sale december
lecture grew huxley's famous work evidence man's place nature addressed key issue long charles darwin published descent man in
although darwin publish descent man general debate topic started year wa even precursor debate century monboddo buffon
darwin dropped hint conclusion origin wrote distant future
key event already occurred richard owen presented linnean society theory man wa marked mammal possessing feature brain peculiar genus homo
reached opinion owen separated man mammal subclass own
cannot swallow neither could huxley wa able demonstrate owen's idea wa completely wrong
subject wa raised ba oxford meeting huxley flatly contradicted owen promised later demonstration facts
huxley's friend william flower gave public dissection show structure posterior horn lateral ventricle hippocampus minor indeed present apes
debate wa widely publicised parodied great hippocampus question
wa seen one owen's greatest blunder revealing huxley dangerous debate also better anatomist
owen conceded wa something could called hippocampus minor ape stated wa much le developed presence detract overall distinction simple brain size
huxley's idea topic summed january first issue new series journal natural history review violent scientific paper ever composed
paper wa reprinted chapter man's place nature addendum giving account owenhuxley controversy ape brain
extended argument ape brain partly debate partly print backed dissection demonstration wa landmark huxley's career
wa highly important asserting dominance comparative anatomy long run influential establishing evolution amongst biologist wa debate wilberforce
also marked start owen's decline esteem fellow biologists
following wa written huxley rolleston ba meeting in
obstinate reiteration erroneous assertion nullified persistent appeal fact greatly regret engagement permit present british association order assist personally believe seventh public demonstration past twelve month untruth three assertion posterior lobe cerebrum posterior cornu lateral ventricle hippocampus minor peculiar man exist
huxleyduring year wa also work human fossil anatomy anthropology
wa first pre-sapiens discovery fossil man wa immediately clear brain case wa surprisingly large
huxley also started dabble physical anthropology classified human race nine category along placing four general categorisation australoid negroid xanthochroic mongoloid
classification depended mainly physical appearance certain xanatomical characteristics
shown every biography quite different rather complementary characters
important also darwin wa field naturalist huxley wa anatomist wa difference experience nature
darwin natural selection wa best way explain evolution explained huge range natural history fact observation solved problems
huxley hand wa empiricist trusted could see thing easily seen
mind one appreciate debate darwin writing letter huxley never going quite far say thought darwin wa right
huxley's reservation natural selection type selection breeding seen give rise variety infertile natural selection cannot proved
huxley's position selection wa agnostic yet gave credence theory
despite concern evidence huxley saw evolution came variation reproduction selection thing would also subject pressures
included idea invented imitated selected human struggle existence hold much intellectual physical world
theory specie thinking right exist coextensive power resisting extinction rival idea meme theory put forward richard dawkins in
darwin's part discussion came mostly letter wa wont along line empirical evidence call impossible practical term event unnecessary
asking see every step transformation splitting one specie another
way many issue clarified problem solved theory doe nearly well
huxley's reservation helena cronin ha aptly remarked wa contagious spread year among kind doubter darwinism
one reason doubt wa comparative anatomy could address question descent question mechanism
november huxley succeeded launching dining club x club composed like-minded people working advance cause science surprisingly club consisted closest friends
hooker john lubbock banker biologist neighbour darwin herbert spencer social philosopher sub-editor economist william spottiswoode mathematician queen's printer thomas hirst professor physic university college london edward frankland new professor chemistry royal institution george busk zoologist palaeontologist formerly surgeon hm dreadnought
tyndall wa particularly close friend many year met regularly discussed issue day
one occasion huxley joined tyndall latter's trip alp helped investigation glaciology
also quite significant x-club satellite william flower george rolleston huxley protegs liberal clergyman arthur stanley dean westminster
guest charles darwin hermann von helmholtz entertained time time

stream good article nhr failed four year helped critical time establishment evolution
reader also failed despite broader appeal included art literature well science
periodical market wa quite crowded time probably critical factor wa huxley's time wa simply over-committed could afford hire full-time editors
occurred often life huxley took many venture wa astute darwin getting others work him
however experience gained reader wa put good use x club put weight behind founding nature in
time mistake made wa permanent editor though full-time norman lockyer served year death
peak x club's influence wa hooker spottiswoode huxley president royal society succession
hooker died lubbock lord avebury wa last surviving member
huxley wa also active member metaphysical society ran to
wa formed around nucleus clergy expanded include kind opinions
huxley wa young virtually degree british university biological science courses
retired established chair biological discipline university broad consensus curriculum followed
early royal school mine moved new quarter south kensington ultimately would become one constituent part imperial college london
move gave huxley chance give prominence laboratory work biology teaching idea suggested practice german universities
main method wa based use carefully chosen type depended dissection anatomy supplemented microscopy museum specimen elementary physiology hand foster
typical day would start huxley lecturing followed program laboratory work supervised demonstrators
huxley's demonstrator picked menall became leader biology britain later life spreading huxley's idea well own
ray lankester became jodrell professor zoology university college london professor comparative anatomy oxford director natural history museum sh
thiselton-dyer became hooker's successor kew wa already hooker's son-in-law t
jeffery parker became professor zoology comparative anatomy university college cardiff william rutherford became professor physiology edinburgh
william flower conservator hunterian museum thh's assistant many dissection became sir william flower hunterian professor comparative anatomy later director natural history museum
remarkable list disciple especially contrasted owen longer professional life huxley left disciple all
huxley's course student much narrower man many bewildered contrast teaching zoology use selected animal type ha come much criticism looking back time student sir arthur shipley said darwin's later work dealt living organism yet obsession wa dead body preserved cut
would persist looking animal material structure living active word
put simply huxley preferred teach actually seen eyes
largely morphological program comparative anatomy remained core biological education hundred year advent cell molecular biology interest evolutionary ecology forced fundamental rethink
interesting fact method field naturalist led way developing theory evolution darwin wallace fritz mller henry bates scarcely represented huxley's program
ecological investigation life environment wa virtually non-existent theory evolutionary otherwise wa discount
michael ruse find mention evolution darwinism exam set huxley confirms lecture content based two complete set lecture notes
since darwin wallace bates hold teaching post stage adult career mller never returned brazil imbalance huxley's program went uncorrected
surely strange huxley's course contain account evidence collected naturalist life tropic evidence found convincing caused view evolution natural selection similar
adrian desmond suggests biology simple synthetic assimilable wa train teacher heuristic function
must part reason indeed doe help explain stultifying nature much school biology
zoology taught level became far much product one man
huxley wa comfortable comparative anatomy wa greatest master day
wa all-round naturalist like darwin shown clearly enough weave together detailed factual information subtle argument across vast web life
huxley chose teaching extent research take straightforward course concentrating personal strengths
huxley wa also major influence direction taken british school november wa voted onto london school board
primary schooling advocated wide range discipline similar taught today reading writing arithmetic art science music etc
secondary education recommended two year basic liberal study followed two year upper-division work focusing specific area study
practical example latter famous lecture piece chalk wa first published essay macmillan's magazine london later year
piece reconstructs geological history britain simple piece chalk demonstrates science organized common sense
may seem step agnostic conviction believed bible's significant moral teaching superb use language relevant english life
however huxley proposed wa create edited version bible shorn shortcoming errors
board voted idea also voted idea public money used support student attending church schools
vigorous debate took place point debate minuted detail
huxley said never party enabling state sweep child country denominational schools
act parliament founded board school permitted reading bible permit denominational doctrine taught
may right see huxley's life work contributing secularisation british society gradually occurred following century
ernst mayr said hardly doubted biology ha helped undermine traditional belief value systemsand huxley anyone else wa responsible trend britain
modern christian apologist consider huxley father antitheism though maintained wa agnostic atheist
wa however lifelong determined opponent almost organised religion throughout life especially roman church
carefully calculated destruction highest moral nature intellectual freedom political freedom mankind
line thought article popular science huxley used expression so-called christianity catholicism explaining say 'so-called' way offense protest monstruous assumption catholic christianity explicitly implicitly contained trust-worthy record teaching jesus nazareth
originally coining term huxley elaborated agnosticism frame nature claim term knowable not
huxley statesagnosticism fact creed method essence lie rigorous application single principle
matter intellect follow reason far take without regard consideration
use term ha continued present day see thomas henry huxley agnosticism
much huxley's agnosticism influenced kantian view human perception ability rely rational evidence rather belief systems
preparation second romanes lecture huxley expressed disappointment shortcoming 'liberal' theology describing doctrine 'popular illusions' teaching replaced 'faulty appear vastly nearer truth'
vladimir lenin remarked huxley agnosticism serf fig-leaf materialism
huxley's interest education went still school university classroom made great effort reach interested adult kind wa largely self-educated
lecture course working men many published afterwards wa use made journalism partly earn money mostly reach literate public
adult life wrote periodicalsthe westminster review saturday review reader pall mall gazette macmillan's magazine contemporary review
germany wa still ahead formal science education interested people victorian britain could use initiative find wa going reading periodical using lending libraries
huxley became principal south london working men's college blackfriar road
sixpence course penny lecture huxley wa bargain wa free library organised college idea wa widely copied
huxley thought said men attended good country squire

good example wa physical basis life lecture given edinburgh november
themethat vital action nothing result molecular force protoplasm display itshocked audience though wa nothing compared uproar wa published fortnightly review february
john morley editor said article appeared periodical generation caused sensation
issue wa reprinted seven time protoplasm became household word punch added 'professor protoplasm' soubriquets
topic stimulated huxley seeing cytoplasmic streaming plant cell indeed sensational sight
audience huxley's claim activity explained word vitality working constituent chemical wa surprising shocking
today would perhaps emphasise extraordinary structural arrangement chemical key understanding cell little wa known nineteenth century
archbishop york thought 'new philosophy' wa based auguste comte's positivism huxley corrected comte's philosophy catholicism minus christianity huxley vol collected essay method results

huxley's dismissal positivism damaged severely comte's idea withered britain
life especially last ten year retirement huxley wrote many issue relating humanities
perhaps best known topic evolution ethic deal question whether biology ha anything particular say moral philosophy
huxley grandson julian huxley gave romanes lecture theme
