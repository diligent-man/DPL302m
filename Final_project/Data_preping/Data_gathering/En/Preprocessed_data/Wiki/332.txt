thomas henry huxley pc frs honfrse fls may june was an english biologist and anthropologist specialising in comparative anatomy
he has become known as darwin s bulldog for his advocacy of charles darwin s theory of evolution
the stories regarding huxley s famous debate in with samuel wilberforce were a key moment in the wider acceptance of evolution and in his own career although historians think that the surviving story of the debate is a later fabrication
huxley had been planning to leave oxford on the previous day but after an encounter with robert chambers the author of vestiges he changed his mind and decided to join the debate
wilberforce was coached by richard owen against whom huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes
huxley was slow to accept some of darwin s ideas such as gradualism and was undecided about natural selection but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of darwin
instrumental in developing scientific education in britain he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition
huxley coined the term agnosticism in and elaborated on it in to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not
huxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self taught
he became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the later th century
he worked on invertebrates clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood
later he worked on vertebrates especially on the relationship between apes and humans
after comparing archaeopteryx with compsognathus he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs a theory widely accepted today
the tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution and by his extensive public work on scientific education both of which had significant effects on society in britain and elsewhere
huxley s romanes lecture evolution and ethics is exceedingly influential in china the chinese translation of huxley s lecture even transformed the chinese translation of darwin s origin of species
thomas henry huxley was born in ealing which was then a village in middlesex
he was the second youngest of eight children of george huxley and rachel withers
his parents were members of the church of england but he sympathized with noncomformists
like some other british scientists of the nineteenth century such as alfred russel wallace huxley was brought up in a literate middle class family which had fallen on hard times
his father was a mathematics teacher at ealing school until it closed putting the family into financial difficulties
as a result thomas left school at the age of after only two years of formal schooling
despite this unenviable start huxley was determined to educate himself
he became one of the great autodidacts of the nineteenth century
at first he read thomas carlyle james hutton s geology and hamilton s logic
in his teens he taught himself german eventually becoming fluent and used by charles darwin as a translator of scientific material in german
he learned latin and enough greek to read aristotle in the original
later on as a young adult he made himself an expert first on invertebrates and later on vertebrates all self taught
he was skilled in drawing and did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates
in his later debates and writing on science and religion his grasp of theology was better than many of his clerical opponents
huxley a boy who left school at ten became one of the most knowledgeable men in britain
he was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners at to his brother in law john cooke in coventry who passed him on to thomas chandler notable for his experiments using mesmerism for medical purposes
chandler s practice was in london s rotherhithe amidst the squalor endured by the dickensian poor
here thomas would have seen poverty crime and rampant disease at its worst
next another brother in law took him on john salt his eldest sister s husband
now huxley entered sydenham college behind university college hospital a cut price anatomy school whose founder marshall hall discovered the reflex arc
all this time huxley continued his programme of reading which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling
a year later buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the apothecaries yearly competition huxley was admitted to study at charing cross hospital where he obtained a small scholarship
at charing cross he was taught by thomas wharton jones professor of ophthalmic medicine and surgery at university college london
jones had been robert knox s assistant when knox bought cadavers from burke and hare
the young wharton jones who acted as go between was exonerated of crime but thought it best to leave scotland
he was a fine teacher up to date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon
in under wharton jones guidance huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs a layer that has been known since as huxley s layer
no doubt remembering this and of course knowing his merit later in life huxley organised a pension for his old tutor
at twenty he passed his first m b
examination at the university of london winning the gold medal for anatomy and physiology
however he did not present himself for the final second m b exams and consequently did not qualify with a university degree
his apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the royal navy
aged huxley was too young to apply to the royal college of surgeons for a licence to practise yet he was deep in debt
so at a friend s suggestion he applied for an appointment in the royal navy
he had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy
sir william burnett the physician general of the navy interviewed him and arranged for the college of surgeons to test his competence by means of a viva voce
finally huxley was made assistant surgeon surgeon s mate but in practice marine naturalist to hms rattlesnake about to set sail on a voyage of discovery and surveying to new guinea and australia
the rattlesnake left england on december and once it arrived in the southern hemisphere huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates
he began to send details of his discoveries back to england where publication was arranged by edward forbes frs who had also been a pupil of knox
both before and after the voyage forbes was something of a mentor to huxley
huxley s paper on the anatomy and the affinities of the family of medusae was published in by the royal society in its philosophical transactions
huxley united the hydroid and sertularian polyps with the medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of hydrozoa
the connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers enclosing a central cavity or stomach
this is characteristic of the phylum now called the cnidaria
he compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals
when at last he got a grant from the royal society for the printing of plates huxley was able to summarise this work in the oceanic hydrozoa published by the ray society in
the value of huxley s work was recognised and on returning to england in he was elected a fellow of the royal society
in the following year at the age of twenty six he not only received the royal society medal but was also elected to the council
he met joseph dalton hooker and john tyndall who remained his lifelong friends
the admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant surgeon so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the rattlesnake
he solved the problem of appendicularia whose place in the animal kingdom johannes peter m ller had found himself wholly unable to assign
it and the ascidians are both as huxley showed tunicates today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum chordata
other papers on the morphology of the cephalopods and on brachiopods and rotifers are also noteworthy
the rattlesnake s official naturalist john macgillivray did some work on botany and proved surprisingly good at notating australian aboriginal languages
he wrote up the voyage in the standard victorian two volume format
huxley effectively resigned from the navy by refusing to return to active service and in july he became professor of natural history at the royal school of mines and naturalist to the british geological survey in the following year
in addition he was fullerian professor at the royal institution and hunterian professor at the royal college of surgeons president of the british association for the advancement of science president of the quekett microscopical club president of the royal society inspector of fisheries and president of the marine biological association
he was elected as a member to the american philosophical society in
the thirty one years during which huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the royal school of mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in british life
huxley retired in after a bout of depressive illness which started in
he resigned the presidency of the royal society in mid term the inspectorship of fisheries and his chair as soon as he decently could and took six months leave
his pension was a fairly handsome a year
in he moved from london to eastbourne where he edited the nine volumes of his collected essays
in he heard of eugene dubois discovery in java of the remains of pithecanthropus erectus now known as homo erectus
finally in he died of a heart attack after contracting influenza and pneumonia and was buried in north london at east finchley
this small family plot had been purchased upon the death of his beloved eldest son noel who died of scarlet fever in huxley s wife henrietta anne n e heathorn and son noel are also buried there
no invitations were sent out but two hundred people turned up for the ceremony they included joseph dalton hooker william henry flower mulford b
foster edwin lankester joseph lister and apparently henry james
huxley and his wife had five daughters and three sons
from onwards huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty
he served on eight royal commissions from to
from to he was a secretary of the royal society and from to he was president
he was president of the geological society from to
in he was president of the british association at liverpool and in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted london school board
he was president of the quekett microscopical club from to
he was the leading person amongst those who reformed the royal society persuaded government about science and established scientific education in british schools and universities
before him science was mostly a gentleman s occupation after him science was a profession
he was awarded the highest honours then open to british men of science
the royal society who had elected him as fellow when he was awarded him the royal medal the next year a year before charles darwin got the same award
he was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition
then later in life came the copley medal in and the darwin medal in the geological society awarded him the wollaston medal in the linnean society awarded him the linnean medal in
there were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies these and his many academic awards are listed in the life and letters
he turned down many other appointments notably the linacre chair in zoology at oxford and the mastership of university college oxford
in the king of sweden made huxley hooker and tyndall knights of the order of the polar star they could wear the insignia but not use the title in britain
huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies academic awards and honorary doctorates from britain and germany
he also became foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in
as recognition of his many public services he was given a pension by the state and was appointed privy councillor in
despite his many achievements he was given no award by the british state until late in life
in this he did better than darwin who got no award of any kind from the state
darwin s proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisers including wilberforce perhaps huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment he had vigorous debates in print with benjamin disraeli william ewart gladstone and arthur balfour and his relationship with lord salisbury was less than tranquil
huxley was for about thirty years evolution s most effective advocate and for some huxley was the premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century for the whole english speaking world
though he had many admirers and disciples his retirement and later death left british zoology somewhat bereft of leadership
he had directly or indirectly guided the careers and appointments of the next generation but none were of his stature
the loss of francis balfour in climbing the alps just after he was appointed to a chair at cambridge was a tragedy
huxley thought he was the only man who can carry out my work the deaths of balfour and w
clifford were the greatest losses to science in our time
the first half of huxley s career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for persistent types in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants was rare or absent in the phanerozoic
in the same vein he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the palaeozoic era and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct
much paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea
huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of orders in the phanerozoic as low as and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved
persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to darwin s more fluid ideas despite his intelligence it took huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution
however gradually huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology and the discipline itself developed
huxley s detailed anatomical work was as always first rate and productive
his work on fossil fish shows his distinctive approach whereas pre darwinian naturalists collected identified and classified huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups
the lobed finned fish such as coelacanths and lung fish have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone the humerus or femur
his interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of tetrapods one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology
the study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles which he united under the title of sauropsida
his papers on archaeopteryx and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are
apart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate and had descended from the same stock as the apes huxley did little work on mammals with one exception
on his tour of america huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses discovered by o
marsh in yale s peabody museum
an easterner marsh was america s first professor of palaeontology but also one who had come west into hostile indian territory in search of fossils hunted buffalo and met red cloud in
funded by his uncle george peabody marsh had made some remarkable discoveries the huge cretaceous aquatic bird hesperornis and the dinosaur footprints along the connecticut river were worth the trip by themselves but the horse fossils were really special
after a week with marsh and his fossils huxley wrote excitedly the collection of fossils is the most wonderful thing i ever saw
the collection at that time went from the small four toed forest dwelling orohippus from the eocene through three toed species such as miohippus to species more like the modern horse
by looking at their teeth he could see that as the size grew larger and the toes reduced the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer
all such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland
and it is now known that is what did happen over large areas of north america from the eocene to the pleistocene the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction see paleocene eocene thermal maximum
the modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line
the horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual and that the origin of the modern horse lay in north america not in eurasia
if so then something must have happened to horses in north america since none were there when europeans arrived
the experience with marsh was enough for huxley to give credence to darwin s gradualism and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series
marsh s and huxley s conclusions were initially quite different
however marsh carefully showed huxley his complete sequence of fossils
as marsh put it huxley then informed me that all this was new to him and that my facts demonstrated the evolution of the horse beyond question and for the first time indicated the direct line of descent of an existing animal
with the generosity of true greatness he gave up his own opinions in the face of new truth and took my conclusions as the basis of his famous new york lecture on the horse
huxley was originally not persuaded of development theory as evolution was once called
this can be seen in his savage review of robert chambers vestiges of the natural history of creation a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution
huxley had also rejected lamarck s theory of transmutation on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it
all this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the royal institution which made darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young huxley s mind
it was the kind of thing darwin did with his closest scientific friends but he must have had some particular intuition about huxley who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man
huxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about darwin s ideas before they were published the group included joseph dalton hooker and charles lyell
the first publication by darwin of his ideas came when wallace sent darwin his famous paper on natural selection which was presented by lyell and hooker to the linnean society in alongside excerpts from darwin s notebook and a darwin letter to asa gray
huxley s famous response to the idea of natural selection was how extremely stupid not to have thought of that however he never conclusively made up his mind about whether natural selection was the main method for evolution though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis
logically speaking the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all
it is to this question that much of darwin s on the origin of species was devoted
its publication in completely convinced huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of darwin s way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for darwin in the debates that followed the book s publication
huxley s support started with his anonymous favourable review of the origin in the times for december and continued with articles in several periodicals and in a lecture at the royal institution in february
at the same time richard owen whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the origin in the edinburgh review also primed samuel wilberforce who wrote one in the quarterly review running to words
the authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until wilberforce s son wrote his biography
so it can be said that just as darwin groomed huxley so owen groomed wilberforce and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves
though we do not know the exact words of the oxford debate we do know what huxley thought of the review in the quarterly
since lord brougham assailed dr young the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a master in science as this remarkable production in which one of the most exact of observers most cautious of reasoners and most candid of expositors of this or any other age is held up to scorn as a flighty person who endeavours to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation and whose mode of dealing with nature is reprobated as utterly dishonourable to natural science if i confine my retrospect of the reception of the origin of species to a twelvemonth or thereabouts from the time of its publication i do not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the quarterly review article since his death huxley has become known as darwin s bulldog taken to refer to his pluck and courage in debate and to his perceived role in protecting the older man
the sobriquet appears to be huxley s own invention although of unknown date and it was not current in his lifetime
while the second half of darwin s life was lived mainly within his family the younger and combative huxley operated mainly out in the world at large
a letter from huxley to ernst haeckel november states the dogs have been snapping at darwin s heels too much of late
famously huxley responded to wilberforce in the debate at the british association meeting on saturday june at the oxford university museum
huxley s presence there had been encouraged on the previous evening when he met robert chambers the scottish publisher and author of vestiges who was walking the streets of oxford in a dispirited state and begged for assistance
the debate followed the presentation of a paper by john william draper and was chaired by darwin s former botany tutor john stevens henslow
darwin s theory was opposed by the bishop of oxford samuel wilberforce and those supporting darwin included huxley and their mutual friends hooker and lubbock
the platform featured brodie and professor beale and robert fitzroy who had been captain of hms beagle during darwin s voyage spoke against darwin
wilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous oxford b a
meeting in when he attacked chambers vestiges
for the more challenging task of opposing the origin and the implication that man descended from apes he had been assiduously coached by richard owen owen stayed with him the night before the debate
on the day wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his quarterly review article written but not yet published then ventured onto slippery ground
his famous jibe at huxley as to whether huxley was descended from an ape on his mother s side or his father s side was probably unplanned and certainly unwise
huxley s reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate the exact wording is not certain was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play
the letters of alfred newton include one to his brother giving an eyewitness account of the debate and written less than a month afterwards
other eyewitnesses with one or two exceptions hooker especially thought he had made the best points give similar accounts at varying dates after the event
the general view was and still is that huxley got much the better of the exchange though wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well
in the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly huxley wrote a detailed account for darwin a letter which does not survive however a letter to his friend frederick daniel dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event
one effect of the debate was to hugely increase huxley s visibility amongst educated people through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals
another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate a lesson he never forgot
a third effect was to serve notice that darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed on the contrary they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority
a fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science with its implied need for scientific education
a fifth consequence was indirect as wilberforce had feared a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the old testament especially the book of genesis
many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate they were supporters perhaps of the controversial essays and reviews
thus both on the side of science and on that of religion the debate was important and its outcome significant
see also below
that huxley and wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate and able to work together on projects such as the metropolitan board of education says something about both men whereas huxley and owen were never reconciled
for nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes
this led him directly into a clash with richard owen a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability
the struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for owen
huxley s croonian lecture delivered before the royal society in on the theory of the vertebrate skull was the start
in this he rejected owen s theory that the bones of the skull and the spine were homologous an opinion previously held by goethe and lorenz oken
from huxley developed his ideas presenting them in lectures to working men students and the general public followed by publication
also in a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets later bound up as a little green book the first copies went on sale in december
other lectures grew into huxley s most famous work evidence as to man s place in nature where he addressed the key issues long before charles darwin published his descent of man in
although darwin did not publish his descent of man until the general debate on this topic had started years before there was even a precursor debate in the th century between monboddo and buffon
darwin had dropped a hint when in the conclusion to the origin he wrote in the distant future
light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history
not so distant as it turned out
a key event had already occurred in when richard owen presented to the linnean society his theory that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus homo
having reached this opinion owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own
no other biologist held such an extreme view
darwin reacted man as distinct from a chimpanzee as an ape from a platypus
i cannot swallow that neither could huxley who was able to demonstrate that owen s idea was completely wrong
the subject was raised at the ba oxford meeting when huxley flatly contradicted owen and promised a later demonstration of the facts
in fact a number of demonstrations were held in london and the provinces
in at the cambridge meeting of the b a
huxley s friend william flower gave a public dissection to show that the same structures the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor were indeed present in apes
the debate was widely publicised and parodied as the great hippocampus question
it was seen as one of owen s greatest blunders revealing huxley as not only dangerous in debate but also a better anatomist
owen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size
huxley s ideas on this topic were summed up in january in the first issue new series of his own journal the natural history review the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed
this paper was reprinted in as chapter of man s place in nature with an addendum giving his account of the owen huxley controversy about the ape brain
in his collected essays this addendum was removed
the extended argument on the ape brain partly in debate and partly in print backed by dissections and demonstrations was a landmark in huxley s career
it was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with wilberforce
it also marked the start of owen s decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists
the following was written by huxley to rolleston before the ba meeting in
my dear rolleston
the obstinate reiteration of erroneous assertions can only be nullified by as persistent an appeal to facts and i greatly regret that my engagements do not permit me to be present at the british association in order to assist personally at what i believe will be the seventh public demonstration during the past twelve months of the untruth of the three assertions that the posterior lobe of the cerebrum the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor are peculiar to man and do not exist in the apes
i shall be obliged if you will read this letter to the section yours faithfully thos
huxley during those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology
in he examined the neanderthal skull cap which had been discovered in
it was the first pre sapiens discovery of a fossil man and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large
huxley also started to dabble in physical anthropology and classified the human races into nine categories along with placing them under four general categorisations as australoid negroid xanthochroic and mongoloid
such classifications depended mainly on physical appearance and certain xanatomical characteristics
huxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with darwin
as shown in every biography they had quite different and rather complementary characters
important also darwin was a field naturalist but huxley was an anatomist so there was a difference in their experience of nature
lastly darwin s views on science were different from huxley s views
for darwin natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations it solved problems
huxley on the other hand was an empiricist who trusted what he could see and some things are not easily seen
with this in mind one can appreciate the debate between them darwin writing his letters huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought darwin was right
huxley s reservations on natural selection were of the type until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other natural selection cannot be proved
huxley s position on selection was agnostic yet he gave no credence to any other theory
despite this concern about evidence huxley saw that if evolution came about through variation reproduction and selection then other things would also be subject to the same pressures
this included ideas because they are invented imitated and selected by humans the struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world
a theory is a species of thinking and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals this is the same idea as meme theory put forward by richard dawkins in
darwin s part in the discussion came mostly in letters as was his wont along the lines the empirical evidence you call for is both impossible in practical terms and in any event unnecessary
it s the same as asking to see every step in the transformation or the splitting of one species into another
my way so many issues are clarified and problems solved no other theory does nearly so well
huxley s reservation as helena cronin has so aptly remarked was contagious it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of darwinism
one reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent but not the question of mechanism
huxley was a pallbearer at the funeral of charles darwin on april
in november huxley succeeded in launching a dining club the x club composed of like minded people working to advance the cause of science not surprisingly the club consisted of most of his closest friends
there were nine members who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more
the members were huxley john tyndall j
hooker john lubbock banker biologist and neighbour of darwin herbert spencer social philosopher and sub editor of the economist william spottiswoode mathematician and the queen s printer thomas hirst professor of physics at university college london edward frankland the new professor of chemistry at the royal institution and george busk zoologist and palaeontologist formerly surgeon for hms dreadnought
all except spencer were fellows of the royal society
tyndall was a particularly close friend for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day
on more than one occasion huxley joined tyndall in the latter s trips into the alps and helped with his investigations in glaciology
there were also some quite significant x club satellites such as william flower and george rolleston huxley proteg s and liberal clergyman arthur stanley the dean of westminster
guests such as charles darwin and hermann von helmholtz were entertained from time to time
they would dine early on first thursdays at a hotel planning what to do high on the agenda was to change the way the royal society council did business
it was no coincidence that the council met later that same evening
first item for the xs was to get the copley medal for darwin which they managed after quite a struggle
the next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas
this was the weekly reader which they bought revamped and redirected
huxley had already become part owner of the natural history review bolstered by the support of lubbock rolleston busk and carpenter x clubbers and satellites
the journal was switched to pro darwinian lines and relaunched in january
after a stream of good articles the nhr failed after four years but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution
the reader also failed despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science
the periodical market was quite crowded at the time but most probably the critical factor was huxley s time he was simply over committed and could not afford to hire full time editors
this occurred often in his life huxley took on too many ventures and was not so astute as darwin at getting others to do work for him
however the experience gained with the reader was put to good use when the x club put their weight behind the founding of nature in
this time no mistakes were made above all there was a permanent editor though not full time norman lockyer who served until a year before his death
in to celebrate his centenary nature issued a supplement devoted to huxley
the peak of the x club s influence was from to as hooker spottiswoode and huxley were presidents of the royal society in succession
spencer resigned in after a dispute with huxley over state support for science
after it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet
hooker died in and lubbock now lord avebury was the last surviving member
huxley was also an active member of the metaphysical society which ran from to
it was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions
tyndall and huxley later joined the club founded by dr
johnson when they could be sure that owen would not turn up
when huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in british universities in the biological sciences and few courses
most biologists of his day either were self taught or took medical degrees
when he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed
huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation
in the early s the royal school of mines moved to new quarters in south kensington ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of imperial college london
the move gave huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching an idea suggested by practice in german universities
in the main the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types and depended on the dissection of anatomy supplemented by microscopy museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of foster
the typical day would start with huxley lecturing at am followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators
huxley s demonstrators were picked men all became leaders of biology in britain in later life spreading huxley s ideas as well as their own
michael foster became professor of physiology at cambridge e
ray lankester became jodrell professor of zoology at university college london professor of comparative anatomy at oxford and director of the natural history museum s h
vines became professor of botany at cambridge w t
thiselton dyer became hooker s successor at kew he was already hooker s son in law t
jeffery parker became professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at university college cardiff and william rutherford became the professor of physiology at edinburgh
william flower conservator to the hunterian museum and thh s assistant in many dissections became sir william flower hunterian professor of comparative anatomy and later director of the natural history museum
it s a remarkable list of disciples especially when contrasted with owen who in a longer professional life than huxley left no disciples at all
no one fact tells so strongly against owen
as that he has never reared one pupil or follower
huxley s courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast the teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism looking back in to his time as a student sir arthur shipley said darwin s later works all dealt with living organisms yet our obsession was with the dead with bodies preserved and cut into the most refined slices
e w macbride said huxley
would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living active beings in a word
he was a necrologist
to put it simply huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes
this largely morphological program of comparative anatomy remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink
it is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution darwin wallace fritz m ller henry bates were scarcely represented at all in huxley s program
ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non existent and theory evolutionary or otherwise was at a discount
michael ruse finds no mention of evolution or darwinism in any of the exams set by huxley and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes
since darwin wallace and bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers and m ller never returned from brazil the imbalance in huxley s program went uncorrected
it is surely strange that huxley s courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics evidence which they had found so convincing and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar
adrian desmond suggests that biology had to be simple synthetic and assimilable because it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function
that must be part of the reason indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology
but zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man
huxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy at which he was the greatest master of the day
he was not an all round naturalist like darwin who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life
huxley chose in his teaching and to some extent in his research to take a more straightforward course concentrating on his personal strengths
huxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by british schools in november he was voted onto the london school board
in primary schooling he advocated a wide range of disciplines similar to what is taught today reading writing arithmetic art science music etc
in secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper division work focusing on a more specific area of study
a practical example of the latter is his famous lecture on a piece of chalk which was first published as an essay in macmillan s magazine in london later that year
the piece reconstructs the geological history of britain from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as organized common sense
huxley supported the reading of the bible in schools
this may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions but he believed that the bible s significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to english life
i do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches
however what huxley proposed was to create an edited version of the bible shorn of shortcomings and errors
statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur
these tender children should not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe
the board voted against his idea but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools
vigorous debate took place on such points and the debates were minuted in detail
huxley said i will never be a party to enabling the state to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools
the act of parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the bible but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught
it may be right to see huxley s life and work as contributing to the secularisation of british society which gradually occurred over the following century
ernst mayr said it can hardly be doubted that biology has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems and huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in britain
some modern christian apologists consider huxley the father of antitheism though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic not an atheist
he was however a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all organised religion throughout his life especially the roman church
carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature in the intellectual freedom and in the political freedom of mankind
in the same line of thought in an article in popular science huxley used the expression the so called christianity of catholicism explaining i say so called not by way of offense but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that catholic christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trust worthy record of the teaching of jesus of nazareth
originally coining the term in huxley elaborated on agnosticism in to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not
huxley statesagnosticism in fact is not a creed but a method the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle
the fundamental axiom of modern science
in matters of the intellect follow your reason as far as it will take you without regard to any other consideration
in matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable
use of that term has continued to the present day see thomas henry huxley and agnosticism
much of huxley s agnosticism is influenced by kantian views on human perception and the ability to rely on rational evidence rather than belief systems
in during preparation for the second romanes lecture huxley expressed his disappointment at the shortcomings of liberal theology describing its doctrines as popular illusions and the teachings they replaced faulty as they are appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth
vladimir lenin remarked that for huxley agnosticism serves as a fig leaf for materialism
see also the debate with wilberforce above
huxley s interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds after all he himself was largely self educated
there were his lecture courses for working men many of which were published afterwards and there was the use he made of journalism partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public
for most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals the westminster review the saturday review the reader the pall mall gazette macmillan s magazine the contemporary review
germany was still ahead in formal science education but interested people in victorian britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries
in huxley became principal of the south london working men s college in blackfriars road
the moving spirit was a portmanteau worker wm
rossiter who did most of the work the funds were put up mainly by f d
maurice s christian socialists
at sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by huxley this was some bargain and so was the free library organised by the college an idea which was widely copied
huxley thought and said that the men who attended were as good as any country squire
the technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective
a good example was the physical basis of life a lecture given in edinburgh on november
its theme that vital action is nothing more than the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it shocked the audience though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the fortnightly review for february
john morley the editor said no article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation
the issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word punch added professor protoplasm to his other soubriquets
the topic had been stimulated by huxley seeing the cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells which is indeed a sensational sight
for these audiences huxley s claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality but by the working of its constituent chemicals was surprising and shocking
today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do but little of that was known in the nineteenth century
when the archbishop of york thought this new philosophy was based on auguste comte s positivism huxley corrected him comte s philosophy is just catholicism minus christianity huxley vol of collected essays methods results
a later version was positivism is sheer popery with m
comte in the chair of st peter and with the names of the saints changed
lecture on the scientific aspects of positivism huxley lay sermons addresses and reviews p
huxley s dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that comte s ideas withered in britain
during his life and especially in the last ten years after retirement huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities
perhaps the best known of these topics is evolution and ethics which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy
both huxley and his grandson julian huxley gave romanes lectures on this theme
for a start huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority
next he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects
thus our emotions our intellect our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution and therefore inherited
despite this the details of our values and ethics are not inherited they are partly determined by our culture and partly chosen by ourselves
morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts ethics cannot be derived from the struggle for existence of moral purpose i see not a trace in nature
that is an article of exclusively human manufacture it is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices see ethics and evolutionary ethics
this seems to put huxley as a compatibilist in the free will vs determinism debate
in this argument huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend herbert spencer
huxley s dissection of rousseau s views on man and society is another example of his later work
the essay undermines rousseau s ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property
characteristic is the doctrine that all men are in any sense or have been at any time free and equal is an utterly baseless fiction
huxley s method of argumentation his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print is itself much studied
his career included controversial debates with scientists clerics and politicians persuasive discussions with royal commissions and other public bodies lectures and articles for the general public and a mass of detailed letter writing to friends and other correspondents
a large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies
huxley worked on ten royal and other commissions titles somewhat shortened here
the royal commission is the senior investigative forum in the british constitution
a rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education three involved medicine and three involved fisheries
several involve difficult ethical and legal issues
all deal with possible changes to law and or administrative practice
trawling for herrings on the coast of scotland
sea fisheries of the united kingdom
the contagious diseases acts
scientific instruction and the advancement of science
the practice of subjugating live animals to scientific experiments vivisection
the universities of scotland
the medical acts
the legal framework for medicine

sir julian huxley frs was the first director of unesco and a notable evolutionary biologist and humanist
aldous huxley was a famous author brave new world eyeless in gaza the doors of perception
sir andrew huxley om prs won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in
he was the second huxley to become president of the royal society other significant descendants of huxley such as sir crispin tickell are treated in the huxley family
biographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the huxley family
his father became sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind and later died in barming asylum brother george suffered from extreme mental anxiety and died in leaving serious debts
brother james a well known psychiatrist and superintendent of kent county asylum was at as near mad as any sane man can be
his favourite daughter the artistically talented mady marian who became the first wife of artist john collier was troubled by mental illness for years
she died of pneumonia in her mid twenties
about huxley himself we have a more complete record
as a young apprentice to a medical practitioner aged thirteen or fourteen huxley was taken to watch a post mortem dissection
afterwards he sank into a deep lethargy and though huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning bibby and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the depression
huxley recuperated on a farm looking thin and ill
the next episode we know of in huxley s life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of hms rattlesnake in
huxley had further periods of depression at the end of and again in
finally in he sank into another depression and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in at the age of
this is enough to indicate the way depression or perhaps a moderate bi polar disorder interfered with his life yet unlike some of the other family members he was able to function extremely well at other times
the problems continued sporadically into the third generation
two of leonard s sons suffered serious depression trevennen committed suicide in and julian suffered a breakdown in and five more later in life
darwin s ideas and huxley s controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires
it was the debate about man s place in nature that roused such widespread comment cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count darwin s head on a monkey s body is one of the visual clich s of the age
the great hippocampus question attracted particular attention
monkeyana punch vol
signed gorilla this turned out to be by sir philip egerton mp amateur naturalist fossil fish collector and richard owen s patron
the last two stanzas include a reference to huxley s comment that life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once next huxley repliesthat owen he liesand garbles his latin quotation that his facts are not new his mistakes not a few detrimental to his reputation to twice slay the slainby dint of the brain thus huxley concludes his review is but labour in vain unproductive of gain and so i shall bid you adieu

report of a sad case recently tried before the lord mayor owen versus huxley
lord mayor asks whether either side is known to the police policeman x huxley your worship i take to be a young hand but very vicious but owen i have seen before
he got into trouble with an old bone man called mantell who never could be off complaining as owen prigged his bones
people did say that the old man never got over it and owen worritted him to death but i don t think it was so bad as that
hears as owen takes the chair at a crib in bloomsbury
i don t think it will be a harmonic meeting altogether
and huxley hangs out in jermyn street
tom huxley s low set included hooker in the green and vegetable line and charlie darwin the pigeon fancier owen s crib in bloomsbury was the british museum of which natural history was but one department
jermyn street is known for its shops of men s clothing possibly implying that huxley was a dandy the water babies a fairy tale for a land baby by charles kingsley serialised in macmillan s magazine published in book form with additions in
kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to darwin s on the origin of species having long since
learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species and the story includes a satire on the reaction to darwin s theory with the main scientific participants appearing including richard owen and huxley
in thomas henry huxley s five year old grandson julian saw the illustration by edward linley sambourne right and wrote his grandfather a letter asking dear grandpater have you seen a waterbaby did you put it in a bottle did it wonder if it could get out could i see it some day your loving julian
huxley wrote back my dear julian i could never make sure about that water baby
my friend who wrote the story of the water baby was a very kind man and very clever
perhaps he thought i could see as much in the water as he did there are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things when you grow up i dare say you will be one of the great deal seers and see things more wonderful than the water babies where other folks can see nothing in october an far left history group reviewing colonial links told imperial college london that because huxley might now be called racist it should remove a bust of him and rename its huxley building
the group of academics had been launched in the wake of black lives matter protests in to address imperial s links to the british empire and build a fully inclusive organisation
it reported that huxley s paper emancipation black and white espouses a racial hierarchy of intelligence which helped feed ideas around eugenics which falls far short of imperial s modern values and that his theories might now be called racist in as much as he used racial divisions and hierarchical categorisation in his attempt to understand their origins in his studies of human evolution
imperial s provost ian walmsley responded that imperial would confront not cover up uncomfortable or awkward aspects of our past and this was very much not a cancel culture approach
students would be consulted before management decided on any action to be taken
a critical response noted that huxley was a public longstanding abolitionist who wrote the most complete demonstration of the specific diversity of the types of mankind will nowise constrain science to spread her gis over their slaveholders atrocities and the north is justified in any expenditure of blood or of money which shall eradicate a system hopelessly inconsistent with the moral elevation the political freedom or the economical progress of the american people a major opponent of the racist position of polygenism as well as the position that some human races were transitional in huxley said there was no shade of justification for the assertion that any existing modification of mankind now known was to be considered as an intermediate form between man and the animals next below him in the scale of the fauna of the world a vehement opponent of the scientific racist james hunt and a political radical who believed in granting equal rights and the vote to both blacks and women
