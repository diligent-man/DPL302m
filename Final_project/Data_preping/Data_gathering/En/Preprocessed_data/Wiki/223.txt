The first series was probably made by Ching chu in the th century who may have been a contemporary of Kuòān Shīyuǎn There are only five pictures in Ching chu's version and the ox's colour changes from dark to white representing the gradual development of the practitioner ending in the disappearance of the practitioner
Tzu te Hui Zide Huihui Jp Jitoku made a version with six pictures The sixth one goes beyond the stage of absolute emptiness where Ching chu's version ends Just like Ching chu's version the ox grows whiter along the way
A third version by an unknown author with ten pictures was the most popular in China It derives from the Ching chu and Tzu te Hui series of pictures and has a somewhat different series of pictures compared to Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version The edition contains a preface by Chu hung and it has ten pictures each of which is preceded by Pu ming's poem of whom Chu hung provides no further information In this version the ox's colour changes from dark to white
The best known version of the oxherding pictures was drawn by the th century Chinese Rinzai Chán Zen master Kuòān Shīyuǎn Jp Kaku an Shi en who also wrote accompanying poems and introductory words attached to the pictures In Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version there is no whitening process and his series also doesn't end with mere emptiness or absolute truth but shows a return to the world depicting Putai the laughing Buddha In Japan Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version gained a wide circulation the earliest one probably belonging to the fifteenth century
Liaoan Qingyu Jp Ryōan Seiyoku made another version with five pictures
