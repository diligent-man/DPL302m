In Reflections in Bullough's Pond Newton historian Diana Muir describes the early industries that developed in the late th and early th centuries in a series of mills built to take advantage of the water power available at Newton Upper Falls and Newton Lower Falls

The Boston and Worcester one of America's earliest railroads reached West Newton in
Wealthy Bostonian businessmen took advantage of the new commuting opportunity offered by the railroad building gracious homes on erstwhile farmland of West Newton hill and on Commonwealth street

The next wave came in the s when automobiles became affordable to a growing upper middle class
Even then however Oak Hill continued to be farmed mostly market gardening until the prosperity of the s made all of Newton more densely settled
