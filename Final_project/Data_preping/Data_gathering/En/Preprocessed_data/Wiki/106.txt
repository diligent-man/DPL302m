Newton is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States
It is approximately 7 miles (11 km) west of downtown Boston
 Newton resembles a patchwork of thirteen villages, without a city center
According to the 2020 U.S
Census, the population of Newton was 88,923.
Newton was settled in 1630 as part of "the newe towne", which was renamed Cambridge in 1638
Roxbury minister John Eliot persuaded the Native American people of Nonantum, a sub-tribe of the Massachusett led by a sachem named Waban, to relocate to Natick in 1651, fearing that they would be exploited by colonists
Newton was incorporated as a separate town, known as Cambridge Village, on December 15, 1681, then renamed Newtown in 1691, and finally Newton in 1766
It became a city on January 5, 1874
Newton is known as The Garden City.
In Reflections in Bullough's Pond, Newton historian Diana Muir describes the early industries that developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in a series of mills built to take advantage of the water power available at Newton Upper Falls and Newton Lower Falls
Snuff, chocolate, glue, paper and other products were produced in these small mills but, according to Muir, the water power available in Newton was not sufficient to turn Newton into a manufacturing city, although it was, beginning in 1902, the home of the Stanley Motor Carriage Company, the maker of the Stanley Steamer.
Newton, according to Muir, became one of America's earliest commuter suburbs
The Boston and Worcester, one of America's earliest railroads, reached West Newton in 1834
Wealthy Bostonian businessmen took advantage of the new commuting opportunity offered by the railroad, building gracious homes on erstwhile farmland of West Newton hill and on Commonwealth street
Muir points out that these early commuters needed sufficient wealth to employ a groom and keep horses, to drive them from their hilltop homes to the station.
Further suburbanization came in waves
One wave began with the streetcar lines that made many parts of Newton accessible for commuters in the late nineteenth century
The next wave came in the 1920s when automobiles became affordable to a growing upper middle class
Even then, however, Oak Hill continued to be farmed, mostly market gardening, until the prosperity of the 1950s made all of Newton more densely settled.
Two of the 9/11 hijackers stayed in Newton the night before the attack
The hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 spent their last night in Newton's Park Inn, an economy motel across the street from the Chestnut Hill Mall and within walking distance of The Atrium.
Each April on Patriots' Day, the Boston Marathon is run through the city, entering from Wellesley on Route 16 (Washington Street) where runners encounter the first of the four infamous Newton Hills
It then turns right onto Route 30 (Commonwealth Avenue) for the long haul into Boston
There are two more hills before reaching Centre Street, and then the fourth and most noted, Heartbreak Hill, rises shortly after Centre Street
Residents and visitors line the race route along Washington Street and Commonwealth Avenue to cheer the runners.
Newton is a suburban city approximately 7 mi (11 km) from downtown Boston, in Middlesex County, Massachusetts
The city is bordered by Waltham and Watertown on the north, Needham and the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston on the south, Wellesley and Weston on the west, and Brookline and the Brighton neighborhood of Boston on the east.
The Charles River flows along the north and west parts of Newton, and Route 128 passes through the west part of the city.
The Massachusetts Turnpike goes through the more urbanized northern section of the city before heading into Boston
Additional major highways in Newton include Route 9, serving the southern parts of the city, and Hammond Pond Parkway, which is the main north–south route through Chestnut Hill and provides access to Brookline and West Roxbury.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 18.2 square miles (47.1 km), of which 18.0 square miles (46.6 km) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km) (0.82%) is water.
Newton has grown around a formation of seven hills
"The general features of Newton are not without interest
Seven principal elevations mark its surface, like the seven hills of ancient Rome, with the difference that the seven hills of Newton are much more distinct than the seven hills of Rome: Nonantum Hill, Waban Hill, Chestnut Hill, Bald Pate, Oak Hill, Institution Hill and Mount Ida."
Rather than having a single city center, Newton is a patchwork of thirteen villages, many boasting small downtown areas of their own
The 13 villages are: Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Newton Centre, Newton Corner, Newton Highlands, Newton Lower Falls, Newton Upper Falls (both on the Charles River, and both former small industrial sites), Newtonville, Nonantum (also known as Silver Lake or "The Lake"), Oak Hill, Thompsonville, Waban and West Newton
Oak Hill Park is a place within the village of Oak Hill that itself is shown as a separate and distinct village on some city maps (including a map dated 2010 on the official City of Newton website), and Four Corners is also shown as a village on some city maps
Although most of the villages have a post office, they have no legal definition and no firmly defined borders
This village-based system often causes some confusion with addresses and for first-time visitors.
The record low temperature was −21 °F (−29 °C) in February 1934; the record high temperature was 101 °F (38 °C) in August 1975.

Newton's proximity to Boston, along with its good public schools and safe and quiet neighborhoods, make it a very desirable community for those who commute to Boston or work in Newton's businesses and industries.
Newton is well-served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service
The Green Line D branch, (also known as the Riverside branch) is a light rail line running through the center of the city that makes very frequent trips to downtown Boston, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes away
The Green Line B branch ends across from Boston College on Commonwealth Avenue, virtually at the border of Boston's  Brighton neighborhood and the City of Newton (an area which encompasses an unincorporated suburban village referred  to as Chestnut Hill)
The MBTA Worcester commuter rail, serving the northern villages of Newton that are proximate to Waltham, offers less frequent service to Boston
It runs from every half-an-hour during peak times to every couple of hours otherwise
The northern villages are also served by frequent express buses that go to downtown Boston via the Massachusetts Turnpike as well as Waltham.
Newton Centre, which is centered around the Newton Centre MBTA station, has been lauded as an example of transit-oriented development.
The Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), which basically follows the old Boston and Albany Railroad main line right-of-way, runs east and west through Newton, while Route 128 (Interstate 95) slices through the extreme western part of the city in the Lower Falls area
Route 30 (Commonwealth Avenue), Route 16 (Watertown Street west to West Newton, where it follows Washington Street west) and route 9 (Worcester Turnpike or Boylston Street) also run east and west through the city
Another major Boston (and Brookline) street, Beacon Street, runs west from the Boston city line to Washington Street west of the hospital, where it terminates at Washington Street.
There are no major north–south roads through Newton: every north–south street in Newton terminates within Newton at one end or the other
The only possible exception is Needham Street, which is north–south at the border between Newton and Needham, but it turns east and becomes Dedham Street, and when it reaches the Boston border, it goes south-east.
There are some north–south streets that are important to intra-Newton traveling
Centre Street runs south from the Watertown town line to Newton Highlands, where it becomes Winchester Street and terminates at Nahanton Street
Walnut Street runs south from Newtonville, where it starts at Crafts Street, down to Newton Highlands, where it ends at Dedham Street.
The City of Newton Police Department has 139 sworn officers
 The Newton Fire Department is fully paid and operates six engine companies, three ladder companies, and one rescue company from six stations.
