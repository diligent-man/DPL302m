In internationalization CJK characters is a collective term for the Chinese Japanese and Korean languages all of which include Chinese characters and derivatives in their writing systems sometimes paired with other scripts
Collectively the CJK characters often include Hnz in Chinese Kanji and Kana in Japanese Hanja and Hangul in Korean
Rarely Vietnamese is included making the abbreviation CJKV since Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters as well in which context they were known as Ch Hn and Ch Nm in Vietnamese
Standard Mandarin Chinese and Standard Cantonese are written almost exclusively in Chinese characters
Over characters are required for general literacy with up to characters for reasonably complete coverage
Japanese uses fewer characters—general literacy in Japanese can be expected with characters
The use of Chinese characters in Korea is increasingly rare although idiosyncratic use of Chinese characters in proper names requires knowledge and therefore availability of many more characters
Even today however South Korean students are taught characters
Other scripts used for these languages such as bopomofo and the Latin-based pinyin for Chinese hiragana and katakana for Japanese and hangul for Korean are not strictly CJK characters although CJK character sets almost invariably include them as necessary for full coverage of the target languages
Until the early th century Classical Chinese was the written language of government and scholarship in Vietnam
Popular literature in Vietnamese was written in the ch Nm script consisting of borrowed Chinese characters together with many characters created locally
From s onwards the script since then used for recording literature has been the Latin ch Quc ng
The sinologist Carl Leban produced an early survey of CJK encoding systems
The number of characters required for complete coverage of all these languages' needs cannot fit in the -character code space of -bit character encodings requiring at least a -bit fixed width encoding or multi-byte variable-length encodings
The -bit fixed width encodings such as those from Unicode up to and including version are now deprecated due to the requirement to encode more characters than a -bit encoding can accommodate—Unicode has some Han characters—and the requirement by the Chinese government that software in China support the GB character set
Although CJK encodings have common character sets the encodings often used to represent them have been developed separately by different East Asian governments and software companies and are mutually incompatible
Unicode has attempted with some controversy to unify the character sets in a process known as Han unification
CJK character encodings should consist minimally of Han characters plus language-specific phonetic scripts such as pinyin bopomofo hiragana katakana and hangul
The CJK character sets take up the bulk of the assigned Unicode code space
There is much controversy among Japanese experts of Chinese characters about the desirability and technical merit of the Han unification process used to map multiple Chinese and Japanese character sets into a single set of unified characters
All three languages can be written both left-to-right and top-to-bottom right-to-left and top-to-bottom in ancient documents but are usually considered left-to-right scripts when discussing encoding issues
Libraries cooperated on encoding standards for JACKPHY characters in the early s
