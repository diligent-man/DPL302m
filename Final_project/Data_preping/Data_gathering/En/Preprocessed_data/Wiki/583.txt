Though the novel is considered children's literature critics noted that this adaptation might not be appropriate for young children Ginia Bellafante wrote in The New York Times that it is ultimately too jaunty to be considered percent safe for someone over and David Knox thought it may well alienate children However Variety's Brian Lowry said that its appeal should run the demographic gamut for PBS from Sesame Street to Bleak House
Critics praised Matt Lucas's portrayal of Mr Toad In ordinary life Mr Lucas’s frame does not suggest that he is a salad and pea shoots kind of guy and here he has fun with an exaggerated corpulence that seems to leave him channeling W C Fields wrote Bellafante David Knox wrote that Lucas’ performance positively swamps this treatment of the classic story
