Road bicycle racing involve both team and individual competition and races are contested in various ways
They range from the one-day road race criterium and time trial to multi-stage events like the Tour de France and its sister events which make up cycling's Grand Tours
The races typically take place from spring through to autumn
Many riders from the northern hemisphere spend the winter in countries such as Australia to compete or train
Professional races range from the three-week Grand Tour stage races such as the Tour de France Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espa√±a to multi-day stage races such as the Tour de Suisse and Tour of California to single day Classics such as the Tour of Flanders and MilanSan Remo
The longest one-day road race sanctioned by USA Cycling is Lotoja which covers the miles km from Logan Utah to Jackson Wyoming
Criteriums are races based on circuits typically less than a mile in length and sometimes run for a set time min min etc rather than a specific distance
Criteriums are the most popular form of road racing in North America
In Belgium kermesses are popular single-day events of usually over km

The bicycles and courses in gravel racing vary widely from road bicycles with wide tires used on smooth gravel roads to bicycles that are similar to mountain bike used on courses that include technical trails
Speeds achieved on indoor tracks are usually greater than those on roads
Other factors affecting speed are the route profile flats and hills wind conditions temperatures and elevation
At a event in Mexico Franois Pervis achieved an average of metres per second kmh mph with a flying start over meters
The top average speed over the men's km time trial at the Summer Olympics was metres per second kmh mph recorded by Chris Hoy
Average speeds clearly drop with increasing distance so that over the km Cootamundra Annual Classic it is metres per second kmh mph
In the km Paris-Roubaix Fabian Cancellara set a speed of metres per second kmh mph while over the km Furnace Creek the speed drops dramatically to metres per second kmh mph
For an extreme road distance such as the km Race Across America the average speed of the record holder is metres per second kmh mph while the km Freedom Trail over mountainous terrain in South Africa is at a record speed of metres per second kmh mph
Mountain bike trials is a sport where riders navigate natural and man-made obstacles without putting down their foot or dabbing
Points are awarded for bike handling skills
Freestyle BMX is an extreme sport of stunt riding BMX bikes
