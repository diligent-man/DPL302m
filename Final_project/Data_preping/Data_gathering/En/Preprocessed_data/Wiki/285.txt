in keeping with zen s mahayana tradition the iconography in various buildings is an array of potential confusion for newcomers at the sanmon are four kings standing guard named shitenno the buddha hall s main altar has three statues of buddhas past present and future the hatto displays kannon the bodhisattva of compassion and four white lions called the a un no shishi the yokushitsu has baddabara the sanshokaku has a statue of hotei and the tosu displays ucchusma
d gen founded eihei ji in with the name sanshoho daibutsuji in the woods of rural japan quite far from the distractions of kamakura period urban life
he appointed a successor but sometime after his death the abbacy of eihei ji became hotly disputed a schism now called the sandai s ron
until eihei ji was not held by the current keizan line of s t but by the line of d gen s chinese disciple jakuen

as eihei ji and s ji ji became rivals over the centuries eihei ji made claims based on the fact of d gen s original residence there
