caliban k l b n kal i ban son of the witch sycorax is an important character in william shakespeare s play the tempest
his character is one of the few shakespearean figures to take on a life of its own outside shakespeare s own work as russell hoban put it caliban is one of the hungry ideas he s always looking for someone to word him into being
caliban is a necessary idea
caliban is half human half monster
after his island becomes occupied by prospero and his daughter miranda caliban is forced into slavery
while he is referred to as a calvaluna or mooncalf a freckled monster he is the only human inhabitant of the island that is otherwise not honour d with a human shape prospero i
in some traditions he is depicted as a wild man or a deformed man or a beast man or sometimes a mix of fish and man a dwarf or even a tortoise
banished from algiers sycorax was left on the isle pregnant with caliban and died before prospero s arrival
caliban despite his inhuman nature clearly loved and worshipped his mother referring to setebos as his mother s god and appealing to her powers against prospero
prospero explains his harsh treatment of caliban by claiming that after initially befriending him caliban attempted to rape miranda
caliban confirms this gleefully saying that if he had not been stopped he would have peopled the island with a race of calibans thou didst prevent me i had peopled else this isle with calibans act i ii
prospero then entraps caliban and torments him with harmful magic if caliban does not obey his orders
resentful of prospero caliban takes stephano one of the shipwrecked servants as a god and as his new master
caliban learns that stephano is neither a god nor prospero s equal in the conclusion of the play however and caliban agrees to obey prospero again
be not afeard the isle is full of noises
sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
will hum about mine ears and sometime voices
that if i then had waked after long sleep
will make me sleep again and then in dreaming
the clouds me thought would open and show riches
ready to drop upon me that when i waked
i cried to dream again
there is a long history of enthusiastic speculation on the name s origin or derivation
one of the most prominent suggestions concerns caliban being an anagram of the spanish word can bal carib people the source of cannibal in english
the character may be seen as a satire on noble cannibal from montaigne s essays a of cannibals
also popular has been comparison to kaliban or cauliban in the romani language which mean black or with blackness
the first romanichal had arrived in england a century before shakespeare s time
since it has been suggested that shakespeare may have named caliban after the tunisian city calibia now called kelibia that is seen on maps of the mediterranean dating to
many other though less notable suggestions have been made primarily in the th century including an arabic word for vile dog a hindu kalee ban satyr of kalee the hindu proserpine german kabeljau codfish etc
