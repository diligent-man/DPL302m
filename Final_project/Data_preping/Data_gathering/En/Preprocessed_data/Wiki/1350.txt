The politics of Vietnam are dominated by a single party the Communist Party of Vietnam CPV
The President of Vietnam is the head of state and the Prime Minister of Vietnam is the head of government both of these are separate from the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam who leads the Communist Party and is head of the Politburo and the Central Military Commission thus the General Secretary is the de facto supreme leader of Vietnam
Executive power is exercised by the government and the President of Vietnam
Legislative power is vested in the National Assembly of Vietnam Vietnamese Quc hi Vit Nam
The Judiciary is independent of the executive
The parliament adopted the current Constitution of Vietnam its fifth on November
The Vietnamese political system is authoritarian with the freedom of assembly association expression press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted
There are no freely elected national leaders political opposition is suppressed all religious activity is controlled by the CPV and dissent is not permitted and civil rights are curtailed
Elections in Vietnam occur under a single-party authoritarian political system
Vietnam is among the few contemporary party-led dictatorships to not hold any direct elections at the national level
The competitive nature of the elections is highly constrained by the Communist Party's monopoly on power in Vietnam limitations on free speech and government interference with the elections
The National Assembly is a unicameral legislative body
The National Assembly has members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms
The legislature is according to the constitution the highest organ of the state
Its powers includes the enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws the adoption of the government budget supervising the Government of Vietnam and other holders of public powers responsible to the National Assembly and appointing members of the judiciary
The Vietnamese constitution and legislation provide for regular elections for the office of the President of the Socialist Republic the National Assembly and the People's Councils
The National Assembly has been characterised as nothing more than a rubber stamp
The President Ch tch nưc is elected by National Assembly for a five-year term and acts as the de jure commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces and Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security
However the president has the right to decide on executive brands
The government Chnh ph the main executive state power of Vietnam is headed by the Prime Minister who has several Deputy Prime Ministers and several ministers in charge of particular activities

The current constitution was adopted on November by the National Assembly of Vietnam
There have been four other constitutions in Vietnamese history the and constitutions
The Communist Party of Vietnam the leading non-State organ operates in accordance with the laws
Government powers in Vietnam are divided into legislative executive and judiciary powers
Vietnam's legal system is based upon socialist legality according to Article of the constitution
Vietnam is a socialist republic with a one-party system led by the Communist Party of Vietnam CPV
The CPV espouses MarxismLeninism and H Ch Minh Thought the political philosophy and ideology of the late H Ch Minh
The two ideologies function as a firm ideological basis and serve as guidance for the activities of the Party and state
According to the Constitution Vietnam is in the period of transition to socialism
MarxismLeninism was introduced to Vietnam in the s and s and Vietnamese culture has been led under the banner of patriotism and MarxismLeninism
H Ch Minh's beliefs were not systematised during his life nor quickly following his death
Trưng Chinh's biography of Chairman H in emphasised his revolutionary policies
The thoughts of H Ch Minh were systematised in under the leadership of Nguyn Vn Linh
H Ch Minh Thought alongside MarxismLeninism became the official ideology of the CPV and the state in
The CPV's claim to legitimacy was retained following the collapse of communism in and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in by its commitment to the thoughts of H Ch Minh according to Sophie Quinn-Judge
According to Pierre Brocheux the author of Ho Chi Minh a Biography the current state ideology is H Ch Minh Thought with MarxismLeninism playing a secondary role
While some claim that H Ch Minh Thought is used as a veil for the Party leadership since they according to this version have stopped believing in communism others claim this is not true considering that H Ch Minh was an avid supporter of the dictatorship of the proletariat
Others see H Ch Minh Thought as a political umbrella term whose main function is to smuggle in non-socialist ideas and policies without challenging socialist legality
Since its foundation the key ideology has been MarxismLeninism but since the introduction of a mixed economy in the late s and s it has lost its monopolistic ideological and moral legitimacy
As became clear because of the Đi Mi reforms the Party could not base its rule on defending only the workers and the peasants which was officially referred to as the working class-peasant alliance
In the constitution introduced in the State represented the workers peasants and intellectuals
In recent years the Party has stopped representing a specific class but instead the interests of the entire people which includes entrepreneurs
The final class barrier was removed in when party members were allowed to engage in private activities
In the face of de-emphasising the role of MarxismLeninism the Party has acquired a broader ideology placing more emphasis on nationalism developmentalism and becoming the protector of tradition
According to the official version the Communist Party of Vietnam Vietnamese Đng Cng sn Vit Nam is leading the Vietnamese people in carrying out the country's renovation modernisation and industrialisation According to the Party's statute amended at the th National Congress on April the CPV was established and trained by President H Ch Minh has led the Vietnamese people to carry out successfully the August Revolution establishing the Democratic Republic of Vit Nam now the Socialist Republic of Vit Nam to defeat foreign invaders to abolish the colonial and feudalist regime to liberate and reunify the country and then carry out the cause of renovation and socialist construction and firmly defend national independence It believes in socialist internationalism of the working class and supports the struggle for peace national independence democracy and social progress of the world's people The CPV acts as the vanguard of the working people and the whole nation by representing their interests
Its aim is to create a strong independent prosperous and democratic country with an equitable and civilized society to realise socialism and ultimately communism The Party's ideological foundation is MarxismLeninism and H Ch Minh Thoughts
These ideologies guide the activities of the Party while promoting the nation's traditions and absorbing other nations' essential ideas
The CPV is organised on the principles of democratic centralism
It practices criticism self-criticism and strict discipline and pursues collective leadership and individual responsibility and promoting comradeship and solidarity in line with the Party's political programs and statutes The CPV is subject to Vietnamese laws and the Constitution
It is the country's ruling party and promotes the mastery of the people over the country
The Party is under the supervision of the people
It is dependent on having the people contribute to the party by strengthening uniting and leading the people in the revolutionary cause
The political system in Vietnam is led by the CPV and it leads respects and promotes the role of the State the Vietnamese Fatherland Front VFF and other socio-political organisations
The National Congress is the party's highest organ
The direction of the Party and the Government is decided at the National Congress held every fifth year
The Central Committee is elected by the National Congress
Delegates vote on policies and candidate posts within the central party leadership
Following ratification of the decisions taken at the National Congress the National Congress dissolves itself
The Central Committee which is elected by the National Congress every fifth year implements the decisions of the National Congress in the five-year period
Since the Central Committee only meets twice a year the Politburo implements the policies of the National Congress
The Central Committee CC is the CPV's most powerful institution
It delegates some of its powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo when it is not in session
When the Vietnam War ended in the Vietnamese leadership led by L Duẩn began to centralise power
This policy continued until the th National Congress when Nguyn Vn Linh took power
Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation
The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives because of this Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders
This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the s
The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the s this is proven by the fact that V Vn Kit tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the s without success
These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee for example more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work
Because of these changes power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved
The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of percent in to a high of percent in
The former President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Trưng Tn Sang was directly elected from the provinces at the th Party Congress held in
Because of the devolution of power the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially for instance when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining L Kh Phiu as General Secretary the leader of Vietnam the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing L Kh Phiu from his post of General Secretary
The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background or were working in the provinces because of this these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during L Kh Phiu's rule
The Central Committee elects the Politburo in the aftermath of the Party Congress
Since the full Central Committee meets only once a year the Politburo functions as the Party's leading collective decision-making body
The Secretariat is also elected by the Central Committee and is headed by the General Secretary Vietnamese Tng B thư Ban Chp hnh Trung ưng Đng Cng sn Vit Nam
It is responsible for solving organisational problems and implementing the demands of the Central Committee

The Ministry of Defence MOD has military tribunals which have the same rules as civil courts
Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC but the SPC has supervisory responsibility
Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors who lack administrative training the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary in part because the Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability
Moreover the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position
In an effort to increase judicial independence the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September
However the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal
