Black schools also referred to as colored schools were racially segregated schools in the United States that originated after the American Civil War and Reconstruction era
The phenomenon began in the late s during Reconstruction era when Southern states under biracial Republican governments created public schools for the ex enslaved
After conservative whites took control across the South
They continued the black schools but at a much lower funding rate than white schools
After the Civil War there were only a handful of schools open to blacks such as the African Free School in New York and the Abiel Smith School in Boston
Individuals and churches especially the Quakers sometimes provided instruction as well
Catholics had established Black schools via Black nuns such as St
The proposal to set up a colored college in New Haven produced a violent reaction and the project was abandoned
Schools in which black and white children studied together were destroyed by mobs in Connecticut and New Hampshire
Few African Americans in the South received any education at all until after the Civil War
Slaves had been prohibited from being educated and there was generally no public school system for white children either
The planter elite paid for private education for its children
Legislatures of Republican freedmen and whites established public schools for the first time during the Reconstruction era
At the beginning of the Reconstruction era teachers in integrated schools were predominantly white
Black educators and education leadership found that many of these white teachers effectively convinced black students that they were inferior This led to distrust of the structure of public education at that time
Because of racism directed at Black students public schools became segregated throughout the south during Reconstruction and until the s
New Orleans was a partial exception its schools were usually integrated during Reconstruction
After the white Democrats regained power in Southern states in the s during the next two decades they imposed Jim Crow laws mandating segregation
They disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through poll taxes and literacy tests
Services for black schools and any black institution routinely received far less financial support than white schools
In addition the South was extremely poor for years in the aftermath of the war its infrastructure destroyed and dependent on an agricultural economy despite falling cotton prices
Into the th century black schools had second-hand books and buildings see Station One Schooland teachers were paid less and had larger classes
In Washington DC however because public school teachers were federal employees African-American and Caucasian teachers were paid the same
The Virginia Constitution of mandated a system of public education for the first time but the newly established schools were operated on a segregated basis
In these early schools which were mostly rural as was characteristic of the South classes were most often taught by a single teacher who taught all subjects ages and grades
Chronic underfunding led to constantly over-populated schools despite the relatively low percentage of African-American students in schools overall
In the average black school in Virginia had percent more pupils in attendance than the average white school
This discrimination continued for several years as demonstrated by the fact that in in Halifax County Virginia the total value of white school property was contrasted to only for the county's black schools
In the s the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People launched a national campaign to achieve equal schools within the separate but equal framework of the US
White hostility towards this campaign kept black schools from necessary resources
According to Rethinking Schools magazine Over the first three decades of the th century the funding gap between black and white schools in the South increasingly widened
NAACP studies of unequal expenditures in the mid-to-late s found that Georgia spent per year on each African-American child as opposed to on each white child
A study by Doxey Wilkerson at the end of the s found that only percent of - to -year-old African Americans were enrolled in high school The NAACP won several victories with this campaign particularly around salary equalization
A part-owner and leader of Sears Roebuck and Company he was responsible for establishing the Rosenwald Fund
Washington in Rosenwald created his fund to improve the education of southern blacks by building schools mostly in rural areas
More than were built in the South by the time of Rosenwald's death in
He created a system of requiring matching public funds and interracial community cooperation for maintenance and operation of schools
Black communities essentially taxed themselves twice to raise money to support new schools often donating land and labor to get them built
With increasing urbanization Rosenwald schools in many rural areas were abandoned
Some have been converted to community centers and in more urban areas maintained or renovated as schools
In modern times the National Trust for Historic Preservation has called Rosenwald Schools as worthy of preservation as beacons of African American education
Septima Clark was an American educator civil rights activist and the creator of citizenship schools in
Clark's project initially developed from secret literacy courses she held for African American adults in the Deep South
Citizenship schools helped Black Southerners push for the right to vote as well as create activists and leaders for the Civil Rights Movement using a curriculum that instilled self-pride cultural-pride literacy and a sense of one's citizenship rights
The citizenship school project trained over citizenship school teachers who led over citizenship schools throughout the South that was responsible for registering approximately African Americans to vote
An activist of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee SNCC in Charles Cobb proposed that the organization sponsor a network of Freedom Schools
Originally Freedom Schools were organized to achieve social political and economic equality through teaching African American students to be social change agents for the Civil Rights Movement Black educators and activists later utilized the schools to provide schooling in areas where black public schools were closed in reaction to the Brown v
More than of these free schools existed by the end of the summer in serving close to students
Public schools were technically desegregated in the United States in by the US
Supreme Court decision in Brown vs Board of Education
Some schools such as the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute were forced into a limited form of desegregation before that with the Baltimore City Public School System voting to desegregate the prestigious advanced placement programme in
However many were still de facto segregated due to inequality in housing and patterns of racial segregation in neighborhoods
President Dwight Eisenhower enforced the Supreme Court's decision by sending US Army troops to Little Rock Arkansas to protect the Little Rock Nine students' entry to school in thus setting a precedent for the Executive Branch to enforce Supreme Court rulings related to racial integration
He was the first president since Reconstruction to send Federal troops into the South to protect the rights of African Americans
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education ruling the Supreme Court allowed the federal government to force mandatory busing on Charlotte North Carolina and other cities nationwide in order to affect student assignment based on race and to attempt to further integrate schools
This was meant to combat patterns of de facto segregation that had developed in northern as well as southern cities
Bradley decision placed a limitation on Swann when they ruled that students could only be bused across district lines when evidence existed of de jure segregation across multiple school districts
In the s and s under federal court supervision many school districts implemented mandatory busing plans within their districts
Busing was controversial because it took students out of their own neighborhoods and further away from their parents' supervision and support
Even young students sometimes had lengthy bus rides each day
Districts also experimented with creating incentives for instance magnet schools to attract different students voluntarily
According to the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University the desegregation of US
public schools peaked in since then schools have become more segregated because of changes in demographic residential patterns with continuing growth in suburbs and new communities
Jonathan Kozol has found that as of the proportion of Black students at majority-white schools was at a level lower than in any year since Changing population patterns with dramatically increased growth in the South and Southwest decreases in old industrial cities and much increased immigration of new ethnic groups have altered school populations in many areas
Black school districts continue to try various programs to improve student and school performance including magnet schools and special programs related to the economic standing of families
Omaha proposed incorporating some suburban districts within city limits to enlarge its school-system catchment area
It wanted to create a one tax one school system that would also allow it to create magnet programs to increase diversity in now predominantly white schools
Ernest Chambers a -year-serving African-American state senator from North Omaha Nebraska believed a different solution was needed
Some observers said that in practical terms public schools in Omaha had been re-segregated since the end of busing in
In Chambers offered an amendment to the Omaha school reform bill in the Nebraska State Legislature which would provide for creation of three school districts in Omaha according to current racial demographics black white and Hispanic with local community control of each district
He believed this would give the African-American community the chance to control a district in which their children were the majority
Opponents to the measure described it as state-sponsored segregation
The authors of a Harvard study on re-segregation believe current trends in the South of white teachers leaving predominantly black schools is an inevitable result of federal court decisions limiting former methods of civil rights-era protections such as busing and affirmative action in school admissions
Teachers and principals cite other issues such as economic and cultural barriers in schools with high rates of poverty as well as teachers' choices to work closer to home or in higher-performing schools
In some areas black teachers are also leaving the profession resulting in teacher shortages
