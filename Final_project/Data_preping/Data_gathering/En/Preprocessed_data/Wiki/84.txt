The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas was originally Norman, and the blocked head of a Norman window above the north arcade show that the building had a clerestory in Norman times
In the 13th century Early English Gothic north and south aisles were added, with four-bay arcades linking the aisles with the nave
Both aisles still retain some lancet windows from this period
 The bell tower was built early in the 14th century in the Decorated Gothic style
A chapel was added at the east end of the north aisle
The chapel's east and north windows in the Transitional style between Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic date it to the chancel about the middle of the 14th century
Later pure Perpendicular Gothic additions include the windows and north door in the north aisle, the present clerestory and nave roof and the chancel arch
In 1870 the Gothic Revival architect Charles Buckeridge completely rebuilt the chancel
