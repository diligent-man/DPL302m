reutemann came into the race tied on points at the top of the drivers championship with brazilian nelson piquet driving a brabham ford
piquet suffered a last lap engine failure which dropped him from third to sixth giving reutemann a three point lead in the championship with two races remaining
qualifying saw ren arnoux take pole position in his renault by seconds from carlos reutemann s williams
it was arnoux s fourth pole position of the season and the sixth in succession for the renault team
alain prost was third in the other renault with jacques laffite in the ligier alongside him on the second row of the grid
alan jones in the other williams and nelson piquet in the brabham made up the third row and the top ten was completed by john watson in the mclaren didier pironi and gilles villeneuve in the two ferraris and bruno giacomelli in the alfa romeo
for the first time the toleman team qualified for a race with brian henton taking rd
teammate derek warwick failed to qualify along with marc surer in the theodore beppe gabbiani in the osella siegfried stohr in the arrows and keke rosberg and chico serra in the two fittipaldis
stohr crashed heavily during the qualifying session already haunted by the trauma of nearly killing mechanic dave luckett in belgium earlier in the season he ultimately decided to stop racing and start a successful motor racing academy
on the run up to the first chicane prost passed both reutemann and teammate arnoux to take the lead while pironi jumped from eighth to fourth
reutemann then overtook arnoux at the curva grande before pironi overtook both to run second by the end of the lap
as prost opened up a lead arnoux re passed reutemann on lap and pironi on lap
laffite having already passed reutemann then overtook pironi for third on lap as villeneuve retired with an engine failure
on lap laffite dropped out with a puncture by which point pironi had dropped back behind reutemann and jones
as rain started to fall jones passed teammate reutemann for third
at the end of the lap eddie cheever spun his tyrrell out at the parabolica on the next lap arnoux himself spun out after swerving to avoid cheever s abandoned car leaving prost comfortably clear of jones
reutemann struggling as the track started to dry again soon fell to eighth behind giacomelli patrick tambay in the second ligier who had only started th piquet pironi and watson
on lap watson lost control exiting the second lesmo bend and smashed into the barriers at high speed
the mclaren was torn in two with the gearbox and rear wheels going across the track and clipping the second tyrrell of michele alboreto who also retired
watson escaped unharmed
on lap tambay like teammate laffite retired with a puncture before giacomelli pulled into the pits with a jammed gearbox on lap
piquet was thus promoted to third with pironi fourth and reutemann fifth followed by mario andretti in the second alfa romeo elio de angelis in the lotus and andrea de cesaris in the second mclaren
reutemann soon passed pironi again before andretti suffered an engine failure on lap
as prost cruised to victory ultimately finishing some seconds ahead of jones piquet looked set to hold off championship rival reutemann for third until his engine blew on the last lap
reutemann duly went past as did de angelis and pironi
piquet was classified sixth ahead of de cesaris who himself suffered a puncture on the last lap
the only other finishers were giacomelli jean pierre jarier in the second osella and henton
reutemann thus led the drivers championship by three points from piquet with two races remaining with prost jones and laffite all retaining outside chances of the title
the williams team meanwhile needed just two more points to secure their second consecutive constructors championship
