According to the 2010 Census, ethnic Russians make up two-thirds of the republic's population, while the ethnic Buryats are only 30%
 Other groups include Ukrainians (0.6%), Tatars (0.7%), and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population.
Mongolic-related Slab Grave cultural monuments are found in Baikal territory
The territory of Buryatia has been governed by the Xiongnu Empire (209 BC-93 CE) and Mongolian Xianbei state (93-234), Rouran Khaganate (330-555), Mongol Empire (1206-1368) and Northern Yuan (1368-1691).
Medieval Mongol tribes like Merkit, Bayads, Barga Mongols and Tümeds inhabited in Buryatia
Today Buryat-Mongols populate the territory of Buryatia.
From 1727 it was the border crossing for the Kyakhta trade between Russia and China.Kyakhta's founder, the Serb Sava Vladislavich, established it as a trading point between Russia and the Qing Empire.
In 1923, the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Buryat: Буряадай Автономито Совет Социалис Республика; Russian: Бурятская Автономная Советская Социалистическая Республика) was created as a result of the merger of State of Buryat-Mongolia and Mongol-Buryat Oblasts
In 1937, Aga Buryatia and Ust-Orda Buryatia were detached from the Buryat-Mongolian ASSR and merged with Chita and Irkutsk Oblasts, respectively
In 1958, the name "Mongol" was removed from the name of the republic
The Buryat ASSR declared its sovereignty in 1990 and adopted the name Republic of Buryatia in 1992
However, it remained an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation
On 11 July 1995 Buryatia signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy
This agreement would be abolished on 15 February 2002.
The head of the Republic is the Head (formerly President), who the voters of the republic elect for a four-year term
From 2004 to 2012 the head of Buryatia (along with all other heads of regions in Russia) was nominated directly by the Russian President.
Between 1991 and 2007, the President was Leonid Vasilyevich Potapov, who was elected on July 1, 1994, re-elected in 1998 (with 63.25% of votes), and then re-elected again on June 23, 2002 (with over 67% of votes)
Prior to the elections, Potapov was the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic—the highest post at that time.
The current Head of the Republic is Alexey Tsydenov, who was elected by popular vote on 10 September 2017
Prior to this he was acting Head, having been appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2017.
The Republic's parliament is the People's Khural, popularly elected every five years
 The People's Khural has 66 deputies and is currently dominated by the country's ruling party, United Russia, with 45 seats
Vladimir Anatolyevich Pavlov has been Chairman of the People's Khural since September 2019.
The Republic's Constitution was adopted on February 22, 1994.
The republic's economy is composed of agricultural and commercial products including wheat, vegetables, potatoes, timber, leather, graphite, and textiles
Fishing, hunting, fur farming, sheep and cattle farming, mining, stock raising, engineering, and food processing are also important economic generators.
The higher education institutions of the republic include Buryat State University, Buryat State Academy of Agriculture, East Siberian State Academy of Arts and Culture, and East Siberia State University of Technology and Management.
Traditionally, Buryats adhered to belief systems that were based on the deification of nature, belief in spirits, and the possibility of their magic influence on the surroundings
They were led by shamans, who systematized tribal beliefs and cults
From the second half of the 17th century, beliefs and cults in the shamanic form were displaced by Buddhism, which became widespread in ethnic Buryatia
By the end of the 19th century, the majority of Buryats were part of the Buddhist tradition
A synthesis of Buddhism and traditional beliefs that formed a system of ecological traditions has constituted a major attribute of Buryat culture.
As of a 2012 survey 27.4% of the population adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 19.8% to Buddhism, 2% to the Slavic Native Faith, Tengrism or Buryat shamanism, 4% declares to be unaffiliated Christian (excluding Protestants), 1% are Orthodox Christian believers without belonging to churches or are members of other Orthodox churches, 1% are members of Protestant churches
In addition, 25% of the population declares to be "spiritual but not religious", 13% to be atheist, and 10.8% follows another religion or did not give an answer to the survey.
Tibetan Buddhism and Orthodox Christianity are the most widespread religions in the republic
Many Slavs, who constitute around 67% of the population, are Russian Orthodox
Since the breakup of the USSR in 1991, a small number have converted to various Protestant denominations or to Rodnovery, Slavic native faith
There are also some Catholics among the Slavs
Most of the Germans (0.11% of the population) are also Orthodox, so are some other non-European groups like Armenians (0.23%), Georgians (0.03%), and Soyot (0.37%)
Buryats constitute 30.04% of the total population.
Most urban Buryats are either Buddhist or Orthodox, while those in the rural areas often adhere to Yellow shamanism, a mixture of shamanism and Buddhism, or to Black shamanism
There are also Tengrist movements
Siberian Tatars are around 0.7% of the population
However, due to isolation from the main body of Tatars, many of them now are either non-religious or Orthodox
Islam is followed by immigrant groups like Azeris and Uzbeks, who constitute another 0.7% of the population.
Lake Baikal is a popular tourist destination, especially in summer.
