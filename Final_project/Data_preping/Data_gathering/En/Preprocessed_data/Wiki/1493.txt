this article is about the history of the united states federal reserve system from its creation to the present
the federal reserve system is the third central banking system in united states history
the first bank of the united states and the second bank of the united states each had a year charter
both banks issued currency made commercial loans accepted deposits purchased securities maintained multiple branches and acted as fiscal agents for the u s
treasury
the u s
federal government was required to purchase of the bank capital stock shares and to appoint of the board members directors of each of those first two banks of the united states therefore each bank s majority control was placed squarely in the hands of wealthy investors who purchased the remaining of the stock
these banks were opposed by state chartered banks who saw them as very large competitors and by many who insisted that they were in reality banking cartels compelling the common man to maintain and support them
president andrew jackson vetoed legislation to renew the second bank of the united states starting a period of free banking
jackson staked the legislative success of his second presidential term on the issue of central banking
every monopoly and all exclusive privileges are granted at the expense of the public which ought to receive a fair equivalent
the many millions which this act proposes to bestow on the stockholders of the existing bank must come directly or indirectly out of the earnings of the american people jackson said in
jackson s second term in office ended in march without the second bank of the united states s charter being renewed
in as a means to help finance the civil war a system of national banks was instituted by the national currency act
the banks each had the power to issue standardized national bank notes based on united states bonds held by the bank
the act was totally revised in and later named as the national bank act or national banking act as it is popularly known
the administration of the new national banking system was vested in the newly created office of the comptroller of the currency and its chief administrator the comptroller of the currency
the office which still exists today examines and supervises all banks chartered nationally and is a part of the u s
treasury department
national bank currency was considered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of u s
treasury bonds
if treasury bond prices declined a national bank had to reduce the amount of currency it had in circulation by either refusing to make new loans or by calling in loans it had made already
the related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile pyramidal reserve system in which nationally chartered rural agriculture based banks were required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks which in turn were required to have reserves in central city banks
during the planting seasons rural banks would exploit their reserves to finance full plantings and during the harvest seasons they would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves
a national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds by borrowing from a clearing house or by calling in loans
as there was little in the way of deposit insurance if a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems then this might cause many people to remove their funds from the bank
because of the crescendo effect of banks which lent more than their assets could cover during the last quarter of the th century and the beginning of the th century the united states economy went through a series of financial panics
prior to a particularly severe panic in there was a motivation for renewed demands for banking and currency reform
the following year congress enacted the aldrich vreeland act which provided for an emergency currency and established the national monetary commission to study banking and currency reform
the chief of the bipartisan national monetary commission was financial expert and senate republican leader nelson aldrich
aldrich set up two commissions one to study the american monetary system in depth and the other headed by aldrich to study the european central banking systems and report on them
aldrich went to europe opposed to centralized banking but after viewing germany s banking system he came away believing that a centralized bank was better than the government issued bond system that he had previously supported
centralized banking was met with much opposition from politicians who were suspicious of a central bank and who charged that aldrich was biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as j p
morgan and his daughter s marriage to john d
rockefeller jr
in aldrich and executives representing the banks of j p
morgan rockefeller and kuhn loeb co secluded themselves for ten days at jekyll island georgia
the executives included frank a
vanderlip president of the national city bank of new york associated with the rockefellers henry davison senior partner of j p
morgan company charles d
norton president of the first national bank of new york and col
edward m
house who would later become president woodrow wilson s closest adviser and founder of the council on foreign relations
there paul warburg of kuhn loeb co
directed the proceedings and wrote the primary features of what would be called the aldrich plan
warburg would later write that the matter of a uniform discount rate interest rate was discussed and settled at jekyll island vanderlip wrote in his autobiography from farmboy to financier
despite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for the affairs of corporations there was an occasion near the close of when i was as secretive indeed as furtive as any conspirator
none of us who participated felt that we were conspirators on the contrary we felt we were engaged in a patriotic work
we were trying to plan a mechanism that would correct the weaknesses of our banking system as revealed under the strains and pressures of the panic of
i do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to jekyl island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the federal reserve system
discovery we knew simply must not happen or else all our time and effort would be wasted
if it were to be exposed publicly that our particular group had gotten together and written a banking bill that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by congress
yet who was there in congress who might have drafted a sound piece of legislation dealing with the purely banking problem with which we were concerned despite meeting in secret from both the public and the government the importance of the jekyll island meeting was revealed three years after the federal reserve act was passed when journalist bertie charles forbes in wrote an article about the hunting trip
the republican plan was proposed by aldrich to solve the banking dilemma a goal which was supported by the american bankers association
the plan provided for one great central bank the national reserve association with a capital of at least million and with branches in various sections
the branches were to be controlled by the member banks on a basis of their capitalization
the national reserve association would issue currency based on gold and commercial paper that would be the liability of the bank and not of the government
the association would also carry a portion of member banks reserves determine discount reserves buy and sell on the open market and hold the deposits of the federal government
the branches and businessmen of each of the districts would elect thirty out of the members of the board of directors of the national reserve association
aldrich fought for a private monopoly with little government influence but conceded that the government should be represented on the board of directors
aldrich then presented what was commonly called the aldrich plan which called for establishment of a national reserve association to the national monetary commission
most republicans and wall street bankers favored the aldrich plan but it lacked enough support in the bipartisan congress to pass
because the bill was introduced by aldrich who was considered the epitome of the eastern establishment the bill received little support
it was derided by southerners and westerners who believed that wealthy families and large corporations ran the country and would thus run the proposed national reserve association
the national board of trade appointed warburg as head of a committee to persuade americans to support the plan
the committee set up offices in the then states and distributed printed materials about the proposed central bank
the nebraskan populist and frequent democratic presidential candidate william jennings bryan said of the plan big financiers are back of the aldrich currency scheme he asserted that if it passed big bankers would then be in complete control of everything through the control of our national finances
there was also republican opposition to the aldrich plan
republican sen
robert m
la follette and rep
charles lindbergh sr
both spoke out against the favoritism that they contended the bill granted to wall street
the aldrich plan is the wall street plan
i have alleged that there is a money trust said lindbergh
the aldrich plan is a scheme plainly in the interest of the trust
in response rep
ars ne pujo a democrat from louisiana obtained congressional authorization to form and chair a subcommittee the pujo committee within the house committee banking committee to conduct investigative hearings on the alleged money trust
the hearings continued for a full year and were led by the subcommittee s counsel democratic lawyer samuel untermyer who later also assisted in drafting the federal reserve act
the pujo hearings convinced much of the populace that america s money largely rested in the hands of a select few on wall street
the subcommittee issued a report saying
if by a money trust is meant an established and well defined identity and community of interest between a few leaders of finance
which has resulted in a vast and growing concentration of control of money and credit in the hands of a comparatively few men
the condition thus described exists in this country today
to us the peril is manifest
when we find
the same man a director in a half dozen or more banks and trust companies all located in the same section of the same city doing the same class of business and with a like set of associates similarly situated all belonging to the same group and representing the same class of interests all further pretense of competition is useless
seen as a money trust plan the aldrich plan was opposed by the democratic party as was stated in its campaign platform but the platform also supported a revision of banking laws intended to protect the public from financial panics and the domination of what is known as the money trust during the election the democratic party took control of the presidency and both chambers of congress
the newly elected president woodrow wilson was committed to banking and currency reform but it took a great deal of his political influence to get an acceptable plan passed as the federal reserve act in
wilson thought the aldrich plan was perhaps correct
when virginia rep
carter glass chairman of the house committee on banking and currency presented his bill to president elect wilson wilson said that the plan must be amended to contain a federal reserve board appointed by the executive branch to maintain control over the bankers
after wilson presented the bill to congress a group of democratic congressmen revolted
the group led by representative robert henry of texas demanded that the money trust be destroyed before it could undertake major currency reforms
the opponents particularly objected to the idea of regional banks having to operate without the implicit government protections that large so called money center banks would enjoy
the group almost succeeded in killing the bill but were mollified by wilson s promises to propose antitrust legislation after the bill had passed and by bryan s support of the bill
after months of hearings amendments and debates the federal reserve act passed congress in december
the bill passed the house by an overwhelming majority of to on december
and passed the senate the next day by a vote of to
an earlier version of the bill had passed the senate to but almost senators had left for christmas vacation by the time the final bill came to a vote
most every democrat was in support of and most republicans were against it
as noted in a paper by the american institute of economic research
in its final form the federal reserve act represented a compromise among three political groups
most republicans and the wall street bankers favored the aldrich plan that came out of jekyll island
progressive democrats demanded a reserve system and currency supply owned and controlled by the government in order to counter the money trust and destroy the existing concentration of credit resources in wall street
conservative democrats proposed a decentralized reserve system owned and controlled privately but free of wall street domination
no group got exactly what it wanted
but the aldrich plan more nearly represented the compromise position between the two democrat extremes and it was closest to the final legislation passed frank vanderlip one of the jekyll island attendees and the president of national city bank wrote in his autobiography
although the aldrich federal reserve plan was defeated when it bore the name aldrich nevertheless its essential points were all contained in the plan that was finally adopted ironically in october two months before the enactment of the federal reserve act frank vanderlip proposed before the senate banking committee his own competing plan to the federal reserve system one with a single central bank controlled by the federal government which almost derailed the legislation then being considered and already passed by the u s
house of representatives
even aldrich stated strong opposition to the currency plan passed by the house
however the former point was also made by republican representative charles lindbergh sr
of minnesota one of the most vocal opponents of the bill who on the day the house agreed to the federal reserve act told his colleagues
but the federal reserve board have no power whatever to regulate the rates of interest that bankers may charge borrowers of money
this is the aldrich bill in disguise the difference being that by this bill the government issues the money whereas by the aldrich bill the issue was controlled by the banks
wall street will control the money as easily through this bill as they have heretofore congressional record v
page dec
republican congressman victor murdock of kansas who voted for the bill told congress on that same day
i do not blind myself to the fact that this measure will not be effectual as a remedy for a great national evil the concentrated control of credit
the money trust has not passed died
you rejected the specific remedies of the pujo committee chief among them the prohibition of interlocking directorates
he your enemy will not cease fighting
at some half baked enactment
you struck a weak half blow and time will show that you have lost
you could have struck a full blow and you would have won in order to get the federal reserve act passed wilson needed the support of populist william jennings bryan who was credited with ensuring wilson s nomination by dramatically throwing his support wilson s way at the democratic convention
wilson appointed bryan as his secretary of state
bryan served as leader of the agrarian wing of the party and had argued for unlimited coinage of silver in his cross of gold speech at the democratic convention
bryan and the agrarians wanted a government owned central bank which could print paper money whenever congress wanted and thought the plan gave bankers too much power to print the government s currency
wilson sought the advice of prominent lawyer louis brandeis to make the plan more amenable to the agrarian wing of the party brandeis agreed with bryan
wilson convinced them that because federal reserve notes were obligations of the government and because the president would appoint the members of the federal reserve board the plan fit their demands
however bryan soon became disillusioned with the system
in the november issue of hearst s magazine bryan wrote that the federal reserve bank that should have been the farmer s greatest protection has become his greatest foe
southerners and westerners learned from wilson that the system was decentralized into districts and surely would weaken new york and strengthen the hinterlands
robert l
owen of oklahoma eventually relented to speak in favor of the bill arguing that the nation s currency was already under too much control by new york elites who he alleged had singlehandedly conspired to cause the panic
large bankers thought the legislation gave the government too much control over markets and private business dealings
the new york times called the act the oklahoma idea the nebraska idea referring to owen and bryan s involvement
however several congressmen including owen lindbergh la follette and murdock claimed that the new york bankers feigned their disapproval of the bill in hopes of inducing congress to pass it
the day before the bill was passed murdock told congress
you allowed the special interests by pretended dissatisfaction with the measure to bring about a sham battle and the sham battle was for the purpose of diverting you people from the real remedy and they diverted you
the wall street bluff has worked when wilson signed the federal reserve act on december he said he felt grateful for having had a part in completing a work
of lasting benefit for the country knowing that it took a great deal of compromise and expenditure of his own political capital to get it enacted
this was in keeping with the general plan of action he made in his first inaugural address on march in which he stated
we shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be modified not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon and step by step we shall make it what it should be in the spirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge not shallow self satisfaction or the excitement of excursions we can not tell
while a system of regional banks was designed so as not to give eastern bankers too much influence over the new bank in practice the federal reserve bank of new york became first among equals
the new york fed for example is solely responsible for conducting open market operations at the direction of the federal open market committee
democratic congressman carter glass sponsored and wrote the eventual legislation and his home state capital of richmond virginia was made a district headquarters
democratic senator james a
reed of missouri obtained two districts for his state
however the report of the federal reserve organization committee which clearly laid out the rationale for their decisions on establishing reserve bank districts in showed that it was based almost entirely upon current correspondent banking relationships
to quell elihu root s objections to possible inflation the passed bill included provisions that the bank must hold at least of its outstanding loans in gold
in later years to stimulate short term economic activity congress would amend the act to allow more discretion in the amount of gold that must be redeemed by the bank critics of the time later joined by economist milton friedman suggested that glass s legislation was almost entirely based on the aldrich plan that had been derided as giving too much power to elite bankers
glass denied copying aldrich s plan
in he told congress no greater misconception was ever projected in this senate chamber
wilson named warburg and other prominent experts to direct the new system which began operations in and played a major role in financing the allied and american war efforts
warburg at first refused the appointment citing america s opposition to a wall street man but when world war i broke out he accepted
he was the only appointee asked to appear before the senate whose members questioned him about his interests in the central bank and his ties to kuhn loeb co s money trusts
the accord also known simply as the accord was an agreement between the u s
department of the treasury and the federal reserve that restored independence to the fed
during world war ii the federal reserve pledged to keep the interest rate on treasury bills fixed at percent
it continued to support government borrowing after the war ended despite the fact that the consumer price index rose in and in and the economy was in recession
president harry s
truman in replaced the then chairman of the federal reserve marriner eccles with thomas b
mccabe for opposing this policy although eccles s term on the board continued for three more years
the reluctance of the federal reserve to continue monetizing the deficit became so great that in president truman invited the entire federal open market committee to the white house to resolve their differences
eccles s memoir beckoning frontiers presents a detailed eyewitness account of this meeting and surrounding events including verbatim transcripts of pertinent documents
william mcchesney martin then assistant secretary of the treasury was the principal mediator
three weeks later he was named chairman of the federal reserve replacing mccabe
in july president jimmy carter nominated paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve board amid roaring inflation
volcker tightened the money supply and by inflation had fallen sharply
in october the federal reserve announced a policy of targeting money aggregates and bank reserves in its struggle with double digit inflation
in january with retail inflation at only the federal reserve announced it was no longer going to use money supply aggregates such as m as guidelines for controlling inflation even though this method had been in use from apparently with great success
before interest rates were used as guidelines inflation was severe
the fed complained that the aggregates were confusing
volcker was chairman until august whereupon alan greenspan assumed the mantle seven months after monetary aggregate policy had changed
from early to mid the federal reserve lowered its interest rates times from to to fight recession
in november rates were cut to and many rates went below the inflation rate
on june the federal funds rate was lowered to its lowest nominal rate since july when the overnight rate averaged
starting at the end of june the federal reserve system raised the target interest rate then continued to do so more times
in february president george w
bush appointed ben bernanke as the chairman of the federal reserve
in march the federal reserve ceased to make public m because the costs of collecting this data outweighed the benefits
m includes all of m which includes m plus large denomination time deposits balances in institutional money funds repurchase liabilities issued by depository institutions and eurodollars held by u s
residents at foreign branches of u s
banks as well as at all banks in the united kingdom and canada
due to a credit crunch caused by the subprime mortgage crisis in september the federal reserve began cutting the federal funds rate
the fed cut rates by after its december meeting disappointing many investors who had expected a bigger cut the dow jones industrial average dropped nearly points that day
the fed slashed the rate by in an emergency action on january to assist in reversing a significant market slide influenced by weakening international markets
the dow jones industrial average initially fell nearly points at the start of trading and then rebounded to a point loss
on january eight days after the decrease the fed lowered its rate again this time by
on august president barack obama announced he would nominate bernanke to a second term as chairman of the federal reserve
in october he nominated janet yellen to succeed bernanke
in december the fed raised its benchmark interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to between and after nine years without changing them
