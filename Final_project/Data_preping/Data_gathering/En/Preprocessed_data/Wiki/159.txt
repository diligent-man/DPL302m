cosmopolitanism is the idea that all human beings are members of a single community
its adherents are known as cosmopolitan or cosmopolite
cosmopolitanism is both prescriptive and aspirational believing humans can and should be world citizens in a universal community
the idea encompasses different dimensions and avenues of community such as promoting universal moral standards establishing global political structures or developing a platform for mutual cultural expression and tolerance
for example kwame anthony appiah articulates a cosmopolitan community where individuals from varying locations physical economic etc enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs religious political etc
by comparison immanuel kant envisioned a cosmopolitan world where armies were abolished and humans were governed under a representative global institution
in all instances proponents of cosmopolitanism share an emphasis that all humans should form one cohesive and united community
in a looser but related sense cosmopolitan is also used to describe places where people of various ethnic cultural and or religious backgrounds live together and interact with each other
the word derives from the ancient greek or kosmopolit s formed from kosmos i e
world universe or cosmos and polit s i e
citizen or one of a city
contemporary usage defines the term as citizen of the world
definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the greek etymology of citizen of the world
however as appiah points out world in the original sense meant cosmos or universe not earth or globe as current use assumes
one definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization
cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that firstly projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe and secondly suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality
the chinese term tianxia all under heaven a metonym for empire has also been re interpreted in the modern age as a conception of cosmopolitanism and was used by s modernists as the title of a shanghai based english language journal of world arts and letters t ien hsia monthly
multilingual modern chinese writers such as lin yutang wen yuan ning also translated cosmopolitanism using the now more common term shijie zhuyi ideology of world liness
cosmopolitanism can be traced back to diogenes of sinope c
b c the founder of the cynic movement in ancient greece
it was said that when diogenes was asked where he came from he answered i am a citizen of the world kosmopolit s
at the time the broadest basis of social identity among greeks was either the individual city state or the culturally and linguistically homogenous hellenic group
stoicism another greek school of thought that was founded roughly a century later built upon diogenes idea with many of its thinkers and adherents stressing that each human being dwells in two communities the local community of our birth and the community of human argument and aspiration
a common way to understand stoic cosmopolitanism is through hierocles circle model of identity which states that individuals should regard themselves as concentric circles the first one around the self followed by immediate family extended family local group citizens countrymen humanity
within these circles human beings feel a sense of affinity or endearment towards others which the stoics termed oikei sis
the task of world citizens becomes then to draw the circles somehow towards the centre making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers and so forth
in his essay perpetual peace a philosophical sketch immanuel kant stages a ius cosmopoliticum cosmopolitan law right as a guiding principle to help global society achieve permanent enduring peace
kant s cosmopolitan right stems from an understanding of all human beings as equal members of a universal community
cosmopolitan right thus works in tandem with international political rights and the shared universal right of humanity
kant s cosmopolitan right is fundamentally bound to the conditions of universal hospitality and the right of resort
universal hospitality is defined as the right to be welcomed upon arrival in foreign territory but is contingent on a guest arriving in a peaceful manner
kant makes the additional claim that all human beings have the basic right of resort the right to present oneself in a foreign land
the right of resort is derived from kant s understanding of the earth s surface as essentially communal and further emphasizing his claims on equally shared universal rights among all human beings
the philosophical concepts of emmanuel levinas on ethics and jacques derrida on hospitality provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes
for levinas the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the other
in being for the other he writes that there is no universal moral law only the sense of responsibility goodness mercy charity that the other in a state of vulnerability calls forth
the proximity of the other is an important part of levinas s concept the face of the other is what compels the response
for derrida the foundation of ethics is hospitality the readiness and the inclination to welcome the other into one s home
ethics he claims is hospitality
pure unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others
levinas s and derrida s theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the other as different but of equal standing
isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world therefore it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others what conditions of hospitality to impose and whether or not we have responded to the call of the other
further both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the other and others and what is at stake
derrida in an interview with bennington summarized cosmopolitanism
a further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the second world war
as a reaction to the holocaust and other atrocities the concept of crimes against humanity became a generally accepted category in international law
this clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind
philosophical cosmopolitans are moral universalists they believe that all humans and not merely compatriots or fellow citizens come under the same moral standards
the boundaries between nations states cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant
a widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is kwame anthony appiah
some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today s unique historical moment an emerging planetary phase of civilization creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as global citizens and possible formation of a global citizens movement
these emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications space travel and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space the emergence of global warming and other ecological threats to our collective existence new global institutions such as the united nations world trade organization or international criminal court the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic globalization the emergence of global ngos and transnational social movements such as the world social forum and so on
globalization a more common term typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural social political environmental demographic values and knowledge transitions taking place
a number of contemporary theorists propose directly and indirectly various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual
thich nhat hanh discusses what he calls interbeing as a way of living one s life in relation to others interbeing might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism
nhat hanh s philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of buddhist teachings which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people animals plants and minerals
he further describes what he calls mindfulness training of the order of interbeing as being aware of sufferings created by but not limited to the following causes fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others indoctrination of narrow minded beliefs imposition of views anger and miscommunication
understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others suffering and the root causes of suffering
therefore to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering which then leads to compassion
it is through this process that others can be recognized as people
other theorists philosophers and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence
in scared sacred velcrow ripper takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion
in the planet paul gilroy explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others
it is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others
thus individual responsibility is being aware of what judith butler calls the precariousness of life in self and other being a cosmopolitan seems to be above all a social ethical enterprise
in cosmopolitanism ethics in a world of strangers kwame anthony appiah notes how social ethics seem to operate whatever obligation one might have to another especially a foreign other that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them
however as judith butler questions at what cost do i establish the familiar as the criterion for valuing others if one values the familiar more than the foreign what are the consequences paul gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one s own culture and history
might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment this estrangement entails a process of exposure to otherness in order to foster the irreducible value of diversity within sameness estrangement therefore could lead to de emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness
for gilroy being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise
in the planet gilroy describes the cases of tom hurndall and rachel corrie each seems to exemplify what might be considered gilroy s figure of the cosmopolitan
both hurndall and corrie removed themselves geographically from their home cultures presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories
hurndall and corrie were both killed in in separate incidents
gilroy s model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples this might be construed as a failure of gilroy s theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar
the venus project an international multidisciplinary educational organization created by jacque fresco works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding of our interdependence with nature and each other
some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones
frantz fanon in the wretched of the earth observes that when nations achieved independence from european colonizers frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future and they became manager s for western enterprise in practise set ting up its country as the brothel of europe when third world nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital ostensibly to improve their national quality of life often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well placed individuals and not the nation itself
further mahmood mamdani in good muslim bad muslim suggests that the imposition of western cultural norms democracy and christianity to name only two has historically resulted in nationalist violence however appiah has implied that democracy is a pre requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations
cosmopolitanism in these instances appears to be a new form of colonization the powerful exploit the weak and the weak eventually fight back
much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken nationalism and the framework of the sovereign nation state for granted
with the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation state has become obsolete and that it is time to design a better and more efficient alternative
jes s moster n analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity
rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will he focuses on political freedom the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions
because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction
especially there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms of language religion and customs in the name of the nation the church or the party
from this point of view the internet provides a much more attractive model than the nation state
neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people ideas or goods
moster n thinks that the nation state is incompatible with the full development of freedom whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines
he proposes a world without sovereign nation states territorially organized in small autonomous but not sovereign cantonal polities complemented by strong world organizations
he emphasizes the difference between international institutions led by representatives of the national governments and world or universal institutions with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications independently of any national bias or proportion
criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism charles blattberg has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be rooted by which he means based upon a global patriotism
more general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available
carol nicholson compares john searle s opposition to multiculturalism with charles taylor s celebration of it
she uses richard rorty as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against searle and in favor of taylor
at a conference on philosophy in a multicultural context rasmus winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism
he develops bruno latour s conception of the philosopher as public diplomat
emile durkheim observed the development of what he called the cult of the individual which is a new religion that replaced the christianity that was dying out and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity
this new religion would provide the new foundations of western society and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation s constitutions
a society s sacred object would be the individual s human dignity and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country s way of interpreting human dignity and human rights
thus rather than finding solidarity through national culture or a particular traditional religious doctrine society would be unified by its adherence to political values i e
individual rights and a defence of human dignity
durkheim s cult of the individual has many similarities to john rawls political liberalism which rawls developed almost a century after durkheim
in his posthumously published professional ethics and civic morals durkheim wrote that
ulrich beck may january was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional nation state politics
nation state theory sees power relations only among different state actors and excludes a global economy or subjugates it to the nation state model
cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta power game in which global capital states and civil society are its players
it is important to mark a distinction between beck s cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state
for beck imposing a single world order was considered hegemonic at best and ethnocentric at worst
rather political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations
acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different
acknowledging the otherness of the future
acknowledging the otherness of nature
acknowledging the otherness of the object
acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities a number of philosophers including emmanuel levinas have introduced the concept of the other
for levinas the other is given context in ethics and responsibility we should think of the other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves
according to levinas our initial interactions with the other occur before we form a will the ability to make choices
the other addresses us and we respond even the absence of response is a response
we are thus conditioned by the other s address and begin to form culture and identity
after the formation of the will we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and as a result continue the process of forming identity
during this process it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with others
even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves
our dependence on the other for the continuous formation of language culture and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us
also once we ve formed a will it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence
when we have gained the capacity for recognition the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the other in conscience
cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of universalism namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law
however the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures
in addition cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development
human dignity however is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable
under cosmopolitanism all humans have rights however history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed
as an example judith butler discusses a western discourse of human in precarious life the powers of mourning and violence
butler works through the idea of human and notes that human has been naturalized in its western mold by the contemporary workings of humanism
thus there is the idea that not all human lives will be supported in the same way indeed that some human lives are worth more protection than others
others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan present the world over with varying identities in different places
this idea is reiterated in sunera thobani s exalted subjects studies in the making of race and nation in canada where she discusses a discourse in which muslim people fall into a good bad dichotomy a good muslim is one who has been westernized and a bad muslim is one who visibly rejects western cultural influences
thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized
individuals who embrace western ideals are considered fully human and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non westernized cultural identities
according to those who follow beck s reasoning a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents
states would also utilize the power of civil society actors such as non governmental organizations ngos and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda
other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today s conception of nation states
these scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of global citizen will take hold diminishing the importance of national identities
the formation of a global citizens movement would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions creating the space for global political discourse and decisions would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level
nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility i e the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level such as global warming and subsidiarity i e the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order
daniele archibugi proposes a renewed model for global citizenship institutional cosmopolitanism
it advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life
a number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible
cosmopolitan democracy for example suggests strengthening the united nations and other international organizations by creating a world parliamentary assembly
cosmopolitanism became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against alien ideas that went counter to orthodoxy
european jews were frequently accused of being rootless cosmopolitans joseph stalin in a moscow speech attacked writings in which the positive soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of lenin characteristic of the political leftovers is many times applauded
in the german democratic republic cosmopolitanism was characterized as a bourgeois imperialist ideology that rejects the nations right to independence and national sovereignty
cosmopolitanism was said to promote the dismantling of national and patriotic traditions and national culture
it was said to be advocated by the anglo american imperialism with an aim to establish world hegemony world government operating in the interests of monopoly capitalism
its opposite was not chauvinist bourgeois nationalism but patriotism love of one s native place one s country
love of the homeland was said to be one of the deepest feelings of the working people expressed in the struggle against conquerors and oppressors
in the st century the epithet became a weapon used by vladimir putin in russia and by nationalists in hungary and poland
in modern times stephen miller a trump administration senior policy advisor publicly criticized cnn reporter jim acosta as exhibiting cosmopolitan bias during a discussion on the government s new immigration plan
