mainstream economics economic surplus also known total welfare total social welfare marshallian surplus alfred marshall refers two related quantities
consumer surplus consumers' surplus monetary gain obtained consumer able purchase product price le highest price would willing pay
producer surplus producers' surplus amount producer benefit selling market price higher least would willing sell roughly equal profit since producer normally willing sell loss normally indifferent selling break-even pricein mid- century engineer jules dupuit first propounded concept economic surplus wa
standard supply demand diagram consumer surplus area triangular supply demand curve linear equilibrium price good demand curve
reflects fact consumer would willing buy single unit good price higher equilibrium price second unit price still equilibrium price etc yet fact pay equilibrium price unit buy
likewise supply-demand diagram producer surplus area equilibrium price supply curve
reflects fact producer would willing supply first unit price lower equilibrium price second unit price still equilibrium price etc yet fact receive equilibrium price unit sell
early writer economic issue used surplus mean draw conclusion relationship production necessities
agricultural sector surplus wa important concept sector ha responsibility feed everyone plus itself
food notable people need specific amount food consume limited amount
mean excess food production must overflow people rationally hoarded
non-agricultural sector therefore limited agricultural sector equaling output food subtracting amount consumed agricultural sector
william petty used broad definition necessity leading focus employment issue surrounding surplus
petty explains hypothetical example territory men men capable producing enough food men
question becomes rest men needed provide necessity thereby suggests variety employment remaining unemployed
david hume approached agricultural surplus concept another direction
hume recognized agriculture may feed cultivate questioned farmer would work produce need
forceful production may occur feudal system would unlikely generate notable surplus opinion
yet could purchase luxury good beyond necessity would become incentivized produce sell surplus
hume see concept abstract theory stated fact discussing england developed introduction foreign luxury history england
smith noted desire luxury infinite compared finite capacity hunger
smith saw development europe originating landlord placing importance luxury spending rather political power
consumer surplus difference maximum price consumer willing pay actual price pay
consumer willing pay unit good current asking price getting benefit purchased product would price wa maximum willingness pay
example good generally high consumer surplus drinking water
people would pay high price drinking water need survive
difference price would pay amount pay consumer surplus
utility first liter drinking water high prevents death first liter would likely consumer surplus subsequent quantities
maximum amount consumer would willing pay given quantity good sum maximum price would pay first unit lower maximum price would willing pay second unit etc
typically price decreasing given individual demand curve must generated rational consumer maximizes utility subject budget constraint
diminishing marginal utility mean person receives le additional utility additional unit
however price product constant every unit equilibrium price
extra money someone would willing pay number unit product le equilibrium quantity higher price equilibrium price quantity benefit receive purchasing quantities
given price consumer buy amount consumer surplus highest
consumer's surplus highest largest number unit even last unit maximum willingness pay market price
consumer surplus used measurement social welfare shown robert willig
single price change consumer surplus provide approximation change welfare
multiple price andor income change however consumer surplus cannot used approximate economic welfare single-valued anymore
modern method developed later estimate welfare effect price change using consumer surplus
aggregate consumers' surplus sum consumer's surplus individual consumers
aggregation represented graphically shown graph market demand supply curves
aggregate consumers' surplus also said maxim satisfaction consumer derives particular good services
consumer surplus individual aggregated area individual aggregated demand curve horizontal line actual price aggregated case equilibrium price
demand curve straight line consumer surplus area triangle
pmkt equilibrium price supply equal demand qmkt total quantity purchased equilibrium price pmax price quantity purchased would fall demand curve intercept price axis
general demand supply function area triangle still found using integral calculus
consumer surplus thus definite integral demand function respect price market price maximum reservation price ie price-intercept demand function
show see rise equilibrium price fall equilibrium quantity consumer surplus falls
change consumer surplus used measure change price income
demand function used represent individual's demand certain product essential determining effect price change
individual's demand function function individual's income demographic characteristic individual vector commodity prices
price product change change consumer surplus measured negative value integral original actual price p new actual price p demand product individual
change consumer surplus positive price change said increased individual welfare
price change consumer surplus negative price change said decreased individual's welfare
supply good expands price fall assuming demand curve downward sloping consumer surplus increases
benefit two group people consumer already willing buy initial price benefit price reduction may buy receive even consumer surplus additional consumer unwilling buy initial price buy new price also receive consumer surplus
initial supply curve consumer surplus triangle line formed price p demand line bounded left price axis top demand line
supply expands consumers' surplus expands triangle p demand line still bounded price axis
change consumer's surplus difference area two triangle consumer welfare associated expansion supply
price reduced benefit area rectangle formed top p bottom p left price axis right line extending vertically upwards q
second set beneficiary consumer buy new consumer pay new lower price p higher price p
consumer surplus triangle bounded left line extending vertically upwards q right top demand line bottom line extending horizontally right p
rule one-half estimate change consumer surplus small change supply constant demand curve
note special case consumer demand curve linear consumer surplus area triangle bounded vertical line q horizontal line
hence change consumer surplus area trapezoid height equal change price ii mid-segment length equal average ex-post ex-ante equilibrium quantities
p p respectively price change supplyproducer surplus refers additional benefit owner production factor product provider bring producer due difference production supply price product current market price
difference amount actually obtained market transaction minimum amount willing accept production factor product provided
producer surplus usually expressed area market price line supply curve
figure shaded area price line supply curve production zero maximum output q indicate producer surplus
indicates total revenue minimum total payment actually accepted manufacturer
area opmeq curve minimum total revenue manufacturer willing accept
figure area enclosed market price line manufacturer's supply line coordinate axis producer surplus
rectangle opeq total revenue actually obtained manufacturer ab trapezoid opmeq
minimum total profit manufacturer willing accept b producer surplus
obviously manufacturer produce sell certain quantity q good market price p
manufacturer ha reduced quantity good q mean manufacturer ha increased production factor production cost equivalent amount avcq
however time manufacturer actually obtains total income equivalent total market price pq
since avc always smaller p production sale good q manufacturer get sale revenue equivalent variable cost also get additional revenue
part excess income reflects increase benefit obtained manufacturer market exchange
therefore economics producer surplus usually used measure producer welfare important part social welfare
producer surplus usually used measure economic welfare obtained manufacturer market supply
supply price constant producer welfare depends market price
part social welfare size producer surplus depends many factors
generally speaking factor remain constant increase market price increase producer surplus decrease supply price marginal cost also increase producer surplus
surplus good people sell part good market price producer surplus decrease
obviously sum producer surplus manufacturer market constitutes producer surplus entire market
graphically expressed area enclosed market supply curve market price line coordinate axis
