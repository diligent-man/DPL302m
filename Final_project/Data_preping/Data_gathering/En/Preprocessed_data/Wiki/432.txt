Boaz ˈboʊæz Hebrew בֹּעַז Bōʿaz Hebrew pronunciation boˈʕaz is a biblical figure appearing in the Book of Ruth in the Hebrew Bible and in the genealogies of Jesus in the New Testament and also the name of a pillar in the portico of the historic Temple in Jerusalem The word is found times in the Scriptures two being in Greek in the form Βοόζ Booz
The root בעז just used in the Bible in relation to Boaz see The Temple perhaps expresses 'quickness' The etymology of the name has been suggested by many as be'oz in the strength of or bo'oz in him is strength from the root 'zz to be strong hence the use of the name Boaz for one of the pillars at the portico of the temple Kings although Biblical scholar Martin Noth preferred of sharp mind
The son of Salmon and his wife Rahab Boaz was a wealthy landowner of Bethlehem in Judea and relative of Elimelech Naomi's late husband He notices Ruth the widowed Moabite daughter in law of Naomi a relative of his see family tree gleaning grain in his fields He soon learns of the difficult circumstances her family is in and Ruth's loyalty to Naomi In response Boaz invites her to eat with him and his workers as well as deliberately leaving grain for her to claim while keeping a protective eye on her
Ruth approaches Boaz and asks him to exercise his right of kinship and marry her Boaz accepts provided that another with a superior claim declines Since the first son of Ruth and a kinsman of her late husband would be deemed the legal offspring of the decedent and heir to Elimelech the other kinsman defers to Boaz
In marrying Ruth Boaz revives Elimelech's lineage and the patrimony is secured to Naomi's family
Their son was Obed father of Jesse and grandfather of David
According to Josephus he lived at the time of Eli
Boaz was the name of the left one of the two frontal columns of Solomon's Temple the other being Jachin Its meaning is a subject of controversy
Boaz is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew as the son of Salmon and Rahab seemingly Rahab of Jericho and as an ancestor of Jesus
In the Talmud some rabbis identify Boaz with the judge Ibzan of Bethlehem Ie Bethlehem in Zebulun cf Joshua Let it be taken into consideration however that Boaz of Ruth was from Judah whereas the two chieftains immediately ulterior to Ibzan were from Zebulun A legend is given that he lost all his sixty children during his lifetime because he did not invite Manoah Samson's father to any of the marriage festivities at his house Since Manoah was at that time without children Boaz thought he did not need to consider on such occasions a childless man who could not pay him back in kind Bava Batra a
The Talmud tells that Boaz was a just pious and learned judge The custom of using the Divine Name in greeting one's fellow man Rt formulated by him and his bet din court of law received the approval of even the heavenly bet din Babylonian Talmud Makkot b Yerushalmi Talmud Ber ix c Midrash Ruth Rabbah to ii
The midrash Ruth Rabbah states that being a pious man Boaz on his first meeting with Ruth perceived her conscientiousness in picking up the grain as she strictly observed the rules prescribed by the Law This as well as her grace and her chaste conduct during work induced Boaz to inquire about the stranger although he was not in the habit of inquiring after women Ruth Rabba to ii Talmudic tractate Shabbat b
In the conversation that followed between Boaz and Ruth the pious proselyte said that being a Moabite she was excluded from association with the community of God Deuteronomy Boaz however replied that the prohibition in the Scripture applied only to the men of Moab and not to the women He furthermore told her that he had heard from the prophets that she was destined to become the ancestress of kings and prophets and he blessed her with the words May God who rewards the pious also reward you Targum Ruth ii Pesiḳ ed Buber xvi a Boaz was especially friendly toward the poor stranger during the meal when he indicated to her by various symbolic courtesies that she would become the ancestress of the Davidic royal house including the Messiah Ruth R to ii Shab b As toward Ruth Boaz had also been kind toward his kinsmen Naomi's sons on hearing of their death taking care that they had an honorable burial Ruth Rabba to
Although Boaz was the prince of the people he personally supervised the threshing of the grain in his barn in order to circumvent any immorality or theft both of which were rife in his days Tan Behar ed Buber viii Ruth Rabba to iii Glad in his heart that the famine was over in Israel he sought rest after having thanked God and studied for a while in the Torah Tan lc Targum Ruth iii and Ruth Rabba ib Aroused out of his first sleep by Ruth he was greatly frightened as he thought she was a devil and he was convinced of the contrary only after touching the hair of her head since devils were believed to be bald Tan lc When he perceived Ruth's pure and holy intentions he not only did not reprove her for her unusual behavior he blessed her and gave her six measures of barley indicating thereby that six pious men should spring from her who would be gifted by God with six excellences cf Isaiah Sanhedrin b Numbers Rabba xiii Ruth Rabba and Targum to Ruth iii the names of the six men differ in these passages but David and the Messiah are always among them Boaz fulfilled the promises he had given to Ruth and when his kinsman the sources differ as to the precise relationship existing between them would not marry her because he did not know the halakah which decreed that Moabite women were not excluded from the Israelitic community Boaz himself married
In the early years of Jewish settlement the term a boaz plural boazim derived from the Biblical character was used to refer to a rich private farmer or landowner such as the ones who flourished during the First Aliya The term was often used with a pejorative connotation by adherents of Socialist Zionism who were strongly opposed to the boazim and counterposed to them the collective Kibbutz and cooperative Moshav forms of agricultural settlement
This use of Boaz became obsolete in later stages of Jewish and Israeli history and is hardly remembered today In contemporary Israel Boaz is commonly used as a male first name and carries no special political or social connotations
