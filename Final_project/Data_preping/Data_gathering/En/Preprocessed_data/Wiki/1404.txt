eib also includes arbitration unit function set traffic lights
eib presently implemented circular ring consisting four byte-wide unidirectional channel counter-rotate pairs
traffic pattern permit channel convey three transaction concurrently
eib run half system clock rate effective channel rate byte every two system clocks
maximum concurrency three active transaction four ring peak instantaneous eib bandwidth byte per clock concurrent transaction byte wide system clock per transfer
figure often quoted ibm literature unrealistic simply scale number processor clock speed
ibm senior engineer david krolak eib lead designer explains concurrency model
participant eib ha one byte read port one byte write port
limit single participant read write rate byte per eib clock simplicity often regarded byte per system clock
spu processor contains dedicated dma management queue capable scheduling long sequence transaction various endpoint without interfering spu's ongoing computation dma queue managed locally remotely well providing additional flexibility control model
since twelve participant total number step around channel back point origin twelve
eib channel permitted convey data requiring six step data must take shorter route around circle direction
number step involved sending packet ha little impact transfer latency clock speed driving step fast relative considerations
however longer communication distance detrimental overall performance eib reduce available concurrency
despite ibm's original desire implement eib powerful cross-bar circular configuration adopted spare resource rarely represents limiting factor performance cell chip whole
worst case programmer must take extra care schedule communication pattern eib able function high concurrency levels
viewing eib isolation system element connects achieving twelve concurrent transaction flow rate work abstract eib bandwidth gbs

number reflects peak instantaneous eib bandwidth scaled processor frequency
however technical restriction involved arbitration mechanism packet accepted onto bus
