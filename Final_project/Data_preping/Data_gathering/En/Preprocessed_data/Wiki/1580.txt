tanaka also had more complete games than darvish pitchers must qualify for the award by meeting seven criteria wins a era innings pitched complete games strikeouts appearances and a winning percentage
both tanaka and darvish met all the criteria
tanaka noted i only had better numbers than him darvish

dodgers teammate chase utley had evaluated darvish s game three start and concluded that this was not the case though darvish changed his approach for game seven
more than a month later a sports illustrated article revealed that the astros had figured out how darvish was tipping his pitches darvish holds the ball at his side when he gets the sign from the catcher
whether he re grips or not as he brings the ball into his glove was the tip off whether he was going to throw a slider cutter or a fastball this unnamed astros player said the astros had known about this going into game which they also won but that they had an even better game plan for game

he was also named to his fifth all star team
named the ace of the japanese national team by manager senichi hoshino in the beijing olympics darvish took the hill in japan s first game of the preliminary round against cuba on august but was charged with the loss after giving up four runs in four innings
the subpar outing caused hoshino to lose faith in him and scratch darvish from the semi finals that he had penciled him in for sending darvish to the mound only in situations that would have no bearing on japan s fate in the tournament
darvish started the last game of the preliminary round against the united states on august and was brought in to mop up after the u s
had taken a decisive lead in the bronze medal match finishing the tournament with a era albeit with strikeouts in seven innings pitched

darvish is a right handed pitcher who throws from a three quarter arm slot in a drop and drive motion
he has a large frame for a pitcher listed at ft in and lb
darvish throws a four seam fastball which averages mph tops out at mph as well as a hard slurve slider in the low s with a sharp break
he complements these two with a wide repertoire of secondary pitches including a two seam fastball also described as a shuuto a cutter two curveballs a splitter and an occasional changeup
darvish has a fast curve and a slow curve the former averaging about mph and the latter about
the slow curve is almost exclusively used in no strike and strike counts while the fast curve is mostly used in strike counts
some professional scouts consider darvish to have the best repertoire of quality pitches including the best slider in all of major league baseball
in august darvish learned a knuckle curve from cubs teammate craig kimbrel and began using the pitch
advance scouting on darvish is made difficult by his tendency to change his most frequent pitch sequences over time
while darvish uses both the set or stretch position and the windup he has been noted for pitching exclusively from the stretch at times even when there is no one on base
while pitching from the windup is generally thought to add velocity to pitches the set position allows pitchers more control over baserunners
in darvish s case the set position often is used as a way of keeping his delivery in sync and consistent
prior to the season darvish s go to pitch was a screwball and he tends to rely more on his off speed pitches than his fastball
after injuring his shoulder in an exhibition game start against the world baseball classic japanese national team in february because of the strain the screwball had gradually been putting on his shoulder he took the pitch out of his in game repertoire and worked to develop his splitter until it became an equally effective pitch that would replace the screwball
he also has succeeded in increasing his fastball velocity from year to year
in season alone he used different pitches cutter with two different movements four seam and two seam fastballs slider splitter normal and slow curveballs knuckle curve and a changeup
in he revealed on twitter that he learnt a supreme pitch which is a hybrid between a splitter and two seam fastball
this pitch can reach mph
yu darvish also has a few ways to learn new pitches to add to his deep pitching arsenal
one of his favorites was to use it in game without knowing which forces him to adapt quickly
