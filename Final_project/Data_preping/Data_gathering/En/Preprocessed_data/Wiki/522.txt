the film was adapted by oliver h p
garrett and david o
selznick from the novel by niven busch
the film proved to be a turbulent experience for selznick and vidor with several directors being left uncredited for their work in the film such as josef von sternberg william dieterle william cameron menzies otto brower sidney franklin and selznick himself
production unit managers glenn cook and william mcgarry were also uncredited
the movie was filmed in wildwood regional park in thousand oaks california
as shot the film could not make it past the hays code censors or religious review boards and so was heavily edited
it was nicknamed lust in the dust which eventually became the name of another movie
a scene in which pearl does a seductive dance for lewton was cut from the film before it was released
the train derailment scenes were filmed on the sierra railroad in tuolumne county california using a combination of a real train and large scale models
bosley crowther of the new york times wrote for despite all his flashy exploitation mr
selznick can t long hide the fact that his multimillion dollar western is a spectacularly disappointing job those are also harsh words about a picture which promises very much and which even for all its disappointments has some flashes of brilliance in it
but the ultimate banality of the story and its juvenile slobbering over sex or should we say primitive passion as says a ponderous foreword compels their use william brogdon of variety gave the film a favorable review writing as a production it adds no class distinction to david o
selznick but assures him a top commercial success
the star lineup is impressive
vastness of the western locale is splendidly displayed in color by mobile cameras
footage is overwhelmingly expansive too much so at times considering its length
harrison s reports deemed the film as a glorified western produced on an immense scale
its theme is tragic love making with tragic consequences some of the photographic shots are extremely effective they make the film look immense edwin schallert of the los angeles times praised the film as a picture of terrific in fact well nigh bewildering impact
it embodies a strange tragical drama of love hate and death set against wild western desert wastes and mesas and fierce mountain fastnesses
historical in pattern the narrative as told on the screen seems to draw from the most elemental sources with few of its characters that are not at times motivated by the most primitive and even brutal impulses
a tremendously strong production lurid and violent in the handling of many of its scenes it still possesses a bigness of design which commands appreciation and respect
it was shown at increased admission prices which boosted its earnings to million in rentals in the united states and canada during its initial release
because of the film s huge production costs rumored to be over its advertising campaign unheard of at the time and selznick s costly distribution tactics the film only broke even
the film was one of the first to be honored by a record album featuring selections from dimitri tiomkin s musical score
rather than use excerpts from the soundtrack rca victor recorded some of the music with the boston pops orchestra conducted by arthur fiedler
the music was split into approximately three minute sections and released on inch rpm discs in
a musical prelude lasting nine and a half minutes as well as a two minute overture preceded the film with tiomkin conducting the studio orchestra this recording was later issued on lp and cd
duel in the sun was first shown on american television on abc on january
it was released on region dvd in
martin scorsese has stated to james lipton on inside the actors studio that this was the first film he saw and holds it in high regard

duel in the sun was remade as saiyan in hindi and was released in
duel in the sun was released the same year as john ford s film my darling clementine and has been described as taking the moment of sadism from ford s film to extremes
released in the postwar years during a period of economic boom and the changing role of women in society including marriage sexuality and inclusion in the work force that left some americans feeling alienated
psychological westerns popular in the s featured characters plagued by a dark torment that reflected the post war attitudes
the march of progress is symbolized by an advancing railroad cutting across a senator s cattle lands
the film takes the moment of sadism exhibited in ford s film and escalates it to extreme levels
the civilizing forces of the american west are represented by the characters of pearl s father laura belle and jesse while lewt and senator mccanles are constant reminders that she is not part of the white patriarchal order
after being raped by lewt pearl is not able to meet the victorian era standards for moral conduct
her identity as part indian is linked to notions of uncontrollable drives the fading of subjectivity and the loss of conscious agency
believing she encouraged the rape jesse ends their romantic relationship
the dark or savage element of her sexuality and unrestrained passions has a racial dimension contrasted with the white feminine ideal in the film s imagery it is something needing to be tamed
she is too sexual to be a proper wife too dark to be a comfortable part of white society and too passionate to be controlled with anything but violence
as pearl is already spoiled by the rape she no longer needs to control her sexuality and enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with lewt who treats her viciously and with racist abuse like calling her a bob tailed little half breed
marriage with pearl is out of the question for lewt due to his father s expectations that the family ranch not be turned into an injun reservation though lewt continues to exhibit jealous controlling behaviors including attempting to murder his brother jesse when he makes plans for pearl to attend school in austin
while in many ways the typical hero of american westerns lewt crosses over into the realm of the savage or uncivilized
the violence pearl encounters from lewt leads her to develop gradually into a femme fatale type character who eventually murders him even as she loves him in order to protect the goodness of jesse and his fianc e helen
