status university wa changed department dgac public institution
school wa originally located outskirt paris-orly airport france's largest
location offered easy access plane navigation flight promotional trip activity leader nearby airline aircraft manufacturer aviation-related business could come university lecture conferences
however rapid growth traffic paris-orly construction charles de gaulle airport brought new challenges
requirement enac's aircraft became stringent aroports de paris became increasingly reluctant renew university's lease
earlier mid-s possibility moving enac new location wa considered
potential location city near paris airport thiais rungis issy-les-moulineaux le mureaux le bourget considered
regional decentralization became priority even publication jean-franois gravier's paris et le dsert franais paris french desert
plan keep enac near paris seemed increasingly doubtful more-distant location began considered
within kilometre-mile mi radius capital city consideration included melun pontoise coulommiers tampes reims vreux chartres orlans
may report listed disadvantage location distant paris however difficulty transporting personnel possible extension course increased operating costs
