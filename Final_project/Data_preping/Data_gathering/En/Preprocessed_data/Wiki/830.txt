cole nationale de l'aviation civile ENAC National School of Civil Aviation is one of colleges as of September accredited to award engineering degrees in France
ENAC is designated as a grande cole by the Confrence des Grandes coles CGE a non-profit organisation which certifies and monitors grandes coles including engineering colleges
ENAC was founded on August to provide initial and continuing education in the field of civil aviation
The school is an tablissement public caractre scientifique culturel et professionnel a public scientific cultural or professional establishment and operates under the oversight of the Ministry of Ecological Transition
Affiliated with the University of Toulouse and Aerospace Valley it is one of the five founders of France AEROTECH
ENAC offers engineering and technical programs in civil aviation and aeronautics
Programs include aerospace engineering aircraft maintenance commercial airline piloting air traffic control and flight instructor
The college also offers three Master of Science programs and Advanced Master programs for students with relevant experience
In immediately after World War II the French air-transport industry experienced rapid growth
To ensure safety and compliance with regulations demand for qualified staff was high there was a need to harmonise communications among sectors of the aviation industry
ENAC was founded to address this issue
Among its founders was Max Hymans the secretary general of civil and commercial aviation
During the postwar years there was a lack of unity in the civil-aviation industry due to the hasty recruitment of large numbers of people from different backgrounds
To standardize personnel a number of training centers were created
Airfield commanders were trained in Orly and navigation staff were trained in Le Bourget
Wireless operators and radiotelegraph technicians were also trained in Orly by the Department of Telecommunications and Signaling
Technical managers were primarily trained in engineering schools including Arts et Mtiers and the National School of Meteorology cole nationale de la mtorologie
Designers were trained by the cole spciale des travaux aronautiques and aircrew were trained by other public or private institutions
ENAC's mission was to coordinate the training of aviation personnel
- June the rules of French public administration were codified
The regulations applying to civil-aviation officials were overhauled affecting the technical staff in particular
Several new groups of civil servants were established air traffic engineers air navigation operation engineers aerial telecommunication civil engineers air traffic controllers telecommunication controllers and air navigation agents
The creation of these groups was followed by a ministerial decision on August which paved the way for the first recruitment by competitive examination which was held in October
On April the International Civil Aviation Organization established requirements for aircrew licensing including a minimum number of flight hours for each category of pilot
Before adopting the name ENAC the school was called a service of education and internships service des coles et des stages and was funded by the general secretariat for civil and commercial aviation
This contrasted with the tradition of French civil-service personnel being trained in grandes coles
Jules Moch the Minister of Works Transport and Tourism unsuccessfully proposed the name cole nationale de l'aviation marchande
ENAC was created on August Decree in Paris at the initiative of Secretary General of Civil Aviation Max Hymans and Jules Moch to train professionals in civil aeronautics and coordinate all air-transport stakeholders including aircrew technicians and civil servants
The university is in Orly south of Paris ENAC's buildings at Orly were an examination center until the early s
Ren Lemaire considers ENAC a university of aviation safety
Aviation safety is synonymous with ENAC since it was the rationale for the training of technicians and airmen at a single school
As noted in a report of the inspection gnrale de l'aviation civile It was in the minds of the creators of the university to develop between the aircrew and the ground staff a community of ideas reciprocal knowledge and esteem that are essential for the teamwork required by air transport However it is doubtful that the report's community of ideas could be only expressed by courses at the same university
Other factors were different lengths of training air navigation civil engineers in the telecommunications branch study for months at the university operations students are trained in months air-navigation engineers in two years and air traffic controllers in nine months
A consistent education was provided to students in different cycles integrating programs
On October the first major partner of the university was recognised this enabled the recruitment of pilots with no previous flight experience
The previous year the university held training sessions on an experimental basis and was responsible for teaching theory for the airline transport pilot licence
Flight training was provided at the Service d'exploitation de la formation aronautique SEFA center at Saint-Yan Airport opened in until students received a commercial pilot licence advanced training was provided at the Air France school
ENAC also provided theoretical training for pilots of a number of airlines and the question of cost arose
The expensive training not paid by France was eventually borne by private airlines
To give its students a thorough understanding of the air-transport environment ENAC sought to cooperate with the cole nationale de la mtorologie a May report noted the influence of meteorology on air traffic control and advocated meteorological training for air-traffic controllers
Close links also traditionally existed between civil aviation and the Air Force
After World War II as civil aviation was developing members of the armed forces participated in its expansion
Pilots radio operators navigators and mechanics came from the military to the airlines and ENAC sought to convert military aircrews
On June a memorandum specifying the school's responsibilities in the training of military pilots for civil aviation was signed
The university was the general contractor of operations and provided theoretical training
In accordance with a of March decree the Service de l'aviation lgre et sportive SALS provided free flight training for pilot candidates coming from the army
From to the number of courses increased from six to and the number of students from to
ENAC benefited from the postwar development of aviation and a number of students came from foreign countries or in particular overseas territories which later became independent
During the early s the university began to accept its first students from foreign civil-aviation authorities
Along with enrollment growth courses were created to keep pace with new ratings
The navigation-instructor rating was introduced in and corresponding training began
Courses were sometimes introduced to meet a need such as a speaking-technique course for instructors that year
The first civilian engineering students were also admitted in
In the airline-pilot theoretical training course began
Students took an annual trip from ENAC Orly and were received in full uniform by local authorities on their arrival
The university underwent significant changes between and
It moved to Toulouse in where the main campus is still located
In the status of the university was changed from a department of the DGAC to a public institution
The school was originally located on the outskirts of Paris-Orly Airport France's largest
Its location offered easy access to planes for navigation flights promotional trips and other activities leaders of nearby airlines aircraft manufacturers and other aviation-related businesses could come to the university for lectures and conferences
However the rapid growth of traffic at Paris-Orly before the construction of Charles de Gaulle Airport brought new challenges
Requirements for ENAC's aircraft became more stringent and Aroports de Paris became increasingly reluctant to renew the university's lease
During the early s the future of the Orly facilities was uncertain
Earlier in the mid-s the possibility of moving ENAC to a new location was considered
Potential locations were cities near Paris airports between and Thiais Rungis Issy-les-Moulineaux Les Mureaux and Le Bourget were considered
Regional decentralization became a priority even before the publication of Jean-Franois Gravier's Paris et le dsert franais Paris and the French Desert
Plans to keep ENAC near Paris seemed increasingly doubtful and more-distant locations began to be considered
Within a -kilometre-mile mi radius of the capital cities under consideration included Melun Pontoise Coulommiers tampes Reims vreux Chartres and Orlans
A May report listed the disadvantages of a location too distant from Paris however such as the difficulty of transporting personnel the possible extension of courses and increased operating costs
Ren Lemaire proposed moving the school to Toulouse in a June report
The city's aeronautical infrastructure and long history as a university town made it an attractive location the University of Toulouse founded in is one of France's oldest universities
cole nationale suprieure d'ingnieurs de constructions aronautiques ENSICA settled in Toulouse in and cole nationale suprieure de l'aronautique et de l'espace SUPAERO was going to move from Paris to the city
ENAC's transfer to Toulouse was approved by Prime Minister Michel Debr on June and confirmed by his successor Georges Pompidou in a July letter
Building construction on the Rangueil campus began in April and was completed on August
The academic year began on September of that year
Five hundred students were expected including who were beginning their training
The new students consisted of air-navigation engineering students drawn largely from cole Polytechnique engineering students in air navigation from classes prparatoires aux grandes coles airline-pilot students air-traffic controller students electronics students commercial-pilot students and flight dispatcher students
The Commission permanente began to examine the university's ambiguous legal status a problem since it was founded
ENAC was closely monitored by its supervisory authority
Inspection reports published once every two years or less were frequently critical of the school with those published in the mid-s beginning to question its existence
The confidential March Brancourt Controller said that the university had a lack of curriculum there is
tension with the training center of Air France and ENAC is a mistake
These difficulties were largely due to incompatibility between ENAC and the civil-aviation industry which required it to provide courses for students and trainees who were not necessarily officials of the Direction gnrale de l'aviation civile DGAC its supervisory authority and to use a varied teaching staff
The university budget also presented a challenges after other types of income such as non-public resources were reduced particularly between and
In ENAC considered raising tuition course prices and fees for non-DGAC students
The school's status required a complex approval process however and a status of public administrative institution seemed more appropriate
The decision was made in the April Decree No
ENAC established a board of directors with Ren Lemaire its first president
In the number of non-civil-service engineering students began to increase
ENAC is becoming important in training civilian aerospace personnel its primary purpose had been to train civil servants
Civilian students are not new the first were admitted in
ENAC's engineering program focused on electronics and information technology has made the university a de facto engineering grande cole
Industry-oriented university research appeared in in accordance with the higher-education law which mandates that engineering education has a research activity basic or applied organized around four areas electronics automation computers and aviation economics
The university instructs future engineers in research methods deductive reasoning long favored by teachers in the classes prparatoires aux grandes coles and grandes coles has been inferior to the inductive reasoning characteristic of engineering research
The growing interest in research includes air navigation
Mastre spcialis programs emerged during the mid-s for the industrial GIFAS Groupement des industries franaises aronautiques et spatiales training foreign executives in a relatively-short time in addition to French students and professionals
Continuing education diversified at the same time in five main areas air-traffic control electronics computers aeronautics and languages
The university's international dimension grew significantly during the s but was hampered by new training requirements for air-traffic controllers
ENAC participated in European projects such as EATCHIP European Air Traffic Control Harmonization and Integration Program and offered student-mobility programs through the Erasmus and Socrates programmes
The university began to welcome a growing number of foreign students and formed close ties with foreign universities such as the Berlin Institute of Technology and the Technische Universitt Darmstadt in Germany and the University of Tampere in Finland
At that time ENAC created the Groupement des coles d'aronautique GEA France with the Institut suprieur de l'aronautique et de l'espace ISAE and cole nationale suprieure de mcanique et d'arotechnique ENSMA
The three grandes coles of this network in partnership with the DGAC and French companies such as EADS Airbus Thales Eurocopter and Safran founded the Institut sino-europen d'ingnierie de l'aviation Chinese-European Aviation Engineering Institute in Tianjin in with master's and mastre spcialis programs for Chinese students
During the s courses in English and activities focused on air navigation were developed
In the university and its alumni association organized the first aeronautical literary festival in Toulouse
ENAC became an ICAO center for training in aviation security in December
The university established new teaching facilities the CAUTRA air traffic control simulator the AERSIM aerodrome control simulator an Airbus A flight management system simulator a static model of the CFM -B engine for the A and a telecom-network laboratory
ENAC became Europe's largest aviation university on January when it merged with SEFA
In the university and DGAC introduced the groupement d'intrt conomique DSNA Services later France Aviation Civile Services
The current director of the university is Olivier Chansou who succeeded former SEFA director Marc Houalla
Chansou the school's eighth director was elected on November
The university is managed by an elected president who oversees three councils training and research flight training and international relations and development
ENAC had a budget of € million a -percent increase over the budget
This was due to the school's merger with SEFA and included a € million EU subsidy
After several months of consideration the ENAC Foundation was established in September
It aims to guide the training and research council in reforming the school's engineering program and fostering corporate partnerships
The foundation consists of technical and human resources managers from aerospace companies such as Air France Airbus Aroport de Paris Rockwell Collins Thals and Aroconseil
