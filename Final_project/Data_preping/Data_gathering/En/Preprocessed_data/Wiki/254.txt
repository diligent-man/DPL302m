The Speenhamland system was a form of outdoor relief intended to mitigate rural poverty in England and Wales at the end of the th century and during the early th century The law was an amendment to the Elizabethan Poor Law It was created as an indirect result of Britain's involvements in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
The system was named after a meeting in Speenhamland Berkshire where local magistrates devised the system as a means to alleviate the distress caused by high grain prices The increase in the price of grain may have occurred as a result of a poor harvest in the years though at the time this was subject to great debate Many blamed middlemen and hoarders as the ultimate architects of the shortage
The Speehamland scale read When a gallon loaf of bread cost one shilling every Poor and Industrious Man should have for his own Support s weekly either produced by his Family's Labour or an Allowance from the Poor rates and for the support of wife and every other of his Family s d When the Gallon loaf shall cost s d then every Poor and Industrious Man shall have s Weekly for his own and s and d for the Support of every other of his Family And so on in proportion as the price of bread rises and falls
The authorities at Speenhamland approved a means tested sliding scale of wage supplements in order to mitigate the worst effects of rural poverty Families were paid extra to top up wages to a set level according to a table This level varied according to the number of children and the price of bread For example if bread was s d pence a loaf the wages of a family with two children were topped up to s d pence
The first formula was set at a time of high prices and possible over charging minimum wage inflation was deliberately muted compared to price rises If bread rose to s d pence the wages were topped up to s d pence In this quoted example in percentage terms a price rise led to a wage rise wages fell from to loaves
The immediate impact of paying the poor rate fell on the landowners of the parish concerned They then sought other means of dealing with the poor such as the workhouse funded through parish unions Eventually pressure due to structural poverty caused the introduction of the new Poor Law
The Speenhamland system appears to have reached its height during the Napoleonic Wars when it was a means of allaying dangerous discontent among growing numbers of rural poor faced by soaring food prices and to have died out in the post war period except in a few parishes The system was popular in the south of England William Pitt the Younger attempted to get the idea passed into legislation but failed The system was not adopted nationally but was popular in the counties which experienced the Swing Riots during the s
In the Report of the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws called the Speenhamland System a universal system of pauperism The system allowed employers including farmers and the nascent industrialists of the town to pay below subsistence wages because the parish would make up the difference and keep their workers alive So the workers' low income was unchanged and the poor rate contributors subsidised the farmers
Thomas Malthus believed a system of supporting the poor would lead to increased population growth rates because the Poor Laws encouraged early marriage and prolific procreation which would be a problem due to the Malthusian catastrophe where population growth would exceed food production Recent scholarly analysis of census data by E A Wrigley and Richard Smith shows that Malthus was mistaken
Historian Rutger Bregman argues that food production actually grew steadily by a third between and though with a smaller section of the populace able to access it due to mechanization and the population growth that actually happened was due to growing demand for child labour and not Speenhamland
David Ricardo believed that Speenhamland would create a poverty trap where the poor would work less which would make food production fall in its turn creating the space for a revolution However Bregman argues the poverty that existed back then was not caused by a supposed Speenhamland poverty trap as wage earners were permitted to keep at least part of their allowances when their earnings increased but instead was the result of price hikes resulting from England returning to the gold standard a policy Ricardo himself had recommended
While some scholars believe that social unrest resulted from the system others believe it was due to the adoption of the gold standard and industrialization which equally affected all the populace in areas with or without Speenhamland
This system of poor relief and others like it lasted until the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act which prohibited boards of guardians supplementing the wages of full time workers This was not always implemented locally as guardians did not want to separate families in workhouses and it was often cheaper to supplement wages than operate larger workhouses
Evidence in the last years shows that the bread scale devised during the Speenhamland meeting in was by no means universal and that even the system of outdoor relief which found one of its earliest though not its first expressions in Speenhamland was not completely widespread Allowances or supplements to wages were used generally as a temporary measure and the way they operated differed between regions Mark Blaug's essay The Myth of the Old Poor Law charged the commissioners of with largely using the Speenhamland system to vilify the old poor law and create a will for the passage of a new one However historians such as Eric Hobsbawm have argued that the old poor law was still damaging by subsidising employers and heightening dependency of workers' incomes on local aristocrats
Daniel A Baugh argues that relief costs did not greatly increase After the Napoleonic Wars the conditions of employment and subsistence in south east England underwent a fundamental change The Speenhamland System did not differ much in consequences from the older system what mattered was the shape of the poverty problem
