in mathematics descartes rule of signs first described by ren descartes in his work la g om trie is a technique for getting information on the number of positive real roots of a polynomial
it asserts that the number of positive roots is at most the number of sign changes in the sequence of polynomial s coefficients omitting the zero coefficients and that the difference between these two numbers is always even
this implies in particular that if the number of sign changes is zero or one then there are exactly zero or one positive roots respectively
by a homographic transformation of the variable one may use descartes rule of signs for getting a similar information on the number of roots in any interval
this is the basic idea of budan s theorem and budan fourier theorem
by repeating the division of an interval into two intervals one gets eventually a list of disjoint intervals containing together all real roots of the polynomial and containing each exactly one real root
descartes rule of signs and homographic transformations of the variable are nowadays the basis of the fastest algorithms for computer computation of real roots of polynomials see real root isolation
descartes himself used the transformation x x for using his rule for getting information of the number of negative roots
the rule states that if the nonzero terms of a single variable polynomial with real coefficients are ordered by descending variable exponent then the number of positive roots of the polynomial is either equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive nonzero coefficients or is less than it by an even number
a root of multiplicity k is counted as k roots
in particular if the number of sign changes is zero or one the number of positive roots equals the number of sign changes
as a corollary of the rule the number of negative roots is the number of sign changes after multiplying the coefficients of odd power terms by or fewer than it by an even number
this procedure is equivalent to substituting the negation of the variable for the variable itself
for example the negative roots of
since nonreal roots of a polynomial with real coefficients must occur in conjugate pairs it means that x has exactly two nonreal roots and one real root which is positive
the subtraction of only multiples of from the maximal number of positive roots occurs because the polynomial may have nonreal roots which always come in pairs since the rule applies to polynomials whose coefficients are real
thus if the polynomial is known to have all real roots this rule allows one to find the exact number of positive and negative roots
since it is easy to determine the multiplicity of zero as a root the sign of all roots can be determined in this case
if the real polynomial p has k real positive roots counted with multiplicity then for every a there are at least k changes of sign in the sequence of coefficients of the taylor series of the function ep x
for sufficiently large a there are exactly k such changes of sign
in the s askold khovanskii developed the theory of fewnomials that generalises descartes rule
the rule of signs can be thought of as stating that the number of real roots of a polynomial is dependent on the polynomial s complexity and that this complexity is proportional to the number of monomials it has not its degree
khovanski showed that this holds true not just for polynomials but for algebraic combinations of many transcendental functions the so called pfaffian functions
