mathematics descartes' rule sign first described ren descartes work la gomtrie technique getting information number positive real root polynomial
asserts number positive root number sign change sequence polynomial's coefficient omitting zero coefficient difference two number always even
implies particular number sign change zero one exactly zero one positive root respectively
homographic transformation variable one may use descartes' rule sign getting similar information number root interval
repeating division interval two interval one get eventually list disjoint interval containing together real root polynomial containing exactly one real root
descartes rule sign homographic transformation variable nowadays basis fastest algorithm computer computation real root polynomial see real-root isolation
descartes used transformation x x using rule getting information number negative roots
rule state nonzero term single-variable polynomial real coefficient ordered descending variable exponent number positive root polynomial either equal number sign change consecutive nonzero coefficient le even number
particular number sign change zero one number positive root equal number sign changes
corollary rule number negative root number sign change multiplying coefficient odd-power term fewer even number
since nonreal root polynomial real coefficient must occur conjugate pair mean x ha exactly two nonreal root one real root positive
subtraction multiple maximal number positive root occurs polynomial may nonreal root always come pair since rule applies polynomial whose coefficient real
thus polynomial known real root rule allows one find exact number positive negative roots
since easy determine multiplicity zero root sign root determined case
real polynomial p ha k real positive root counted multiplicity every least k change sign sequence coefficient taylor series function epx
