i t was pure chance jean pierre insists
there was already a bill going through and the minister took advantage of our award to call it the rosetta law

olivier gourmet the main character of le fils has a brief cameo as a detective in l enfant
like rosetta s emilie dequenne d borah fran ois the seventeen year old lead in l enfant was appearing in her first film
luc dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows what we do with the actors is also very physical
the day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before
the instructions we give the actors are above all physical
we start working without the cameraman just the actors and my brother and me
we walk them through the blocking first one then the other trying several different versions
they say but do not act their lines
we do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling
at this point there is no cameraman no sound engineer no lighting
then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot which is usually a long take
doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors movements or any small details
the dardennes often employ handheld cameras and use available light
in they signed a petition in support of director roman polanski who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his sexual abuse charges which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown freely and safely and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door for actions of which no one can know the effects
