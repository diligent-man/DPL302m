Brothers Jean-Pierre Dardenne (French: [daʁdɛn]; born 21 April 1951) and Luc Dardenne (born 10 March 1954), collectively referred to as the Dardenne brothers, are a Belgian filmmaking duo
They write, produce, and direct their films together.
The Dardennes began making narrative and documentary films in the late 1970s
They came to international attention in the mid-1990s with La Promesse (The Promise)
They won their first major international film prize when Rosetta won the Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival
Their work tends to reflect left-wing themes and points-of-view.
In 2002, Olivier Gourmet won Best Actor at Cannes for the Dardennes' Le Fils (The Son)
In 2005, they won the Palme d'Or a second time for their film L'Enfant (The Child), putting them in an elite club, at the time, of only seven
Their film, Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence), won Best Screenplay at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival and was released in Europe in the fall
Their film The Kid with a Bike won the Grand Prix at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, received one Golden Globe nomination and eight Magritte Award nominations
Jean-Pierre was the jury president for the Cinéfoundation and Short Films sections of the 2012 Cannes Film Festival
In 2015, their film Deux jours, une nuit (Two Days, One Night) received nine Magritte Award nominations (winning three) and one Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Marion Cotillard
Their 2019 feature Young Ahmed won them the Best Director Award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival
Their 2022 film Tori and Lokita won the 75th Anniversary Prize at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival.
Creators of intensely naturalistic films about working class life in Belgium, brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne have created a notable body of work since 1996
With La Promesse (The Promise) (1996), Rosetta (1999), Le Fils (The Son) (2002), and L'Enfant (The Child) (2005), the Dardennes' films show young people at the fringes of society – immigrants, the unemployed, the inhabitants of shelters
Both Rosetta and L'Enfant were awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the only two Belgian films ever to earn the honor.
The Dardennes were born and raised in Seraing in Liege, in Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium
Jean-Pierre (born in 1951) studied drama while Luc (born three years later) studied philosophy
In 1975 they established Derives, the production company that produced the roughly sixty documentary films they made before branching into feature films
These films covered such topics as  Polish immigration, World War II resistance, a general strike in 1960
Their first two feature films, however, are rarely seen today: Falsch (1987) adapted from René Kalisky, featuring Bruno Cremer and Je pense a vous (1992).
The Dardennes had their first international success with La Promesse (The Promise) in 1996.
With Rosetta the Dardennes turned their focus to the burdens – philosophical, spiritual, psychological – of unemployment
Émilie Dequenne, who had not acted in film before, and was awarded the Best Actress Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, is the title character, a young woman living with her alcoholic mother in a trailer park
The film is about Rosetta's search for purpose and to Rosetta purpose can only be found through work – she makes her way through Seraing's fringes for the most menial of positions; she catches fish in the muddy, murky stream by her trailer park
Rosetta was the first Belgian film ever to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, coming in ahead of films by David Lynch, Pedro Almodóvar, Takeshi Kitano, and Raoul Ruiz
The film provided some impetus for a labor law designed to protect young workers like Rosetta shortly after the film's release
"'[I]t was pure chance,' Jean-Pierre insists
'There was already a bill going through, and the minister took advantage of our award to call it the Rosetta Law
But we never intended to get laws changed.' Luc adds: 'Of course, we always hope our films will speak to people, disturb them, but we never hoped to change the world'."
Crimes and occupations again figure prominently in the Dardennes' fourth film, L'Enfant (The Child)
 The film earned the Dardennes the Palme d'Or from Cannes, their second in seven years
L'Enfant won the André Cavens Award in 2005, making directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne fourth-time winners of the award.
The Dardenne brothers have a regular stable of collaborators (for all of their films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo
Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L'Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence), Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike), and Bryan's father in The Unknown Girl (La Fille inconnue)
Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L'Enfant
Like Rosetta's Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L'Enfant, was appearing in her first film
Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: "What we do with the actors is also very physical
The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before
The instructions we give the actors are above all physical
We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me
We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions
They say but do not act their lines
We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling
At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting
Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take
Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors' movements or any small details."
The Dardennes often employ handheld cameras and use available light
In 2009, they signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown "freely and safely", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door "for actions of which no-one can know the effects."
In June 2012, the brothers were invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Their 2014 film Two Days, One Night was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival
The film received nine nominations at the 5th Magritte Awards, winning three, including Best Film and Best Director
Marion Cotillard received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her performance in the film, the first Oscar nomination for a Dardenne brothers film.
In 2014, their body of work was awarded the special prize of the 40th Anniversary of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival.
In 2016 they premiered The Unknown Girl (La Fille inconnue), starring Adèle Haenel as a young doctor who lets the door buzzer of her small clinic go unanswered one evening after work hours and then grows determined to discover the identity of the young woman found dead nearby when the police see from a security tape that she had been the person ringing at the door.
Their 2019 film Young Ahmed, a film about a Belgian teenager embracing Islamic extremism, was nominated for the Palme D'or at the Cannes Film Festival and they won the Best Director prize.
Their 2022 film Tori and Lokita, was nominated for the Palme D'or at the Cannes Film Festival and won the 75th Anniversary Prize.
