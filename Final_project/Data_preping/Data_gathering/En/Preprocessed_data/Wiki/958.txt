The Dardennes often employ handheld cameras and use available light In they signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his sexual abuse charges which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown freely and safely and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door for actions of which no one can know the effects
