according to philip parker the structural form is an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative
other analysts describe the structure as a circular narrative
hitmen jules winnfield and vincent vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss gangster marsellus wallace from a business partner brett
after vincent checks the contents of the briefcase jules shoots one of brett s associates
he declaims a passage from the bible and he and vincent kill brett for trying to double cross marsellus
they take the briefcase to marsellus and wait while he bribes boxer butch coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match
the next day vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer lance
he shoots up and drives to meet marsellus s wife mia having agreed to escort her while marsellus is out of town
they eat at jack rabbit slim s a s themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest then return home
while vincent is in the bathroom mia finds his heroin and snorts it mistaking it for cocaine
she suffers an overdose vincent rushes her to lance s house where they revive her with an injection of adrenaline into her heart
vincent drops mia off at her home and the two agree never to tell marsellus about the incident
butch bets the bribe money on himself and double crosses marsellus winning the bout but accidentally killing his opponent as well
knowing that marsellus will send hitmen after him he prepares to flee with his girlfriend fabienne but discovers she has forgotten to pack a gold watch passed down to him through his family
returning to his apartment to retrieve it he notices a submachine gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush
when vincent exits the bathroom butch shoots him dead and departs
when marsellus spots butch stopped at a traffic light butch rams his car into him leaving both of them injured and dazed
once marsellus regains consciousness he draws a gun and shoots at butch chasing him into a pawnshop
as butch gains the upper hand and is about to shoot marsellus maynard the shop owner captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement
maynard and his accomplice zed take marsellus into another room and begin to rape him leaving the gimp a silent figure in a bondage suit to watch over butch
butch breaks loose and knocks the gimp unconscious
instead of fleeing he decides to save marsellus and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop
he kills maynard and frees marsellus who shoots zed in the crotch with maynard s shotgun
marsellus informs butch that they are even and to tell no one about the rape and to depart los angeles forever
butch picks up fabienne on zed s chopper and they ride away
earlier after vincent and jules have killed brett in his apartment another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them but every shot misses after briefly checking themselves for wounds jules and vincent shoot him dead
while driving away with brett s associate marvin jules professes that their survival was a miracle which vincent disputes
vincent accidentally shoots marvin in the face killing him and covering vincent jules and the car interior in blood in broad daylight
they hide the car at the home of jules s friend jimmie who demands they deal with the problem before his wife bonnie comes home
marsellus sends a cleaner winston wolfe who directs jules and vincent to clean the car hide the body in the trunk dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard
at a diner jules tells vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime convinced that their miraculous survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention
while vincent is in the bathroom a couple pumpkin and honey bunny hold up the restaurant and demand marsellus s briefcase
distracting him with its contents jules overpowers pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint honey bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun on him
vincent returns with his gun aimed at her but jules defuses the situation
he recites the biblical passage expresses ambivalence about his life of crime and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave
jules and vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand
john travolta as vincent vega jules partner in crime working for marsellus wallace
tarantino cast travolta in pulp fiction because michael madsen who had played vic vega in reservoir dogs chose to appear in kevin costner s wyatt earp instead
madsen has since expressed regret over his decision
harvey weinstein pushed for daniel day lewis in the part
travolta accepted a reduced rate sources say either us or us but the film s success and his academy award nomination for best actor revitalized his career
vincent is the brother of vic vega aka mr
blonde whom he owned and operated a nightclub with in amsterdam
vincent had also previously served time in prison
he is also the cousin of tim and suzanne vega and nephew of edgardo vega yunqu
in tarantino discussed an idea for a movie starring travolta and madsen as the vega brothers the concept remains unrealized samuel l
jackson as jules winnfield vincent s partner in crime working for marsellus wallace
jackson s first audition was overshadowed by paul calder n jackson had assumed the audition was merely a reading
weinstein convinced him to audition a second time and his performance of the final diner scene won over tarantino
jules was originally scripted with a giant afro but tarantino s pa mistakenly bought a jheri curled wig
tarantino was initially enraged but jackson persuaded him to keep it since the hairstyle had gained popularity through the rap group n w a
film critic owen gleiberman took it as a tacit comic statement about the ghettoization of black people in movies
jackson received an oscar nomination for best supporting actor
calder n appears in the film as paul a bartender at marsellus s social club as well as marsellus s assistant
tarantino wrote the role for laurence fishburne who turned it down
according to tarantino fishburne refused it because his team did not see it as a starring role fishburne later said he turned it down because he felt the film glamorized heroin uma thurman as mia wallace wallace s wife and an aspiring actress
miramax favored holly hunter or meg ryan for the role of mia
alfre woodard and meg tilly were also considered but tarantino wanted thurman after their first meeting
she dominated the film s promotional material appearing on a bed with cigarette in hand
she was nominated for an oscar for best supporting actress
despite being launched into the celebrity a list thurman chose not to do any big budget films until batman robin three years later harvey keitel as winston wolfe a cleaner who aids jules and vincent
tarantino wrote the part of wolfe specifically for keitel who had starred in reservoir dogs and was instrumental in its production
in tarantino s words harvey had been my favorite actor since i was years old keitel had played a similarly employed character in point of no return tim roth as ringo pumpkin a burglar and yolanda s boyfriend
roth had starred in reservoir dogs alongside keitel
he had used an american accent in reservoir dogs but uses his natural london accent in pulp fiction
though tarantino had written the part with roth in mind tristar head mike medavoy preferred johnny depp or christian slater
early in development tarantino had contemplated casting roth as vincent and gary oldman as jules rewriting the characters as two english guys amanda plummer as yolanda honey bunny ringo s girlfriend and partner in crime
tarantino wrote the role of yolanda for plummer to partner her with roth onscreen
roth had introduced tarantino to her saying i want to work with amanda in one of your films but she has to have a really big gun maria de medeiros as fabienne butch s girlfriend
tarantino met de medeiros a portuguese actress while traveling with reservoir dogs around the european film festival circuit ving rhames as marsellus wallace a crime boss and employer of jules and vincent
before rhames was cast the part of wallace was initially offered to max julien and sid haig but both turned down the role
according to bender rhames gave one of the best auditions i ve ever seen
his acclaimed performance led to him being cast in big budget features such as mission impossible con air and out of sight eric stoltz as lance vincent s drug dealer
gary oldman was the preferred choice among tristar executives based on his portrayal of drug dealing pimp drexl spivey in true romance rosanna arquette as jody lance s wife
pam grier read for the role but tarantino did not believe audiences would find it plausible for lance to yell at her
tarantino later cast grier as the lead role for jackie brown
ellen degeneres also read for the part of jody
rosanna s sister alexis also appears in the film as a man emerging from a bathroom to shoot at and miss vincent and jules who then kill him christopher walken as captain koons a usaf veteran of the vietnam war who delivers a young butch his father s coveted gold watch
during koons monologue which is interspersed with colourful descriptions of the viet cong he mentions a soldier called winocki
joe winocki john garfield is a character in the film air force directed by howard hawks one of tarantino s favorite directors
tarantino played a character named desmond winocki in a guest appearance on an episode of all american girl titled pulp sitcom bruce willis as butch coolidge an aging boxer on the run from marsellus having double crossed him
willis was a major star but most of his recent films had been critical and box office disappointments
as related by peter bart participating in the modestly budgeted film meant lowering his salary and risking his star status but the strategy
paid off royally pulp fiction not only brought willis new respect as an actor but also earned him several million dollars willis appearance and physical presence were crucial to tarantino bruce has the look of a s actor
i can t think of any other star that has that look butch s look was specifically modeled after aldo ray in nightfall and his demeanor based on ralph meeker s portrayal of mike hammer in robert aldrich s kiss me deadly
chandler lindauer plays a young butch additionally bronagh gallagher plays jody s friend trudi who does little but smoke a bong during the scene where vincent revives mia
according to author jason bailey quentin thought it would be funny to have this casual observer who just happened to be there
all of this was born out of the experience of when you go to someone s house to buy drugs there are always people who are just there phil lamarr portrays marvin an associate of jules and vincent
lamarr auditioned for tarantino after both had done a show for an improv group a few months prior
he read for the roles of jules winnfield and brett before being cast as marvin
tarantino himself appears as jules friend jimmie in whose house they clean up a murder
tarantino was unsure whether to play jimmie or lance choosing jimmie as he wanted to be behind the camera during mia s overdose scene
frank whaley portrays brett an associate of jules and vincent who has a briefcase requested by marcellus
whaley met tarantino while he was filming reservoir dogs at a lab in sundance institute
he recalls we ended up meeting and spending time together and i liked him so i was really happy when he asked me to be in this movie burr steers appears as roger a friend of brett s nicknamed flock of seagulls by jules
the scene of the confrontation between brett and jules went through several takes due to steers making mistakes
steers recalled in an interview that he had found acting difficult due to the loudness of the gunshots
angela jones portrays esmeralda villalobos a cab driver who aids butch s escape
her casting and character were inspired by her performance in the short film curdled later remade as a feature film with finance from tarantino and again starring jones
duane whitaker peter greene and stephen hibbert play maynard zed and the gimp respectively
according to the daily beast these three psycho hillbillies that rape marsellus in maynard s shop s basement are a reference to the film deliverance
steve buscemi makes a cameo appearance as a waiter at jack rabbit slim s dressed as buddy holly
buscemi who had appeared in reservoir dogs was originally considered for the role of jimmie but was unable to commit
kathy griffin appears as herself
roger avary wrote the first element of what would become the pulp fiction screenplay in the fall of
the initial inspiration was the three part horror anthology film black sabbath by italian filmmaker mario bava
the tarantino avary project was provisionally titled black mask after the seminal hardboiled crime fiction magazine
tarantino s script was produced as reservoir dogs his directorial debut avary created the basis for the gold watch storyline of pulp fiction
with work on reservoir dogs completed tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film i got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don t telling three separate stories having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story tarantino explains that the idea was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you ve ever seen when it comes to crime stories the oldest stories in the book
you know vincent vega and marsellus wallace s wife the oldest story about
the guy s gotta go out with the big man s wife and don t touch her
you know you ve seen the story a zillion times i m using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry he says
part of the trick is to take these movie characters these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life s rules and see how they unravel in at least one case boxer butch coolidge tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic hollywood crime story i wanted him to be basically like ralph meeker as mike hammer in aldrich s kiss me deadly
i wanted him to be a bully and a jerk
tarantino went to work on the script for pulp fiction in amsterdam in march possibly at the winston hotel in the red light district
he was joined there by avary who contributed pandemonium reigns to the project and participated in its rewriting as well as the development of the new storylines that would link up with it
two scenes originally written by avary for the true romance screenplay exclusively credited to tarantino were incorporated into the opening of the bonnie situation the miraculous missed shots by the hidden gunman and the rear seat automobile killing
the notion of the crimeworld cleaner that became the heart of the episode was inspired by a short curdled that tarantino saw at a film festival
he cast the lead actress angela jones in pulp fiction and later backed the filmmakers production of a feature length version of curdled
the script included a couple of made up commercial brands that often featured in later tarantino films big kahuna burgers a big kahuna soda cup appears in reservoir dogs and red apple cigarettes
as he worked on the script tarantino also accompanied reservoir dogs around the european film festivals
released in the united states in october the picture was a critical and commercial success
in january the pulp fiction script was complete
tarantino and his producer lawrence bender brought the script to jersey films
before even seeing reservoir dogs jersey had attempted to sign tarantino for his next project
ultimately a development deal worth around million had been struck the deal gave a band apart bender and tarantino s newly formed production company initial financing and office facilities jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio
jersey had a distribution and first look deal with columbia tristar which paid tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option
in february pulp fiction appeared on a variety list of films in pre production at tristar
in june however the studio put the script into turnaround
according to a studio executive tristar chief mike medavoy found it too demented
there were suggestions that tristar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low budget for its desired star driven image
avary who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut killing zoe has said that tristar s objections were comprehensive encompassing the script s fundamental structure
he characterizes the studio s position this is the worst thing ever written
it makes no sense
someone s dead and then they re alive
it s too long violent and unfilmable so i thought that s that
bender brought the script to miramax the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired by disney
harvey weinstein co chairman of miramax along with his brother bob was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up
pulp fiction the first miramax project to get a green light after the disney acquisition was budgeted at million
it became the first movie that miramax completely financed
helping hold costs down was the plan bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week regardless of their industry status
the biggest star to sign on to the project was bruce willis
though he had recently appeared in several big budget flops he was still a major overseas draw
on the strength of his name miramax garnered million for the film s worldwide rights virtually ensuring its profitability
principal photography commenced on september
the lead offscreen talent had all worked with tarantino on reservoir dogs cinematographer andrzej seku a film editor sally menke production designer david wasco and costume designer betsy heimann
according to tarantino w e had million
i wanted it to look like a million movie
i wanted it to look like an epic
it s an epic in everything in invention in ambition in length in scope in everything except the price tag the film he says was shot on asa film stock which is the slowest stock they make
the reason we use it is that it creates an almost no grain image it s lustrous
it s the closest thing we have to s technicolor the largest chunk of the budget went to creating the jack rabbit slim s set
it was built in a culver city warehouse where it was joined by several other sets as well as the film s production offices
the diner sequence was shot on location in hawthorne at the hawthorne grill known for its googie architecture
for the costumes tarantino took his inspiration from french director jean pierre melville who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor
tarantino cast himself in a modest sized role as he had in reservoir dogs
one of his pop totems fruit brute a long discontinued general mills cereal also returned from the earlier film
the shoot wrapped on november
before pulp fiction s premiere tarantino convinced avary to forfeit his agreed on cowriting credit and accept a story by credit so the line written and directed by quentin tarantino could be used in advertising and onscreen
no film score was composed for pulp fiction quentin tarantino instead used an eclectic assortment of surf music rock and roll soul and pop songs
dick dale s rendition of misirlou plays during the opening credits
tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film but not he insists because of its association with surfing culture to me it just sounds like rock and roll even morricone music
it sounds like rock and roll spaghetti western music tarantino planned to use a power pop song my sharona by the knack during the film s rape scene but ultimately discounted it
some of the songs were suggested to tarantino by his friends chuck kelley and laura lovelace who were credited as music consultants
lovelace also appeared in the film as laura a waitress she reprises the role in jackie brown
the soundtrack album was released along with the film in
the album peaked on the billboard chart at number
the single urge overkill s cover of the neil diamond song girl you ll be a woman soon reached number
estella tincknell describes how the particular combination of well known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a self consciously cool text
the use of the mono tracked beat heavy style of early s u s
underground pop mixed with classic ballads such as dusty springfield s son of a preacher man is crucial to the film s postmodern knowingness she contrasts the soundtrack with that of forrest gump the highest grossing film of which also relies on period pop recordings t he version of the sixties offered by pulp fiction
is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter culture featured in forrest gump but is rather a more genuinely marginal form of sub culture based around a lifestyle surfing hanging that is resolutely apolitical the soundtrack is central she says to the film s engagement with the younger cinematically knowledgeable spectator it solicits
pulp fiction premiered in may at the cannes film festival
the weinsteins hit the beach like commandos bringing the picture s entire cast over
the film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation
it won the palme d or the festival s top prize generating a further wave of publicity
the first u s
review of the film was published on may in industry trade magazine variety
todd mccarthy called pulp fiction a spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture
a startling massive success from cannes forward tarantino was on the road continuously promoting the film
over the next few months it played in smaller festivals around europe building buzz nottingham munich taormina locarno norway and san sebasti n
tarantino later said one thing that s cool is that by breaking up the linear structure when i watch the film with an audience it does break the audience s alpha state
it s like all of a sudden i gotta watch this
i gotta pay attention you can almost feel everybody moving in their seats
it s actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie in late september it opened the new york film festival
the new york times published its review the day of the opening
janet maslin called the film a triumphant cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from mr
tarantino s ripe imagination a landscape of danger shock hilarity and vibrant local color
he has come up with a work of such depth wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of american film makers
on october pulp fiction went into general release in the united states
as peter biskind describes it was not platformed that is it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built the traditional way of releasing an indie film it went wide immediately into theaters in the eyes of some cultural critics reservoir dogs had given tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence
miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign you won t know the facts till you ve seen the fiction went one slogan
pulp fiction was the top grossing film at the us box office its first weekend with a gross of edging out a sylvester stallone vehicle the specialist which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters
the gross claimed by miramax was disputed by others
warner bros
initially reported an estimated gross of million for the specialist with bob weinstein then reporting a gross for pulp fiction of million claiming that the film was on another screens that had previously been overlooked
warners then updated their gross to million claiming they had made a calculation error
early monday morning miramax reported a gross of million with warners reporting million for the specialist placing pulp fiction first but other industry sources did not believe miramax s numbers
variety estimated that pulp fiction grossed to million for the weekend
against its budget of million and about million in marketing costs pulp fiction wound up grossing million at the u s
box office making it the first indie film to surpass million
worldwide it took in nearly million
in terms of domestic grosses it was the tenth biggest film of even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top
popular engagement with the film such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase indicates the kind of cult status that pulp fiction achieved almost immediately
as moviemaker puts it the movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon abroad as well in britain where it opened a week after its u s
release not only was the film a big hit but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in uk publishing history a top ten bestseller
on review aggregator rotten tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of
the website s critical consensus reads one of the most influential films of the s pulp fiction is a delirious post modern mix of neo noir thrills pitch black humor and pop culture touchstones on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim
audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of b on an a to f scale
the response of major american film reviewers was widely favorable
roger ebert of the chicago sun times described it as so well written in a scruffy fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it the noses of those zombie writers who take screenwriting classes that teach them the formulas for hit films
richard corliss of time wrote it towers over the year s other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool
it dares hollywood films to be this smart about going this far
if good directors accept tarantino s implicit challenge the movie theater could again be a great place to live in in newsweek david ansen wrote the miracle of quentin tarantino s pulp fiction is how being composed of secondhand debased parts it succeeds in gleaming like something new you get intoxicated by it wrote entertainment weekly s owen gleiberman high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be
i m not sure i ve ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild ass joy the way that tarantino does there s a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive wrote peter travers of rolling stone
pulp fiction is indisputably great
the los angeles times was one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film s opening weekend
kenneth turan wrote the writer director appears to be straining for his effects
some sequences especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation of someone who s afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to pulp fiction itself
while not panning the film stanley kauffmann of the new republic felt that the way that it has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting
pulp fiction nourishes abets cultural slumming responding to comparisons between tarantino s film and the work of french new wave director jean luc godard especially his first most famous feature jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader wrote the fact that pulp fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful namely the ones we already have and don t wish to expand observing in the national review that n o film arrives with more advance hype john simon was unswayed titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness
debate about the film spread beyond the review pages with its violence often being the theme
in the washington post donna britt described how she was happy not to see pulp fiction on a recent weekend and thus avoid discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody s brains around a car interior
some commentators took exception to the film s frequent use of the word nigger mentioned times
in the chicago tribune todd boyd argued that the word s recurrence has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool
in britain james wood writing in the guardian set the tone for much subsequent criticism tarantino represents the final triumph of postmodernism which is to empty the artwork of all content thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies
only in this age could a writer as talented as tarantino produce artworks so vacuous so entirely stripped of any politics metaphysics or moral interest
around the turn of the year pulp fiction was named best picture by the national society of film critics national board of review los angeles film critics association boston society of film critics society of texas film critics southeastern film critics association and kansas city film critics circle
tarantino was named best director by all seven of those organizations as well as by the new york film critics circle and chicago film critics association
the screenplay won several prizes with various awarding bodies ascribing credit differently
at the nd golden globe awards tarantino named as sole recipient of the best screenplay honor failed to mention avary in his acceptance speech
in february the film received seven oscar nominations best picture director actor travolta supporting actor jackson supporting actress thurman original screenplay and film editing
travolta jackson and thurman were each nominated as well for the st screen actors guild awards presented on february but none took home the honor
at the academy awards ceremony the following month tarantino and avary were announced as joint winners of the academy award for best original screenplay
the furor around the film was still going strong much of the march issue of artforum was devoted to its critical dissection
pulp fiction garnered four honors at the independent spirit awards held at the end of the month best feature best director male lead jackson and best screenplay tarantino
at the british academy film awards bafta tarantino and avary shared the bafta award for best original screenplay and jackson won for best supporting actor
the film was nominated for the grand prix of the belgian film critics association
the february issue of new york magazine lists pulp fiction alongside citizen kane sunset boulevard dr
strangelove butch cassidy and the sundance kid the conversation nashville taxi driver the elephant man in the bedroom there will be blood and roma as the best movies that lost best picture at the oscars
pulp fiction quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era
in in a special edition of siskel ebert devoted to tarantino gene siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the ossification of american movies with their brutal formulas
in siskel s view
the violent intensity of pulp fiction calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are
hitchcock s psycho arthur penn s bonnie and clyde and stanley kubrick s a clockwork orange
each film shook up a tired bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become
and that i predict will be the ultimate honor for pulp fiction
like all great films it criticizes other movies
ken dancyger writes that its imitative and innovative style like that of its predecessor reservoir dogs represents
a new phenomenon the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life
the consequence is twofold the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the gangster films or westerns horror films or adventure films
and that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form a different experience for the audience
in a widely covered speech on may republican presidential candidate bob dole attacked the american entertainment industry for peddling nightmares of depravity
pulp fiction was soon associated with his charges concerning gratuitous violence
dole had not mentioned the film he cited two less celebrated movies based on tarantino screenplays natural born killers and true romance
in september dole did accuse pulp fiction which he had not seen of promoting the romance of heroin
paula rabinowitz expresses the general film industry opinion that pulp fiction simultaneously resurrected john travolta and film noir
in peter biskind s description it created a guys with guns frenzy
the film has also been labeled as a black comedy and a neo noir
critic geoffrey o brien however argued against the classification of pulp fiction into the neo noir genre the old time noir passions the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that tarantino conjures up
it is neither neo noir nor a parody of noir similarly nicholas christopher calls it more gangland camp than neo noir and foster hirsch suggests that its trippy fantasy landscape characterizes it more definitively than any genre label
regardless the stylistic influence of pulp fiction soon became apparent
less than a year after the picture s release british critic jon ronson attended the national film school s end of semester screenings and assessed the impact out of the five student movies i watched four incorporated violent shoot outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic s pop hits two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of the brady bunch before offing their victim
not since citizen kane has one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking among the first hollywood films cited as its imitators were destiny turns on the radio in which tarantino acted things to do in denver when you re dead and days in the valley
it triggered a myriad of clones writes fiona villella
internationally according to david desser it not only influenced a british brand of noir but extended the noir vision virtually around the world
pulp fiction s effect on film form was still reverberating in when david denby of the new yorker credited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives
its impact on hollywood was deeper still
according to variety the trajectory of pulp fiction from cannes launch to commercial smash forever altered the game of so called independent cinema
it cemented miramax s place as the reigning indie superpower writes biskind
pulp became the star wars of independents exploding expectations for what an indie film could do at the box office the film s large financial return on its small budget
transform ed the industry s attitude toward the lowly indies
spawning a flock of me too classics divisions
s mart studio executives suddenly woke up to the fact that grosses and market share which got all the press were not the same as profits
once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of small scale they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves and either bought the distributors as disney had miramax or started their own
copy ing miramax s marketing and distribution strategies
in variety noting the increasing number of actors switching back and forth between expensive studio films and low budget independent or indie style projects suggested that the watershed moment for movie stars came with the decision by willis one of hollywood s highest paid performers to appear in pulp fiction
and its impact was even broader than that
it has been described as a major cultural event an international phenomenon that influenced television music literature and advertising
not long after its release it was identified as a significant focus of attention within the growing community of internet users
adding pulp fiction to his roster of the great movies in roger ebert called it the most influential film of the decade
four years later time s corliss wrote much the same unquestionably the most influential american movie of the s

in it was voted th overall on the afi s years
movies list
in it was named one of time s all time movies
as of september it is number on metacritic s list of all time highest scores
the film ranks very highly in popular surveys

in a readers poll by the british magazine total film it ranked as the number three film in history
it was voted as the fourth greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for britain s channel in
tarantino has stated that he originally planned to do a black mask movie referring to the magazine largely responsible for popularizing hardboiled detective fiction
i t kind of went somewhere else
geoffrey o brien sees the result as connected rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers as cornell woolrich and fredric brown
both dealt heavily in the realm of improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes a realm that pulp fiction makes its own in particular o brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of brown s novels and the recursive interweaving structure of pulp fiction
philip french describes the film s narrative as a circular movement or m bius strip of a kind resnais and robbe grillet would admire
james mottram regards crime novelist elmore leonard whose influence tarantino has acknowledged as the film s primary literary antecedent
he suggests that leonard s rich dialogue is reflected in tarantino s popular culture strewn jive he also points to the acute extremely dark sense of humor leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration
film scholar historian robert kolker sees the flourishes the apparent witty banality of the dialogue the goofy fracturing of temporality as a patina over a pastiche
the pastiche
is essentially of two films that tarantino can t seem to get out of his mind mean streets directed by martin scorsese who loved pulp fiction and the way the film was told
and the killing directed by stanley kubrick he contrasts pulp fiction with postmodern hollywood predecessors hudson hawk starring willis and last action hero starring arnold schwarzenegger that took the joke too far
simply mocked or suggested that they were smarter than the audience and flopped
todd mccarthy writes that the film s striking widescreen compositions often contain objects in extreme close up as well as vivid contrasts sometimes bringing to mind the visual strategies of sergio leone an acknowledged hero of tarantino s
to martin rubin the expansive brightly colored widescreen visuals evoke comedy directors such as frank tashlin and blake edwards
the movie s host of pop culture allusions ranging from the famous image of marilyn monroe s skirt flying up over a subway grating to jules addressing a soon to be victim as flock of seagulls because of his haircut have led many critics to discuss it within the framework of postmodernism
describing the film in as tarantino s postmodern masterpiece
to date david walker writes that it is marked by its playful reverence for the s
and its constantly teasing and often deferential references to other films
he characterizes its convoluted narrative technique as postmodern tricksiness
calling the film a terminally hip postmodern collage foster hirsch finds pulp fiction far from a masterpiece authoritative influential and meaningless
set in a world that could exist only in the movies it is a succulent guilty pleasure beautifully made junk food for cin astes
o brien dismissing attempts to associate the movie with film noir argues that pulp fiction is more a guided tour of an infernal theme park decorated with cultural detritus buddy holly and mamie van doren fragments of blaxploitation and roger corman and shogun assassin music out of a twenty four hour oldies station for which all the decades since the fifties exist simultaneously catherine constable takes the moment in which a needle filled with adrenalin is plunged into the comatose mia s heart as exemplary
she proposes that it can be seen as effecting her resurrection from the dead simultaneously recalling and undermining the gothic convention of the vampire s stake
on this model the referencing of previous aesthetic forms and styles moves beyond
empty pastiche sustaining an inventive and affirmative mode of postmodernism
mark t
conard asks w hat is the film about and answers american nihilism hirsch suggests if the film is actually about anything other than its own cleverness it seems dedicated to the dubious thesis that hit men are part of the human family richard alleva argues that pulp fiction has about as much to do with actual criminality or violence as cyrano de bergerac with the realities of seventeenth century france or the prisoner of zenda with balkan politics he reads the movie as a form of romance whose allure is centered in the characters nonnaturalistic discourse wise guy literate media smart obscenely epigrammatic
in alan stone s view the absurd dialogue like that between vincent and jules in the scene where the former accidentally kills marvin unexpectedly transforms the meaning of the violence clich
pulp fiction unmasks the macho myth by making it laughable and deheroicizes the power trip glorified by standard hollywood violence stone reads the film as politically correct
there is no nudity and no violence directed against women
it celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity there are strong women and strong black men and the director swims against the current of class stereotype
where stone sees a celebration kolker finds a vacuum the postmodern insouciance violence homophobia and racism of pulp fiction were perfectly acceptable because the film didn t pretend seriousness and therefore didn t mock it calling it the acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking he explains the postmodern is about surfaces it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop cultural figures according to kolker
that s why pulp fiction was so popular
not because all audiences got all or any of its references to scorsese and kubrick but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification
the film s cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world but this nastiness keeps being laughed off by the mock intensity of the action the prowling confronting perverse confined and airless nastiness of the world tarantino creates
henry a
giroux argues that tarantino empties violence of any critical social consequences offering viewers only the immediacy of shock humor and irony without insight as elements of mediation
none of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing
t he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight
regarding the violence and nihilism in the film pamela demory has suggested that pulp fiction should be seen in light of the short stories of flannery o connor which likewise feature religious elements banality and violence with grotesque humor discussing the connection between violence and redemption demory concludes that while o connor s purpose is to convince readers of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace tarantino seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film all the violence degradation death crime amoral behavior grace is still possible there might still be a god who doesn t judge us on merits
pulp fiction is full of homages to other movies
tarantino s characters writes gary groth inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of hollywood product
tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac he literally can t help himself two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film s highly intertextual style
many have assumed that the dance sequence at jack rabbit slim s was intended as a reference to travolta s star making performance as tony manero in the epochal saturday night fever tarantino however credits a scene in the jean luc godard film bande part with the inspiration
according to the filmmaker
everybody thinks that i wrote this scene just to have john travolta dancing
but the scene existed before john travolta was cast
but once he was cast it was like great
we get to see john dance
all the better my favorite musical sequences have always been in godard because they just come out of nowhere
it s so infectious so friendly
and the fact that it s not a musical but he s stopping the movie to have a musical sequence makes it all the more sweet
jerome charyn argues that beyond all the better travolta s presence is essential to the power of the scene and of the film
travolta s entire career becomes backstory the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor but still resides in our memory as the king of disco
we keep waiting for him to shed his paunch put on a white polyester suit and enter the odyssey club in bay ridge brooklyn where he will dance for us and never never stop
daniel day lewis couldn t have woken such a powerful longing in us
he isn t part of america s own mad cosmology
tony manero is an angel sitting on vince s shoulder
vince and mia s actual dance may be closer to the choreography of anna karina s shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends in bande part but even that reference is lost to us and we re with tony again
estella tincknell notes that while the diner setting seems to be a simulacrum of a fifties restaurant
the twist contest is a musical sequence which evokes the sixties while travolta s dance performance inevitably references the seventies and his appearance in saturday night fever
the past thus becomes a more general pastness in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment she also argues that in this passage the film briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classic film musical and in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion
the pivotal moment in which marsellus crosses the street in front of butch s car and notices him evokes the scene in which marion crane s boss sees her under similar circumstances in psycho
marsellus and butch are soon held captive by maynard and zed two sadistic honkies straight out of deliverance directed by john boorman
zed shares a name with sean connery s character in boorman s follow up the science fiction film zardoz
when butch decides to rescue marsellus in glyn white s words he finds a trove of items with film hero resonances
critics have identified these weapons with a range of possible allusions
hammer the toolbox murders
baseball bat walking tall the untouchables
chainsaw the texas chain saw massacre evil dead ii
katana samurai sword many including seven samurai the yakuza shogun assassin at the conclusion of the scene a portentous line of marsellus s echoes one from the crime drama charley varrick directed by another of tarantino s heroes don siegel the name of the character who speaks it there is maynard
david bell argues that far from going against the current of class stereotype this scene like deliverance mobilize s a certain construction of poor white country folk and particularly their sexualization
rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape in american movies stephen paul miller believes the pulp fiction scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes the buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in deliverance
the nineties film reduces seventies competition horror and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play a fiction a pulp fiction giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly in the end tarantino s use of parody is about repetition transgression and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history in groth s view the crucial difference is that in deliverance the rape created the film s central moral dilemma whereas in pulp fiction it was merely the single weirdest day of butch s life american me did it too tarantino observed
there s like three butt fucking scenes in american me
that s definitely the one to beat in that particular category
neil fulwood focuses on butch s weapon selection writing here tarantino s love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious as well as sending up his own reputation as an enfant terrible of movie violence
moreover the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder white asserts that the katana he finally and significantly selects identifies him with
honourable heroes conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that butch is rejecting
the traditional japanese sword in contrasts represents a culture with a well defined moral code and thus connects butch with a more meaningful approach to life
the biker film nam s angels is also shown with fabienne characterizing it as a motorcycle movie i m not sure the name
robert miklitsch argues that tarantino s telephilia may be more central to the guiding sensibility of pulp fiction than the filmmaker s love for rock n roll and even cinema
talking about his generation one that came of age in the s tarantino has commented that the number one thing we all shared wasn t music that was a sixties thing
our culture was television a random list of the tv programs referenced in pulp fiction confirms his observation speed racer clutch cargo the brady bunch the partridge family the avengers the three stooges the flintstones i spy green acres kung fu happy days and last but not least mia s fictional pilot fox force five
the above list with the possible exception of the avengers writes miklitsch suggests that pulp fiction has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant gardism of godard than with mainstream network programming jonathan rosenbaum had brought tv into his analysis of the tarantino godard comparison acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen but the differences between what godard likes and what tarantino likes and why are astronomical it s like comparing a combined museum library film archive record shop and department store with a jukebox a video rental outlet and an issue of tv guide
sharon willis focuses on the way a television show clutch cargo marks the beginning of and plays on through the scene between young butch and his father s comrade in arms
the vietnam war veteran is played by christopher walken whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized g i
in the vietnam war movie the deer hunter
willis writes that when captain koons enters the living room we see walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of s television and movie versions of ruined masculinity in search of rehabilitation
t he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze miklitsch asserts that for some critics the film is a prime example of the pernicious ooze like influence of mass culture exemplified by their b te noire tv kolker might not disagree arguing that pulp fiction is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television its homophobes thugs and perverts sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long take tableaux we watch laugh and remain with nothing to comprehend
the combination of the mysterious suitcase lock is the number of the beast
tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents it is simply a macguffin a pure plot device
originally the case was to contain diamonds but this was seen as too mundane
for filming purposes it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened
in a video interview with fellow director and friend robert rodriguez tarantino purportedly reveals the secret contents of the briefcase but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in tarantino and rodriguez s grindhouse with an intertitle that reads missing reel
the interview resumes with rodriguez discussing how radically the knowledge of the briefcase s contents alters one s understanding of the movie
despite tarantino s statements many solutions to what one scholar calls this unexplained postmodern puzzle have been proposed
a strong similarity has often been observed with robert aldrich s film noir kiss me deadly
that movie features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive
in their review of alex cox s film repo man in the daily telegraph nick cowen and hari patience suggest that pulp fiction may also owe a debt of inspiration to the glowing car trunk in that film
in scholar paul gormley s view this connection with kiss me deadly and a similar one with raiders of the lost ark makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself
the idea that the briefcase contains marsellus s soul gained popular currency in the mid s
analyzing the notion roger ebert dismissed it as nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the net
jules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage ezekiel before he executes someone
the passage is heard three times in the introductory sequence in which jules and vincent reclaim marsellus s briefcase from the doomed brett that same recitation a second time at the beginning of the bonnie situation which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence and in the epilogue at the diner
the first version of the passage is as follows
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother s keeper and the finder of lost children
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee the second version from the diner scene is identical except for the final line and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you
while the final two sentences of jules s speech are similar to the actual cited passage the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases
the text of ezekiel preceding verse indicates that god s wrath is retribution for the hostility of the philistines
in the king james version from which jules s speech is adapted ezekiel reads in its entirety
and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my vengeance upon them tarantino s primary inspiration for the speech was the work of japanese martial arts star sonny chiba
its text and its identification as ezekiel derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the chiba movie karate kiba the bodyguard where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator
the version seen at the beginning of the bodyguard is as follows
the path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother s keeper and the father of lost children
and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger who poison and destroy my brothers and they shall know that i am chiba the bodyguard when i shall lay my vengeance upon them in the s television series kage no gundan shadow warriors chiba s character would lecture the villain of the week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him
a killer delivers a similar biblical rant in modesty blaise the hardback but pulp style novel vincent is shown with in two scenes
two critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between jules s transformation and the issue of postmodernity
gormley argues that unlike the film s other major characters marsellus aside jules is
linked to a thing beyond postmodern simulation
t his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a baptist preacher spouting ezekiel because it was just a cool thing to say in his conversion jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation which in this case the film constructs as god
adele reinhartz writes that the depth of jules s transformation is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage in the first he is a majestic and awe inspiring figure proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self righteousness
in the second
he appears to be a different sort of man altogether
i n true postmodern fashion he reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation similar to gormley conard argues that as jules reflects on the passage it dawns on him that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life to conard this contrasts with the film s prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture
rosenbaum finds much less in jules s revelation t he spiritual awakening at the end of pulp fiction which jackson performs beautifully is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung fu movies
it may make you feel good but it certainly doesn t leave you any wiser
much of pulp fiction s action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet
to a lesser extent tarantino s other films also feature this narrative element
at jack rabbit slim s mia goes to powder her nose literally she snorts coke in the restroom surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping
butch and fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom he in the shower she brushing her teeth the next morning but just a few seconds later in screen time she is again brushing her teeth
as jules and vincent confront brett and two of his pals a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom his actions will lead to jules transformative moment of clarity
after marvin s absurd death vincent and jules wash up in jimmie s bathroom where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel
when the diner hold up turns into a mexican standoff honey bunny whines i gotta go pee
as described by peter and will brooker in three significant moments vincent retires to the bathroom and returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened the threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically and is realized in the third instance
vincent and jules s diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by vincent s bathroom break an armed robbery ensues while vincent is reading on the toilet
while vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with marsellus s wife mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine snorts it and overdoses
during a stakeout at butch s apartment vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by butch in the brookers analysis through vince
we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent transformed disastrously in the instant you are not looking fraiman finds it particularly significant that vincent is reading modesty blaise in two of these instances
she links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as the archetypal consumers of pulp
locating popular fiction in the bathroom tarantino reinforces its association with shit already suggested by the dictionary meanings of pulp that preface the movie moist shapeless matter also lurid stories on cheap paper
what we have then is a series of damaging associations pulp women shit that taint not only male producers of mass market fiction but also male consumers
perched on the toilet with his book vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes preoccupied by the anal he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by butch with a czech m submachine gun
that this fate has to do with vincent s reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub
willis reads pulp fiction in almost precisely the opposite direction finding its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold
this is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture especially the popular culture of one s childhood as is tarantino s wont as well as his stated aim despite that argues fraiman pulp fiction demonstrates
that even an open pulpophile like tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences
in november miramax filed a lawsuit against tarantino who released seven nfts based on uncut and unseen scenes of pulp fiction and including the original handwritten script revealing secrets about the film and its creator miramax claimed they own the film rights
however tarantino disputes the lawsuit and claims he has rights to the film script in written form
pulp fiction won eight major awards from a total of twenty six nominations including a best original screenplay win at the th academy awards
also in the balloting by the national society of film critics samuel l
jackson was the runner up in both the best actor and the best supporting actor categories
