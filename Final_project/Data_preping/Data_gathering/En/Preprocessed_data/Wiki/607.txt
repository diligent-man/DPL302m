absolute monarchs a history of the papacy is a book by the english popular historian john julius norwich published in the united states by random house
it was published slightly earlier in the uk by chatto windus under the title popes a history
it was introduced after norwich had progressively built his reputation with more than twenty previous published titles and received significant notice in the press
as indicated by its title this is a history of the popes from saint peter to pope benedict xvi
although primarily factual norwich enlivens the historical record by sharing commentary and indicating motivations for the parties decisions and actions
for example in treating charles martel norwich asks if he would stop the advance of the lombards and answers perhaps but he would not be hurried accordingly the reader is presented with the grand strategy and moral dilemmas of the times providing a sense of the drama present in every age
norwich comments that pope gregory i term was an administrator of genius an organizer and a missionary he was not and never could be an abstract thinker or theologian or even a politician further he was p ious but practical he intended the patrimony of peter to be a huge charitable fund at the immediate disposal of the church for the benefit of the poor every day twelve paupers shared his table
norwich also details the low points of the institution
in the mid th century the de facto ruler of rome and therefore the papacy was the ravishingly beautiful but sinister figure of marozia senatrix of rome pope john x who showed signs of acting independently was struck down in the lateran before his brother s eyes and later deposed and imprisoned in the castle sant angelo where he was soon afterward smothered to death with pillows apparently marozia hated him which may partly have been due to the fact that he had been her mother s lover marozia used her power to have her grandson installed as pope john xii
far from conforming to our modern image of the pope as a frail elderly man this twenty something gave female pilgrims to rome quite a different sort of papal audience by raping them
roughly years later in the selection of a new pope was bitterly divided between frederick i holy roman emperor and the cardinals
after the cardinals had chosen cardinal roland and at the point in the investiture ceremony where he bent his head to receive the scarlet mantle of the papacy
octavian an imperial partisan cardinal dived at him snatched the mantle and tried to don it himself he lost it in a scuffle but then his chaplain instantly produced another presumably brought along for just such an eventuality which octavian this time managed to put on unfortunately back to front before anyone could stop him after some further brouhaha octavian made a dash for the papal throne sat on it and proclaimed himself pope victor iv although the imperial forces present at the time in rome helped him maintain his claim for some months they had to head back to germany in the autumn before the alpine passes would be blocked by snow spelling the end for pope victor iv
there is a chapter on pope joan the woman who by legend having kept her gender a secret was elected pope in but became pregnant and gave delivery during a procession from old st
peter s basilica to the lateran in a narrow lane
norwich attributes this legend to a work by a dominican monk named martin further stating that i t is largely thanks to him that the legend of pope joan
has become one of the hoariest canards in papal history he writes regarding earlier authors referencing of pope joan that though their histories were written earlier all of the surviving copies comfortably postdate martin noting that many references are mutually inconsistent norwich states most of the rest echo martin s words so closely as to leave no doubt that they are using him as their authority the author further notes a letter from pope leo ix term to michael i cerularius the patriarch of constantinople stating god forbid that we wish to believe that
the church of constantinople
once raised a woman onto the seat of its pontiff
we regard this crime as
abominable and horrible
norwich then asks h ad leo ever heard of the existence of pope joan is it likely that he would have laid himself open to the patriarch s obvious retort
of pope innocent iii term norwich writes his complete confidence in himself together with a sense of humor rare in the middle ages made him patient simple and always approachable genuinely loved by those around him
of pope alexander vi term aka rodrigo borgia norwich asserts also referencing alexander s son cesare borgia t hanks to the two of them and in lesser measure daughter lucrezia the borgias have become a legend for villainy and cruelty but there was another side
speaking of the church norwich asserts t o survive with its independence intact it desperately needed adequate finance firm administration and astute diplomacy and these alexander was able to provide in full measure however questionable his means of doing so the author further notes m any of the accusations leveled against him could have been easily disproved had he bothered to do so by leaving them unanswered he contributed to his own unspeakable reputation
new york times reviewer bill keller states of norwich he keeps things moving at nearly beach read pace by being selective about where he lingers and by adopting the tone of an enthusiastic tour guide expert but less than reverent the reviewer noted that norwich has little to say about the theology of the popes and treats their doctrinal disputes as a diplomatic matter
los angeles times reviewer janet kinosian writes of norwich with his unstuffy and sometimes witty writing style he walks us through what could otherwise be a stifling couple of thousand years of popes antipopes endless political power struggles war greed torture inquisitions egomania incest fornication bastard children and orgies
