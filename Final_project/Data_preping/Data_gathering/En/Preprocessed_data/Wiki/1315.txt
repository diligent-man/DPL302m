The raven paradox also known as Hempel's paradox Hempel's ravens or rarely the paradox of indoor ornithology is a paradox arising from the question of what constitutes evidence for the truth of a statement Observing objects that are neither black nor ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though intuitively these observations are unrelated
This problem was proposed by the logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the s to illustrate a contradiction between inductive logic and intuition
Hempel describes the paradox in terms of the hypothesis
All ravens are black In the form of an implication this can be expressed as If something is a raven then it is blackVia contraposition this statement is equivalent to
If something is not black then it is not a ravenIn all circumstances where is true is also trueâ€”and likewise in all circumstances where is false ie if a world is imagined in which something that was not black yet was a raven existed is also false
Given a general statement such as all ravens are black a form of the same statement that refers to a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to constitute evidence for that general statement For example
My pet raven is blackis evidence supporting the hypothesis that all ravens are black
The paradox arises when this same process is applied to statement On sighting a green apple one can observe
This green apple is not black and it is not a ravenBy the same reasoning this statement is evidence that if something is not black then it is not a raven But since as above this statement is logically equivalent to all ravens are black it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black This conclusion seems paradoxical because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple
Nicod's criterion says that only observations of ravens should affect one's view as to whether all ravens are black Observing more instances of black ravens should support the view observing white or coloured ravens should contradict it and observations of non ravens should not have any influence
Hempel's equivalence condition states that when a proposition X provides evidence in favor of another proposition Y then X also provides evidence in favor of any proposition that is logically equivalent to Y
Realistically the set of ravens is finite The set of non black things is either infinite or beyond human enumeration To confirm the statement 'All ravens are black' it would be necessary to observe all ravens This is difficult but possible To confirm the statement 'All non black things are non ravens' it would be necessary to examine all non black things This is not possible Observing a black raven could be considered a finite amount of confirmatory evidence but observing a non black non raven would be an infinitesimal amount of evidence
The paradox shows that Nicod's criterion and Hempel's equivalence condition are not mutually consistent A resolution to the paradox must reject at least one out of
validation by positive instances NCA satisfactory resolution should also explain why there naively appears to be a paradox Solutions that accept the paradoxical conclusion can do this by presenting a proposition that we intuitively know to be false but that is easily confused with PC while solutions that reject EC or NC should present a proposition that we intuitively know to be true but that is easily confused with EC or NC
Although this conclusion of the paradox seems counter intuitive some approaches accept that observations of coloured non ravens can in fact constitute valid evidence in support for hypotheses about the universal blackness of ravens
Hempel himself accepted the paradoxical conclusion arguing that the reason the result appears paradoxical is that we possess prior information without which the observation of a non black non raven would indeed provide evidence that all ravens are black
He illustrates this with the example of the generalization All sodium salts burn yellow and asks us to consider the observation that occurs when somebody holds a piece of pure ice in a colorless flame that does not turn yellow
One of the most popular proposed resolutions is to accept the conclusion that the observation of a green apple provides evidence that all ravens are black but to argue that the amount of confirmation provided is very small due to the large discrepancy between the number of ravens and the number of non black objects According to this resolution the conclusion appears paradoxical because we intuitively estimate the amount of evidence provided by the observation of a green apple to be zero when it is in fact non zero but extremely small
I J Good's presentation of this argument in is perhaps the best known and variations of the argument have been popular ever since although it had been presented in and early forms of the argument appeared as early as
Good's argument involves calculating the weight of evidence provided by the observation of a black raven or a white shoe in favor of the hypothesis that all the ravens in a collection of objects are black The weight of evidence is the logarithm of the Bayes factor which in this case is simply the factor by which the odds of the hypothesis changes when the observation is made The argument goes as follows
objects that might be seen at any moment of which
non black ravens and suppose that the hypotheses
are initially equiprobable Then if we happen to see a black raven the Bayes factor in favour of
displaystyle tfrac rNBig textaveragelefttfrac r Ntfrac r N tfrac Nright = tfrac rr
ie about if the number of ravens in existence is known to be large But the factor if we see a white shoe is only
displaystyle tfrac N bNBig textaveragelefttfrac N b Ntfrac N b N maxtfrac N b rNright
displaystyle = frac N bmax leftN b tfrac r tfrac tfrac N b right
and this exceeds unity by only about
Thus the weight of evidence provided by the sight of a white shoe is positive but is small if the number of ravens is known to be small compared to the number of non black objectsMany of the proponents of this resolution and variants of it have been advocates of Bayesian probability and it is now commonly called the Bayesian Solution although as Chihara observes there is no such thing as the Bayesian solution There are many different 'solutions' that Bayesians have put forward using Bayesian techniques Noteworthy approaches using Bayesian techniques some of which accept PC and instead reject NC include Earman Eells Gibson Hosiasson Lindenbaum Howson and Urbach Mackie and Hintikka who claims that his approach is more Bayesian than the so called 'Bayesian solution' of the same paradox Bayesian approaches that make use of Carnap's theory of inductive inference include Humburg Maher and Fitelson Hawthorne Vranas introduced the term Standard Bayesian Solution to avoid confusion
Maher accepts the paradoxical conclusion and refines it
To reach ii he appeals to Carnap's theory of inductive probability which is from the Bayesian point of view a way of assigning prior probabilities that naturally implements induction According to Carnap's theory the posterior probability
is the number of objects that have been examined according to the available evidence
is the number of examined objects that turned out to have the predicate
is a constant that measures resistance to generalization
will be very close to one after a single observation of an object that turned out to have the predicate
regardless of the fraction of observed objects that had the predicate
Using this Carnapian approach Maher identifies a proposition we intuitively and correctly know is false but easily confuse with the paradoxical conclusion The proposition in question is that observing non ravens tells us about the color of ravens While this is intuitively false and is also false according to Carnap's theory of induction observing non ravens according to that same theory causes us to reduce our estimate of the total number of ravens and thereby reduces the estimated number of possible counterexamples to the rule that all ravens are black
Hence from the Bayesian Carnapian point of view the observation of a non raven does not tell us anything about the color of ravens but it tells us about the prevalence of ravens and supports All ravens are black by reducing our estimate of the number of ravens that might not be black
Much of the discussion of the paradox in general and the Bayesian approach in particular has centred on the relevance of background knowledge Surprisingly Maher shows that for a large class of possible configurations of background knowledge the observation of a non black non raven provides exactly the same amount of confirmation as the observation of a black raven The configurations of background knowledge that he considers are those that are provided by a sample proposition namely a proposition that is a conjunction of atomic propositions each of which ascribes a single predicate to a single individual with no two atomic propositions involving the same individual Thus a proposition of the form A is a black raven and B is a white shoe can be considered a sample proposition by taking black raven and white shoe to be predicates
Maher's proof appears to contradict the result of the Bayesian argument which was that the observation of a non black non raven provides much less evidence than the observation of a black raven The reason is that the background knowledge that Good and others use can not be expressed in the form of a sample proposition in particular variants of the standard Bayesian approach often suppose as Good did in the argument quoted above that the total numbers of ravens non black objects andor the total number of objects are known quantities Maher comments that The reason we think there are more non black things than ravens is because that has been true of the things we have observed to date Evidence of this kind can be represented by a sample proposition But given any sample proposition as background evidence a non black non raven confirms A just as strongly as a black raven does Thus my analysis suggests that this response to the paradox ie the Standard Bayesian one cannot be correct
Fitelson Hawthorne examined the conditions under which the observation of a non black non raven provides less evidence than the observation of a black raven They show that if
is the proposition that the object is black and
is the proposition that the object is a raven then the condition
displaystyle frac Poverline Baoverline HPRaoverline H Poverline BaRaoverline H geq PBaRaoverline Hfrac Poverline BaHPRaH
is sufficient for the observation of a non black non raven to provide less evidence than the observation of a black raven Here a line over a proposition indicates the logical negation of that proposition
This condition does not tell us how large the difference in the evidence provided is but a later calculation in the same paper shows that the weight of evidence provided by a black raven exceeds that provided by a non black non raven by about
This is equal to the amount of additional information in bits if the base of the logarithm is that is provided when a raven of unknown color is discovered to be black given the hypothesis that not all ravens are black
is somewhere around or Thus it may appear that a single instance of a black raven does not yield much more support than would a non black non raven However under plausible conditions it can be shown that a sequence of
instances ie of n black ravens as compared to n non black non ravens yields a ratio of likelihood ratios on the order of
The authors point out that their analysis is completely consistent with the supposition that a non black non raven provides an extremely small amount of evidence although they do not attempt to prove it they merely calculate the difference between the amount of evidence that a black raven provides and the amount of evidence that a non black non raven provides
Some approaches for resolving the paradox focus on the inductive step They dispute whether observation of a particular instance such as one black raven is the kind of evidence that necessarily increases confidence in the general hypothesis such as that ravens are always black
Good gives an example of background knowledge with respect to which the observation of a black raven decreases the probability that all ravens are black
Suppose that we know we are in one or other of two worlds and the hypothesis H under consideration is that all the ravens in our world are black We know in advance that in one world there are a hundred black ravens no non black ravens and a million other birds and that in the other world there are a thousand black ravens one white raven and a million other birds A bird is selected equiprobably at random from all the birds in our world It turns out to be a black raven This is strong evidence that we are in the second world wherein not all ravens are blackGood concludes that the white shoe is a red herring Sometimes even a black raven can constitute evidence against the hypothesis that all ravens are black so the fact that the observation of a white shoe can support it is not surprising and not worth attention Nicod's criterion is false according to Good and so the paradoxical conclusion does not follow
Hempel rejected this as a solution to the paradox insisting that the proposition 'c is a raven and is black' must be considered by itself and without reference to any other information and pointing out that it was emphasized in section b of my article in Mind that the very appearance of paradoxicality in cases like that of the white shoe results in part from a failure to observe this maxim
The question that then arises is whether the paradox is to be understood in the context of absolutely no background information as Hempel suggests or in the context of the background information that we actually possess regarding ravens and black objects or with regard to all possible configurations of background information
Good had shown that for some configurations of background knowledge Nicod's criterion is false provided that we are willing to equate inductively support with increase the probability of see below The possibility remained that with respect to our actual configuration of knowledge which is very different from Good's example Nicod's criterion might still be true and so we could still reach the paradoxical conclusion Hempel on the other hand insists our background knowledge itself is the red herring and that we should consider induction with respect to a condition of perfect ignorance
In his proposed resolution Maher implicitly made use of the fact that the proposition All ravens are black is highly probable when it is highly probable that there are no ravens Good had used this fact before to respond to Hempel's insistence that Nicod's criterion was to be understood to hold in the absence of background information
imagine an infinitely intelligent newborn baby having built in neural circuits enabling him to deal with formal logic English syntax and subjective probability He might now argue after defining a raven in detail that it is extremely unlikely that there are any ravens and therefore it is extremely likely that all ravens are black that is that
is true 'On the other hand' he goes on to argue 'if there are ravens then there is a reasonable chance that they are of a variety of colours Therefore if I were to discover that even a black raven exists I would consider
to be less probable than it was initially'This according to Good is as close as one can reasonably expect to get to a condition of perfect ignorance and it appears that Nicod's condition is still false Maher made Good's argument more precise by using Carnap's theory of induction to formalize the notion that if there is one raven then it is likely that there are many
Maher's argument considers a universe of exactly two objects each of which is very unlikely to be a raven a one in a thousand chance and reasonably unlikely to be black a one in ten chance Using Carnap's formula for induction he finds that the probability that all ravens are black decreases from to when it is discovered that one of the two objects is a black raven
Maher concludes that not only is the paradoxical conclusion true but that Nicod's criterion is false in the absence of background knowledge except for the knowledge that the number of objects in the universe is two and that ravens are less likely than black things
Quine argued that the solution to the paradox lies in the recognition that certain predicates which he called natural kinds have a distinguished status with respect to induction This can be illustrated with Nelson Goodman's example of the predicate grue An object is grue if it is blue before say and green afterwards Clearly we expect objects that were blue before to remain blue afterwards but we do not expect the objects that were found to be grue before to be blue after since after they would be green Quine's explanation is that blue is a natural kind a privileged predicate we can use for induction while grue is not a natural kind and using induction with it leads to error
This suggests a resolution to the paradox Nicod's criterion is true for natural kinds such as blue and black but is false for artificially contrived predicates such as grue or non raven The paradox arises according to this resolution because we implicitly interpret Nicod's criterion as applying to all predicates when in fact it only applies to natural kinds
Another approach which favours specific predicates over others was taken by Hintikka Hintikka was motivated to find a Bayesian approach to the paradox that did not make use of knowledge about the relative frequencies of ravens and black things Arguments concerning relative frequencies he contends cannot always account for the perceived irrelevance of evidence consisting of observations of objects of type A for the purposes of learning about objects of type not A
His argument can be illustrated by rephrasing the paradox using predicates other than raven and black For example All men
are tall is equivalent to All short people are women and so observing that a randomly selected person is a short woman should provide evidence that all men are tall Despite the fact that we lack background knowledge to indicate that there are dramatically fewer men than short people we still find ourselves inclined to reject the conclusion Hintikka's example is a generalization like 'no material bodies are infinitely divisible' seems to be completely unaffected by questions concerning immaterial entities independently of what one thinks of the relative frequencies of material and immaterial entities in one's universe of discourse
His solution is to introduce an order into the set of predicates When the logical system is equipped with this order it is possible to restrict the scope of a generalization such as All ravens are black so that it applies to ravens only and not to non black things since the order privileges ravens over non black things As he puts it
If we are justified in assuming that the scope of the generalization 'All ravens are black' can be restricted to ravens then this means that we have some outside information which we can rely on concerning the factual situation The paradox arises from the fact that this information which colors our spontaneous view of the situation is not incorporated in the usual treatments of the inductive situationSome approaches for the resolution of the paradox reject Hempel's equivalence condition That is they may not consider evidence supporting the statement all non black objects are non ravens to necessarily support logically equivalent statements such as all ravens are black
Scheffler and Goodman took an approach to the paradox that incorporates Karl Popper's view that scientific hypotheses are never really confirmed only falsified
The approach begins by noting that the observation of a black raven does not prove that All ravens are black but it falsifies the contrary hypothesis No ravens are black A non black non raven on the other hand is consistent with both All ravens are black and with No ravens are black As the authors put it
the statement that all ravens are black is not merely satisfied by evidence of a black raven but is favored by such evidence since a black raven disconfirms the contrary statement that all ravens are not black ie satisfies its denial A black raven in other words satisfies the hypothesis that all ravens are black rather than not it thus selectively confirms that all ravens are blackSelective confirmation violates the equivalence condition since a black raven selectively confirms All ravens are black but not All non black things are non ravens
Scheffler and Goodman's concept of selective confirmation is an example of an interpretation of provides evidence in favor of which does not coincide with increase the probability of This must be a general feature of all resolutions that reject the equivalence condition since logically equivalent propositions must always have the same probability
It is impossible for the observation of a black raven to increase the probability of the proposition All ravens are black without causing exactly the same change to the probability that All non black things are non ravens If an observation inductively supports the former but not the latter then inductively support must refer to something other than changes in the probabilities of propositions A possible loophole is to interpret All as Nearly all Nearly all ravens are black is not equivalent to Nearly all non black things are non ravens and these propositions can have very different probabilities
This raises the broader question of the relation of probability theory to inductive reasoning Karl Popper argued that probability theory alone cannot account for induction His argument involves splitting a hypothesis
into a part that is deductively entailed by the evidence
and another part This can be done in two ways
displaystyle H=A and B E=B and C
and so on The condition that is necessary for such a splitting of H and E to be possible is
displaystyle H=H or E and H or overline E
which as Popper says is the logically strongest part of
in this case provide any support for the factor
The answer is No It never does Indeed
which are possibilities of no interest This result is completely devastating to the inductive interpretation of the calculus of probability All probabilistic support is purely deductive that part of a hypothesis that is not deductively entailed by the evidence is always strongly countersupported by the evidence There is such a thing as probabilistic support there might even be such a thing as inductive support though we hardly think so But the calculus of probability reveals that probabilistic support cannot be inductive supportThe orthodox Neyman Pearson theory of hypothesis testing considers how to decide whether to accept or reject a hypothesis rather than what probability to assign to the hypothesis From this point of view the hypothesis that All ravens are black is not accepted gradually as its probability increases towards one when more and more observations are made but is accepted in a single action as the result of evaluating the data that has already been collected As Neyman and Pearson put it
Without hoping to know whether each separate hypothesis is true or false we may search for rules to govern our behaviour with regard to them in following which we insure that in the long run of experience we shall not be too often wrongAccording to this approach it is not necessary to assign any value to the probability of a hypothesis although one must certainly take into account the probability of the data given the hypothesis or given a competing hypothesis when deciding whether to accept or to reject The acceptance or rejection of a hypothesis carries with it the risk of error
This contrasts with the Bayesian approach which requires that the hypothesis be assigned a prior probability which is revised in the light of the observed data to obtain the final probability of the hypothesis Within the Bayesian framework there is no risk of error since hypotheses are not accepted or rejected instead they are assigned probabilities
An analysis of the paradox from the orthodox point of view has been performed and leads to among other insights a rejection of the equivalence condition
It seems obvious that one cannot both accept the hypothesis that all P's are Q and also reject the contrapositive ie that all non Q's are non P Yet it is easy to see that on the Neyman Pearson theory of testing a test of All P's are Q is not necessarily a test of All non Q's are non P or vice versa A test of All P's are Q requires reference to some alternative statistical hypothesis of the form
whereas a test of All non Q's are non P requires reference to some statistical alternative of the form
But these two sets of possible alternatives are different Thus one could have a test of
without having a test of its contrapositiveThe following propositions all imply one another Every object is either black or not a raven Every raven is black and Every non black object is a non raven They are therefore by definition logically equivalent However the three propositions have different domains the first proposition says something about every object while the second says something about every raven
The first proposition is the only one whose domain of quantification is unrestricted all objects so this is the only one that can be expressed in first order logic It is logically equivalent to
displaystyle forall xoverline Bx rightarrow overline Rx
indicates the material conditional according to which If
It has been argued by several authors that material implication does not fully capture the meaning of If
see the paradoxes of material implication For every object
is either black or not a raven is true when there are no ravens It is because of this that All ravens are black is regarded as true when there are no ravens Furthermore the arguments that Good and Maher used to criticize Nicod's criterion see Â§ Good's baby above relied on this fact that All ravens are black is highly probable when it is highly probable that there are no ravens
To say that all ravens are black in the absence of any ravens is an empty statement It refers to nothing All ravens are white is equally relevant and true if this statement is considered to have any truth or relevance
Some approaches to the paradox have sought to find other ways of interpreting If
which would eliminate the perceived equivalence between All ravens are black and All non black things are non ravens
One such approach involves introducing a many valued logic according to which If
is false In such a system contraposition is not automatically allowed If
Consequently All ravens are black is not equivalent to All non black things are non ravens
In this system when contraposition occurs the modality of the conditional involved changes from the indicative If that piece of butter has been heated to Â°C then it has melted to the counterfactual If that piece of butter had been heated to Â°C then it would have melted According to this argument this removes the alleged equivalence that is necessary to conclude that yellow cows can inform us about ravens
In proper grammatical usage a contrapositive argument ought not to be stated entirely in the indicative ThusFrom the fact that if this match is scratched it will light it follows that if it does not light it was not scratchedis awkward We should sayFrom the fact that if this match is scratched it will light it follows that if it were not to light it would not have been scratched One might wonder what effect this interpretation of the Law of Contraposition has on Hempel's paradox of confirmation If
would not be a raven Therefore whatever confirms the latter should also by the Equivalence Condition confirm the former True but yellow cows still cannot figure into the confirmation of All ravens are black because in science confirmation is accomplished by prediction and predictions are properly stated in the indicative mood It is senseless to ask what confirms a counterfactualSeveral commentators have observed that the propositions All ravens are black and All non black things are non ravens suggest different procedures for testing the hypotheses Eg Good writes
As propositions the two statements are logically equivalent But they have a different psychological effect on the experimenter If he is asked to test whether all ravens are black he will look for a raven and then decide whether it is black But if he is asked to test whether all non black things are non ravens he may look for a non black object and then decide whether it is a ravenMore recently it has been suggested that All ravens are black and All non black things are non ravens can have different effects when accepted The argument considers situations in which the total numbers or prevalences of ravens and black objects are unknown but estimated When the hypothesis All ravens are black is accepted according to the argument the estimated number of black objects increases while the estimated number of ravens does not change
It can be illustrated by considering the situation of two people who have identical information regarding ravens and black objects and who have identical estimates of the numbers of ravens and black objects For concreteness suppose that there are objects overall and according to the information available to the people involved each object is just as likely to be a non raven as it is to be a raven and just as likely to be black as it is to be non black
and so on Then the estimated number of ravens is the estimated number of black things is the estimated number of black ravens is and the estimated number of non black ravens counterexamples to the hypotheses is
One of the people performs a statistical test eg a Neyman Pearson test or the comparison of the accumulated weight of evidence to a threshold of the hypothesis that All ravens are black while the other tests the hypothesis that All non black objects
are non ravens For simplicity suppose that the evidence used for the test has nothing to do with the collection of objects dealt with here If the first person accepts the hypothesis that All ravens are black then according to the argument about objects whose colors were previously in doubt the ravens are now thought to be black while nothing different is thought about the remaining objects the non ravens Consequently he should estimate the number of black ravens at the number of black non ravens at and the number of non black non ravens at By specifying these changes this argument explicitly restricts the domain of All ravens are black to ravens
On the other hand if the second person accepts the hypothesis that All non black objects are non ravens then the approximately non black objects about which it was uncertain whether each was a raven will be thought to be non ravens At the same time nothing different will be thought about the approximately remaining objects the black objects Consequently he should estimate the number of black ravens at the number of black non ravens at and the number of non black non ravens at According to this argument since the two people disagree about their estimates after they have accepted the different hypotheses accepting All ravens are black is not equivalent to accepting All non black things are non ravens accepting the former means estimating more things to be black while accepting the latter involves estimating more things to be non ravens Correspondingly the argument goes the former requires as evidence ravens that turn out to be black and the latter requires non black things that turn out to be non ravens
A number of authors have argued that propositions of the form All
presuppose that there are objects that are
This analysis has been applied to the raven paradox
All nonblack things are nonravens are not strictly equivalent due to their different existential presuppositions Moreover although
describe the same regularity the nonexistence of nonblack ravens they have different logical forms The two hypotheses have different senses and incorporate different procedures for testing the regularity they describeA modified logic can take account of existential presuppositions using the presuppositional operator '' For example
can denote All ravens are black while indicating that it is ravens and not non black objects which are presupposed to exist in this example
the logical form of each hypothesis distinguishes it with respect to its recommended type of supporting evidence the possibly true substitution instances of each hypothesis relate to different types of objects The fact that the two hypotheses incorporate different kinds of testing procedures is expressed in the formal language by prefixing the operator '' to a different predicate The presuppositional operator thus serves as a relevance operator as well It is prefixed to the predicate '
because the objects relevant to the testing procedure incorporated in All raven are black include only ravens it is prefixed to the predicate '
because the objects relevant to the testing procedure incorporated in All nonblack things are nonravens include only nonblack things Using Fregean terms whenever their presuppositions hold the two hypotheses have the same referent truth value but different senses that is they express two different ways to determine that truth valueAssociation fallacy
