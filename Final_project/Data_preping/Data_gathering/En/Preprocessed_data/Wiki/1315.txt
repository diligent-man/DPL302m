raven paradox also known hempel's paradox hempel's raven rarely paradox indoor ornithology paradox arising question constitutes evidence truth statement
observing object neither black raven may formally increase likelihood raven black even though intuitively observation unrelated
problem wa proposed logician carl gustav hempel illustrate contradiction inductive logic intuition
form implication expressed something raven blackvia contraposition statement equivalent to
something black ravenin circumstance true also trueand likewise circumstance false ie world imagined something wa black yet wa raven existed also false
given general statement raven black form statement refers specific observable instance general class would typically considered constitute evidence general statement
pet raven blackis evidence supporting hypothesis raven black
green apple black ravenby reasoning statement evidence something black raven
since statement logically equivalent raven black follows sight green apple evidence supporting notion raven black
conclusion seems paradoxical implies information ha gained raven looking apple
nicod's criterion say observation raven affect one's view whether raven black
observing instance black raven support view observing white coloured raven contradict observation non-ravens influence
hempel's equivalence condition state proposition x provides evidence favor another proposition x also provides evidence favor proposition logically equivalent y
set non-black thing either infinite beyond human enumeration
confirm statement 'all raven black' would necessary observe ravens
confirm statement 'all non-black thing non-ravens' would necessary examine non-black things
observing black raven could considered finite amount confirmatory evidence observing non-black non-raven would infinitesimal amount evidence
paradox show nicod's criterion hempel's equivalence condition mutually consistent
validation positive instance nca satisfactory resolution also explain naively appears paradox
solution accept paradoxical conclusion presenting proposition intuitively know false easily confused pc solution reject ec nc present proposition intuitively know true easily confused ec nc
although conclusion paradox seems counter-intuitive approach accept observation coloured non-ravens fact constitute valid evidence support hypothesis universal blackness ravens
hempel accepted paradoxical conclusion arguing reason result appears paradoxical posse prior information without observation non-black non-raven would indeed provide evidence raven black
illustrates example generalization sodium salt burn yellow asks u consider observation occurs somebody hold piece pure ice colorless flame doe turn yellow
one popular proposed resolution accept conclusion observation green apple provides evidence raven black argue amount confirmation provided small due large discrepancy number raven number non-black objects
according resolution conclusion appears paradoxical intuitively estimate amount evidence provided observation green apple zero fact non-zero extremely small
good's presentation argument perhaps best known variation argument popular ever since although presented early form argument appeared early as
good's argument involves calculating weight evidence provided observation black raven white shoe favor hypothesis raven collection object black
weight evidence logarithm bayes factor case simply factor odds hypothesis change observation made
happen see black raven bayes factor favour of
displaystyle tfrac rnbig textaveragelefttfrac r-ntfrac r-n tfrac nright tfrac rr-
displaystyle tfrac n-bnbig textaveragelefttfrac n-b-ntfrac n-b-n maxtfrac n-b-rnright
displaystyle frac n-bmax leftn-b-tfrac r tfrac tfrac n-b-right
thus weight evidence provided sight white shoe positive small number raven known small compared number non-black objectsmany proponent resolution variant advocate bayesian probability commonly called bayesian solution although chihara observes thing bayesian solution
many different 'solutions' bayesians put forward using bayesian technique noteworthy approach using bayesian technique accept pc instead reject nc include earman eells gibson hosiasson-lindenbaum howson urbach mackie hintikka claim approach bayesian so-called 'bayesian solution' paradox
bayesian approach make use carnap's theory inductive inference include humburg maher fitelson hawthorne
vranas introduced term standard bayesian solution avoid confusion
reach ii appeal carnap's theory inductive probability bayesian point view way assigning prior probability naturally implement induction
using carnapian approach maher identifies proposition intuitively correctly know false easily confuse paradoxical conclusion
proposition question observing non-ravens tell u color ravens
intuitively false also false according carnap's theory induction observing non-ravens according theory cause u reduce estimate total number raven thereby reduces estimated number possible counterexample rule raven black
hence bayesian-carnapian point view observation non-raven doe tell u anything color raven tell u prevalence raven support raven black reducing estimate number raven might black
much discussion paradox general bayesian approach particular ha centred relevance background knowledge
surprisingly maher show large class possible configuration background knowledge observation non-black non-raven provides exactly amount confirmation observation black raven
configuration background knowledge considers provided sample proposition namely proposition conjunction atomic proposition ascribes single predicate single individual two atomic proposition involving individual
thus proposition form black raven b white shoe considered sample proposition taking black raven white shoe predicates
maher's proof appears contradict result bayesian argument wa observation non-black non-raven provides much le evidence observation black raven
reason background knowledge good others use expressed form sample proposition particular variant standard bayesian approach often suppose good argument quoted total number raven non-black object andor total number object known quantities
maher comment reason think non-black thing raven ha true thing observed date
given sample proposition background evidence non-black non-raven confirms strongly black raven does
fitelson hawthorne examined condition observation non-black non-raven provides le evidence observation black raven
displaystyle frac poverline baoverline hpraoverline h poverline baraoverline h geq pbaraoverline hfrac poverline bahprah
sufficient observation non-black non-raven provide le evidence observation black raven
condition doe tell u large difference evidence provided later calculation paper show weight evidence provided black raven exceeds provided non-black non-raven about
equal amount additional information bit base logarithm provided raven unknown color discovered black given hypothesis raven black
thus may appear single instance black raven doe yield much support would non-black non-raven
n black raven compared n non-black non-ravens yield ratio likelihood ratio order of
author point analysis completely consistent supposition non-black non-raven provides extremely small amount evidence although attempt prove merely calculate difference amount evidence black raven provides amount evidence non-black non-raven provides
dispute whether observation particular instance one black raven kind evidence necessarily increase confidence general hypothesis raven always black
good give example background knowledge respect observation black raven decrease probability raven black
suppose know one two world hypothesis h consideration raven world black
know advance one world hundred black raven non-black raven million bird world thousand black raven one white raven million birds
second world wherein raven blackgood concludes white shoe red herring sometimes even black raven constitute evidence hypothesis raven black fact observation white shoe support surprising worth attention
nicod's criterion false according good paradoxical conclusion doe follow
hempel rejected solution paradox insisting proposition 'c raven black' must considered without reference information pointing it
appearance paradoxicality case like white shoe result part failure observe maxim
question arises whether paradox understood context absolutely background information hempel suggests context background information actually posse regarding raven black object regard possible configuration background information
good shown configuration background knowledge nicod's criterion false provided willing equate inductively support increase probability see below
possibility remained respect actual configuration knowledge different good's example nicod's criterion might still true could still reach paradoxical conclusion
hempel hand insists background knowledge red herring consider induction respect condition perfect ignorance
proposed resolution maher implicitly made use fact proposition raven black highly probable highly probable ravens
good used fact respond hempel's insistence nicod's criterion wa understood hold absence background information
imagine infinitely intelligent newborn baby built-in neural circuit enabling deal formal logic english syntax subjective probability
might argue defining raven detail extremely unlikely raven therefore extremely likely raven black that
'on hand' go argue 'if raven reasonable chance variety colours
therefore discover even black raven exists would consider
le probable wa initially'this according good close one reasonably expect get condition perfect ignorance appears nicod's condition still false
maher made good's argument precise using carnap's theory induction formalize notion one raven likely many
maher's argument considers universe exactly two object unlikely raven one thousand chance reasonably unlikely black one ten chance
using carnap's formula induction find probability raven black decrease discovered one two object black raven
maher concludes paradoxical conclusion true nicod's criterion false absence background knowledge except knowledge number object universe two raven le likely black things
quine argued solution paradox lie recognition certain predicate called natural kind distinguished status respect induction
clearly expect object blue remain blue afterwards expect object found grue blue since would green
quine's explanation blue natural kind privileged predicate use induction grue natural kind using induction lead error
suggests resolution paradox nicod's criterion true natural kind blue black false artificially contrived predicate grue non-raven
paradox arises according resolution implicitly interpret nicod's criterion applying predicate fact applies natural kinds
another approach favour specific predicate others wa taken hintikka
hintikka wa motivated find bayesian approach paradox make use knowledge relative frequency raven black things
argument concerning relative frequency contends cannot always account perceived irrelevance evidence consisting observation object type purpose learning object type not-a
argument illustrated rephrasing paradox using predicate raven black
tall equivalent short people woman observing randomly selected person short woman provide evidence men tall
despite fact lack background knowledge indicate dramatically fewer men short people still find inclined reject conclusion
generalization like 'no material body infinitely divisible' seems completely unaffected question concerning immaterial entity independently one think relative frequency material immaterial entity one's universe discourse
logical system equipped order possible restrict scope generalization raven black applies raven non-black thing since order privilege raven non-black things
justified assuming scope generalization 'all raven black' restricted raven mean outside information rely concerning factual situation
paradox arises fact information color spontaneous view situation incorporated usual treatment inductive situationsome approach resolution paradox reject hempel's equivalence condition
may consider evidence supporting statement non-black object non-ravens necessarily support logically-equivalent statement raven black
scheffler goodman took approach paradox incorporates karl popper's view scientific hypothesis never really confirmed falsified
approach begin noting observation black raven doe prove raven black falsifies contrary hypothesis raven black
non-black non-raven hand consistent raven black raven black
statement raven black merely satisfied evidence black raven favored evidence since black raven disconfirms contrary statement raven black ie
black raven word satisfies hypothesis raven black rather thus selectively confirms raven blackselective confirmation violates equivalence condition since black raven selectively confirms raven black non-black thing non-ravens
scheffler goodman's concept selective confirmation example interpretation provides evidence favor doe coincide increase probability must general feature resolution reject equivalence condition since logically equivalent proposition must always probability
impossible observation black raven increase probability proposition raven black without causing exactly change probability non-black thing non-ravens
observation inductively support former latter inductively support must refer something change probability propositions
possible loophole interpret nearly nearly raven black equivalent nearly non-black thing non-ravens proposition different probabilities
raise broader question relation probability theory inductive reasoning
karl popper argued probability theory alone cannot account induction
probabilistic support purely deductive part hypothesis deductively entailed evidence always strongly countersupported evidence
thing probabilistic support might even thing inductive support though hardly think so
calculus probability reveals probabilistic support cannot inductive supportthe orthodox neyman-pearson theory hypothesis testing considers decide whether accept reject hypothesis rather probability assign hypothesis
point view hypothesis raven black accepted gradually probability increase towards one observation made accepted single action result evaluating data ha already collected
without hoping know whether separate hypothesis true false may search rule govern behaviour regard following insure long run experience shall often wrongaccording approach necessary assign value probability hypothesis although one must certainly take account probability data given hypothesis given competing
contrast bayesian approach requires hypothesis assigned prior probability revised light observed data obtain final probability hypothesis
within bayesian framework risk error since hypothesis accepted rejected instead assigned probabilities
analysis paradox orthodox point view ha performed lead among insight rejection equivalence condition
seems obvious one cannot accept hypothesis p's q also reject contrapositive ie
yet easy see neyman-pearson theory testing test p's q necessarily test non-q's non-p vice versa
test p's q requires reference alternative statistical hypothesis form
whereas test non-q's non-p requires reference statistical alternative form
without test contrapositivethe following proposition imply one another every object either black raven every raven black every non-black object non-raven therefore definition logically equivalent
however three proposition different domain first proposition say something every object second say something every raven
first proposition one whose domain quantification unrestricted object one expressed first-order logic
ha argued several author material implication doe fully capture meaning if
furthermore argument good maher used criticize nicod's criterion see good's baby relied fact raven black highly probable highly probable ravens
raven white equally relevant true statement considered truth relevance
would eliminate perceived equivalence raven black non-black thing non-ravens
one approach involves introducing many-valued logic according if
system contraposition occurs modality conditional involved change indicative piece butter ha heated c ha melted counterfactual piece butter heated c would melted
according argument remove alleged equivalence necessary conclude yellow cow inform u ravens
proper grammatical usage contrapositive argument ought stated entirely indicative
thusfrom fact match scratched light follows doe light wa scratchedis awkward
sayfrom fact match scratched light follows light would scratched one might wonder effect interpretation law contraposition ha hempel's paradox confirmation
therefore whatever confirms latter also equivalence condition confirm former
true yellow cow still cannot figure confirmation raven black science confirmation accomplished prediction prediction properly stated indicative mood
senseless ask confirms counterfactualseveral commentator observed proposition raven black non-black thing non-ravens suggest different procedure testing hypotheses
asked test whether raven black look raven decide whether black
asked test whether non-black thing non-ravens may look non-black object decide whether ravenmore recently ha suggested raven black non-black thing non-ravens different effect accepted
argument considers situation total number prevalence raven black object unknown estimated
hypothesis raven black accepted according argument estimated number black object increase estimated number raven doe change
illustrated considering situation two people identical information regarding raven black object identical estimate number raven black objects
concreteness suppose object overall according information available people involved object likely non-raven raven likely black non-black
estimated number raven estimated number black thing estimated number black raven estimated number non-black raven counterexample hypothesis is
neyman-pearson test comparison accumulated weight evidence threshold hypothesis raven black test hypothesis non-black objects
simplicity suppose evidence used test ha nothing collection object dealt here
first person accepts hypothesis raven black according argument object whose color previously doubt raven thought black nothing different thought remaining object non-ravens
consequently estimate number black raven number black non-ravens number non-black non-ravens at
specifying change argument explicitly restricts domain raven black ravens
hand second person accepts hypothesis non-black object non-ravens approximately non-black object wa uncertain whether wa raven thought non-ravens
time nothing different thought approximately remaining object black objects
consequently estimate number black raven number black non-ravens number non-black non-ravens at
according argument since two people disagree estimate accepted different hypothesis accepting raven black equivalent accepting non-black thing non-ravens accepting former mean estimating thing black accepting latter involves estimating thing non-ravens
correspondingly argument go former requires evidence raven turn black latter requires non-black thing turn non-ravens
describe regularity nonexistence nonblack raven different logical forms
two hypothesis different sens incorporate different procedure testing regularity describea modified logic take account existential presupposition using presuppositional operator ''
denote raven black indicating raven non-black object presupposed exist example
logical form hypothesis distinguishes respect recommended type supporting evidence possibly true substitution instance hypothesis relate different type objects
fact two hypothesis incorporate different kind testing procedure expressed formal language prefixing operator '' different predicate
object relevant testing procedure incorporated raven black include raven prefixed predicate '
