multiple sclerosis also known encephalomyelitis disseminata common demyelinating disease insulating cover nerve cell brain spinal cord damaged
damage disrupts ability part nervous system transmit signal resulting range sign symptom including physical mental sometimes psychiatric problems
specific symptom include double vision blindness one eye muscle weakness trouble sensation coordination
take several form new symptom either occurring isolated attack relapsing form building time progressive forms
attack symptom may disappear completely although permanent neurological problem often remain especially disease advances
cause unclear underlying mechanism thought either destruction immune system failure myelin-producing cells
proposed cause include genetics environmental factor viral infections
usually diagnosed based presenting sign symptom result supporting medical tests
treatment attempt improve function attack prevent new attacks
medication used treat modestly effective side effect poorly tolerated
