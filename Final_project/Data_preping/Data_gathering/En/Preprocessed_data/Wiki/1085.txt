Ng be Bugl Spanish o e u le is the largest and most populous of Panama's five comarcas ind genas It was created in from lands formerly belonging to the provinces of Bocas del Toro Chiriqu and Veraguas The capital is known as Bu biti in Guaym and Llano Tugr in Spanish
Ng be Bugl Comarca is sub divided into sub regions districts and corregimientos
Starting in the Panamanian government was required to establish comarcas demarcated regions in which indigenous groups possess exclusive land rights and considerable administrative autonomy Within comarcas people elect a General assembly governor and any number of regional and local leaders although the government still controls public expenditure and tax revenues within the territory The comarca Ng be Bugl located in north western Panama was formed in both as a latent result of government promise and of considerable political pressure from the Ng be Bugl united by threats of natural resource exploitation and environmental degradation on their ancestral lands The territory is made up of land previously belonging to the provinces of Bocas del Toro Chiriqu and Veraguas and divided into seven districts listed above with capitals the capital of the entire comarca is B bti located in the M na district As the Ng be Bugl population tends to identify more with their communities than with an ethnicity and is distributed rather unevenly the political organization that prompted the formation of their comarca is fairly unusual but nonetheless demonstrates a powerful capacity to influence government actions
Ng be Bugl comarca is characterized by mountainous terrain steep slopes and generally nutrient poor soil with high rock content all characteristics that make farming difficult On the Caribbean slope there is no dry season and tropical forest dominates the landscape on the Pacific slope there is a windy dry season December to April and a wet season As a result of greater seasonal variation there are more localized geographies on the Pacific slope and vegetation consists of grasses mixed with tropical forest cover Small perennial streams and larger rivers run on both sides of the continental divide and are used for bathing laundry and drinking In the region most travel is done on foot or horseback as there are few year round access roads leading into the comarca the first ever starting out as a mine access road that runs up to Bu bti and continues to Escopeta the location of the Cerro Colorado mine from San Felix a city connected to the interamericana highway via Las Cruces
Although closely associated and collectively referred to as the Guaym the Ng be and Bugl are two separate linguistic indigenous groups whose languages are mutually unintelligible The larger group the Ng be speak Ng bere while the smaller group the Bugl speak Bugl re both are members of the Chibchan language family Collectively these two groups make up the largest indigenous population in Panama Note the difference in spelling of Ng be and Ng be the two variations depend on local dialects The vowel low back rounded sound indicated by does not exist in Spanish and is confused with o Since newspapers know the vowel should have a dieresis on it they often misspell it as The sound represented by is virtually similar to the sound aw in the word saw The spelling Ng be used here is the more widely spread correct spelling in Ng bere
The Guaym generally live in houses supported by sticks with a grass or zinc roof and dirt floor wealthier families may have a cement floor In each house a platform under the roof is used for food storage and there are a number of raised bed platforms
Ch caras called kra in Ng bere are sturdy bags made from plant fibers They are used both as storage units and to transport materials Occasionally you can even see infants being transported in a ch cara Some women also make these bags to sell so they may participate in the informal economy
Families have a few large cooking pots called pailas and many keep chicha a corn drink in the house
Guaym men typically wear homemade multi colored pants straw hats and rubber boots while women wear full bright colored dresses with shoulder and neckline adornments nagua and embroidered bands around the waist and bottom Women generally do not wear shoes These items are usually made at home with hand crank sewing machines and like ch caras sold for extra income
The filing of teeth to a point using a machete sharpener is not uncommon among Guaym men and women although the practice is generally carried out in more traditional areas
Families are usually rather large and often groups of women live close together so they can assist each other when caring for children Polygamy was once common among the Ng be Bugl as the number of wives and children a man has signifies prestige It is no longer common since supporting multiple wives and large families is increasingly difficult
Social capital and reciprocity networks formed through a kinship system are important for reducing economic and social resource vulnerability while creating opportunity for families to cooperate and take advantage of more opportunities that will help them and other members of their kinship group get by Marriage and kinship relations also play a large part in determining land ownership and use rights
As the Ng be Bugl typically practice subsistence agriculture definitions of land ownership and use are of pinnacle importance to every household especially as population increases in proportion to arable land in the comarca and productive land is degraded by excessive use The intricate system on which land resources are allocated is based on the kinship system Ownership rights to unclaimed land are established through occupation and farming although very little fertile land in the comarca remains unclaimed Members of a kinship group collectively own land but those who live in the village on the land control it Undeniable rights to this collectively owned land belong to each member of the kinship group while borrowed rights are often extended to the members of a spouses family although these rights can be revoked In this way social organization shapes the pattern of economic life and livelihood for most Guaym The most common crops grown in the comarca Ng be Bugl Ngobeland are corn rice beans otoe bananas and coffee although people also grow tomatoes peppers and other vegetables in smaller gardens at home Fruits such as mangos oranges nance grow seasonally along with cacao all of which supplement the Guaym diet Meat is rarely eaten although many families keep cows pigs ducks and chickens mostly egg laying sardines are a common staple and hojaldras fried Panamanian bread are sometimes eaten for breakfast Most farming is done on land cleared using slash and burn techniques and due to growing population pressures this land is rarely left fallow for sufficient time so crop yields tend to decrease over time
As subsistence agriculture becomes less and less reliable the Guaym people have started to participate in the cash economy which provides some relatively accessible alternatives for generating capital and obtaining necessary amenities and resources Labor is one abundant resource the Guaym possess although due to poor education and low human capital including health and nutrition the labor force is rather unskilled As a result many men serve as migrant agricultural workers or leave the comarca to seek other types of informal jobs Many men work during the coffee harvest in the Chiriqui Highlands including Boquete and Santa Clara This region of Panama is known for high quality shade grown and in some cases organic coffee The Guaym also harvest seasonal vegetables grown at higher altitudes Women also participate in the informal economy by making chacaras naguas and jewelry to sell and some men sew pants or weave hats to do the same Social capital is again salient to participation in the informal economy as relationships provide people with new opportunities to make money social capital can even be a mechanism used to attract help from both governmental and non governmental organizations
The Ng be Bugl experience much adversity as a result of contemporary conditions As localized problems of land and crop shortage grow into a more generalized issue and it becomes more difficult to generate capital in a shrinking labor market malnutrition is prevalent especially in children and expecting mothers Attempts to generate capital by becoming a migrant worker also have negative social effects including added strains on family structure and increased pressure on women to provide for their children alone The dispersed nature of the population also makes existing medical care hard to access and a general lack of potable water and sanitation services cause a myriad of health problems Lack of sufficient infrastructure and under provision of social services by the government is often the root of many problems that plague the most rural areas
Prevalence of poor Spanish skills is also an issue as Guaym people are often unaware of legal rights and hence either fail to communicate complaints or to use the paths of legal recourse available to them when it would be beneficial to do so This condition especially affects women because far fewer of them speak Spanish than men Levels of secondary education are also low in the comarca Ng be Bugl as children are financially limited and transportation to secondary schooling presents a great challenge for many families As a result only of children ages in the comarca Ng be Bugl have schooling beyond the sixth grade
Finally many Guaym communities are threatened by environmental degradation caused by both farming and government or corporate exploitation of their land The Cerro Colorado copper deposit one of the world's largest deposits of copper ore is located in the comarca Ng be Bugl Mining in the area although it is legal because the property rights of subsurface resources belong to the state poses a great environmental threat as waste materials from extraction and processing pollute local watersheds Although they may provide temporary income mining endeavors also have many adverse social and cultural effects in the comarca and most natives are opposed to mineral exploitation on their lands
