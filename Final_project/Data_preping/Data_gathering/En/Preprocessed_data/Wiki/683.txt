tennessee is one of the states of the united states
what is now tennessee was initially part of north carolina and later part of the southwest territory
it was admitted to the union on june as the th state
tennessee would earn the nickname the volunteer state during the war of when many tennesseans would step in to help with the war effort
especially during the americans victory at the battle of new orleans in
the nickname would become even more applicable during the mexican american war in after the secretary of war asked the state for soldiers and tennessee sent over
tennessee was the last state to formally leave the union and join the confederacy at the outbreak of the american civil war in
with nashville occupied by union forces from it was the first state to be readmitted to the union at the end of the war
during the civil war tennessee would furnish the second most soldiers for the confederate army behind virginia
tennessee would also supply more units of soldiers for the union army than any other state within the confederacy with east tennessee being a unionist stronghold
beginning during the reconstruction era the state had competitive party politics but a democratic takeover in the late s resulted in passage of disenfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting with the exception of memphis
this sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid th century
during the early th century tennessee would transition from an agrarian economy based on tobacco and cotton to a more diversified economy
this was aided in part by massive federal investment in the tennessee valley authority created by franklin d
roosevelt s new deal helping the tva become the nation s largest public utility provider
the huge electricity supply made possible the establishment of the city of oak ridge to house the manhattan project s uranium enrichment facilities helping to build the world s first atomic bombs
in the element tennessine was named for the state largely in recognition of the roles played by oak ridge vanderbilt university and the university of tennessee in the element s discovery
paleo indians are believed to have hunted and camped in what is now tennessee as early as years ago
along with projectile points common for this period archaeologists in williamson county have uncovered a year old mastodon skeleton with cut marks typical of prehistoric hunters
the most prominent known archaic period c
bc site in tennessee is the icehouse bottom site located just south of fort loudoun in monroe county
excavations at icehouse bottom in the early s uncovered evidence of human habitation dating to as early as bc
other archaic sites include rose island located a few miles downstream from icehouse bottom and the eva site in benton county
the archaic peoples first domesticated dogs and created the first villages in the state but were largely hunter gatherers confined to smaller territories than their predecessors
tennessee is home to two major woodland period bc ad sites the pinson mounds in madison county and the old stone fort in coffee county both built c
the pinson mounds are the largest middle woodland site in the southeastern united states consisting of at least mounds and a geometric earthen enclosure
the old stone fort is a large ceremonial structure with a complex entrance way situated on what was once a relatively inaccessible peninsula
mississippian c
villages are found along the banks of most of the major rivers in tennessee
the most well known of these sites include chucalissa near memphis mound bottom in cheatham county shiloh mounds in hardin county and the toqua site in monroe county
excavations at the mcmahan mound site in sevier county and more recently at townsend in blount county have uncovered the remnants of palisaded villages dating to
in the th century three spanish expeditions passed through what is now tennessee
the hernando de soto expedition entered the tennessee valley via the nolichucky river in june rested for several weeks at the village of chiaha near the modern douglas dam and proceeded southward to the coosa chiefdom in northern georgia
de soto spent the winter of in camp on pontotoc ridge in extreme northern mississippi
he may have entered tennessee and went west to the mississippi at or near present day memphis
in the expedition of trist n de luna which was resting at coosa entered the chattanooga area to help the coosa chief subdue a rebellious tribe known as the napochies
in the pardo expedition entered the tennessee valley via the french broad river rested for several days at chiaha and followed a trail to the upper little tennessee river before being forced to turn back
at chiaha one of pardo s subordinates hernando moyano de morales established a short lived fort called san pedro
it along with five other spanish forts across the region was destroyed by natives in thereby opening the area to other european colonization
chronicles of the spanish explorers provide the earliest written accounts regarding the tennessee valley s th century inhabitants
most of the valley including chiaha was part of the coosa chiefdom s regional sphere of influence
inhabitants spoke a dialect of the muskogean language and lived in complex agrarian communities centered around fortified villages
cherokee speaking people lived in the remote reaches of the appalachian mountains and may have been at war with the muskogean inhabitants in the valley
the village of tali visited by de soto in is believed to be the mississippian period village excavated at the toqua site in the s
the villages of chalahume and satapo visited by pardo in were likely predecessors and namesakes for the later cherokee villages of chilhowee and citico which were located near the modern chilhowee dam
as of the th century tennessee was the middle ground for several different native peoples
along the mississippi river was the chickasaw choctaw peoples and inland of them were the coushatta all three were part of the muskogean language family
before european contact they were supposedly all a loose collection of mississippian culture city states with their own leaders but upon contact with europeans they merged into larger nations spread out and adopted a european lifestyle earning many of them the title of the civilized tribes during the height of the mississippians hundreds of walled cities extended throughout the american south from louisiana to the east coast up the mississippi into wisconsin a few fringe cities along larger rivers on the great plains
they had complex society agriculture
they did not build with stone but made plenty of examples of sculpture work in clay stone copper
most of what remains of these cities however are large pyramidal earthen hills upon which chiefs upper classmen would build their homes and artful burial mounds
these people did not develop the mississippian culture however but adopted it from the caddo people west of the mississippi river
to the east were the yuchi iroquoian cherokee divided along the tennessee river
in the north central region of the state were the algonquian cisca
they later moved northeast and merged with the shawnee but were briefly replaced with a second native nation known as the maumee or mascouten which were driven south during the beaver wars from southern michigan
they later merged with the miami of indiana were once again replaced by the shawnee
the shawnee controlled most of the ohio river region until the shawnee wars
in british fur trader abraham wood sent an expedition led by james needham and gabriel arthur from fort henry in the colony of virginia into overhill cherokee territory in modern day northeastern tennessee
needham was killed during the expedition and arthur was taken prisoner for more than a year
that same year a french expedition led by missionary jacques marquette and trader louis jolliet explored the mississippi river and became the first europeans to map the mississippi valley
french explorers and traders led by robert de la salle entered the region in at fort prudhomme
france briefly established a presence at fort assumption during the chickasaw wars
in a group of french traders under charles charleville s command established a settlement at the present location of downtown nashville near the cumberland river which became known as french lick
these settlers quickly established an extensive fur trading network with the local native americans but by the s the settlement had largely been abandoned
in the french constructed fort assumption under jean baptiste le moyne de bienville on the mississippi river at the present day location of memphis which they used as a base against the chickasaw during the campaign of the chickasaw wars
it was abandoned the next year after the chickasaw took hostage french troops stationed at the fort
the cherokee eventually moved south from the area now called virginia
as european colonists spread into the area the native populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west including the muscogee yuchi chickasaw and choctaw peoples
then from to the us government forced the cherokee to leave the eastern united states
nearly cherokee were forced to march from eastern tennessee to the indian territory west of the arkansas territory
this came to be known as the trail of tears as an estimated cherokee died along the way
in the cherokee language the event is called nunna daul isunyi the trail where we cried
in the s and s longhunters from virginia explored much of east and middle tennessee
in british soldiers from the colony of south carolina built fort loudoun near present day vonore the first british settlement in what is now tennessee
fort loudoun was the westernmost british outpost to that date and was designed by john william gerard de brahm and constructed by forces under captain raymond demer
shortly after its completion demer relinquished command of the fort to his brother captain paul demer
hostilities erupted between the british and the overhill cherokees into an armed conflict that became known as the anglo cherokee war and a siege of the fort ended with its surrender in
the next morning paul demer and a number of his men were killed in an ambush nearby and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner
after the end of the french and indian war britain issued the royal proclamation of which forbade settlements west of the appalachian mountains in an effort to mitigate conflicts with the natives
despite this proclamation migration across the mountains continued and the first permanent european settlers began arriving in the northeastern part of the state in the late s
william bean a longhunter who settled in a log cabin near present day johnson city in is traditionally accepted as the first permanent european american settler in tennessee
most th century settlers were english or of primarily english descent but nearly of them were scotch irish
during the watauga association met with and leased lands belonging to the cherokee at sycamore shoals in the present day area of elizabethton tennessee
in sycamore shoals was the site of the transylvania purchase conducted between the cherokee and north carolina land baron richard henderson
the treaty of sycamore shoals more popularly referred to as the transylvania purchase after henderson s transylvania company which had raised money for the endeavor consisted of two parts
the first known as the path grant deed regarded the transylvania company s purchase of lands in southwest virginia including parts of what is now west virginia and northeastern tennessee
the second part known as the great grant acknowledged the transylvania company s purchase of some acres km of land between the kentucky river and cumberland river which included a large portion of modern kentucky and a significant portion of tennessee north of present day nashville
the transylvania company paid for the land with pounds sterling of trade goods
after the treaty was signed frontier explorer daniel boone came northward to blaze the wilderness road connecting the transylvania purchase lands with the holston and watauga settlements
both the lease and the sale were considered illegal by the crown government as well as by the warring cherokee faction known as the chickamauga led by the war chief dragging canoe
the chickamauga aggressively contested the westward expansion by white settlers across tennessee throughout the cherokee american wars
in april the watauga association was reorganized as the washington district allied with the colonies that were declaring independence from great britain
the washington district annexation petition was first rejected by virginia in the spring of but a similar annexation petition presented by the district to the north carolina legislature was approved in november
in the days before statehood tennesseans struggled to gain a political voice and suffered for lack of the protection afforded by organized government
six counties washington sullivan and greene in east tennessee and davidson sumner and tennessee county in middle tennessee had been formed as western counties of north carolina between and
in the newly formed cumberland association under the cumberland compact established fort nashborough on the cumberland river opening up a second frontier of settlement within present day tennessee
the cumberland river settlements were separated from those in the east by a substantial enclave of cherokee territory that was not formally acquired from them until
after the american revolutionary war north carolina did not want the trouble and expense of maintaining such distant settlements embroiled as they were with hostile tribesmen during the cherokee american wars and needing roads forts and open waterways
nor could the far flung settlers look to the national government for under the weak loosely constituted articles of confederation it was a government in name only
in richard henderson negotiated a series of treaties with the cherokee to sell the lands of the watauga settlements at sycamore shoals on the banks of the watauga river in present day elizabethton
an agreement to sell land for the transylvania colony which included the territory in modern day tennessee north of the cumberland river was also signed
later that year daniel boone under henderson s employment blazed a trail from fort chiswell in virginia through the cumberland gap which became part of the wilderness road a major thoroughfare for settlers into tennessee and kentucky
the first reported permanent settlement in tennessee bean station was established in but was explored by pioneers daniel boone and william bean one year prior on a longhunting excursion
the duo first observed bean station after crossing the gap at clinch mountain along a southern expansion of the wilderness road from the cumberland gap one of the main thoroughfares into tennessee
after fighting in the american revolutionary war one year later bean was awarded acres km in the area he previously surveyed for settlement during his excursion with boone
bean would later construct a four room cabin at this site which served as his family s permanent home and as an inn for prospective settlers fur traders and longhunters thus establishing the first reported permanent settlement in tennessee
the settlement was situated at the intersection of the wilderness road that roughly followed what is present day u s
route e and the great indian warpath an east west pathway that roughly followed what is now u s
route w
this heavily trafficked crossroads location made bean station an important stopover between washington d c
and new orleans for early american travelers entering tennessee with taverns and inns were operating by the s
the westerners two main demands protection from the indians and the right to navigate the mississippi river went mainly unheeded during the s
north carolina s insensitivity led frustrated east tennesseans in to form the breakaway state of franklin
john sevier was named governor and the fledgling state began operating as an independent though unrecognized government
at the same time leaders of the cumberland settlements made overtures for an alliance with spain which controlled the lower mississippi river and was held responsible for inciting the indian raids
in drawing up the watauga and cumberland compacts early tennesseans had already exercised some of the rights of self government and were showing signs of a willingness to take political matters into their own hands
such stirrings of independence caught the attention of north carolina which began to reassert control over its western counties
these policies and internal divisions among east tennesseans doomed the short lived state of franklin which passed out of existence by early
when north carolina ratified the constitution of the united states in it also ceded its western lands the tennessee country to the federal government
north carolina had used these lands as a means of rewarding its revolutionary war soldiers
in the cession act of it reserved the right to satisfy further land claims in tennessee
congress designated the area as the territory of the united states south of the river ohio more commonly known as the southwest territory
the territory was divided into three districts two for east tennessee and one for the mero district on the cumberland each with its own courts militia and officeholders
president george washington appointed william blount a prominent north carolinian politician with extensive holdings in the western lands territorial governor
in a territorial census revealed a sufficient population for statehood
a referendum showed a three to one majority in favor of joining the union
governor blount called for a constitutional convention to meet in knoxville where delegates from all the counties drew up a model state constitution and democratic bill of rights
the voters chose sevier as governor
the newly elected legislature voted for blount and william cocke as senators and andrew jackson as congressman
tennessee leaders thereby converted the territory into a new state with organized government and constitution before applying to congress for admission
since the southwest territory was the first federal territory to present itself for admission to the union there was some uncertainty about how to proceed and congress was divided on the issue
nonetheless in a close vote on june congress approved the admission of tennessee as the sixteenth state of the union
they drew its borders by extending the northern and southern borders of north carolina with a few deviations to the mississippi river tennessee s western boundary
in the early years of settlement planters brought enslaved african americans with them from kentucky and virginia
enslaved african americans were first concentrated in middle tennessee where planters developed mixed crops and bred high quality horses and cattle as they did in the inner bluegrass region of kentucky
east tennessee had more subsistence farmers and few slaveholders
during the early years of state formation there was support for emancipation
at the constitutional convention of free negroes were given the right to vote if they met residency and property requirements
efforts to abolish slavery were defeated at this convention and again at the convention of
the convention of also marked the state s retraction of suffrage for most free african americans
by the number of african americans had increased from less than at the beginning of the century to
this was chiefly related to the invention of the cotton gin in and the development of large plantations and transportation of numerous enslaved people to the cotton belt in west tennessee in the area of the mississippi river
by the enslaved population had nearly doubled to with only free african americans in the state
while much of the enslaved population were concentrated in west tennessee planters in middle tennessee also used enslaved african americans for labor
according to the census enslaved african americans comprised about of the state s population of million before the civil war
most tennesseans initially showed little enthusiasm for breaking away from a nation whose struggles it had shared for so long
there were small exceptions such as franklin county which borders alabama in southern middle tennessee franklin county formally threatened to secede from tennessee and join alabama if tennessee did not leave the union
franklin county withdrew this threat when tennessee did eventually secede
in tennesseans had voted by a slim margin for the constitutional unionist john bell a native son and moderate who continued to search for a way out of the crisis
in february fifty four percent of the state s voters voted against sending delegates to a secession convention
with the attack on fort sumter in april however followed by president abraham lincoln s call for volunteers to coerce the seceded states back into line public sentiment turned dramatically against the union
historian daniel crofts wrote unionists of all descriptions both those who became confederates and those who did not considered the proclamation calling for seventy five thousand troops disastrous having consulted personally with lincoln in march congressman horace maynard the unconditional unionist and future republican from east tennessee felt assured that the administration would pursue a peaceful policy
soon after april a dismayed maynard reported that the president s extraordinary proclamation had unleashed a tornado of excitement that seems likely to sweep us all away men who had heretofore been cool firm and union loving had become perfectly wild and were aroused to a phrenzy sic of passion for what purpose they asked could such an army be wanted but to invade overrun and subjugate the southern states the growing war spirit in the north further convinced southerners that they would have to fight for our hearthstones and the security of home
governor isham harris began military mobilization submitted an ordinance of secession to the general assembly and made direct overtures to the confederate government
in a june referendum east tennessee held firm against separation while west tennessee returned an equally heavy majority in favor
the deciding vote came in middle tennessee which went from percent against secession in february to percent in favor in june
having ratified by popular vote its connection with the fledgling confederacy tennessee became the last state to officially withdraw from the union
people in east tennessee were firmly against tennessee s move to leave the union as were many in other parts of the union particularly in historically whig portions of west tennessee
this was primarily due to the distribution of slavery throughout the state of the state s entire slave population nearly of west tennesseans and about of middle tennesseans were enslaved but in east tennessee slaves made up only of the population
the east tennessee convention which met at knoxville in may and at greeneville in june consisted of east tennessee counties and one middle tennessee county scott county that resolved to secede from tennessee and form a separate state aligned with the union
they petitioned the state legislature in nashville which denied their request to secede and sent confederate troops under felix zollicoffer to occupy east tennessee and prevent secession
many east tennesseans engaged in guerrilla warfare against state authorities by burning bridges cutting telegraph wires and spying
the union backing state of scott was also established at this time and remained a de facto enclave of the united states throughout the war
tennessee provided more union troops than any other confederate state more than soldiers in total more than of whom were black
tennessee also provided confederate troops the second highest number after virginia
many battles were fought in the state most of them union victories
ulysses s
grant and the united states navy captured control of the cumberland and tennessee rivers in february and held off the confederate counterattack at shiloh in april of the same year
capture of memphis and nashville gave the union control of the western and middle sections
control was confirmed at the battle of stones river at murfreesboro in early january
after nashville was captured the first confederate state capital to fall andrew johnson an east tennessean from greeneville was appointed military governor of the state by lincoln
the military government abolished slavery in the state and union troops occupied much of the state through the end of the war
the confederates continued to hold east tennessee despite the strength of unionist sentiment there with the exception of pro confederate sullivan county
the confederates besieged chattanooga in early fall but were driven off by grant in november
many of the confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of general braxton bragg who led the army of tennessee from shiloh to confederate defeat at chattanooga
the last major battles came when the confederates invaded in november and were checked at franklin then totally destroyed by george thomas at nashville in december
after the war tennessee adopted the thirteenth amendment forbidding slave holding or involuntary servitude on february ratified the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution on july and was the first state readmitted to the union on july
because it had ratified the fourteenth amendment tennessee was the only state that seceded from the union that did not have a military governor during reconstruction
proscription was the policy of disqualifying as many ex confederates as possible
in tennessee disfranchised upwards of ex confederates
there were only two or three african americans in the tennessee legislature during reconstruction though others served as state and city officers
even with increased participation on the nashville city council african americans held only one third of the seats
whites thus clearly continued to control the state during reconstruction
in his race for congress in andrew johnson addressed african americans in speaking campaigns in western counties saying if fit and qualified by character and education no one should deny you the ballot
in southern democrats regained control of the state legislature and quickly reversed many of the reforms of the brownlow administration
in the tennessee general assembly passed four acts of self described electoral reform that resulted in the disenfranchisement of a significant portion of african american voters as well as many poor white voters
the timing of the legislation resulted from a unique opportunity seized by the democratic party to bring an end to what one historian described as the most consistently competitive political system in the south these laws instituted a poll tax required early voter registration allowed secret ballots and required separate ballot boxes for state and federal elections
in the political campaign of the democrats waged a battle unparalleled in corruption and violence to gain quorum control over both houses of the legislature
with republicans unable to stall or defeat antiparty measures the disenfranchising acts sailed through the general assembly and governor robert l
taylor signed them into law
hailed by newspaper editors as the end of black voting the laws worked as expected and african american voting declined precipitously in rural and small town tennessee
many urban blacks continued to vote until so called progressive reforms eliminated their political power in the early twentieth century
disenfranchising provisions worked against poor whites as well as blacks for decades
tennessee became a white dominated state with the democratic party in power in the middle and western sections the eastern section retained republican support based on its unionist leanings before and during the war
in the state celebrated its centennial of statehood albeit one year late with a great exposition in nashville
the tennessee centennial exposition was the ultimate expression of the gilded age in the upper south a showcase of industrial technology and exotic papier m ch versions of the world s wonders
the nashville parthenon a full scale replica of athens parthenon was built in plaster wood and brick
rebuilt of concrete in the s it remains one of the city s attractions
during its six month run at centennial park the exposition drew nearly two million visitors to see its dazzling monuments to the south s recovery
governor robert taylor observed some of them who saw our ruined country thirty years ago will certainly appreciate the fact that we have wrought miracles
during the first world war tennessee provided the most celebrated american soldier alvin c
york of fentress county tennessee
he was a former conscientious objector who in october subdued an entire german machine gun regiment in the argonne forest
besides receiving the medal of honor and assorted french decorations york became a powerful symbol of patriotism in the press and hollywood film
tennessee became the focus of national attention during the campaign for women s voting rights
like the temperance movement women s suffrage was an issue with its roots in middle class reform efforts of the late th century
the organized movement came of age with the founding of the tennessee equal suffrage association in which gave the movement at least one national leader in sue shelton white from henderson
there was a determined and largely female opposition championed by the chattanooga times the nashville banner and the jonesboro herald and tribune
to overcome the opposition the tennessee suffragists were moderate in their tactics and gained limited voting rights before the national question arose
in august governor albert h
roberts called a special session of the general assembly to consider ratification of the nineteenth amendment to the u s
constitution
leaders of the rival groups flooded into nashville to lobby the general assembly
in a close house vote the suffrage amendment won passage when an east tennessee legislator harry burn switched sides after receiving a telegram from his mother encouraging him to support ratification
on august during a special session of the sixty first general assembly tennessee s vote in favor of ratifying the nineteenth amendment made it the pivotal state in the ratification process
women immediately made their presence felt by swinging tennessee to warren harding in the presidential election
it was the first time since that the state had voted for a republican presidential candidate
national attention came tennessee s way during the trial of john t
scopes also called the scopes trial
in the general assembly as part of a general education bill passed a law that forbade the teaching of evolution in the public schools
some local boosters in dayton tennessee concocted a scheme to have scopes a high school biology teacher violate the law and stand trial as a way of drawing publicity and visitors to the town
their plan worked all too well as the rhea county courthouse was turned into a circus of national and even international media coverage
thousands flocked to dayton to witness the high powered legal counsels william jennings bryan for the prosecution and clarence darrow for the defense argue their case
tennessee was ridiculed in the northeast and west coast press as the monkey state even as a wave of revivals defending religious fundamentalism swept the state
the trial was also given the name monkey trial by the same reporters
the legal outcome of the trial was inconsequential
scopes was convicted and fined a penalty later rescinded by the state court of appeals
the law itself remained on the books until
at the very time that tennessee s rural culture was under attack by urban critics its music found a national audience
in wsm a powerful nashville radio station began broadcasting a weekly program of live music which soon was dubbed the grand ole opry such music came in diverse forms banjo and fiddle string bands from appalachia family gospel singing groups and country vaudeville acts such as murfreesboro native uncle dave macon
as of the longest running radio program in american history the opry used the new technology of radio to tap into a huge market for old timey or hillbilly music
two years after the opry s opening in a series of landmark sessions at bristol tennessee field scout ralph peer of the victor company recorded jimmie rodgers and the carter family to produce the first nationally popular rural records
tennessee emerged as the heartland of traditional country music home to many of the performers as well as the place from which it was broadcast to the nation
the need to create work for the unemployed during the great depression the desire for rural electrification and the desire to control the annual spring floods on the tennessee river drove the federal government s creation of the tennessee valley authority the nation s largest public utility in
the tva affected the lives of nearly all tennesseans
the agency was created mainly through the persistence of senator george norris of nebraska
headquartered in knoxville it was charged with the task of planning the total development of the tennessee river valley
tva sought to do this by building hydroelectric dams constructing between and as well as electricity producing coal fired power plants
inexpensive and abundant electrical power was the main benefit the tva brought to tennessee particularly to rural areas that previously did not have electrical service
tva brought electricity to about farm households across the state
by tva was the largest electrical utility in the nation a supplier of vast amounts of power whose presence in tennessee attracted large industries to relocate near one of its dams or steam plants
this incentive contributed to important economic development in the state
world war ii brought relief to tennessee by employing ten percent of the state s populace men and women in the armed services
most of those who remained on farms and in cities worked on war related production since tennessee received war orders amounting to billion
tennessee military personnel served with distinction from pearl harbor to the final bloody assaults at iwo jima and okinawa and died in combat during the war
in middle tennessee residents played host to army divisions that swarmed over the countryside on maneuvers preparing for the d day invasion
tennesseans participated in all phases of the war from combat to civilian administration to military research
cordell hull served twelve years as franklin d
roosevelt s secretary of state and became one of the chief architects of the united nations for which he received the nobel peace prize
war based industries hummed with the labor of a greatly enlarged workforce
a giant shell loading plant was built at milan as well as the vultee aircraft works in nashville tva projects also expanded in east tennessee
approximately of the state s workers were female by the end of the war
especially significant for the war effort was tennessee s role in the manhattan project the military s top secret project to build an atomic weapon
research and production work for the first a bombs were conducted at the huge scientific industrial installation at oak ridge tennessee
the oak ridge community was entirely a creation of the war
it grew from empty woods in to a city of tennessee s fifth largest four years later
with increased industrialization of the state s economy the labor movement in the state would also gain momentum
in workers at an american enka company factory near the city of morristown would strike
tensions soon built when residents appeared at the factory gates to apply for advertised replacements of the striking workers
violence then followed with people killed and the vandalism and destruction of cars and houses
then governor gordon browning dispatched national guard troops to restore order at the facility
by the end of the strike the event had become the location of on site congressional hearings and the nationwide face regarding labor relations
disenfranchising legislation of the late th century had affected poor whites as well as african americans
despite vows to overturn them successive legislatures expanded the reach of the disenfranchising laws until they covered the state
county officers regulated the vote by providing opportunities to pay the tax as they did in knoxville or conversely by making payment as difficult as possible
such manipulation of the tax and therefore the vote created an opportunity for the rise of urban bosses and political machines
urban politicians bought large blocks of poll tax receipts and distributed them to blacks and whites who then voted as instructed
abuses of the poll tax continued to resist efforts by reformers for change in the s and s
in legislators managed to rescind the poll tax but the tennessee supreme court declared that action unconstitutional
it was not until that a new constitutional convention finally removed provisions for the poll tax
hundreds of thousands of citizens both black and white had been disenfranchised by its abuses during the decades since its passage
tennessee played an important and prominent role during the civil rights movement
many national civil rights leaders such as martin luther king jr received training in methods of nonviolent protest at the highlander folk school in monteagle tennessee
the methods which mahatma gandhi had used were taught here
in the spring of after decades of segregation tennessee s jim crow laws were challenged by an organized group of nashville college students from fisk university american baptist theological seminary and vanderbilt university
the students led by jim farmer john lewis and ministers of local african american churches used methods of non violent protest in anticipation of a planned and concerted effort to desegregate nashville s downtown lunch counters through a series of sit ins
although many were harassed and beaten by white vigilantes and arrested by the nashville police none of the students retaliated with violence
the nashville sit ins reached a turning point when the house of z
alexander looby a prominent african american attorney and leader was bombed
although no one was killed thousands of protesters spontaneously marched to nashville city hall to confront mayor ben west
the mayor had offered only weak half measures and vacillated toward segregation
meeting the mass of protesters outside city hall west informally debated with them and concluded by conceding that segregation was immoral
the bombing the march and mayor west s statement helped convince downtown lunch counters to desegregate
although segregation and jim crow were by no means over the episode served as one of the first successful events of nonviolent protest and as a significant example to the rest of the nation
the leadership activism and moral arguments of african americans in the civil rights movement across the south gained passage of the national civil rights act of and the voting rights act of
african americans regained ordinary civil rights and the power to exercise their voting rights
voting rights for all were protected by provisions of the voting rights act
in contrast to the successes of the movement in tennessee the assassination of martin luther king jr in memphis was perceived as symbolic of hatred in the state
king was in the city to support a strike by black sanitary public works employees of afscme local
the city quickly settled the strike on favorable terms to the employees
riots and civil unrest erupted in african american areas in numerous cities across the country resulting in widespread injuries and millions of dollars in property damages
in voters approved eight amendments to the state constitution which extended the governor s term from two to four years prohibiting two successive terms and outlawed the poll tax
in the years following world war ii tennessee s economy continued to industrialize and demand for energy grew faster than ever before
tva built additional dams and coal fired power plants in the state during the postwar years
in voters approved eight amendments to the state constitution which extended the governor s term from two to four years prohibiting two successive terms and outlawed the poll tax
by the s and onward the state experienced economic growth due to the construction of the interstate highway system
most of the state s interstates were completed by the mid s
the construction of interstate through memphis became a national talking point on the issue of eminent domain and grassroots lobbying when the tennessee department of transportation tdot attempted to acquire overton park from the city of memphis for the highway s right of way
a local activist group spent many years contesting the project and filed a series of lawsuits to stop the construction through the park
the case made its way to the u s
supreme court in the landmark case citizens to preserve overton park v
volpe
the court sided in favor of the activist group and established the framework for judicial review of government agencies
in a state constitutional convention was held that recommended amendments to the state s constitution of which votes approved the next year
the changes allowed governors to serve two consecutive terms required the general assembly to balance the state s annual budget reformed county legislative bodies and removed provisions that had been invalidated by federal legislation and court cases during the civil rights movement
tva s construction of the tellico dam in loudon county became the subject of national controversy in the s when the endangered snail darter fish was reported to be affected by the project
after lawsuits by environmental groups the debate was decided by the u s
supreme court case tennessee valley authority v
hill in leading to amendments of the endangered species act that same year
