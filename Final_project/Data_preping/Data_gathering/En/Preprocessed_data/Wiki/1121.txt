Cornish Yarg is a semi hard cow's milk cheese made in Cornwall United Kingdom Before being left to mature the cheese is wrapped in nettle leaves to form an edible though mouldy rind The texture varies from creamy and soft immediately under the nettle coating to a Caerphilly cheese like crumbly texture in the middle
Although made according to an historic method Cornish Yarg is actually the product of the British cheesemaking renaissance in the s while its roots are inspired by traditional British Territorial cheeses
The cheese is produced at Lynher Dairies Cheese Company on Pengreep Farm near Truro by Catherine Mead Dane Hopkins and team Yarg is simply Gray spelt backwards It is named after Alan and Jenny Gray enterprising farmers who found a recipe by Gervase Markham for a nettle wrapped semi hard cheese in their attic The original recipe is thought to date back to the th century
In the Grays sold the recipe to Michael and Margaret Horrell farmers wanting to diversify into cheesemaking Mead began working with the Horrells in helping to develop the business She built a second dairy on Pengreep Farm in and in when the Horrells retired all production moved to Lynher Dairies
Cornish Yarg is made using pasteurised cow's milk sourced from neighbouring farms After pressing and brining nettles are painted on by hand The application of nettles changes the acidity on the outside of the cheese thus affecting the manner in which the curd breaks down and matures
