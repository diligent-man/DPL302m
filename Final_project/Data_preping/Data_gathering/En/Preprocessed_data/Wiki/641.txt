a red herring is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important question
it may be either a logical fallacy or a literary device that leads readers or audiences toward a false conclusion
a red herring may be used intentionally as in mystery fiction or as part of rhetorical strategies e g in politics or may be used in argumentation inadvertently
the term was popularized in by english polemicist william cobbett who told a story of having used a strong smelling smoked fish to divert and distract hounds from chasing a rabbit
as an informal fallacy the red herring falls into a broad class of relevance fallacies
unlike the straw man which involves a distortion of the other party s position the red herring is a seemingly plausible though ultimately irrelevant diversionary tactic
according to the oxford english dictionary a red herring may be intentional or unintentional it is not necessarily a conscious intent to mislead
the expression is mainly used to assert that an argument is not relevant to the issue being discussed
for example i think we should make the academic requirements stricter for students
i recommend you support this because we are in a budget crisis and we do not want our salaries affected the second sentence though used to support the first sentence does not address that topic
in fiction and non fiction a red herring may be intentionally used by the writer to plant a false clue that leads readers or audiences toward a false conclusion
for example the character of bishop aringarosa in dan brown s the da vinci code is presented for most of the novel as if he is at the centre of the church s conspiracies but is later revealed to have been innocently duped by the true antagonist of the story
the character s name is a loose italian translation of red herring aringa rosa rosa actually meaning pink and very close to rossa red
a red herring is found in the first sherlock holmes story a study in scarlet where the murderer writes at the crime scene the word rache revenge in german leading the police and the reader to mistakenly presume that a german was involved
a red herring is often used in legal studies and exam problems to mislead and distract students from reaching a correct conclusion about a legal issue intended as a device that tests students comprehension of underlying law and their ability to properly discern material factual circumstances
there is no fish species red herring rather it is a name given to a particularly strong kipper made with fish typically herring that has been strongly cured in brine or heavily smoked
this process makes the fish particularly pungent smelling and with strong enough brine turns its flesh reddish
in this literal sense as a strongly cured kipper the term can be dated to the mid th century in the poem the treatise by walter of bibbesworth he ete no ffyssh but heryng red
until the figurative sense of red herring was thought to originate from a supposed technique of training young scent hounds
there are variations of the story but according to one version the pungent red herring would be dragged along a trail until a puppy learned to follow the scent
later when the dog was being trained to follow the faint odour of a fox or a badger the trainer would drag a red herring whose strong scent confuses the animal perpendicular to the animal s trail to confuse the dog
the dog eventually learned to follow the original scent rather than the stronger scent
a variation of this story is given without mention of its use in training in the macmillan book of proverbs maxims and famous phrases with the earliest use cited being from w
butler s life of napier published in
brewer s dictionary of phrase and fable gives the full phrase as drawing a red herring across the path an idiom meaning to divert attention from the main question by some side issue here once again a dried smoked and salted herring when drawn across a fox s path destroys the scent and sets the hounds at fault another variation of the dog story is given by robert hendrickson who says escaping convicts used the pungent fish to throw off hounds in pursuit
according to a pair of articles by professor gerald cohen and robert scott ross published in comments on etymology supported by etymologist michael quinion and accepted by the oxford english dictionary the idiom did not originate from a hunting practice
ross researched the origin of the story and found the earliest reference to using herrings for training animals was in a tract on horsemanship published in by gerland langbaine
langbaine recommended a method of training horses not hounds by dragging the carcass of a cat or fox so that the horse would be accustomed to following the chaos of a hunting party
he says if a dead animal is not available a red herring would do as a substitute
this recommendation was misunderstood by nicholas cox published in the notes of another book around the same time who said it should be used to train hounds not horses
either way the herring was not used to distract the hounds or horses from a trail rather to guide them along it
the earliest reference to using herring for distracting hounds is an article published on february by radical journalist william cobbett in his polemical periodical political register
according to cohen and ross and accepted by the oed this is the origin of the figurative meaning of red herring
in the piece william cobbett critiques the english press which had mistakenly reported napoleon s defeat
cobbett recounted that he had once used a red herring to deflect hounds in pursuit of a hare adding it was a mere transitory effect of the political red herring for on the saturday the scent became as cold as a stone quinion concludes this story and cobbett s extended repetition of it in was enough to get the figurative sense of red herring into the minds of his readers unfortunately also with the false idea that it came from some real practice of huntsmen
although cobbett popularized the figurative usage he was not the first to consider red herring for scenting hounds in a literal sense an earlier reference occurs in the pamphlet nashe s lenten stuffe published in by the elizabethan writer thomas nashe in which he says next to draw on hounds to a scent to a red herring skin there is nothing comparable the oxford english dictionary makes no connection with nashe s quote and the figurative meaning of red herring to distract from the intended target only in the literal sense of a hunting practice to draw dogs toward a scent
the courtroom thriller the trial and the book it was based on explains the red herring defence in law as deriving from a species of herring coloured bright red which darts back and forth in front of possible predators to distract them from the place where its eggs have been laid
there is no such fish species
the use of herring to distract pursuing scent hounds was tested on episode of the series mythbusters
although the hound used in the test stopped to eat the fish and lost the fugitive s scent temporarily it eventually backtracked and located the target resulting in the myth being classified by the show as busted
