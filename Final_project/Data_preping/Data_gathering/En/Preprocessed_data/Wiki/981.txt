Land for peace is a legalistic interpretation of UN Security Council Resolution which has been used as the basis of subsequent Arab Israeli peace making The name Land for Peace is derived from the wording of the resolution's first operative paragraph which affirms that peace should include the application of two principles Withdrawal of Israeli forces Giving Up Land and Termination of all claims or states of belligerency Making Peace Since the resolution stipulates that both principles should apply they can be viewed jointly as giving up land for peace referred to more concisely as 'land for peace'
This interpretation is widely contested because it implies that Israeli withdrawal is linked to its neighbours' willingness to formally make peace Competing interpretations of the resolution regard Israel as being obligated to withdraw unilaterally from all territories captured in Operative paragraph of Resolution reads as follows
Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles
i Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict ii Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force In when Lord Caradon was asked about the concessions the Arab states would have to make to Israel as part of an overall settlement he said Well that's perfectly obvious if you read again the principles of which have been accepted by Egypt Jordan Syria and Saudi Arabia and in effect by Israel The provision is that if there is an adequate withdrawal all states in the area must be free to live within secure and recognized boundaries free from force and threat of force So it is an acceptance that Israel has a right to exist just as they would have a right to their homeland and have a right to exist This is the essential bargain that we are proposing It's not a new thing it's been going since
On June Israel offered to give up Sinai and the Golan in exchange for peace an offer that was rejected in September by the Arab States by the Khartoum Resolution which became famous for the Three No's no peace with Israel no recognition of Israel no negotiations with it
The first application of the land for peace formula was Israel's peace treaty with Egypt in under which Israel withdrew from the Sinai as part of a comprehensive peace agreement facilitated by economic assistance to both sides from the United States
In a similar comprehensive agreement invoking resolution formed the basis of the Israel Jordan peace treaty whereby both sides redeployed to their respective sides of the agreed international boundary
