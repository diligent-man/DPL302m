apoptosis ancient greek romanized apptsis lit ''falling off'' form programmed cell death occurs multicellular organisms
biochemical event lead characteristic cell change morphology death
change include blebbing cell shrinkage nuclear fragmentation chromatin condensation dna fragmentation mrna decay
average adult human loses billion cell day due apoptosis
average human child eight fourteen year old approximately twenty thirty billion cell die per day
contrast necrosis form traumatic cell death result acute cellular injury apoptosis highly regulated controlled process confers advantage organism's life cycle
example separation finger toe developing human embryo occurs cell digit undergo apoptosis
unlike necrosis apoptosis produce cell fragment called apoptotic body phagocyte able engulf remove content cell spill onto surrounding cell cause damage them
apoptosis cannot stop ha begun highly regulated process
intrinsic pathway cell kill sens cell stress extrinsic pathway cell kill signal cells
weak external signal may also activate intrinsic pathway apoptosis
pathway induce cell death activating caspase protease enzyme degrade proteins
two pathway activate initiator caspase activate executioner caspase kill cell degrading protein indiscriminately
addition importance biological phenomenon defective apoptotic process implicated wide variety diseases
excessive apoptosis cause atrophy whereas insufficient amount result uncontrolled cell proliferation cancer
factor like fa receptor caspase promote apoptosis member bcl- family protein inhibit apoptosis
