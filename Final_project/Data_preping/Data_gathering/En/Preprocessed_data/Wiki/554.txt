apoptosis from ancient greek romanized ap pt sis lit falling off is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms
biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes morphology and death
these changes include blebbing cell shrinkage nuclear fragmentation chromatin condensation dna fragmentation and mrna decay
the average adult human loses between and billion cells each day due to apoptosis
for an average human child between eight and fourteen years old approximately twenty to thirty billion cells die per day
in contrast to necrosis which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism s life cycle
for example the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis
unlike necrosis apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytes are able to engulf and remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to them
because apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun it is a highly regulated process
apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways
in the intrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because it senses cell stress while in the extrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells
weak external signals may also activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
both pathways induce cell death by activating caspases which are proteases or enzymes that degrade proteins
the two pathways both activate initiator caspases which then activate executioner caspases which then kill the cell by degrading proteins indiscriminately
in addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases
excessive apoptosis causes atrophy whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation such as cancer
some factors like fas receptors and caspases promote apoptosis while some members of the bcl family of proteins inhibit apoptosis
german scientist carl vogt was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in
in anatomist walther flemming delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death
however it was not until that the topic was resurrected
while studying tissues using electron microscopy john kerr at the university of queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death
following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon kerr was invited to join alastair currie as well as andrew wyllie who was currie s graduate student at university of aberdeen
in the trio published a seminal article in the british journal of cancer
kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis but in the article the process of natural cell death was called apoptosis
kerr wyllie and currie credited james cormack a professor of greek language at university of aberdeen with suggesting the term apoptosis
kerr received the paul ehrlich and ludwig darmstaedter prize on march for his description of apoptosis
he shared the prize with boston biologist h
robert horvitz
for many years neither apoptosis nor programmed cell death was a highly cited term
two discoveries brought cell death from obscurity to a major field of research identification of components of the cell death control and effector mechanisms and linkage of abnormalities in cell death to human disease in particular cancer
the nobel prize in medicine was awarded to sydney brenner h
robert horvitz and john sulston for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis
the genes were identified by studies in the nematode c
elegans and homologues of these genes function in humans to regulate apoptosis
in greek apoptosis translates to the falling off of leaves from a tree
cormack professor of greek language reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the greeks over two thousand years before
hippocrates used the term to mean the falling off of the bones
galen extended its meaning to the dropping of the scabs
cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name
debate continues over the correct pronunciation with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second p silent p to s s ap toh sis and the second p pronounced e p p to s s as in the original greek
in english the p of the greek pt consonant cluster is typically silent at the beginning of a word e g
pterodactyl ptolemy but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel as in helicopter or the orders of insects diptera lepidoptera etc
in the original kerr wyllie currie paper there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation
we are most grateful to professor james cormack of the department of greek university of aberdeen for suggesting this term
the word apoptosis is used in greek to describe the dropping off or falling off of petals from flowers or leaves from trees
to show the derivation clearly we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable the second half of the word being pronounced like ptosis with the p silent which comes from the same root to fall and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid the initiation of apoptosis is tightly regulated by activation mechanisms because once apoptosis has begun it inevitably leads to the death of the cell
the two best understood activation mechanisms are the intrinsic pathway also called the mitochondrial pathway and the extrinsic pathway
the intrinsic pathway is activated by intracellular signals generated when cells are stressed and depends on the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria
the extrinsic pathway is activated by extracellular ligands binding to cell surface death receptors which leads to the formation of the death inducing signaling complex disc
a cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to a stress which may bring about cell suicide
the binding of nuclear receptors by glucocorticoids heat radiation nutrient deprivation viral infection hypoxia increased intracellular concentration of free fatty acids and increased intracellular calcium concentration for example by damage to the membrane can all trigger the release of intracellular apoptotic signals by a damaged cell
a number of cellular components such as poly adp ribose polymerase may also help regulate apoptosis
single cell fluctuations have been observed in experimental studies of stress induced apoptosis
before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway
this step allows those signals to cause cell death or the process to be stopped should the cell no longer need to die
several proteins are involved but two main methods of regulation have been identified the targeting of mitochondria functionality or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms
an extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease calpain
the intrinsic pathway is also known as the mitochondrial pathway
mitochondria are essential to multicellular life
without them a cell ceases to respire aerobically and quickly dies
this fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways
apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways
they may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out
they are very closely related to intrinsic pathway and tumors arise more frequently through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway because of sensitivity
there is also a growing body of evidence indicating that nitric oxide is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable
nitric oxide has been implicated in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through its possible action as a signal molecule of subsequent pathways that activate apoptosis
during apoptosis cytochrome c is released from mitochondria through the actions of the proteins bax and bak
the mechanism of this release is enigmatic but appears to stem from a multitude of bax bak homo and hetero dimers of bax bak inserted into the outer membrane
once cytochrome c is released it binds with apoptotic protease activating factor apaf and atp which then bind to pro caspase to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome
the apoptosome cleaves the pro caspase to its active form of caspase which in turn cleaves and activates pro caspase into the effector caspase
mitochondria also release proteins known as smacs second mitochondria derived activator of caspases into the cell s cytosol following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes
smac binds to proteins that inhibit apoptosis iaps thereby deactivating them and preventing the iaps from arresting the process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed
iap also normally suppresses the activity of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases which carry out the degradation of the cell
therefore the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability
two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested the tnf induced tumor necrosis factor model and the fas fas ligand mediated model both involving receptors of the tnf receptor tnfr family coupled to extrinsic signals
tnf alpha is a cytokine produced mainly by activated macrophages and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis
most cells in the human body have two receptors for tnf alpha tnfr and tnfr
the binding of tnf alpha to tnfr has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins tnf receptor associated death domain tradd and fas associated death domain protein fadd
ciap can inhibit tnf signaling by binding to traf
flip inhibits the activation of caspase
binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of transcription factors involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses
however signalling through tnfr might also induce apoptosis in a caspase independent manner
the link between tnf alpha and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of tnf alpha plays a fundamental role in several human diseases especially in autoimmune diseases
the tnf alpha receptor superfamily also includes death receptors drs such as dr and dr
these receptors bind to the proteintrail and mediate apoptosis
apoptosis is known to be one of the primary mechanisms of targeted cancer therapy
luminescent iridium complex peptide hybrids iphs have recently been designed which mimic trail and bind to death receptors on cancer cells thereby inducing their apoptosis
fas pathwaythe fas receptor first apoptosis signal also known as apo or cd is a transmembrane protein of the tnf family which binds the fas ligand fasl
the interaction between fas and fasl results in the formation of the death inducing signaling complex disc which contains the fadd caspase and caspase
in some types of cells type i processed caspase directly activates other members of the caspase family and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell
in other types of cells type ii the fas disc starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase
common componentsfollowing tnf r and fas activation in mammalian cells a balance between proapoptotic bax bid bak or bad and anti apoptotic bcl xl and bcl members of the bcl family are established
this balance is the proportion of proapoptotic homodimers that form in the outer membrane of the mitochondrion
the proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and smac
control of proapoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of nonapoptotic cells is incompletely understood but in general bax or bak are activated by the activation of bh only proteins part of the bcl family
caspasescaspases play the central role in the transduction of er apoptotic signals
caspases are proteins that are highly conserved cysteine dependent aspartate specific proteases
there are two types of caspases initiator caspases caspase and effector caspases caspase
the activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric activator protein
effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage
the active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program
caspase independent apoptotic pathwaythere also exists a caspase independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by aif apoptosis inducing factor
amphibian frog xenopus laevis serves as an ideal model system for the study of the mechanisms of apoptosis
in fact iodine and thyroxine also stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins in amphibians metamorphosis and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog
negative regulation of apoptosis inhibits cell death signaling pathways helping tumors to evade cell death and developing drug resistance
the ratio between anti apoptotic bcl and pro apoptotic bax proteins determines whether a cell lives or dies
many families of proteins act as negative regulators categorized into either antiapoptotic factors such as iaps and bcl proteins or prosurvival factors like cflip bnip fadd akt and nf b
many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis but these converge on a single mechanism that actually causes the death of the cell
after a cell receives stimulus it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic caspases
in addition to the destruction of cellular organelles mrna is rapidly and globally degraded by a mechanism that is not yet fully characterized
mrna decay is triggered very early in apoptosis
a cell undergoing apoptosis shows a series of characteristic morphological changes
early alterations include
cell shrinkage and rounding occur because of the retraction lamellipodia and the breakdown of the proteinaceous cytoskeleton by caspases
the cytoplasm appears dense and the organelles appear tightly packed
chromatin undergoes condensation into compact patches against the nuclear envelope also known as the perinuclear envelope in a process known as pyknosis a hallmark of apoptosis
the nuclear envelope becomes discontinuous and the dna inside it is fragmented in a process referred to as karyorrhexis
the nucleus breaks into several discrete chromatin bodies or nucleosomal units due to the degradation of dna apoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed making it difficult to detect or visualize on classical histology sections
during karyorrhexis endonuclease activation leaves short dna fragments regularly spaced in size
these give a characteristic laddered appearance on agar gel after electrophoresis
tests for dna laddering differentiate apoptosis from ischemic or toxic cell death
before the apoptotic cell is disposed of there is a process of disassembly
there are three recognized steps in apoptotic cell disassembly
membrane blebbing the cell membrane shows irregular buds known as blebs
initially these are smaller surface blebs
later these can grow into larger so called dynamic membrane blebs
an important regulator of apoptotic cell membrane blebbing is rock rho associated coiled coil containing protein kinase
formation of membrane protrusions some cell types under specific conditions may develop different types of long thin extensions of the cell membrane called membrane protrusions
three types have been described microtubule spikes apoptopodia feet of death and beaded apoptopodia the latter having a beads on a string appearance
pannexin is an important component of membrane channels involved in the formation of apoptopodia and beaded apoptopodia
fragmentation the cell breaks apart into multiple vesicles called apoptotic bodies which undergo phagocytosis
the plasma membrane protrusions may help bring apoptotic bodies closer to phagocytes the removal of dead cells by neighboring phagocytic cells has been termed efferocytosis
dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecules such as phosphatidylserine on their cell surface
phosphatidylserine is normally found on the inner leaflet surface of the plasma membrane but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a protein known as scramblase
these molecules mark the cell for phagocytosis by cells possessing the appropriate receptors such as macrophages
the removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an inflammatory response
during apoptosis cellular rna and dna are separated from each other and sorted to different apoptotic bodies separation of rna is initiated as nucleolar segregation
many knock outs have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins
several caspases in addition to apaf and fadd have been mutated to determine the new phenotype
in order to create a tumor necrosis factor tnf knockout an exon containing the nucleotides was removed from the gene
this exon encodes a portion of the mature tnf domain as well as the leader sequence which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing
tnf mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities
however upon immunization with srbc sheep red blood cells these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response they were able to generate normal levels of igm but could not develop specific igg levels
apaf is the protein that turns on caspase by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis
since a mutation in the apaf gene is embryonic lethal a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an apaf mouse
this assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion
when an apaf gene trap is introduced into cells many morphological changes occur such as spina bifida the persistence of interdigital webs and open brain
in addition after embryonic day the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes
apaf cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation
a bax knock out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord leading to an increase in motor neurons
the caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway so it follows that knock outs made have varying damaging results
a caspase knock out leads to a severe brain malformation
a caspase knock out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality
however with the use of cre lox technology a caspase knock out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral t cells an impaired t cell response and a defect in neural tube closure
these mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by cd tnfr etc
but not resistant to apoptosis caused by uv irradiation chemotherapeutic drugs and other stimuli
finally a caspase knock out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation
a remarkable feature of these ko mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype casp apaf ko mice have deformations of neural tissue and fadd and casp ko showed defective heart development however in both types of ko other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist
in order to perform analysis of apoptotic versus necrotic necroptotic cells one can do analysis of morphology by label free live cell imaging time lapse microscopy flow fluorocytometry and transmission electron microscopy
there are also various biochemical techniques for analysis of cell surface markers phosphatidylserine exposure versus cell permeability by flow cytometry cellular markers such as dna fragmentation flow cytometry caspase activation bid cleavage and cytochrome c release western blotting
it is important to know how primary and secondary necrotic cells can be distinguished by analysis of supernatant for caspases hmgb and release of cytokeratin
however no distinct surface or biochemical markers of necrotic cell death have been identified yet and only negative markers are available
these include absence of apoptotic markers caspase activation cytochrome c release and oligonucleosomal dna fragmentation and differential kinetics of cell death markers phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization
a selection of techniques that can be used to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references
the many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components many of them not yet understood
as a pathway is more or less sequential in nature removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another
in a living organism this can have disastrous effects often in the form of disease or disorder
a discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical but the concept overlying each one is the same the normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis
this results in a cell that lives past its use by date and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny increasing the likelihood of the cell s becoming cancerous or diseased
a recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called nci h
the x linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein xiap is overexpressed in cells of the h cell line
xiaps bind to the processed form of caspase and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the number of proapoptotic agonists
as a consequence the balance of anti apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die
defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors
as a particular example defects in molecules that control transcription factor nf b in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs
this degree of independence from external survival signals can enable cancer metastasis
the tumor suppressor protein p accumulates when dna is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors
part of this pathway includes alpha interferon and beta interferon which induce transcription of the p gene resulting in the increase of p protein level and enhancement of cancer cell apoptosis
p prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the cell cycle at g or interphase to give the cell time to repair however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail
any disruption to the regulation of the p or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors
inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers inflammatory diseases and viral infections
it was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death
the most common of these diseases is cancer the disease of excessive cellular proliferation which is often characterized by an overexpression of iap family members
as a result the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction cycle regulating genes such as p ras or c myc are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells and further genes such as bcl also modify their expression in tumors
some apoptotic factors are vital during mitochondrial respiration e g
cytochrome c
pathological inactivation of apoptosis in cancer cells is correlated with frequent respiratory metabolic shifts toward glycolysis an observation known as the warburg hypothesis
apoptosis in hela cells is inhibited by proteins produced by the cell these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins
these tumor suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein
hpv e and e are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus hpv being responsible for the formation of the cervical tumor from which hela cells are derived
hpv e causes p which regulates the cell cycle to become inactive
hpv e binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to control cell division
these two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for hela cells immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur
canine distemper virus cdv is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins
this is an important oncolytic property of cdv this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells
oncoproteins e and e still leave p inactive but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection
these oncolytic properties provided a promising link between cdv and lymphoma apoptosis which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine lymphoma and human non hodgkin lymphoma
defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cells so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment
the main method of treatment for potential death from signaling related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis
for instance treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death
to stimulate apoptosis one can increase the number of death receptor ligands such as tnf or trail antagonize the anti apoptotic bcl pathway or introduce smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor iaps
the addition of agents such as herceptin iressa or gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream
finally adding p mdm complexes displaces p and activates the p pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway
apoptosis is a multi step multi pathway cell death programme that is inherent in every cell of the body
in cancer the apoptosis cell division ratio is altered
cancer treatment by chemotherapy and irradiation kills target cells primarily by inducing apoptosis
on the other hand loss of control of cell death resulting in excess apoptosis can lead to neurodegenerative diseases hematologic diseases and tissue damage
it is of interest to note that neurons that rely on mitochondrial respiration undergo apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer s and parkinson s
an observation known as the inverse warburg hypothesis
moreover there is an inverse epidemiological comorbidity between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer
the progression of hiv is directly linked to excess unregulated apoptosis
in a healthy individual the number of cd lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow however in hiv positive patients this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate cd cells
in the case of hiv cd lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis when stimulated
at the molecular level hyperactive apoptosis can be caused by defects in signaling pathways that regulate the bcl family proteins
increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as bim or their decreased proteolysis leads to cell death and can cause a number of pathologies depending on the cells where excessive activity of bim occurs
cancer cells can escape apoptosis through mechanisms that suppress bim expression or by increased proteolysis of bim
treatments aiming to inhibit works to block specific caspases
finally the akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways
akt phosphorylates and inhibits bad a bcl family member causing bad to interact with the scaffold resulting in bcl dissociation and thus cell survival
akt also activates ikk which leads to nf b activation and cell survival
active nf b induces the expression of anti apoptotic genes such as bcl resulting in inhibition of apoptosis
nf b has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type
the progression of the human immunodeficiency virus infection into aids is due primarily to the depletion of cd t helper lymphocytes in a manner that is too rapid for the body s bone marrow to replenish the cells leading to a compromised immune system
one of the mechanisms by which t helper cells are depleted is apoptosis which results from a series of biochemical pathways
hiv enzymes deactivate anti apoptotic bcl
this does not directly cause cell death but primes the cell for apoptosis should the appropriate signal be received
in parallel these enzymes activate proapoptotic procaspase which does directly activate the mitochondrial events of apoptosis
hiv may increase the level of cellular proteins that prompt fas mediated apoptosis
hiv proteins decrease the amount of cd glycoprotein marker present on the cell membrane
released viral particles and proteins present in extracellular fluid are able to induce apoptosis in nearby bystander t helper cells
hiv decreases the production of molecules involved in marking the cell for apoptosis giving the virus time to replicate and continue releasing apoptotic agents and virions into the surrounding tissue
the infected cd cell may also receive the death signal from a cytotoxic t cell cells may also die as direct consequences of viral infections
hiv expression induces tubular cell g m arrest and apoptosis
the progression from hiv to aids is not immediate or even necessarily rapid hiv s cytotoxic activity toward cd lymphocytes is classified as aids once a given patient s cd cell count falls below
researchers from kumamoto university in japan have developed a new method to eradicate hiv in viral reservoir cells named lock in and apoptosis using the synthesized compound heptanoylphosphatidyl l inositol pentakisphophate or l hippo to bind strongly to the hiv protein pr gag they were able to suppress viral budding
by suppressing viral budding the researchers were able to trap the hiv virus in the cell and allow for the cell to undergo apoptosis natural cell death
associate professor mikako fujita has stated that the approach is not yet available to hiv patients because the research team has to conduct further research on combining the drug therapy that currently exists with this lock in and apoptosis approach to lead to complete recovery from hiv
viral induction of apoptosis occurs when one or several cells of a living organism are infected with a virus leading to cell death
cell death in organisms is necessary for the normal development of cells and the cell cycle maturation
it is also important in maintaining the regular functions and activities of cells
viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including
receptor binding
activation of protein kinase r pkr
interaction with p
expression of viral proteins coupled to mhc proteins on the surface of the infected cell allowing recognition by cells of the immune system such as natural killer and cytotoxic t cells that then induce the infected cell to undergo apoptosis canine distemper virus cdv is known to cause apoptosis in central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of infected dogs in vivo and in vitro
apoptosis caused by cdv is typically induced via the extrinsic pathway which activates caspases that disrupt cellular function and eventually leads to the cells death
in normal cells cdv activates caspase first which works as the initiator protein followed by the executioner protein caspase
however apoptosis induced by cdv in hela cells does not involve the initiator protein caspase
hela cell apoptosis caused by cdv follows a different mechanism than that in vero cell lines
this change in the caspase cascade suggests cdv induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway excluding the need for the initiator caspase
the executioner protein is instead activated by the internal stimuli caused by viral infection not a caspase cascade
the oropouche virus orov is found in the family bunyaviridae
the study of apoptosis brought on by bunyaviridae was initiated in when it was observed that apoptosis was induced by the la crosse virus into the kidney cells of baby hamsters and into the brains of baby mice
orov is a disease that is transmitted between humans by the biting midge culicoides paraensis
it is referred to as a zoonotic arbovirus and causes febrile illness characterized by the onset of a sudden fever known as oropouche fever
the oropouche virus also causes disruption in cultured cells cells that are cultivated in distinct and specific conditions
an example of this can be seen in hela cells whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected
with the use of gel electrophoresis it can be observed that orov causes dna fragmentation in hela cells
it can be interpreted by counting measuring and analyzing the cells of the sub g cell population
when hela cells are infected with orov the cytochrome c is released from the membrane of the mitochondria into the cytosol of the cells
this type of interaction shows that apoptosis is activated via an intrinsic pathway
in order for apoptosis to occur within orov viral uncoating viral internalization along with the replication of cells is necessary
apoptosis in some viruses is activated by extracellular stimuli
however studies have demonstrated that the orov infection causes apoptosis to be activated through intracellular stimuli and involves the mitochondria
many viruses encode proteins that can inhibit apoptosis
several viruses encode viral homologs of bcl
these homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as bax and bak which are essential for the activation of apoptosis
examples of viral bcl proteins include the epstein barr virus bhrf protein and the adenovirus e b k protein
some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and an example is the crma protein of cowpox viruses
whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of tnf and fas
for example the m t protein of myxoma viruses can bind tnf preventing it from binding the tnf receptor and inducing a response
furthermore many viruses express p inhibitors that can bind p and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity
as a consequence p cannot induce apoptosis since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins
the adenovirus e b k protein and the hepatitis b virus hbx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function
viruses can remain intact from apoptosis in particular in the latter stages of infection
they can be exported in the apoptotic bodies that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response
this favours the spread of the virus
programmed cell death in plants has a number of molecular similarities to that of animal apoptosis but it also has differences notable ones being the presence of a cell wall and the lack of an immune system that removes the pieces of the dead cell
instead of an immune response the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a vacuole that ruptures as the cell dies
additionally plants do not contain phagocytic cells which are essential in the process of breaking down and removing apoptotic bodies
whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name apoptosis as opposed to the more general programmed cell death is unclear
the characterization of the caspases allowed the development of caspase inhibitors which can be used to determine whether a cellular process involves active caspases
using these inhibitors it was discovered that cells can die while displaying a morphology similar to apoptosis without caspase activation
later studies linked this phenomenon to the release of aif apoptosis inducing factor from the mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus mediated by its nls nuclear localization signal
inside the mitochondria aif is anchored to the inner membrane
in order to be released the protein is cleaved by a calcium dependent calpain protease
