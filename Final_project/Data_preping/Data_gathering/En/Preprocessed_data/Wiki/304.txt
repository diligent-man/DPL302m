Gothic fiction sometimes called Gothic horror in the th century is a loose literary aesthetic of fear and haunting
The name is a reference to Gothic architecture of the European Middle Ages which was characteristic of the settings of early Gothic novels
The first work to call itself Gothic was Horace Walpole's novel The Castle of Otranto later subtitled A Gothic Story
Subsequent th century contributors included Clara Reeve Ann Radcliffe William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis
The Gothic influence continued into the early th century works by the Romantic poets and novelists such as Mary Shelley Walter Scott and E
Hoffmann frequently drew upon gothic motifs in their works
The early Victorian period continued the use of gothic in novels by Charles Dickens and the Bront sisters as well as works by the American writers Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne
Later prominent works were Dracula by Bram Stoker Richard Marsh's The Beetle and Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
Twentieth-century contributors include Daphne du Maurier Stephen King Shirley Jackson Anne Rice and Toni Morrison
Gothic fiction is characterized by an environment of fear the threat of supernatural events and the intrusion of the past upon the present
Gothic fiction is distinguished from other forms of scary or supernatural stories such as fairy tales by the specific theme of the present being haunted by the past
The setting typically includes physical reminders of the past especially through ruined buildings which stand as proof of a previously thriving world which is decaying in the present
Especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries characteristic settings include castles religious buildings like monasteries and convents and crypts
The atmosphere is typically claustrophobic and common plot elements include vengeful persecution imprisonment and murder
The depiction of horrible events in Gothic fiction often serves as a metaphorical expression of psychological or social conflicts
Gothic fiction often moves between high culture and low or popular culture
Gothic literature is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era
English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period marked by harsh laws enforced by torture and with mysterious fantastic and superstitious rituals
Similar to the Gothic Revivalists' rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the neoclassical style of the Enlightened Establishment the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime and a quest for atmosphere
Gothic ruins invoke multiple linked emotions by representing inevitable decay and the collapse of human creations hence the urge to add fake ruins as eyecatchers in English landscape parks
Placing a story in a Gothic building serves several purposes
It inspires feelings of awe implies that the story is set in the past gives an impression of isolation or dissociation from the rest of the world and coveys religious associations
Setting the novel in a Gothic castle was meant to imply a story not only set in the past but shrouded in darkness
The architecture often served as a mirror for the characters and events of the story
The buildings in The Castle of Otranto for example are riddled with tunnels that characters use to move back and forth in secret
This movement mirrors the secrets surrounding Manfred's possession of the castle and how it came into his family
From the castles dungeons forests and hidden passages of the Gothic novel genre emerged female Gothic
Guided by the works of authors such as Ann Radcliffe Mary Shelley and Charlotte Bront the female Gothic allowed womens' societal and sexual desires to be introduced
In many respects the novel's intended reader of the time was the woman who even as she enjoyed such novels felt she had to lay down her book with affected indifference or momentary shame according to Jane Austen author of Northanger Abbey
The Gothic novel shaped its form for woman readers to turn to Gothic romances to find support for their own mixed feelings
Female Gothic narratives focus on such topics as a persecuted heroine in flight from a villainous father and in search of an absent mother while male writers tend towards masculine transgression of social taboos
The emergence of the ghost story gave women writers something to write about besides the common marriage plot allowing them to present a more radical critique of male power violence and predatory sexuality
When the female Gothic coincides with the explained supernatural the natural cause of terror is not the supernatural but female disability and societal horrors rape incest and the threatening control of a male antagonist
Female Gothic novels also address women's discontent with patriarchal society their problematic and unsatisfying maternal position and their role within that society
Women's fears of entrapment in the domestic their own body marriage childbirth or domestic abuse commonly appear in the genre
After the characteristic Gothic Bildungsroman-like plot sequence female Gothic allowed readers to grow from adolescence to maturity in the face of the realized impossibilities of the supernatural
As protagonists like Adeline in The Romance of the Forest learn that their superstitious fantasies and terrors are replaced by natural cause and reasonable doubt the reader may grasp the heroine's true position The heroine possesses the romantic temperament that perceives strangeness where others see none
Her sensibility therefore prevents her from knowing that her true plight is her condition the disability of being female
The components that would eventually combine into Gothic literature had a rich history by the time Walpole presented a fictitious medieval manuscript in The Castle of Otranto in
The plays of William Shakespeare in particular were a crucial reference point for early Gothic writers in both an effort to bring credibility to their own works as well as legitimize the emerging genre as serious literature to the public
Tragedies such as Hamlet Macbeth King Lear Romeo and Juliet and Richard III with plots revolving around the supernatural revenge murder ghosts witchcraft omens written in dramatic pathos and set in medieval castles was a huge influence upon early Gothic authors who frequently quote and make allusions to Shakespeare's works
John Milton's Paradise Lost was also very influential amongst Gothic writers who were especially drawn to the tragic anti-hero character Satan who became a model for many charismatic Gothic villains and Byronic heroes
Milton's version of the myth of the fall and redemption creation and decreation is as Frankenstein again reveals an important model for Gothic plots
Alexander Pope who had a considerable influence upon Walpole was the first significant poet of the th century to write a poem in an authentic Gothic manner
Eloisa to Abelard which tells of star-crossed lovers one doomed to a life of seclusion in a convent and the other in a monastery abounds in gloomy imagery religious terror and suppressed passion
The influence of Pope's poem is found throughout th-century Gothic literature including the novels of Walpole Radcliffe and Lewis
Gothic literature is often described with words such as wonder and terror This sense of wonder and terror that provides the suspension of disbelief so important to the Gothic—which except for when it is parodied even for all its occasional melodrama is typically played straight in a self-serious manner—requires the imagination of the reader to be willing to accept the idea that there might be something beyond that which is immediately in front of us The mysterious imagination necessary for Gothic literature to have gained any traction had been growing for some time before the advent of the Gothic
The need for this came as the known world was becoming more explored reducing the geographical mysteries of the world
The edges of the map were filling in and no dragons were to be found
Clive Bloom theorizes that this void in the collective imagination was critical in the development of the cultural possibility for the rise of the Gothic tradition
The setting of most early Gothic works was medieval but this was a common theme long before Walpole
In Britain especially there was a desire to reclaim a shared past
This obsession frequently led to extravagant architectural displays such as Fonthill Abbey and sometimes mock tournaments were held
It was not merely in literature that a medieval revival made itself felt and this too contributed to a culture ready to accept a perceived medieval work in
The Gothic often uses scenery of decay death and morbidity to achieve its effects especially in the Italian Horror school of Gothic
However Gothic literature was not the origin of this tradition indeed it was far older
The corpses skeletons and churchyards so commonly associated with early Gothic works were popularized by the Graveyard poets and were also present in novels such as Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year which contains comical scenes of plague carts and piles of corpses
Even earlier poets like Edmund Spenser evoked a dreary and sorrowful mood in such poems as Epithalamion
All of the aspects of pre-Gothic literature occur to some degree in the Gothic but even taken together they still fall short of true Gothic
What was lacking was an aesthetic to tie the elements together
Bloom notes that this aesthetic must take the form of a theoretical or philosophical core which is necessary to save the best tales from becoming mere anecdote or incoherent sensationalism In this case the aesthetic needed to be an emotional one and was finally provided by Edmund Burke's work A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful which finally codified the gothic emotional experience Specifically Burke's thoughts on the Sublime Terror and Obscurity were most applicable
These sections can be summarized thus the Sublime is that which is or produces the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling the Sublime is most often evoked by Terror and to cause Terror we need some amount of Obscurity we can't know everything about that which is inducing Terror or else a great deal of the apprehension vanishes Obscurity is necessary to experience the Terror of the unknown
Bloom asserts that Burke's descriptive vocabulary was essential to the Romantic works that eventually informed the Gothic
The birth of Gothic literature was thought to have been influenced by political upheaval
Researchers linked its birth with the English Civil War culminating in a Jacobite rebellion more recent to the first Gothic novel
A collective political memory and any deep cultural fears associated with it likely contributed to early Gothic villains as literary representatives of defeated Tory barons or Royalists rising from their political graves in the pages of early Gothic novels to terrorize the bourgeois reader of late eighteenth century England
The first work to call itself Gothic was Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto
The first edition presented the story as a translation of a sixteenth century manuscript and was widely popular
Walpole revealed himself as the true author in the second edition which added the subtitle A Gothic Story The revelation prompted a backlash from readers who considered it inappropriate for a modern author to write a supernatural story in a rational age
Walpole did not initially prompt many imitators
Beginning with Clara Reeve's The Old English Baron the s saw more writers attempting his combination of supernatural plots with emotionally realistic characters
Examples include Sophia Lee's The Recess - and William Beckford's Vathek
At the height of the Gothic novel's popularity in the s the genre was almost synonymous with Ann Radcliffe whose works were highly anticipated and widely imitated
Particularly popular were The Romance of the Forest and The Mysteries of Udolpho
Walter Scott in an essay on Radcliffe writes of the popularity of Udolpho at the time The very name was fascinating and the public who rushed upon it with all the eagerness of curiosity rose from it with unsated appetite
When a family was numerous the volumes flew and were sometimes torn from hand to hand Radcliffe's novels were often seen as the feminine and rational opposite of a more violently horrifying male Gothic associated with Matthew Lewis
Radcliffe's final novel The Italian was a response to Lewis's The Monk
Other notable Gothic novels of the s include William Godwin's Caleb Williams Regina Maria Roche's Clermont and Charles Brockden Brown's Wieland as well as large numbers of anonymous works published by the Minerva Press
In continental Europe Romantic literary movements led to related Gothic genres such as the German Schauerroman and the French roman noir
Eighteenth century Gothic novels were typically set in a distant past and for English novels a distant European country but without specific dates or historical figures that characterized the later development of historical fiction
The saturation of Gothic-inspired literature during the s was referred to in a letter by Samuel Taylor Coleridge writing on March indeed I am almost weary of the Terrible having been a hireling in the Critical Review for the last six or eight months I have been reviewing the Monk the Italian Hubert de Sevrac c c c in all of which dungeons and old castles solitary Houses by the Sea Side Caverns Woods extraordinary characters all the tribe of Horror Mystery have crowded on me even to surfeiting
The excesses stereotypes and frequent absurdities of the Gothic genre made it rich territory for satire
After there was a period in which Gothic parodies outnumbered sincere Gothic novels
In The Heroine by Eaton Stannard Barrett Gothic tropes are exaggerated for comic effect
In Jane Austen's novel Northanger Abbey the naive protagonist much like a female Quixote conceives herself a heroine of a Radcliffean romance and imagines murder and villainy on every side though the truth turns out to be much more prosaic
This novel is also noted for including a list of early Gothic works since known as the Northanger Horrid Novels
The poetry romantic adventures and character of Lord Byron—characterised by his spurned lover Lady Caroline Lamb as mad bad and dangerous to know—were another inspiration for the Gothic novel providing the archetype of the Byronic hero
Byron features as the title character in Lady Caroline's own Gothic novel Glenarvon
Byron was also the host of the celebrated ghost-story competition involving himself Percy Bysshe Shelley Mary Shelley and John William Polidori at the Villa Diodati on the banks of Lake Geneva in the summer of
This occasion was productive of both Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Polidori's The Vampyre featuring the Byronic Lord Ruthven
The Vampyre has been accounted by cultural critic Christopher Frayling as one of the most influential works of fiction ever written and spawned a craze for vampire fiction and theatre and latterly film that has not ceased to this day
Mary Shelley's novel though clearly influenced by the Gothic tradition is often considered the first science fiction novel despite the novel's lack of any scientific explanation for the monster's animation and the focus instead on the moral dilemmas and consequences of such a creation
John Keats' La Belle Dame sans Merci and Isabella or the Pot of Basil which feature mysteriously fey ladies
In the latter poem the names of the characters the dream visions and the macabre physical details are influenced by the novels of premiere Gothicist Ann Radcliffe
Walter Scott although ushering in the historical novel and in effect turning popularity away from Gothic fiction frequently employs Gothic elements in his novels and poetry
Scott drew upon oral folklore fireside tails and ancient superstitions often creating a juxtaposition between rationality and the supernatural
Novels such as The Bride of Lammermoor in which the character's fates are decided by superstition and prophecy or the poem Marmion in which a Nun is walled alive inside a convent illustrate Scott's influence and use of Gothic themes
A late example of a traditional Gothic novel is Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Maturin which combines themes of anti-Catholicism with an outcast Byronic hero
Loudon's The Mummy features standard Gothic motifs characters and plotting but with one significant twist it is set in the twenty-second century and speculates on fantastic scientific developments that might have occurred four hundred years in the future making it and Frankenstein among the earliest examples of the science fiction genre developing from Gothic traditions
During two decades the most famous author of Gothic literature in Germany was the polymath E
His novel The Devil's Elixirs was influenced by Lewis's The Monk and even mentions it
The novel explores the motive of Doppelgnger a term coined by another German author and supporter of Hoffmann Jean Paul in his humorous novel Siebenks
He also wrote an opera based on the Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu's Gothic story Undine for which de la Motte Fouqu himself wrote the libretto
Aside from Hoffmann and de la Motte Fouqu three other important authors from the era were Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff The Marble Statue Ludwig Achim von Arnim Die Majoratsherren and Adelbert von Chamisso Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte
After them Wilhelm Meinhold wrote The Amber Witch and Sidonia von Bork
In Spain the priest Pascual Prez Rodrguez was the most assiduous novelist in the Gothic way closely aligned to the supernatural explained by Ann Radcliffe
At the same time the poet Jos de Espronceda published The Student of Salamanca - a narrative poem which presents a horrid variation on the Don Juan legend
In Russia authors of the Romantic era include Antony Pogorelsky penname of Alexey Alexeyevich Perovsky Orest Somov Oleksa Storozhenko Alexandr Pushkin Nikolai Alekseevich Polevoy Mikhail Lermontov for his work Stuss and Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky
Pushkin is particularly important as his short story The Queen of Spades was so popular that it was adapted into operas and later films by both Russian and foreign artists
Some parts of Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time are also considered to belong in the Gothic genre but they lack the supernatural elements of other Russian Gothic stories
The following poems are also now considered to belong to the Gothic genre Meshchevskiy's Lila Katenin's Olga Pushkin's The Bridegroom Pletnev's The Gravedigger and Lermontov's Demon
The key author of the transition from Romanticism to Realism Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol who was also one of the most important authors of Romanticism produced a number of works that qualify as Gothic fiction
Each of his three short story collections features a number of stories that fall within the Gothic genre or contain Gothic elements
They include Saint John's Eve and A Terrible Vengeance from Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka The Portrait from Arabesques and Viy from Mirgorod
While all are well known the latter is probably the most famous having inspired at least eight film adaptations two now considered lost one animated film two documentaries and a video game
Gogol's work differs from Western European Gothic fiction as his cultural influences drew on Ukrainian folklore Cossack lifestyle and as he was a religious man Orthodox Christianity
Other relevant authors of this era include Vladimir Fyodorovich Odoevsky The Living Corpse written published The Ghost The Sylphide as well as short stories Count Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy The Family of the Vourdalak and The Vampire Mikhail Zagoskin Unexpected Guests Jzef SękowskiOsip Senkovsky Antar and Yevgeny Baratynsky The Ring
By the Victorian era Gothic had ceased to be the dominant genre for novels in England partly replaced by more sedate historical fiction
However Gothic short stories continued to be popular published in magazines or as small chapbooks called penny dreadfuls
The most influential Gothic writer from this period was the American Edgar Allan Poe who wrote numerous short stories and poems reinterpreting Gothic tropes
His story The Fall of the House of Usher revisits classic Gothic tropes of aristocratic decay death and madness
Poe is now considered the master of the American Gothic
In England one of the most influential penny dreadfuls is the anonymously authored Varney the Vampire which introduced the trope of vampires having sharpened teeth
Another notable English author of penny dreadfuls is George W
Reynolds known for The Mysteries of London Faust Wagner the Wehr-wolf and The Necromancer
Elizabeth Gaskell's tales The Doom of the Griffiths Lois the Witch and The Grey Woman all employ one of the most common themes of Gothic fiction the power of ancestral sins to curse future generations or the fear that they will
In Spain Gustavo Adolfo Bcquer stood out with his romantic poems and short tales some of them depicting supernatural events
Today he is considered by some as the most-read writer in Spanish after Miguel de Cervantes
In addition to these short Gothic fictions were some novels which drew on the Gothic
Emily Bront's Wuthering Heights transports the Gothic to the forbidding Yorkshire Moors and features ghostly apparitions and a Byronic hero in the person of the demonic Heathcliff
The Bronts' fictions were cited by feminist critic Ellen Moers as prime examples of Female Gothic exploring woman's entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction
Emily's Cathy and Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre are examples of female protagonists in such roles
Louisa May Alcott's Gothic potboiler A Long Fatal Love Chase written in but published in is also an interesting specimen of this subgenre
In addition to Jane Eyre Charlotte Bront's Villette also shows Gothic influence
Like other examples of the female Gothic this book employs the explained supernatural
Throughout the book a ghostly nun haunts the protagonist Lucy Snowe
Lucy’s friend a doctor suggests that the nun is a product of her imagination but the end of the book reveals that the nun was in fact a disguised suitor coming to visit Ginevra a friend of Lucy’s
Another Gothic feature of Villette is an anti-Catholic bias
Like other gothic novels such as Radcliffe’s The Italian it is set in a Catholic country
Lucy Snowe consistently says negative things about Catholicism in general and about specific Catholic people
As an English Protestant Lucy is very out of place in her Catholic setting
The genre was also a heavy influence on mainstream writers such as Charles Dickens who read Gothic novels as a teenager and incorporated their gloomy atmosphere and melodrama into his own works shifting them to a more modern period and an urban setting for example in Oliver Twist Bleak House and Great Expectations
These works juxtapose wealthy ordered and affluent civilisation with the disorder and barbarity of the poor in the same metropolis
Bleak House in particular is credited with introducing urban fog to the novel which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film Mighall
Miss Havisham from Great Expectations a bitter recluse who shuts herself away in her gloomy mansion ever since being jilted at the altar on her wedding day is one of Dickens’ most Gothic characters
His most explicitly Gothic work is his last novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood which he did not live to complete and was published unfinished upon his death in
The mood and themes of the Gothic novel held a particular fascination for the Victorians with their obsession with mourning rituals mementos and mortality in general
Irish Catholics also wrote Gothic fiction in the th century
Although some Anglo-Irish dominated and defined the subgenre decades later they did not own it
Irish Catholic Gothic writers included Gerald Griffin James Clarence Mangan and John and Michael Banim
William Carleton was a notable Gothic writer but he converted from Catholicism to Anglicanism during his life
In Germany Jeremias Gotthelf wrote The Black Spider an allegorical work that uses Gothic themes
The last work from the German writer Theodor Storm The Rider on the White Horse also uses Gothic motives and themes
After Gogol Russian literature saw the rise of Realism but many authors continued to write stories within Gothic fiction territory
Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev one of the most celebrated Realists wrote Faust Phantoms Song of the Triumphant Love and Clara Milich
Another classic Russian Realist Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky incorporated Gothic elements into many of his works although none can be seen as purely Gothic
Grigory Petrovich Danilevsky who wrote historical and early science fiction novels and stories wrote Mertvec-ubiytsa Dead Murderer in
Also Grigori Alexandrovich Machtet wrote Zaklyatiy kazak which may now also be considered Gothic
The s saw the revival of the Gothic as a powerful literary form allied to fin de siecle which fictionalized contemporary fears like ethical degeneration and questioned the social structures of the time
Classic works of this Urban Gothic include Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray George du Maurier's Trilby Richard Marsh's The Beetle Henry James' The Turn of the Screw and the stories of Arthur Machen
In Ireland Gothic fiction tended to be purveyed by the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy
According to literary critic Terry Eagleton Charles Maturin Sheridan Le Fanu and Bram Stoker form the core of the Irish Gothic subgenre with stories featuring castles set in a barren landscape and a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry which represent in allegorical form the political plight of Catholic Ireland subjected to the Protestant Ascendancy
Le Fanu's use of the gloomy villain forbidding mansion and persecuted heroine in Uncle Silas shows direct influence from both Walpole's Otranto and Radcliffe's Udolpho
Le Fanu's short story collection In a Glass Darkly includes the superlative vampire tale Carmilla which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced Bram Stoker's vampire novel Dracula
Stoker's book not only created the most famous Gothic villain ever Count Dracula but also established Transylvania and Eastern Europe as the locus classicus of the Gothic
Published in the same year as Dracula Florence Marryat's The Blood of the Vampire is another piece of vampire fiction
The Blood of the Vampire which like Carmilla features a female vampire is notable for its treatment of vampirism as both racial and medicalised
The vampire Harriet Brandt is also a psychic vampire killing unintentionally
In the United States two notable late th century writers in the Gothic tradition were Ambrose Bierce and Robert W
Bierce's short stories were in the horrific and pessimistic tradition of Poe
Chambers indulged in the decadent style of Wilde and Machen even including a character named Wilde in his The King in Yellow
Some works of the Canadian writer Gilbert Parker also fall into the genre including the stories in The Lane that Had No Turning
The serialized novel The Phantom of the Opera by the French writer Gaston Leroux is another well-known example of Gothic fiction from the early th century when many German authors were writing works influenced by Schauerroman including Hanns Heinz Ewers
Until the s Russian Gothic was not viewed as a genre or label by Russian critics
If used the word gothic was used to describe mostly early works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky from the s
Most critics simply used tags such as Romanticism and fantastique such as in the story collection translated into English as Russian th-Century Gothic Tales but originally titled Фантастический мир русской романтической повести literally The Fantastic World of Russian Romanticism Short StoryNovella
However since the mid-s Russian gothic fiction as a genre began to be discussed in books such as The Gothic-Fantastic in Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature European Gothic A Spirited Exchange The Russian Gothic novel and its British antecedents and Goticheskiy roman v Rossii The Gothic Novel in Russia
The first Russian author whose work has been described as gothic fiction is considered to be Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin
While many of his works feature gothic elements the first considered to belong purely under the gothic fiction label is Ostrov Borngolm Island of Bornholm from
Nearly ten years later Nikolay Ivanovich Gnedich followed suit with his novel Don Corrado de Gerrera set in Spain in the reign of Philip II
The term Gothic is sometimes also used to describe the ballads of Russian authors such as Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky particularly Ludmila and Svetlana both translations based on Gottfreid August Burger's Gothic German ballad Lenore
During the last years of Imperial Russia in the early th century many authors continued to write in the Gothic fiction genre
They include the historian and historical fiction writer Alexander Valentinovich Amfiteatrov Leonid Nikolaievich Andreyev who developed psychological characterization the symbolist Valery Yakovlevich Bryusov Alexander Grin Anton Pavlovich Chekhov and Aleksandr Ivanovich Kuprin
Nobel Prize winner Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin wrote Dry Valley which is seen as influenced by Gothic literature
In a monograph on the subject Muireann Maguire writes The centrality of the Gothic-fantastic to Russian fiction is almost impossible to exaggerate and certainly exceptional in the context of world literature
Gothic fiction and Modernism influenced each other
This is often evident in detective fiction horror fiction and science fiction but the influence of the Gothic can also be seen in the high literary modernism of the th century
Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray initiated a re-working of older literary forms and myths that becomes common in the work of Yeats Eliot and Joyce among others
In Joyce's Ulysses the living are transformed into ghosts which points to an Ireland in stasis at the time but also a history of cyclical trauma from the Great Famine in the s through to the current moment in the text
The way Ulysses uses Gothic tropes such as ghosts and hauntings while removing the literally supernatural elements of th century Gothic fiction is indicative of a general form of modernist Gothic writing in the first half of the th century
In America pulp magazines such as Weird Tales reprinted classic Gothic horror tales from the previous century by such authors as Poe Arthur Conan Doyle and Edward Bulwer-Lytton and printed new stories by modern authors featuring both traditional and new horrors
The most significant of these was H
Lovecraft who also wrote a conspectus of the Gothic and supernatural horror tradition in his Supernatural Horror in Literature as well as developing a Mythos that would influence Gothic and contemporary horror well into the st century
Lovecraft's protg Robert Bloch contributed to Weird Tales and penned Psycho which drew on the classic interests of the genre
From these the Gothic genre per se gave way to modern horror fiction regarded by some literary critics as a branch of the Gothic although others use the term to cover the entire genre
The Romantic strand of Gothic was taken up in Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca which is seen by some to have been influenced by Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre
Other books by du Maurier such as Jamaica Inn also display Gothic tendencies
Du Maurier's work inspired a substantial body of female Gothics concerning heroines alternately swooning over or terrified by scowling Byronic men in possession of acres of prime real estate and the appertaining droit du seigneur
The genre also influenced American writing creating a Southern Gothic genre that combines some Gothic sensibilities such as the grotesque with the setting and style of the Southern United States
Examples include Erskine Caldwell William Faulkner Carson McCullers John Kennedy Toole Manly Wade Wellman Eudora Welty Rhodi Hawk Tennessee Williams Truman Capote Flannery O'Connor Davis Grubb Anne Rice Harper Lee and Cormac McCarthy
Mass-produced Gothic romances became popular in the s s and s with authors such as Phyllis A
Whitney Joan Aiken Dorothy Eden Victoria Holt Barbara Michaels Mary Stewart Alicen White and Jill Tattersall
Many featured covers showing a terror-stricken woman in diaphanous attire in front of a gloomy castle often with a single lit window
Many were published under the Paperback Library Gothic imprint and marketed to female readers
While the authors were mostly women some men wrote Gothic romances under female pseudonyms the prolific Clarissa Ross and Marilyn Ross were pseudonyms of the male Dan Ross Frank Belknap Long published Gothics under his wife's name Lyda Belknap Long the British writer Peter O'Donnell wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent
Apart from imprints like Love Spell discontinued in very few books seem to embrace the term these days
Gothic fiction continues to be extensively practised by contemporary authors
Many modern writers of horror or other types of fiction exhibit considerable Gothic sensibilities examples include Anne Rice Stella Coulson Susan Hill Billy Martin and Neil Gaiman and in some works by Stephen King
Disch's novel The Priest was subtitled A Gothic Romance and partly modelled on Matthew Lewis' The Monk
Many writers such as Billy Martin Stephen King and particularly Clive Barker have focused on the surface of the body and the visuality of blood
England's Rhiannon Ward is among recent writers of Gothic fiction
Contemporary American writers in the tradition include Joyce Carol Oates in such novels as Bellefleur and A Bloodsmoor Romance and short story collections such as Night-Side Skarda b and Raymond Kennedy in his novel Lulu Incognito
A number of Gothic traditions have also developed in New Zealand with the subgenre referred to as New Zealand Gothic or Maori Gothic and Australia known as Australian Gothic
These explore everything from the multicultural natures of the two countries to their natural geography
Novels in the Australian Gothic tradition include Kate Grenville's The Secret River and the works of Kim Scott
An even smaller genre is Tasmanian Gothic set exclusively on the island with prominent examples including Gould's Book of Fish by Richard Flanagan and The Roving Party by Rohan Wilson
Southern Ontario Gothic applies a similar sensibility to a Canadian cultural context
Robertson Davies Alice Munro Barbara Gowdy Timothy Findley and Margaret Atwood have all produced notable exemplars of this form
Another writer in the tradition was Henry Farrell best known for his Hollywood horror novel What Ever Happened To Baby Jane Farrell's novels spawned a subgenre of Grande Dame Guignol in the cinema represented by such films as the film based on Farrell's novel which starred Bette Davis versus Joan Crawford this subgenre of films was dubbed the psycho-biddy genre
The many Gothic subgenres include a new environmental Gothic or ecoGothic
It is an ecologically aware Gothic engaged in dark nature and ecophobia
Writers and critics of the ecoGothic suggest that the Gothic genre is uniquely positioned to speak to anxieties about climate change and the planet's ecological future
Among the bestselling books of the st century the YA novel Twilight by Stephenie Meyer is now increasingly identified as a Gothic novel as is Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind
Literary Gothic themes have been translated into other media
There was a notable revival in th century Gothic horror cinema such as the classic Universal monsters films of the s Hammer Horror films and Roger Corman's Poe cycle
In Hindi cinema the Gothic tradition was combined with aspects of Indian culture particularly reincarnation for an Indian Gothic genre beginning with Mahal and Madhumati
The s Gothic television series Dark Shadows borrowed liberally from Gothic traditions with elements like haunted mansions vampires witches doomed romances werewolves obsession and madness
The early s saw a Gothic Romance comic book mini-trend with such titles as DC Comics' The Dark Mansion of Forbidden Love and The Sinister House of Secret Love Charlton Comics' Haunted Love Curtis Magazines' Gothic Tales of Love and AtlasSeaboard Comics' one-shot magazine Gothic Romances
Twentieth century rock music also had its Gothic side
Black Sabbath's debut album created a dark sound different from other bands at the time and has been called the first ever goth-rock record
However the first recorded use of gothic to describe a style of music was for The Doors
Critic John Stickney used the term gothic rock to describe the music of The Doors in October in a review published in The Williams Record
The album recognized as initiating the goth music genre is Unknown Pleasures by the band Joy Division although earlier bands such The Velvet Underground also contributed to the genre's distinctive style
Themes from Gothic writers such as H
Lovecraft were used among Gothic rock and heavy metal bands especially in black metal thrash metal Metallica's The Call of Ktulu death metal and gothic metal
For example heavy metal musician King Diamond delights in telling stories full of horror theatricality Satanism and anti-Catholicism in his compositions
