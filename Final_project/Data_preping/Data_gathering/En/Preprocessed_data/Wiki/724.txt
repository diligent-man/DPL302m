wessex w s ks old english estseaxna r e wests ksn ri t e the kingdom of the west saxons was an anglo saxon kingdom in the south of great britain from until england was unified by thelstan in
the anglo saxons believed that wessex was founded by cerdic and cynric but this may be a legend
the two main sources for the history of wessex are the anglo saxon chronicle and the west saxon genealogical regnal list which sometimes conflict
wessex became a christian kingdom after cenwalh was baptised and was expanded under his rule
c dwalla later conquered sussex kent and the isle of wight
his successor ine issued one of the oldest surviving english law codes and established a second west saxon bishopric
the throne subsequently passed to a series of kings with unknown genealogies
during the th century as the hegemony of mercia grew wessex largely retained its independence
it was during this period that the system of shires was established
under egbert surrey sussex kent essex and mercia along with parts of dumnonia were conquered
he also obtained the overlordship of the northumbrian king
however mercian independence was restored in
during the reign of his successor thelwulf a danish army arrived in the thames estuary but was decisively defeated
when thelwulf s son thelbald usurped the throne the kingdom was divided to avoid war
thelwulf was succeeded in turn by his four sons the youngest being alfred the great
wessex was invaded by the danes in and alfred was compelled to pay them to leave
they returned in but were forced to withdraw
in they forced alfred to flee to the somerset levels but were eventually defeated at the battle of edington
during his reign alfred issued a new law code gathered scholars to his court and was able to devote funds to building ships organising an army and establishing a system of burhs
alfred s son edward captured the eastern midlands and east anglia from the danes and became ruler of mercia in upon the death of his sister thelfl d
edward s son thelstan conquered northumbria in and england became a unified kingdom for the first time
cnut the great who conquered england in created the wealthy and powerful earldom of wessex but in harold godwinson reunited the earldom with the crown and wessex ceased to exist
from the neolithic onwards the chalk downland of the area that would become wessex was traversed by the harrow way which can still be traced from marazion in cornwall to the coast of the english channel near dover and was probably connected with the ancient tin trade
in the late neolithic the ceremonial sites of avebury and stonehenge were completed on salisbury plain but the final phase of stonehenge was erected by the so called wessex culture of the middle bronze age c bc
the area has many other earthworks and erected stone monuments from the neolithic and early bronze periods including the dorset cursus an earthwork km mi long and m yd wide which was oriented to the midwinter sunset
although agriculture and hunting were pursued during this long period there is little archaeological evidence of human settlements
by the iron age celtic british tribes such as the durotriges atrebates belgae and dobunni occupied the future wessex
following the roman conquest from the st century ad numerous country villas with attached farms were established across wessex along with the important towns of dorchester and winchester the ending chester comes from latin castra a military camp
the romans or rather the romano british built another major road that integrated wessex running eastwards from exeter through dorchester to winchester and silchester and on to london
in the mid th century there were increasing raids on roman britain by peoples such as the picti scotti attacotti and franks as well as the saxons
in these tribes simultaneously invaded britain from the north west and east
the invaders reportedly defeated or co opted roman forces in most parts of northern and western britain
however the roman general theodosius had recaptured most areas by the end of
in magnus maximus defeated further raids
however there was increasing internal conflict across the roman empire
during in the context of the overthrow of emperor gratian maximus took most of the garrison from britain to gaul where he was made augustus of the west ruling britain gaul spain and roman africa
following the death of maximus in roman authority in britain again declined
during the late s stilicho attempted to restore control with a campaign against the picti but this was undermined in when stilicho transferred troops to the continent to fight the goths
two subsequent roman rulers of britain were murdered
in a roman officer in britain constantine iii declared himself augustus of the west and left for gaul taking with him roman troops
finally in when romano british officials requested military assistance from emperor honorius he told them to manage their own defences
economic decline occurred after these events circulation of roman coins ended and the importation of items from the roman empire stopped
theories about the settlement of saxons jutes and angles in britain are divided into two categories by the historian peter hunter blair namely welsh and english
the welsh tradition is exemplified by gildas in de excidio et conquestu britanniae
in brief it states that after the romans left the celtic britons managed to continue for a time without any major disruptions
however when finally faced with northern invaders a certain unnamed ruler in britain called a proud tyrant by gildas requested assistance from the saxons in exchange for land
there were no conflicts between the british and the saxons for a time but following a dispute about the supply of provisions the saxons warred against the british and severely damaged parts of the country
in time however some saxon troops left britain under ambrosius aurelianus the british subsequently defeated those who remained
a lengthy conflict ensued in which neither side gained any decisive advantage until the britons routed the saxons at the battle of mons badonicus
after this there occurred a peaceful period for the britons under which gildas was living at the time he wrote the de excidio et conquestu britanniae
one of the english traditions about the saxon arrival concerns hengest and horsa
when bede wrote his ecclesiastical history of the english people he adapted gildas narrative and added details such as the names of those involved
to the proud tyrant he gave the name vortigern and the saxon commanders he named hengest and horsa
further details were added to the story in the historia brittonum which was partially written by nennius
according to the historia hengest and horsa fought the invaders of britain under the condition of gaining the island of thanet
the daughter of hengest rowena later arrived on a ship of reinforcements and vortigern married her
however a war arose in kent due to a dispute between hengest and vortigern s son
after losing several battles the saxons finally defeated the british by treacherously attacking them once the two parties had convened for a meeting
some additional details of the hengest and horsa legend are found in the anglo saxon chronicle
the chronicle then records subsequent saxon arrivals including that of cerdic the founder of wessex in
according to the anglo saxon chronicle cerdic and his son cynric landed in southern hampshire in but this account is not regarded by historians as reliable due to duplication of chronicle entries and evidence that the area was first occupied by jutes
although the entry mentions cynric as cerdic s son a different source lists him as the son of cerdic s son creoda
the chronicle continues stating that port and his two sons bieda and m gla landed at portsmouth in and killed a high ranking british nobleman
in cerdic and cynric slew british king natanleod along with five thousand of his men though the historicity of natanleod has been disputed and cerdic became the first king of wessex in
the saxons attacked cerdicesford in intending to cross the river avon and block a road which connected old sarum and badbury rings a british stronghold
the battle appears to have ended as a draw and the expansion of wessex ended for about thirty years
this is likely due to losses suffered during the battle and an apparent peace agreement with the britons
the battle of mons badonicus is believed to have been fought around this time
gildas states that the saxons were completely defeated in the battle in which king arthur participated according to nennius
this defeat is not recorded in the chronicle
the thirty year period of peace was temporarily interrupted when according to the chronicle the saxons conquered the isle of wight in at a battle near carisbrooke
cynric became the ruler of wessex after cerdic died in and reigned for twenty six years
the sources do agree that ceawlin who succeeded cynric in about is the son of cynric he usually is named as the father of cuthwine
ceawlin s reign is thought to be more reliably documented than those of his predecessors though the chronicle s dates of to are different from the revised chronology
ceawlin overcame pockets of resisting britons to the northeast in the chilterns gloucestershire and somerset
the capture of cirencester gloucester and bath in after the pause caused by the battle of mons badonicus opened the way to the southwest
ceawlin is one of the seven kings named in bede s ecclesiastical history of the english people as holding imperium over the southern english the chronicle later repeated this claim referring to ceawlin as a bretwalda or britain ruler
ceawlin was deposed perhaps by his nephew ceol and died a year later
six years later in about ceol was succeeded by a brother ceolwulf who was succeeded in his turn in about by cynegils
the genealogies do not agree on cynegils pedigree his father is variously given as ceola ceolwulf ceol cuthwine cutha or cuthwulf
the tradition embodied in the anglo saxon chronicle and in the genealogies of the west saxon dynasty is open to considerable doubt
this is largely because the founder of the dynasty and a number of his alleged descendants had brittonic celtic rather than anglo saxon germanic names
the name cerdic is derived from the british name caraticos
this may indicate that cerdic was a native briton and that his dynasty became anglicised over time
other members of the dynasty possessing celtic names include ceawlin and c dwalla
c dwalla who died as late as was the last west saxon king to possess a celtic name
it is in cynegils reign that the first event in west saxon history that can be dated with reasonable certainty occurs the baptism of cynegils by birinus which happened at the end of the s perhaps in
birinus was then established as bishop of the west saxons with his seat at dorchester on thames
this was the first conversion to christianity by a west saxon king but it was not accompanied by the immediate conversion of all the west saxons cynegils successor and probably his son cenwealh who came to the throne in about was a pagan at his accession
however he too was baptised only a few years later and wessex became firmly established as a christian kingdom
cynegils s godfather was king oswald of northumbria and his conversion may have been connected with an alliance against king penda of mercia who had previously attacked wessex
these attacks marked the beginning of sustained pressure from the expanding kingdom of mercia
in time this would deprive wessex of its territories north of the thames and the bristol avon encouraging the kingdom s reorientation southwards
cenwealh married penda s daughter and when he repudiated her penda again invaded and drove him into exile for some time perhaps three years
the dates are uncertain but it was probably in the late s or early s
he spent his exile in east anglia and was converted to christianity there
after his return cenwealh faced further attacks from penda s successor wulfhere but was able to expand west saxon territory in somerset at the expense of the britons
he established a second bishopric at winchester while the one at dorchester was soon abandoned as mercian power pushed southwards
after cenwealh s death in his widow seaxburh held the throne for a year she was followed by scwine who was apparently descended from another brother of ceawlin
this was one of several occasions on which the kingship of wessex is said to have passed to a remote branch of the royal family with an unbroken male line of descent from cerdic these claims may be genuine or may reflect the spurious assertion of descent from cerdic to legitimise a new dynasty
scwine s reign only lasted two years and in the throne passed back to the immediate family of cenwealh with the accession of his brother centwine
centwine is known to have fought and won battles against the britons but the details have not survived
centwine was succeeded by another supposed distant relative c dwalla who claimed descent from ceawlin
c dwalla reigned for just two years but achieved a dramatic expansion of the kingdom s power conquering the kingdoms of sussex kent and the isle of wight although kent regained its independence almost immediately and sussex followed some years later
his reign ended in when he abdicated and went on pilgrimage to rome where he was baptised by pope sergius i and died soon afterwards
bokeley dyke appears to have been fortified around this period and the former roman road at ackling dyke blocked by the britons to prevent the west saxons advance into dorset
evidence suggests that dorset north hampshire eastern devon and southern wiltshire were substantially under west saxon control by the beginning of the reign of caedwalla in but details of their conquest is unclear
his successor was ine who also claimed to be a descendant of cerdic through ceawlin but again through a long separated line of descent
ine was the most durable of the west saxon kings reigning for years
he issued the oldest surviving english code of laws apart from those of the kingdom of kent and established a second west saxon bishopric at sherborne covering the area west of selwood forest which formed an important boundary between east and west wessex
near the end of his life he followed in c dwalla s footsteps by abdicating and making a pilgrimage to rome
the throne then passed to a series of other kings who claimed descent from cerdic but whose supposed genealogies and relationship to one another are unknown
during the th century wessex was overshadowed by mercia whose power was then at its height and the west saxon kings may at times have acknowledged mercian overlordship
they were however able to avoid the more substantial control which mercia exerted over smaller kingdoms
during this period wessex continued its gradual advance to the west overwhelming the british kingdom of dumnonia devon
at this time wessex took de facto control over much of devon although britons retained a degree of independence in devon until at least the th century
william of malmesbury claimed that the britons and saxons inhabited exeter as equals until as a result of the mercian conquest of the northern portion of its early territories in gloucestershire and oxfordshire the thames and the avon now probably formed the northern boundary of wessex while its heartland lay in hampshire wiltshire berkshire dorset and somerset
the system of shires which was later to form the basis of local administration throughout england and eventually ireland wales and scotland as well originated in wessex and had been established by the mid th century
in the fortunes of wessex were transformed by the accession of egbert who came from a cadet branch of the ruling dynasty that claimed descent from ine s brother ingild
with his accession the throne became firmly established in the hands of a single lineage
early in his reign he conducted two campaigns against the west welsh first in and then again at gafulford in
during the course of these campaigns he conquered the western britons still in devon and reduced those beyond the river tamar now cornwall to the status of a vassal
in or he overturned the political order of england by decisively defeating king beornwulf of mercia at ellendun and seizing control of surrey sussex kent and essex from the mercians while with his help east anglia broke away from mercian control
in he conquered mercia driving its king wiglaf into exile and secured acknowledgement of his overlordship from the king of northumbria
he thereby became the bretwalda or high king of britain
this position of dominance was short lived as wiglaf returned and restored mercian independence in but the expansion of wessex across south eastern england proved permanent
egbert s later years saw the beginning of danish viking raids on wessex which occurred frequently from onwards
in a huge danish army said to have been carried on ships arrived in the thames estuary
having defeated king beorhtwulf of mercia in battle the danes moved on to invade wessex but were decisively crushed by egbert s son and successor king thelwulf in the exceptionally bloody battle of aclea
this victory postponed danish conquests in england for fifteen years but raids on wessex continued
in thelwulf went on pilgrimage to rome and his eldest surviving son thelbald took advantage of his absence to seize his father s throne
on his return thelwulf agreed to divide the kingdom with his son to avoid bloodshed ruling the new territories in the east while thelbald held the old heartland in the west
thelwulf was succeeded by each of his four surviving sons ruling one after another the rebellious thelbald then thelbert who had previously inherited the eastern territories from his father and who reunited the kingdom on thelbald s death then thelred and finally alfred the great
this occurred because the first two brothers died in wars with the danes without issue while thelred s sons were too young to rule when their father died
in several of the danish commanders combined their respective forces into one large army and landed in england
over the following years what became known as the great heathen army overwhelmed the kingdoms of northumbria and east anglia
then in the great summer army arrived from scandinavia to reinforce the great heathen army
the reinforced army invaded wessex and although thelred and alfred won some victories and succeeded in preventing the conquest of their kingdom a number of defeats and heavy losses of men compelled alfred to pay the danes to leave wessex
the danes spent the next few years subduing mercia and some of them settled in northumbria but the rest returned to wessex in
alfred responded effectively and was able with little fighting to bring about their withdrawal in
a portion of the danish army settled in mercia but at the beginning of the remaining danes mounted a winter invasion of wessex taking alfred by surprise and overrunning much of the kingdom
alfred was reduced to taking refuge with a small band of followers in the marshes of the somerset levels but after a few months he was able to gather an army and defeated the danes at the battle of edington bringing about their final withdrawal from wessex to settle in east anglia
simultaneous danish raids on the north coast of france and brittany occurred in the s prior to the establishment of normandy in and recorded danish alliances with both bretons and cornish may have resulted in the suppression of cornish autonomy with the death by drowning of king donyarth in as recorded by the annales cambriae
no subsequent kings of cornwall are recorded after this time but asser records cornwall as a separate kingdom from wessex in the s
in a viking fleet that had assembled in the thames estuary sailed across the channel to start a new campaign on the continent
the rampaging viking army on the continent encouraged alfred to protect his kingdom of wessex
over the following years alfred carried out a dramatic reorganisation of the government and defences of wessex building warships organising the army into two shifts which served alternately and establishing a system of fortified burhs across the kingdom
this system is recorded in a th century document known as the burghal hidage which details the location and garrisoning requirements of thirty three forts whose positioning ensured that no one in wessex was more than a long day s ride from a place of safety
in the s these reforms helped him to repulse the invasion of another huge danish army which was aided by the danes settled in england with minimal losses
in two individuals found a large hoard near leominster consisting primarily of saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins the latter date to around ce
according to a news report experts believe it the hoard was buried by a viking during a series of raids known to have taken place in the area at that time while wessex was ruled by alfred the great and mercia by ceolwulf ii
two imperial coins recovered from the treasure hunters depict the two kings indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms at least for a time that was previously unknown to historians according to the report a report by the guardian adds that the presence of both kings on the two emperor coins suggests some sort of pact between the pair
but the rarity of the coins also suggests that alfred quickly dropped his ally who was just about written out of history alfred also reformed the administration of justice issued a new law code and championed a revival of scholarship and education
he gathered scholars from around england and elsewhere in europe to his court and with their help translated a range of latin texts into english doing much of the work personally and orchestrated the composition of the anglo saxon chronicle
as a result of these literary efforts and the political dominance of wessex the west saxon dialect of this period became the standard written form of old english for the rest of the anglo saxon period and beyond
the danish conquests had destroyed the kingdoms of northumbria and east anglia and divided mercia in half with the danes settling in the north east while the south west was left to the english king ceolwulf allegedly a danish puppet
when ceolwulf s rule came to an end he was succeeded as ruler of english mercia not by another king but by a mere ealdorman aethelred who acknowledged alfred s overlordship and married his daughter ethelfleda
the process by which this transformation of the status of mercia took place is unknown but it left alfred as the only remaining english king
after the invasions of the s wessex and english mercia continued to be attacked by the danish settlers in england and by small danish raiding forces from overseas but these incursions were usually defeated while there were no further major invasions from the continent
the balance of power tipped steadily in favour of the english
in ealdorman thelred died leaving his widow alfred s daughter thelfl d in charge of mercia
alfred s son and successor edward the elder then annexed london oxford and the surrounding area probably including middlesex hertfordshire buckinghamshire and oxfordshire from mercia to wessex
between and a series of english offensives overwhelmed the danes of mercia and east anglia bringing all of england south of the humber under edward s power
in thelfl d died and edward took over direct control of mercia extinguishing what remained of its independence and ensuring that henceforth there would be only one kingdom of the english
in edward s successor athelstan conquered northumbria bringing the whole of england under one ruler for the first time
the kingdom of wessex had thus been transformed into the kingdom of england
although wessex had now effectively been subsumed into the larger kingdom which its expansion had created like the other former kingdoms it continued for a time to have a distinct identity which periodically found renewed political expression
after the death of king eadred in who had no legitimate heirs the rule of england passed to his nephew eadwig
eadwig s unpopularity with the nobility and the church led the thanes of mercia and northumbria to declare their allegiance to his younger brother edgar in october though eadwig continued to rule in wessex
in eadwig died and the whole of england came under edgar s control
after the conquest of england by the danish king cnut in he established earldoms based on the former kingdoms of northumbria mercia and east anglia but initially administered wessex personally
within a few years however he had created an earldom of wessex encompassing all of england south of the thames for his english henchman godwin
for almost fifty years the vastly wealthy holders of this earldom first godwin and then his son harold were the most powerful men in english politics after the king
finally on the death of edward the confessor in harold became king reuniting the earldom of wessex with the crown
no new earl was appointed before the ensuing norman conquest of england and as the norman kings soon did away with the great earldoms of the late anglo saxon period marks the extinction of wessex as a political unit
wessex is often symbolised by a wyvern or dragon
both henry of huntingdon and matthew of westminster talk of a golden dragon being raised at the battle of burford in by the west saxons
the bayeux tapestry depicts a fallen golden dragon as well as a red golden white dragon at the death of king harold ii who was previously earl of wessex
dragon standards were in fairly wide use in europe at the time being derived from the draco standard employed by the later roman army and there is no evidence that it explicitly identified wessex
a panel of th century stained glass at exeter cathedral indicates that an association with an image of a dragon in south west britain pre dated the victorians
nevertheless the association with wessex was only popularised in the th century most notably through the writings of e
freeman
by the time of the grant of armorial bearings by the college of arms to somerset county council in a red dragon had become the accepted heraldic emblem of the former kingdom
this precedent was followed in when wiltshire county council was granted arms
two gold wessex dragons were later granted as supporters to the arms of dorset county council in
in the british army the wyvern has been used to represent wessex the rd wessex infantry division and postwar regional wessex brigade adopted a formation sign consisting of a gold wyvern on a black or dark blue background
the regular wessex brigade of the s adopted a cap badge featuring the heraldic beast until the regiments took back up individual regimental badges in the late s
the territorial army wessex regiment continued to wear the wessex brigade badge until the late s when its individual companies too readopted their parent regular regimental cap badges
the now disbanded west somerset yeomanry adopted a wessex wyvern rampant as the centre piece for its cap badge and the current royal wessex yeomanry adopted a similar device in when the regiment moved from wearing individual squadron county yeomanry cap badges to a unified single regimental cap badge
when sophie countess of wessex was granted arms the sinister supporter assigned was a blue wyvern described by the college of arms as an heraldic beast which has long been associated with wessex
in the s william crampton the founder of the british flag institute designed a flag for the wessex region which depicts a gold wyvern on a red field
a coat of arms was attributed by medieval heralds to the kings of wessex
these arms appear in a manuscript of the th century and are blazoned as azure a cross patonce alternatively a cross fleury or cross moline between four martlets or
the attributed arms of wessex are also known as the arms of edward the confessor and the design is based on an emblem historically used by king edward the confessor on the reverse side of pennies minted by him
the heraldic design continued to represent both wessex and edward in classical heraldry and is found on a number of church windows in derived shields such as the arms of the collegiate church of st peter at westminster westminster abbey which was founded by the king
thomas hardy used a fictionalised wessex as a setting for many of his novels adopting his friend william barnes term wessex for their home county of dorset and its neighbouring counties in the south and west of england
hardy s wessex excluded gloucestershire and oxfordshire but the city of oxford which he called christminster was visited as part of wessex in jude the obscure
he gave each of his wessex counties a fictionalised name such as with berkshire which is known in the novels as north wessex
the film shakespeare in love included a character called lord wessex a title which did not exist in elizabethan times
the itv television series broadchurch takes place in the wessex area primarily the county of dorset
it features government agencies such as wessex police and wessex crown court and several characters are seen attending south wessex secondary school
in the book and television series the last kingdom wessex is the primary setting focusing on the rule of alfred the great and the war against the vikings
wessex remains a common term for the area
many organisations that cover the area of dorset somerset hampshire and wiltshire use the name wessex in their company or organisation name for example wessex bus wessex water and wessex institute of technology
the wessex constitutional convention and wessex regionalist party are minor groups seeking increased political autonomy for the region
a number of british army units also use the name wessex such as the wessex regiment and nd regiment royal artillery known as the wessex gunners
