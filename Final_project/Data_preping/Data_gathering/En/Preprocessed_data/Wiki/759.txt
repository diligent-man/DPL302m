catherine of siena march april a lay member of the dominican order was a mystic activist and author who had a great influence on italian literature and on the catholic church
canonized in she is also a doctor of the church
born and raised in siena she wanted from an early age to devote herself to god against the will of her parents
she joined the mantellates a group of pious women primarily widows informally devoted to dominican spirituality
her influence with pope gregory xi played a role in his decision to leave avignon for rome
the pope then sent catherine to negotiate peace with florence
after gregory xi s death march and the conclusion of peace july she returned to siena
she dictated to secretaries her set of spiritual treatises the dialogue of divine providence
the great schism of the west led catherine of siena to go to rome with the pope
she sent numerous letters to princes and cardinals to promote obedience to pope urban vi and to defend what she calls the vessel of the church
she died on april exhausted by her rigorous fasting
urban vi celebrated her funeral and burial in the basilica of santa maria sopra minerva in rome
devotion around catherine of siena developed rapidly after her death
pope pius ii canonized her in she was declared a patron saint of rome in by pope pius ix and of italy together with francis of assisi in by pope pius xii
she was the second woman to be declared a doctor of the church on october by pope paul vi only days after teresa of vila
in pope john paul ii proclaimed her a co patron saint of europe
catherine of siena is one of the outstanding figures of medieval catholicism by the strong influence she has had in the history of the papacy and her extensive authorship
she was behind the return of the pope from avignon to rome and then carried out many missions entrusted to her by the pope something quite rare for a woman in the middle ages
her dialogue hundreds of letters and dozens of prayers also give her a prominent place in the history of italian literature
caterina di jacopo di benincasa was born on march shortly before the black death ravaged europe in siena republic of siena today italy to lapa piagenti the daughter of a local poet and jacopo di benincasa a cloth dyer who ran his enterprise with the help of his sons
the house where catherine grew up still exists
lapa was about forty years old when she gave premature birth to twin daughters catherine and giovanna
she had already borne children but half of them had died
giovanna was handed over to a wet nurse and died soon after
catherine was nursed by her mother and developed into a healthy child
she was two years old when lapa had her th child another daughter named giovanna
as a child catherine was so merry that the family gave her the pet name of euphrosyne which is greek for joy and the name of an euphrosyne of alexandria
catherine is said by her confessor and biographer raymond of capua o p s life to have had her first vision of christ when she was five or six years old she and a brother were on the way home from visiting a married sister when she is said to have experienced a vision of christ seated in glory with the apostles peter paul and john
raymond continues that at age seven catherine vowed to give her whole life to god
when catherine was sixteen her older sister bonaventura died in childbirth already anguished by this catherine soon learned that her parents wanted her to marry bonaventura s widower
she was absolutely opposed and started a strict fast
she had learned this from bonaventura whose husband had been far from considerate but his wife had changed his attitude by refusing to eat until he showed better manners
besides fasting catherine further disappointed her mother by cutting off her long hair as a protest against being overly encouraged to improve her appearance to attract a husband
catherine would later advise raymond of capua to do during times of trouble what she did now as a teenager build a cell inside your mind from which you can never flee in this inner cell she made her father into a representation of christ her mother into the blessed virgin mary and her brothers into the apostles
serving them humbly became an opportunity for spiritual growth
catherine resisted the accepted course of marriage and motherhood on the one hand or a nun s veil on the other
she chose to live an active and prayerful life outside a convent s walls following the model of the dominicans
eventually her father gave up and permitted her to live as she pleased
a vision of saint dominic gave strength to catherine but her wish to join his order was no comfort to lapa who took her daughter with her to the baths in bagno vignoni to improve her health
catherine fell seriously ill with a violent rash fever and pain which conveniently made her mother accept her wish to join the mantellate the local association of devout laywomen
the mantellate taught catherine how to read and she lived in almost total silence and solitude in the family home
her custom of giving away clothing and food without asking anyone s permission cost her family significantly but she requested nothing for herself
by staying in their midst she could live out her rejection of them more strongly
she did not want their food referring to the table laid for her in heaven with her real family
according to raymond of capua at the age of twenty one c
catherine experienced what she described in her letters as a mystical marriage with jesus later a popular subject in art as the mystic marriage of saint catherine
caroline walker bynum explains one surprising and controversial aspect of this marriage that occurs both in artistic representations of the event and in some early accounts of her life underlining the extent to which the marriage was a fusion with christ s physicality catherine received not the ring of gold and jewels that her biographer reports in his bowdlerized version but the ring of christ s foreskin catherine herself mentions the foreskin as wedding ring motif in one of her letters equating the wedding ring of a virgin with a foreskin she typically claimed that her own wedding ring to christ was simply invisible
she wrote in a letter to encourage a nun who seems to have been undergoing a prolonged period of spiritual trial and torment bathe in the blood of christ crucified
see that you don t look for or want anything but the crucified as a true bride ransomed by the blood of christ crucified for that is my wish
you see very well that you are a bride and that he has espoused you you and everyone else and not with a ring of silver but with a ring of his own flesh
look at the tender little child who on the eighth day when he was circumcised gave up just so much flesh as to make a tiny circlet of a ring raymond of capua also records that she was told by christ to leave her withdrawn life and enter the public life of the world
catherine rejoined her family and began helping the ill and the poor where she took care of them in hospitals or homes
her early pious activities in siena attracted a group of followers women and men who gathered around her
as social and political tensions mounted in siena catherine found herself drawn to intervene in wider politics
she made her first journey to florence in probably to be interviewed by the dominican authorities at the general chapter held in florence in may though this is disputed if she was interviewed then the absence of later evidence suggests she was deemed sufficiently orthodox
it seems that at this time she acquired raymond of capua as her confessor and spiritual director
after this visit she began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central italy advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through the total love for god in pisa in she used what influence she had to sway that city and lucca away from alliance with the anti papal league whose force was gaining momentum and strength
she also lent her enthusiasm towards promoting the launch of a new crusade
it was in pisa in that according to raymond of capua s biography she received the stigmata visible at catherine s request only to herself
physical travel was not the only way in which catherine made her views known
from onwards she began dictating letters to scribes
these letters were intended to reach men and women of her circle increasingly widening her audience to include figures in authority as she begged for peace between the republics and principalities of italy and for the return of the papacy from avignon to rome
she carried on a long correspondence with pope gregory xi asking him to reform the clergy and the administration of the papal states
towards the end of she returned to siena to assist a young political prisoner niccol di tuldo at his execution
in june catherine went to avignon as ambassador of the republic of florence to make peace with the papal states on march gregory xi had placed florence under interdict
she was unsuccessful and was disowned by the florentine leaders who sent ambassadors to negotiate on their own terms as soon as catherine s work had paved the way for them
catherine sent an appropriately scorching letter back to florence in response
while in avignon catherine also tried to convince pope gregory xi the last avignon pope to return to rome
gregory did indeed return his administration to rome in january to what extent this was due to catherine s influence is a topic of much modern debate
catherine returned to siena and spent the early months of founding a women s monastery of strict observance outside the city in the old fortress of belcaro
she spent the rest of at rocca d orcia about twenty miles from siena on a local mission of peace making and preaching
during this period in autumn she had the experience which led to the writing of her dialogue and learned to write although she still seems to have chiefly relied upon her secretaries for her correspondence
late in or early in catherine again travelled to florence at the order of gregory xi to seek peace between florence and rome
following gregory s death in march riots the revolts of the ciompi broke out in florence on june and in the ensuing violence she was nearly assassinated
eventually in july peace was agreed between florence and rome catherine returned quietly to florence
in late november with the outbreak of the western schism the new pope urban vi summoned her to rome
she stayed at pope urban vi s court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy both meeting with individuals at court and writing letters to persuade others
for many years she had accustomed herself to a rigorous abstinence
she received the holy eucharist almost daily
this extreme fasting appeared unhealthy in the eyes of the clergy and her own sisterhood
her confessor raymond ordered her to eat properly
but catherine claimed that she was unable to describing her inability to eat as an infermit illness
from the beginning of catherine could neither eat nor swallow water
on february she lost the use of her legs
catherine died in rome on april at the age of thirty three having eight days earlier suffered a massive stroke which paralyzed her from the waist down
her last words were father into your hands i commend my soul and my spirit
there is some internal evidence of catherine s personality teaching and work in her nearly four hundred letters her dialogue and her prayers
much detail about her life has also however been drawn from the various sources written shortly after her death in order to promote her cult and canonization
though much of this material is heavily hagiographic it has been an important source for historians seeking to reconstruct catherine s life
various sources are particularly important especially the works of raymond of capua who was catherine s spiritual director and close friend from until her death and himself became master general of the order in
raymond wrote what is known as the legenda major his life of catherine which was completed in fifteen years after catherine s death
another important work written after catherine s death was libellus de supplemento little supplement book written between and by tommaso d antonio nacci da siena commonly called thomas of siena or tommaso caffarini the work is an expansion of raymond s legenda major making heavy use of the notes of catherine s first confessor tommaso della fonte notes that do not survive anywhere else
caffarini later published a more compact account of catherine s life entitled the legenda minor
from onwards caffarini also coordinated the compiling of the processus of venice the set of documents submitted as part of the process of canonisation of catherine which provides testimony from nearly all of catherine s disciples
there is also an anonymous piece entitled miracoli della beata caterina miracle of blessed catherine written by an anonymous florentine
a few other relevant pieces survive
three genres of work by catherine survive
her major treatise is the dialogue of divine providence
this had probably begun in october and was certainly finished by november
contemporaries of catherine are united in asserting that much of the book was dictated while catherine was in ecstasy though it also seems possible that catherine herself may then have re edited many passages in the book
it is a dialogue between a soul who rises up to god and god himself
catherine s letters are considered one of the great works of early tuscan literature
many of these were dictated although she herself learned to write in have survived
in her letters to the pope she often addressed him affectionately simply as babbo daddy instead of the formal form of address your holiness
other correspondents include her various confessors among them raymond of capua the kings of france and hungary the infamous mercenary john hawkwood the queen of naples members of the visconti family of milan and numerous religious figures
approximately one third of her letters are to women
twenty six prayers of catherine of siena also survive mostly composed in the last eighteen months of her life the university of alcal conserves a unique handwritten spanish manuscript while other available texts are printed copies collected by the national library of france
catherine s theology can be described as mystical and was employed towards practical ends for her own spiritual life or those of others
she used the language of medieval scholastic philosophy to elaborate her experiential mysticism
interested mainly with achieving an incorporeal union with god catherine practiced extreme fasting and asceticism eventually to the extent of living solely off the eucharist every day
for catherine this practice was the means to fully realize her love of christ in her mystical experience with a large proportion of her ecstatic visions relating to the consumption or rejection of food during her life
she viewed christ as a bridge between the soul and god and transmitted that idea along with her other teachings in her book the dialogue
the dialogue is highly systematic and explanatory in its presentation of her mystical ideas however these ideas themselves are not so much based on reason or logic as they are based in her ecstatic mystical experience
in one of her letters she sent to her confessor raymund of capua she recorded this revelation from her conversation with christ in which he said do you know what you are to me and what i am to you my daughter i am he who is you are she who is not
this mystical concept of god as the wellspring of being is seen in the works and ideas of aquinas and can be seen as a simplistic rendering of apotheosis and a more rudimentary form of the doctrine of divine simplicity
she describes god in her work the dialogues as a sea in which we are the fish the point being that the relationship between god and man should not be seen as man contending against the divine and vice versa but as god being the endless being that supports all things
she was buried in the roman cemetery of santa maria sopra minerva which lies near the pantheon
after miracles were reported to take place at her grave raymond moved her inside the basilica of santa maria sopra minerva where she lies to this day
her head however was parted from her body and inserted in a gilt bust of bronze
this bust was later taken to siena and carried through that city in a procession to the dominican church
behind the bust walked lapa catherine s mother who lived until she was years old
by then she had seen the end of the wealth and the happiness of her family and followed most of her children and several of her grandchildren to the grave
she helped raymond of capua write his biography of her daughter and said i think god has laid my soul athwart in my body so that it can t get out the incorrupt head and thumb were entombed in the basilica of san domenico at siena where they remain
pope pius ii himself from siena canonized catherine on june
on october pope paul vi named catherine a doctor of the church this title was almost simultaneously given to teresa of vila september making them the first women to receive this honour
initially however her feast day was not included in the general roman calendar
when it was added in it was put on the day of her death april however because this conflicted with the feast of saint peter of verona which also fell on april catherine s feast day was moved in to the new date of april
in the revision of the calendar it was decided to leave the celebration of the feast of st peter of verona to local calendars because he was not as well known worldwide and catherine s feast was restored to april
catherine is remembered in the church of england with a lesser festival on april
in his decree of april pope pius ix declared catherine of siena to be a co patroness of rome
on june pope pius xii named her a joint patron saint of italy along with saint francis of assisi
on october pope john paul ii made her one of europe s patron saints along with saint teresa benedicta of the cross and saint bridget of sweden
she is also the patroness of the historically catholic american woman s fraternity theta phi alpha
the people of siena wished to have catherine s body
a story is told of a miracle whereby they were partially successful knowing that they could not smuggle her whole body out of rome they decided to take only her head which they placed in a bag
when stopped by the roman guards they prayed to catherine to help them confident that she would rather have her body or at least part thereof in siena
when they opened the bag to show the guards it appeared no longer to hold her head but to be full of rose petals
catherine ranks high among the mystics and spiritual writers of the church
she remains a greatly respected figure for her spiritual writings and political boldness to speak truth to power it being exceptional for a woman in her time period to have had such influence in politics and on world history
the main churches in honor of catherine of siena are
santa maria sopra minerva in rome place where her body is preserved
basilica of san domenico in siena in this church the incorrupt head of catherine of siena is preserved
shrine of saint catherine it in siena complex of religious buildings built around the birthplace of catherine
modern editions and english translations
the italian critical edition of the dialogue is catherine of siena il dialogo della divina provvidenza ovvero libro della divina dottrina nd ed ed
giuliana cavallini siena cantagalli
st edn cavallini demonstrated that the standard division of the dialogue in into four treatises entitled the treatise on discretion on prayer on providence and on obedience was in fact a result of a misreading of the text in the edition of the dialogue
modern editors and translators including noffke have followed cavallini in rejecting this fourfold division
the italian critical edition of the prayers is catherine of siena le orazioni ed
