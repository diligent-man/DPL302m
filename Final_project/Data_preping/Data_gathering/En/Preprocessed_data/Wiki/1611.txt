born in paris into an affluent bourgeois family chausson was the sole surviving child of a building contractor who made his fortune assisting baron haussmann in the redevelopment of paris in the s
to please his father chausson studied law and was appointed a barrister for the court of appeals but had little or no interest in the profession
he frequented the paris salons where he met celebrities such as henri fantin latour odilon redon and vincent d indy
before deciding on a musical career he dabbled in writing and drawing
in at the age of he began attending the composition classes of jules massenet at the paris conservatoire massenet came to regard him as an exceptional person and a true artist
he had already composed some piano pieces and songs
nevertheless the earliest manuscripts that have been preserved are those corrected by massenet
at the conservatoire chausson also studied with c sar franck with whom he formed a close friendship that lasted until franck s death in
chausson interrupted his studies in after a failed attempt to win the prix de rome
during and chausson who enjoyed travel visited bayreuth to hear the operas of richard wagner
on the first of these journeys he went with d indy for the premiere of wagner s parsifal and on the second trip he went with his new spouse jeanne escudier with whom he was to have five children
from until his death in chausson was secretary of the soci t nationale de musique
in his own home boulevard de courcelles near parc monceau he received a great many eminent artists including the composers henri duparc gabriel faur claude debussy and isaac alb niz poet st phane mallarm russian novelist ivan turgenev and impressionist painter claude monet
chausson also assembled an important collection of paintings
when only years old chausson died while staying at one of his country retreats the ch teau de moussets in limay yvelines
riding his bicycle downhill chausson hit a brick wall and died instantly
the exact circumstances remain unclear although probably an accident there has been the suggestion of suicide as chausson was prone to depression
this suicide theory was propounded by debussy s biographer edward lockspeiser but has been firmly rejected more recently by chausson s own biographer ralph scott grover
ironically when he was chausson jotted into his diary i have the premonition that my life will be short
i m far from complaining about it but i should not want to die before having done something
chausson was buried in p re lachaise cemetery in paris
his funeral was attended by many leading figures of the arts including duparc gabriel faur isaac alb niz redon edgar degas auguste rodin henri de r gnier pierre lou s and claude debussy
while chausson s brotherly relationship with debussy had ended abruptly five years earlier following his disapproval of debussy s promiscuity debussy never ceased to admire chausson s music
a small park square ernest chausson in the th arrondissement of paris is named in his honour
the creative work of chausson is commonly divided into three periods
in the first his output was stylistically dominated by the influence of massenet
the second period dating from is marked by a more dramatic character deriving partly from chausson s contacts with the artistic milieux in which he moved
from his father s death in dates the beginning of his third period during which he was especially influenced by his reading of the symbolist poets and russian literature particularly turgenev dostoyevsky and tolstoy
chausson s work is deeply individual but it does reflect some technical influences of both wagner and his other musical hero franck
stylistic traces not only of massenet but also of brahms can be detected sometimes
in general chausson s compositional idiom bridges the gap between the ripe romanticism of massenet and franck and the more introverted impressionism of debussy
several delicate and admirable songs came from chausson s pen
he completed one opera le roi arthus king arthur
his orchestral output was small but significant
it includes the symphonic poem viviane the symphony in b flat his sole symphony po me for violin and orchestra an important piece in the violin repertoire and the dramatic and haunting song cycle po me de l amour et de la mer
chausson is believed to be the first composer to use the celesta
he employed that instrument in december in his incidental music written for a small orchestra for la temp te a french translation by maurice bouchor of shakespeare s the tempest
not at all prolific chausson left behind only opus numbered pieces
musical creation for him always proved to be a long painful struggle
however the quality and originality of his compositions are consistently high and several of his works continue to make occasional appearances on programmes of leading singers chamber music ensembles and orchestras
there are moments when i feel myself driven by a kind of feverish instinct as if i had the presentiment of being unable to attain my goal or of attaining it too late ernest chausson
