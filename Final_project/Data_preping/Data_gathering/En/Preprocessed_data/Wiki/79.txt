a razor is a bladed tool primarily used in the removal of body hair through the act of shaving
kinds of razors include straight razors safety razors disposable razors and electric razors
while the razor has been in existence since before the bronze age the oldest razor like object has been dated to bc the most common types of razors in current usage are the safety razor and the electric razor though other kinds are still in use
razors have been identified from many bronze age cultures
these were made of bronze or obsidian and were generally oval in shape with a small tang protruding from one of the short ends
various forms of razors were used throughout history which are different in appearance but similar in use to modern straight razors
in prehistoric times clam shells shark teeth and flint were sharpened and used to shave with
drawings of such blades were found in prehistoric caves
some tribes still use blades made of flint to this day
excavations in egypt have unearthed solid gold and copper razors in tombs dating back to the th millennium bc
razors were used and manufactured in kerma during the bronze age several razors as well as other personal hygiene artifacts were recovered from bronze age burials in northern europe and are believed to belong to high status individuals
the roman historian livy reported that the razor was introduced in ancient rome in the th century bc
by legendary king lucius tarquinius priscus
priscus was ahead of his time because razors did not come to general use until a century later
the first modern straight razor complete with decorated handles and hollow ground blades was constructed in sheffield in england the centre of the cutlery industry in the th and th centuries
benjamin huntsman produced the first superior hard steel grade through a special crucible process suitable for use as blade material in though it was first rejected in england
huntsman s process was adopted by the french sometime later albeit reluctantly at first because of nationalist sentiments
the english manufacturers were even more reluctant than the french to adopt the process and only did so after they saw its success in france
sheffield steel a highly polished steel also known as sheffield silver steel and famous for its deep gloss finish is considered a superior quality steel and is still used to this day in france by such manufacturers as thiers issard
in the th and th centuries the wealthy had servants to shave them or could frequent barbershops
daily shaving was not a widespread practice in the th century so some people never shaved
the custom of shaving every day among american men is a th century innovation which was started after world war i
men were required to shave daily so their gas masks would fit properly and this became much easier with the advent of the safety razor which was standard issue during the war
in the th century cutlers in sheffield england and solingen germany produced a variety of razors
straight razors were the most common form of shaving before the th century and remained common in many countries until the s
barbers were specially trained to give customers a thorough and quick shave and a collection of straight razors ready for use was a common sight in most barbershops
barbers still have them but they use them less often
straight razors eventually fell out of fashion
their first challenger was manufactured by king c
gillette a double edged safety razor with replaceable blades
gillette s idea was the use of the loss leader concept in which the razors were sold at a loss but the replacement blades earned a high margin and provided continuous sales
they were immensely successful because of advertising campaigns and slogans denigrating the straight razor s effectiveness and questioning its safety
these new safety razors did not require any serious tutelage to use
the blades were extremely hard to sharpen and were meant to be thrown away after one use and rusted quickly if not discarded
they also required a smaller initial investment though they cost more over time
despite its long term advantages the straight razor lost significant market share
and as shaving became less intimidating and men began to shave themselves more the demand for barbers providing straight razor shaves decreased
in stainless steel blades which could be used more than once became available reducing the cost of safety razor shaving
the first such blades were made by the wilkinson firm famous maker of ceremonial swords in sheffield
soon gillette schick and other manufacturers were making stainless steel blades
these were followed by multiple blade cartridges and disposable razors
for each type of replaceable blade there is generally a disposable razor
in the s electric razors became available
these can rival the cost of a good straight razor although the whole straight razor shaving kit can exceed the cost of even an expensive electric razor
straight razors with open steel blades also commonly known as cut throats were the most commonly used razors before the th century
straight razors consist of a blade sharpened on one edge
the blade can be made of either stainless steel which is slower to hone and strop but it is easier to maintain since it does not stain easily or high carbon steel which hones and strops quickly and keeps its edge well but rusts and stains easily if not cleaned and dried promptly
at present stainless steel razors are harder to find than carbon steel but both remain in production
the blade rotates on a pin through its tang between two protective pieces called scales when folded into the scales the blade is protected from damage and the user is protected
handle scales are made of various materials including mother of pearl celluloid bone plastic and wood
once made of ivory this has been discontinued although fossil ivory is used occasionally
these razors are similar in use and appearance to straight razors but use disposable blades either standard double edged cut in half or specially made single edge
these shavettes are used in the same way as straight razors but do not require stropping and honing
the first step towards a safer to use razor was the guard razor also called a straight safety razor which added a protective guard to a regular straight razor
the first such razor was most likely invented by a french cutler jean jacques perret circa
the invention was inspired by the joiner s plane and was essentially a straight razor with its blade surrounded by a wooden sleeve
the earliest razor guards had comb like teeth and could only be attached to one side of a razor a reversible guard was one of the first improvements made to guard razors
an early description of a safety razor similar in form to the ones used today is found on william samuel henson s patent application for a comb tooth guard
this guard could be attached to a straight razor or to a razor the cutting blade which is at right angles with the handle and resembles somewhat the form of a common hoe
around a new design with a smaller blade placed on top of a handle was marketed by the kampfe brothers as the best available shaving method on the market that won t cut a user like straight steel razors
the term safety razor was first used in and described a basic razor with a handle attached to a head where a removable blade may be placed
the edge was then protected by a comb patterned on the head to protect the skin
in the more modern day produced safety razors the comb is now more commonly replaced by a safety bar
there are two types of safety razors the single edged and the double edged
the single edged razor is essentially a centimetre in long segment of a straight razor
the double edged safety razor is a razor with a slant bar that can be used on both sides with two open edges
the blade on the double edged safety razor is slightly curved to allow for a smoother and cleaner shave
in the american inventor king camp gillette with the assistance of william nickerson submitted a patent of a new variation of safety razor with disposable blades which was patented in
one reason was that shaving with a safety razor should be safer and more convenient than shaving with a classic straight razor with a sharp blade
the thick grip of these safety razors can be reused
gillette realized that a profit could be made by selling an inexpensive razor with disposable blades
this has been called the razor and blades business model and has become a very common practice for a wide variety of products
many other brands of safety razors have come and gone
much of the competition was based on designing blades that would fit only one style of razor until the blade shape was standardized by the inclusion of a multi faceted central channel to the blade which would accommodate the various designs of blade securing systems e g
three pins a slender metal bar etc
even today these various securing forms still persist in their variety in de razors all accepting the same universal blade design
exploiting the same razor and blades business model as pioneered in the early th century cartridge razors were developed in the s and are now the most common form of shaving in developed countries
although designed to have a more ergonomic shape at both the handle and head including commonly a pivoted head which keeps the blades angled to the skin at a pre determined angle through the shaving motion the concept is very similar to that of the double edge razor
however here the entire head assembly known as a cartridge is removed and disposed of not just the blade
also it is common for these cartridge heads to have multiple razor blades set into them commonly between two and five blades
disposable safety razors are highly similar in design to cartridge razors constructed from inexpensive materials commonly injection moulded polycarbonate yet are meant to be wholly disposable after use with no blade sharpening or replacement possible
one device was invented in by american entertainer and inventor paul winchell
safety razor life may be extended by drying the blades after use
the electric razor also known as the electric dry shaver has a rotating or oscillating blade
the electric razor usually does not require the use of shaving cream soap or water
the razor may be powered by a small dc motor which is either powered by batteries or mains electricity
many modern ones are powered using rechargeable batteries
alternatively an electro mechanical oscillator driven by an ac energized solenoid may be used
some very early mechanical shavers had no electric motor and had to be powered by hand for example by pulling a cord to drive a flywheel
the first electric razor was invented by john f
o rourke in
industrial production of electric razor machines started in by the us company remington rand based on the patent of jacob schick from
since the dutch company philips has produced electric razor machines
one of the main differences between electric razors is the shaving technology they use
usually electric shaving machines use several round rotating shaving blades or a horizontally shaver s foil and cutter block technology
thick rigid single edged razors such as utility knives are used for various hand held tasks
applications include detailed carpentry work like sanding and scraping in a specialized holder paper cutting for technical drawing plumbing and finish work such as grouting and cleaning and removing paint from flat surfaces such as panes of glass
unlike shaving razors the industrial grade blades used in these tools are usually made from a non stainless steel like carbon steel and have a tougher and duller edge
