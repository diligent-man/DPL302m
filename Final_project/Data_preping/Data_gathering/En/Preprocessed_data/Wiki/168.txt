the calculus of variations is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations which are small changes in functions
and functionals to find maxima and minima of functionals mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers
functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives
functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the euler lagrange equation of the calculus of variations
a simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points
if there are no constraints the solution is a straight line between the points
however if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space then the solution is less obvious and possibly many solutions may exist
such solutions are known as geodesics
a related problem is posed by fermat s principle light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points which depends upon the material of the medium
one corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least stationary action
many important problems involve functions of several variables
solutions of boundary value problems for the laplace equation satisfy the dirichlet s principle
plateau s problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in a solution of soap suds
although such experiments are relatively easy to perform their mathematical interpretation is far from simple there may be more than one locally minimizing surface and they may have non trivial topology
the calculus of variations may be said to begin with newton s minimal resistance problem in followed by the brachistochrone curve problem raised by johann bernoulli
it immediately occupied the attention of jakob bernoulli and the marquis de l h pital but leonhard euler first elaborated the subject beginning in
lagrange was influenced by euler s work to contribute significantly to the theory
after euler saw the work of the year old lagrange euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of lagrange s purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the calculus of variations in his lecture elementa calculi variationum
legendre laid down a method not entirely satisfactory for the discrimination of maxima and minima
isaac newton and gottfried leibniz also gave some early attention to the subject
to this discrimination vincenzo brunacci carl friedrich gauss sim on poisson mikhail ostrogradsky and carl jacobi have been among the contributors
an important general work is that of sarrus which was condensed and improved by cauchy
other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by strauch jellett otto hesse alfred clebsch and lewis buffett carll but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of weierstrass
his celebrated course on the theory is epoch making and it may be asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation
the th and the rd hilbert problem published in encouraged further development
in the th century david hilbert oskar bolza gilbert ames bliss emmy noether leonida tonelli henri lebesgue and jacques hadamard among others made significant contributions
marston morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called morse theory
lev pontryagin ralph rockafellar and f
clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory
the dynamic programming of richard bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations
the calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima collectively called extrema of functionals
a functional maps functions to scalars so functionals have been described as functions of functions functionals have extrema with respect to the elements
displaystyle y
of a given function space defined over a given domain
a functional
displaystyle j y
is said to have an extremum at the function
displaystyle f
displaystyle delta j j y j f
has the same sign for all
displaystyle y
in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of
displaystyle f
the function
displaystyle f
is called an extremal function or extremal
the extremum
displaystyle j f
is called a local maximum if
displaystyle delta j leq
everywhere in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of
displaystyle f
and a local minimum if
displaystyle delta j geq
there
for a function space of continuous functions extrema of corresponding functionals are called strong extrema or weak extrema depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not
both strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of the functions in the space be continuous
thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum but the converse may not hold
finding strong extrema is more difficult than finding weak extrema
an example of a necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the euler lagrange equation
finding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions
the maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes i e is equal to zero
the extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the functional derivative is equal to zero
this leads to solving the associated euler lagrange equation
consider the functional
displaystyle j y int x x l left x y x y x right dx
where
displaystyle x x
are constants
displaystyle y x
is twice continuously differentiable
displaystyle y x frac dy dx
displaystyle l left x y x y x right
is twice continuously differentiable with respect to its arguments
displaystyle x y
displaystyle y
if the functional
displaystyle j y
attains a local minimum at
displaystyle f
displaystyle eta x
is an arbitrary function that has at least one derivative and vanishes at the endpoints
displaystyle x
displaystyle x
then for any number
displaystyle varepsilon
close to
displaystyle j f leq j f varepsilon eta
the term
displaystyle varepsilon eta
is called the variation of the function
displaystyle f
and is denoted by
displaystyle delta f
substituting
displaystyle f varepsilon eta
displaystyle y
in the functional
displaystyle j y
the result is a function of
displaystyle varepsilon
displaystyle phi varepsilon j f varepsilon eta
since the functional
displaystyle j y
has a minimum for
displaystyle y f
the function
displaystyle phi varepsilon
has a minimum at
displaystyle varepsilon
and thus
displaystyle phi equiv left frac d phi d varepsilon right varepsilon int x x left frac dl d varepsilon right varepsilon dx
taking the total derivative of
displaystyle l left x y y right
where
displaystyle y f varepsilon eta
displaystyle y f varepsilon eta
are considered as functions of
displaystyle varepsilon
rather than
displaystyle x
yields
displaystyle frac dl d varepsilon frac partial l partial y frac dy d varepsilon frac partial l partial y frac dy d varepsilon
and because
displaystyle frac dy d varepsilon eta
displaystyle frac dy d varepsilon eta
displaystyle frac dl d varepsilon frac partial l partial y eta frac partial l partial y eta
therefore
displaystyle begin aligned int x x left frac dl d varepsilon right varepsilon dx int x x left frac partial l partial f eta frac partial l partial f eta right dx int x x frac partial l partial f eta dx left frac partial l partial f eta right x x int x x eta frac d dx frac partial l partial f dx int x x left frac partial l partial f eta eta frac d dx frac partial l partial f right dx end aligned
where
displaystyle l left x y y right to l left x f f right
displaystyle varepsilon
and we have used integration by parts on the second term
the second term on the second line vanishes because
displaystyle eta
displaystyle x
displaystyle x
by definition
also as previously mentioned the left side of the equation is zero so that
displaystyle int x x eta x left frac partial l partial f frac d dx frac partial l partial f right dx
according to the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations the part of the integrand in parentheses is zero i e
displaystyle frac partial l partial f frac d dx frac partial l partial f
which is called the euler lagrange equation
the left hand side of this equation is called the functional derivative of
displaystyle j f
and is denoted
displaystyle delta j delta f x
in general this gives a second order ordinary differential equation which can be solved to obtain the extremal function
displaystyle f x
the euler lagrange equation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for an extremum
displaystyle j f
a sufficient condition for a minimum is given in the section variations and sufficient condition for a minimum
in order to illustrate this process consider the problem of finding the extremal function
displaystyle y f x
which is the shortest curve that connects two points
displaystyle left x y right
displaystyle left x y right
the arc length of the curve is given by
displaystyle a y int x x sqrt y x dx
displaystyle y x frac dy dx y f x y f x
note that assuming y is a function of x loses generality ideally both should be a function of some other parameter
this approach is good solely for instructive purposes
the euler lagrange equation will now be used to find the extremal function
displaystyle f x
that minimizes the functional
displaystyle a y
displaystyle frac partial l partial f frac d dx frac partial l partial f
displaystyle l sqrt f x
since
displaystyle f
does not appear explicitly in
displaystyle l
the first term in the euler lagrange equation vanishes for all
displaystyle f x
and thus
displaystyle frac d dx frac partial l partial f
substituting for
displaystyle l
and taking the derivative
displaystyle frac d dx frac f x sqrt f x
displaystyle frac f x sqrt f x c
for some constant
displaystyle c
displaystyle frac f x f x c
where
displaystyle leq c
solving we get
displaystyle f x frac c c
which implies that
displaystyle f x m
is a constant and therefore that the shortest curve that connects two points
displaystyle left x y right
displaystyle left x y right
displaystyle f x mx b qquad text with m frac y y x x quad text and quad b frac x y x y x x
and we have thus found the extremal function
displaystyle f x
that minimizes the functional
displaystyle a y
so that
displaystyle a f
is a minimum
the equation for a straight line is
displaystyle y f x
in other words the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
in physics problems it may be the case that
displaystyle frac partial l partial x
meaning the integrand is a function of
displaystyle f x
displaystyle f x
displaystyle x
does not appear separately
in that case the euler lagrange equation can be simplified to the beltrami identity
displaystyle l f frac partial l partial f c
where
displaystyle c
is a constant
the left hand side is the legendre transformation of
displaystyle l
with respect to
displaystyle f x
the intuition behind this result is that if the variable
displaystyle x
is actually time then the statement
displaystyle frac partial l partial x
implies that the lagrangian is time independent
by noether s theorem there is an associated conserved quantity
in this case this quantity is the hamiltonian the legendre transform of the lagrangian which often coincides with the energy of the system
this is minus the constant in beltrami s identity
displaystyle s
depends on higher derivatives of
displaystyle y x
that is if
displaystyle s int a b f x y x y x dots y n x dx
displaystyle y
must satisfy the euler poisson equation
displaystyle frac partial f partial y frac d dx left frac partial f partial y right dots n frac d n dx n left frac partial f partial y n right
the discussion thus far has assumed that extremal functions possess two continuous derivatives although the existence of the integral
displaystyle j
requires only first derivatives of trial functions
the condition that the first variation vanishes at an extremal may be regarded as a weak form of the euler lagrange equation
the theorem of du bois reymond asserts that this weak form implies the strong form
displaystyle l
has continuous first and second derivatives with respect to all of its arguments and if
displaystyle frac partial l partial f neq
displaystyle f
has two continuous derivatives and it satisfies the euler lagrange equation
hilbert was the first to give good conditions for the euler lagrange equations to give a stationary solution
within a convex area and a positive thrice differentiable lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the euler lagrange equations in the interior
however lavrentiev in showed that there are circumstances where there is no optimum solution but one can be approached arbitrarily closely by increasing numbers of sections
the lavrentiev phenomenon identifies a difference in the infimum of a minimization problem across different classes of admissible functions
for instance the following problem presented by mani in
displaystyle l x int x t x
displaystyle a x in w x x
clearly
displaystyle x t t frac
minimizes the functional but we find any function
displaystyle x in w infty
gives a value bounded away from the infimum
examples in one dimension are traditionally manifested across
displaystyle w
displaystyle w infty
but ball and mizel procured the first functional that displayed lavrentiev s phenomenon across
displaystyle w p
displaystyle w q
displaystyle leq p q infty
there are several results that gives criteria under which the phenomenon does not occur for instance standard growth a lagrangian with no dependence on the second variable or an approximating sequence satisfying cesari s condition d but results are often particular and applicable to a small class of functionals
connected with the lavrentiev phenomenon is the repulsion property any functional displaying lavrentiev s phenomenon will display the weak repulsion property
for example if
displaystyle varphi x y
denotes the displacement of a membrane above the domain
displaystyle d
in the
displaystyle x y
plane then its potential energy is proportional to its surface area
displaystyle u varphi iint d sqrt nabla varphi cdot nabla varphi dx dy
plateau s problem consists of finding a function that minimizes the surface area while assuming prescribed values on the boundary of
displaystyle d
the solutions are called minimal surfaces
the euler lagrange equation for this problem is nonlinear
displaystyle varphi xx varphi y varphi yy varphi x varphi x varphi y varphi xy
see courant for details
it is often sufficient to consider only small displacements of the membrane whose energy difference from no displacement is approximated by
displaystyle v varphi frac iint d nabla varphi cdot nabla varphi dx dy
the functional
displaystyle v
is to be minimized among all trial functions
displaystyle varphi
that assume prescribed values on the boundary of
displaystyle d
displaystyle u
is the minimizing function and
displaystyle v
is an arbitrary smooth function that vanishes on the boundary of
displaystyle d
then the first variation of
displaystyle v u varepsilon v
must vanish
displaystyle left frac d d varepsilon v u varepsilon v right varepsilon iint d nabla u cdot nabla v dx dy
provided that u has two derivatives we may apply the divergence theorem to obtain
displaystyle iint d nabla cdot v nabla u dx dy iint d nabla u cdot nabla v v nabla cdot nabla u dx dy int c v frac partial u partial n ds
where
displaystyle c
is the boundary of
displaystyle d
displaystyle s
is arclength along
displaystyle c
displaystyle partial u partial n
is the normal derivative of
displaystyle u
displaystyle c
since
displaystyle v
vanishes on
displaystyle c
and the first variation vanishes the result is
displaystyle iint d v nabla cdot nabla u dx dy
for all smooth functions v that vanish on the boundary of
displaystyle d
the proof for the case of one dimensional integrals may be adapted to this case to show that
displaystyle nabla cdot nabla u
displaystyle d
the difficulty with this reasoning is the assumption that the minimizing function u must have two derivatives
riemann argued that the existence of a smooth minimizing function was assured by the connection with the physical problem membranes do indeed assume configurations with minimal potential energy
riemann named this idea the dirichlet principle in honor of his teacher peter gustav lejeune dirichlet
however weierstrass gave an example of a variational problem with no solution minimize
displaystyle w varphi int x varphi dx
among all functions
displaystyle varphi
that satisfy
displaystyle varphi
displaystyle varphi
displaystyle w
can be made arbitrarily small by choosing piecewise linear functions that make a transition between and in a small neighborhood of the origin
however there is no function that makes
displaystyle w
eventually it was shown that dirichlet s principle is valid but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations see jost and li jost
a more general expression for the potential energy of a membrane is
displaystyle v varphi iint d left frac nabla varphi cdot nabla varphi f x y varphi right dx dy int c left frac sigma s varphi g s varphi right ds
this corresponds to an external force density
displaystyle f x y
displaystyle d
an external force
displaystyle g s
on the boundary
displaystyle c
and elastic forces with modulus
displaystyle sigma s
acting on
displaystyle c
the function that minimizes the potential energy with no restriction on its boundary values will be denoted by
displaystyle u
provided that
displaystyle f
displaystyle g
are continuous regularity theory implies that the minimizing function
displaystyle u
will have two derivatives
in taking the first variation no boundary condition need be imposed on the increment
displaystyle v
the first variation of
displaystyle v u varepsilon v
is given by
displaystyle iint d left nabla u cdot nabla v fv right dx dy int c left sigma uv gv right ds
if we apply the divergence theorem the result is
displaystyle iint d left v nabla cdot nabla u vf right dx dy int c v left frac partial u partial n sigma u g right ds
if we first set
displaystyle v
displaystyle c
the boundary integral vanishes and we conclude as before that
displaystyle nabla cdot nabla u f
displaystyle d
then if we allow
displaystyle v
to assume arbitrary boundary values this implies that
displaystyle u
must satisfy the boundary condition
displaystyle frac partial u partial n sigma u g
displaystyle c
this boundary condition is a consequence of the minimizing property of
displaystyle u
it is not imposed beforehand
such conditions are called natural boundary conditions
the preceding reasoning is not valid if
displaystyle sigma
vanishes identically on
displaystyle c
in such a case we could allow a trial function
displaystyle varphi equiv c
where
displaystyle c
is a constant
for such a trial function
displaystyle v c c left iint d f dx dy int c g ds right
by appropriate choice of
displaystyle c
displaystyle v
can assume any value unless the quantity inside the brackets vanishes
therefore the variational problem is meaningless unless
displaystyle iint d f dx dy int c g ds
this condition implies that net external forces on the system are in equilibrium
if these forces are in equilibrium then the variational problem has a solution but it is not unique since an arbitrary constant may be added
further details and examples are in courant and hilbert
both one dimensional and multi dimensional eigenvalue problems can be formulated as variational problems
the sturm liouville eigenvalue problem involves a general quadratic form
displaystyle q varphi int x x left p x varphi x q x varphi x right dx
where
displaystyle varphi
is restricted to functions that satisfy the boundary conditions
displaystyle varphi x quad varphi x
displaystyle r
be a normalization integral
displaystyle r varphi int x x r x varphi x dx
the functions
displaystyle p x
displaystyle r x
are required to be everywhere positive and bounded away from zero
the primary variational problem is to minimize the ratio
displaystyle q r
among all
displaystyle varphi
satisfying the endpoint conditions
it is shown below that the euler lagrange equation for the minimizing
displaystyle u
displaystyle pu qu lambda ru
where
displaystyle lambda
is the quotient
displaystyle lambda frac q u r u
it can be shown see gelfand and fomin that the minimizing
displaystyle u
has two derivatives and satisfies the euler lagrange equation
the associated
displaystyle lambda
will be denoted by
displaystyle lambda
it is the lowest eigenvalue for this equation and boundary conditions
the associated minimizing function will be denoted by
displaystyle u x
this variational characterization of eigenvalues leads to the rayleigh ritz method choose an approximating
displaystyle u
as a linear combination of basis functions for example trigonometric functions and carry out a finite dimensional minimization among such linear combinations
this method is often surprisingly accurate
the next smallest eigenvalue and eigenfunction can be obtained by minimizing
displaystyle q
under the additional constraint
displaystyle int x x r x u x varphi x dx
this procedure can be extended to obtain the complete sequence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the problem
the variational problem also applies to more general boundary conditions
instead of requiring that
displaystyle varphi
vanish at the endpoints we may not impose any condition at the endpoints and set
displaystyle q varphi int x x left p x varphi x q x varphi x right dx a varphi x a varphi x
where
displaystyle a
displaystyle a
are arbitrary
if we set
displaystyle varphi u varepsilon v
the first variation for the ratio
displaystyle q r
displaystyle v frac r u left int x x left p x u x v x q x u x v x lambda r x u x v x right dx a u x v x a u x v x right
where is given by the ratio
displaystyle q u r u
as previously
after integration by parts
displaystyle frac r u v int x x v x left pu qu lambda ru right dx v x p x u x a u x v x p x u x a u x
if we first require that
displaystyle v
vanish at the endpoints the first variation will vanish for all such
displaystyle v
only if
displaystyle pu qu lambda ru quad hbox for quad x x x
displaystyle u
satisfies this condition then the first variation will vanish for arbitrary
displaystyle v
only if
displaystyle p x u x a u x quad hbox and quad p x u x a u x
these latter conditions are the natural boundary conditions for this problem since they are not imposed on trial functions for the minimization but are instead a consequence of the minimization
eigenvalue problems in higher dimensions are defined in analogy with the one dimensional case
for example given a domain
displaystyle d
with boundary
displaystyle b
in three dimensions we may define
displaystyle q varphi iiint d p x nabla varphi cdot nabla varphi q x varphi dx dy dz iint b sigma s varphi ds
displaystyle r varphi iiint d r x varphi x dx dy dz
displaystyle u
be the function that minimizes the quotient
displaystyle q varphi r varphi
with no condition prescribed on the boundary
displaystyle b
the euler lagrange equation satisfied by
displaystyle u
displaystyle nabla cdot p x nabla u q x u lambda r x u
where
displaystyle lambda frac q u r u
the minimizing
displaystyle u
must also satisfy the natural boundary condition
displaystyle p s frac partial u partial n sigma s u
on the boundary
displaystyle b
this result depends upon the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations see jost and li jost for details
many extensions including completeness results asymptotic properties of the eigenvalues and results concerning the nodes of the eigenfunctions are in courant and hilbert
fermat s principle states that light takes a path that locally minimizes the optical length between its endpoints
if the
displaystyle x
coordinate is chosen as the parameter along the path and
displaystyle y f x
along the path then the optical length is given by
displaystyle a f int x x n x f x sqrt f x dx
where the refractive index
displaystyle n x y
depends upon the material
if we try
displaystyle f x f x varepsilon f x
then the first variation of
displaystyle a
the derivative of
displaystyle a
with respect to is
displaystyle delta a f f int x x left frac n x f f x f x sqrt f x n y x f f sqrt f x right dx
after integration by parts of the first term within brackets we obtain the euler lagrange equation
displaystyle frac d dx left frac n x f f sqrt f right n y x f sqrt f x
the light rays may be determined by integrating this equation
this formalism is used in the context of lagrangian optics and hamiltonian optics
there is a discontinuity of the refractive index when light enters or leaves a lens
displaystyle n x y begin cases n text if quad x n text if quad x end cases
where
displaystyle n
displaystyle n
are constants
then the euler lagrange equation holds as before in the region where
displaystyle x
displaystyle x
and in fact the path is a straight line there since the refractive index is constant
at the
displaystyle x
displaystyle f
must be continuous but
displaystyle f
may be discontinuous
after integration by parts in the separate regions and using the euler lagrange equations the first variation takes the form
displaystyle delta a f f f left n frac f sqrt f n frac f sqrt f right
the factor multiplying
displaystyle n
is the sine of angle of the incident ray with the
displaystyle x
axis and the factor multiplying
displaystyle n
is the sine of angle of the refracted ray with the
displaystyle x
snell s law for refraction requires that these terms be equal
as this calculation demonstrates snell s law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of the optical path length
it is expedient to use vector notation let
displaystyle x x x x
displaystyle t
be a parameter let
displaystyle x t
be the parametric representation of a curve
displaystyle c
and let
displaystyle dot x t
be its tangent vector
the optical length of the curve is given by
displaystyle a c int t t n x sqrt dot x cdot dot x dt
note that this integral is invariant with respect to changes in the parametric representation of
displaystyle c
the euler lagrange equations for a minimizing curve have the symmetric form
displaystyle frac d dt p sqrt dot x cdot dot x nabla n
where
displaystyle p frac n x dot x sqrt dot x cdot dot x
it follows from the definition that
displaystyle p
satisfies
displaystyle p cdot p n x
therefore the integral may also be written as
displaystyle a c int t t p cdot dot x dt
this form suggests that if we can find a function
displaystyle psi
whose gradient is given by
displaystyle p
then the integral
displaystyle a
is given by the difference of
displaystyle psi
at the endpoints of the interval of integration
thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related to the study of the level surfaces of
displaystyle psi
in order to find such a function we turn to the wave equation which governs the propagation of light
this formalism is used in the context of lagrangian optics and hamiltonian optics
the wave equation for an inhomogeneous medium is
displaystyle u tt c nabla cdot nabla u
where
displaystyle c
is the velocity which generally depends upon
displaystyle x
wave fronts for light are characteristic surfaces for this partial differential equation they satisfy
displaystyle varphi t c x nabla varphi cdot nabla varphi
we may look for solutions in the form
displaystyle varphi t x t psi x
in that case
displaystyle psi
satisfies
displaystyle nabla psi cdot nabla psi n
where
displaystyle n c
according to the theory of first order partial differential equations if
displaystyle p nabla psi
displaystyle p
satisfies
displaystyle frac dp ds n nabla n
along a system of curves the light rays that are given by
displaystyle frac dx ds p
these equations for solution of a first order partial differential equation are identical to the euler lagrange equations if we make the identification
displaystyle frac ds dt frac sqrt dot x cdot dot x n
we conclude that the function
displaystyle psi
is the value of the minimizing integral
displaystyle a
as a function of the upper end point
that is when a family of minimizing curves is constructed the values of the optical length satisfy the characteristic equation corresponding the wave equation
hence solving the associated partial differential equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem
this is the essential content of the hamilton jacobi theory which applies to more general variational problems
in classical mechanics the action
displaystyle s
is defined as the time integral of the lagrangian
displaystyle l
the lagrangian is the difference of energies
displaystyle l t u
where
displaystyle t
is the kinetic energy of a mechanical system and
displaystyle u
its potential energy
hamilton s principle or the action principle states that the motion of a conservative holonomic integrable constraints mechanical system is such that the action integral
displaystyle s int t t l x dot x t dt
is stationary with respect to variations in the path
displaystyle x t
the euler lagrange equations for this system are known as lagrange s equations
displaystyle frac d dt frac partial l partial dot x frac partial l partial x
and they are equivalent to newton s equations of motion for such systems
the conjugate momenta
displaystyle p
are defined by
displaystyle p frac partial l partial dot x
for example if
displaystyle t frac m dot x
displaystyle p m dot x
hamiltonian mechanics results if the conjugate momenta are introduced in place of
displaystyle dot x
by a legendre transformation of the lagrangian
displaystyle l
into the hamiltonian
displaystyle h
defined by
displaystyle h x p t p dot x l x dot x t
the hamiltonian is the total energy of the system
displaystyle h t u
analogy with fermat s principle suggests that solutions of lagrange s equations the particle trajectories may be described in terms of level surfaces of some function of
displaystyle x
this function is a solution of the hamilton jacobi equation
displaystyle frac partial psi partial t h left x frac partial psi partial x t right

finite element method is a variational method for finding numerical solutions to boundary value problems in differential equations
total variation denoising an image processing method for filtering high variance or noisy signals calculus of variations is concerned with variations of functionals which are small changes in the functional s value due to small changes in the function that is its argument
the first variation is defined as the linear part of the change in the functional and the second variation is defined as the quadratic part
for example if
displaystyle j y
is a functional with the function
displaystyle y y x
as its argument and there is a small change in its argument from
displaystyle y
displaystyle y h
where
displaystyle h h x
is a function in the same function space as
displaystyle y
then the corresponding change in the functional is
displaystyle delta j h j y h j y
the functional
displaystyle j y
is said to be differentiable if
displaystyle delta j h varphi h varepsilon h
where
displaystyle varphi h
is a linear functional
displaystyle h
is the norm of
displaystyle h
displaystyle varepsilon to
displaystyle h to
the linear functional
displaystyle varphi h
is the first variation of
displaystyle j y
and is denoted by
displaystyle delta j h varphi h
the functional
displaystyle j y
is said to be twice differentiable if
displaystyle delta j h varphi h varphi h varepsilon h
where
displaystyle varphi h
is a linear functional the first variation
displaystyle varphi h
is a quadratic functional and
displaystyle varepsilon to
displaystyle h to
the quadratic functional
displaystyle varphi h
is the second variation of
displaystyle j y
and is denoted by
displaystyle delta j h varphi h
the second variation
displaystyle delta j h
is said to be strongly positive if
displaystyle delta j h geq k h
for all
displaystyle h
and for some constant
displaystyle k
using the above definitions especially the definitions of first variation second variation and strongly positive the following sufficient condition for a minimum of a functional can be stated
