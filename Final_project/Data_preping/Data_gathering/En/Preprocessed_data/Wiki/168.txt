calculus variation concerned maximum minimum collectively called extremum functionals
functional map function scalar functionals described function function functionals extremum respect elements
function space continuous function extremum corresponding functionals called strong extremum weak extremum depending whether first derivative continuous function respectively continuous not
strong weak extremum functionals space continuous function strong extremum additional requirement first derivative function space continuous

maximum minimum function may located finding point derivative vanishes ie equal zero
extremum functionals may obtained finding function functional derivative equal zero
