The calculus of variations is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations which are small changes in functions
and functionals to find maxima and minima of functionals mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the Euler Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations
A simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points If there are no constraints the solution is a straight line between the points However if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space then the solution is less obvious and possibly many solutions may exist Such solutions are known as geodesics A related problem is posed by Fermat's principle light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points which depends upon the material of the medium One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of leaststationary action
Many important problems involve functions of several variables Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet's principle Plateau's problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in a solution of soap suds Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform their mathematical interpretation is far from simple there may be more than one locally minimizing surface and they may have non trivial topology
The calculus of variations may be said to begin with Newton's minimal resistance problem in followed by the brachistochrone curve problem raised by Johann Bernoulli It immediately occupied the attention of Jakob Bernoulli and the Marquis de l'Hôpital but Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject beginning in Lagrange was influenced by Euler's work to contribute significantly to the theory After Euler saw the work of the year old Lagrange Euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of Lagrange's purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the calculus of variations in his lecture Elementa Calculi Variationum
Legendre laid down a method not entirely satisfactory for the discrimination of maxima and minima Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz also gave some early attention to the subject To this discrimination Vincenzo Brunacci Carl Friedrich Gauss Siméon Poisson Mikhail Ostrogradsky and Carl Jacobi have been among the contributors An important general work is that of Sarrus which was condensed and improved by Cauchy Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by Strauch Jellett Otto Hesse Alfred Clebsch and Lewis Buffett Carll but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Weierstrass His celebrated course on the theory is epoch making and it may be asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation The th and the rd Hilbert problem published in encouraged further development
In the th century David Hilbert Oskar Bolza Gilbert Ames Bliss Emmy Noether Leonida Tonelli Henri Lebesgue and Jacques Hadamard among others made significant contributions Marston Morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called Morse theory Lev Pontryagin Ralph Rockafellar and F H Clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory The dynamic programming of Richard Bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations
The calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima collectively called extrema of functionals A functional maps functions to scalars so functionals have been described as functions of functions Functionals have extrema with respect to the elements
of a given function space defined over a given domain A functional
is said to have an extremum at the function
is called an extremal function or extremal The extremum
everywhere in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of
there For a function space of continuous functions extrema of corresponding functionals are called strong extrema or weak extrema depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not
Both strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of the functions in the space be continuous Thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum but the converse may not hold Finding strong extrema is more difficult than finding weak extrema An example of a necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the Euler Lagrange equation
Finding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes ie is equal to zero The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the functional derivative is equal to zero This leads to solving the associated Euler Lagrange equation
is twice continuously differentiable with respect to its arguments
is an arbitrary function that has at least one derivative and vanishes at the endpoints
is called the variation of the function

and we have used integration by parts on the second term The second term on the second line vanishes because
by definition Also as previously mentioned the left side of the equation is zero so that
displaystyle int xxeta xleftfrac partial Lpartial f frac ddxfrac partial Lpartial f'rightdx=
According to the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations the part of the integrand in parentheses is zero ie
displaystyle frac partial Lpartial f frac ddxfrac partial Lpartial f'=
which is called the Euler Lagrange equation The left hand side of this equation is called the functional derivative of
In general this gives a second order ordinary differential equation which can be solved to obtain the extremal function
The Euler Lagrange equation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for an extremum
A sufficient condition for a minimum is given in the section Variations and sufficient condition for a minimum
In order to illustrate this process consider the problem of finding the extremal function
which is the shortest curve that connects two points
The arc length of the curve is given by
Note that assuming y is a function of x loses generality ideally both should be a function of some other parameter This approach is good solely for instructive purposes
The Euler Lagrange equation will now be used to find the extremal function
displaystyle frac partial Lpartial f frac ddxfrac partial Lpartial f'=
the first term in the Euler Lagrange equation vanishes for all
displaystyle frac ddx frac f'xsqrt +f'x =
is a constant and therefore that the shortest curve that connects two points
displaystyle fx=mx+bqquad textwith m=frac y yx xquad textandquad b=frac xy xyx x
and we have thus found the extremal function
is a minimum The equation for a straight line is
In other words the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
In physics problems it may be the case that
meaning the integrand is a function of
does not appear separately In that case the Euler Lagrange equation can be simplified to the Beltrami identity
is a constant The left hand side is the Legendre transformation of
The intuition behind this result is that if the variable
implies that the Lagrangian is time independent By Noether's theorem there is an associated conserved quantity In this case this quantity is the Hamiltonian the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian which often coincides with the energy of the system This is minus the constant in Beltrami's identity
displaystyle frac partial fpartial y frac ddxleftfrac partial fpartial y'right+dots + nfrac dndxnleftfrac partial fpartial ynright=
The discussion thus far has assumed that extremal functions possess two continuous derivatives although the existence of the integral
requires only first derivatives of trial functions The condition that the first variation vanishes at an extremal may be regarded as a weak form of the Euler Lagrange equation The theorem of Du Bois Reymond asserts that this weak form implies the strong form If
has continuous first and second derivatives with respect to all of its arguments and if
has two continuous derivatives and it satisfies the Euler Lagrange equation
Hilbert was the first to give good conditions for the Euler Lagrange equations to give a stationary solution Within a convex area and a positive thrice differentiable Lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the Euler Lagrange equations in the interior
However Lavrentiev in showed that there are circumstances where there is no optimum solution but one can be approached arbitrarily closely by increasing numbers of sections The Lavrentiev Phenomenon identifies a difference in the infimum of a minimization problem across different classes of admissible functions For instance the following problem presented by Manià in
minimizes the functional but we find any function
gives a value bounded away from the infimum
Examples in one dimension are traditionally manifested across
but Ball and Mizel procured the first functional that displayed Lavrentiev's Phenomenon across
There are several results that gives criteria under which the phenomenon does not occur for instance 'standard growth' a Lagrangian with no dependence on the second variable or an approximating sequence satisfying Cesari's Condition D but results are often particular and applicable to a small class of functionals
Connected with the Lavrentiev Phenomenon is the repulsion property any functional displaying Lavrentiev's Phenomenon will display the weak repulsion property

displaystyle Uvarphi =iint Dsqrt +nabla varphi cdot nabla varphi dxdy
Plateau's problem consists of finding a function that minimizes the surface area while assuming prescribed values on the boundary of

displaystyle leftfrac ddvarepsilon Vu+varepsilon vrightvarepsilon ==iint Dnabla ucdot nabla vdxdy=
Provided that u has two derivatives we may apply the divergence theorem to obtain
displaystyle iint Dnabla cdot vnabla udxdy=iint Dnabla ucdot nabla v+vnabla cdot nabla udxdy=int Cvfrac partial upartial nds
and the first variation vanishes the result is
for all smooth functions v that vanish on the boundary of
The proof for the case of one dimensional integrals may be adapted to this case to show that
The difficulty with this reasoning is the assumption that the minimizing function u must have two derivatives Riemann argued that the existence of a smooth minimizing function was assured by the connection with the physical problem membranes do indeed assume configurations with minimal potential energy Riemann named this idea the Dirichlet principle in honor of his teacher Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet However Weierstrass gave an example of a variational problem with no solution minimize
can be made arbitrarily small by choosing piecewise linear functions that make a transition between − and in a small neighborhood of the origin However there is no function that makes
Eventually it was shown that Dirichlet's principle is valid but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations see Jost and Li Jost
A more general expression for the potential energy of a membrane is
displaystyle Vvarphi =iint Dleftfrac nabla varphi cdot nabla varphi +fxyvarphi rightdxdy+int Cleftfrac sigma svarphi +gsvarphi rightds
This corresponds to an external force density
The function that minimizes the potential energy with no restriction on its boundary values will be denoted by
are continuous regularity theory implies that the minimizing function
will have two derivatives In taking the first variation no boundary condition need be imposed on the increment
displaystyle iint Dleftnabla ucdot nabla v+fvrightdxdy+int Cleftsigma uv+gvrightds=
If we apply the divergence theorem the result is
displaystyle iint Dleft vnabla cdot nabla u+vfrightdxdy+int Cvleftfrac partial upartial n+sigma u+grightds=
the boundary integral vanishes and we conclude as before that
to assume arbitrary boundary values this implies that
This boundary condition is a consequence of the minimizing property of
it is not imposed beforehand Such conditions are called natural boundary conditions
The preceding reasoning is not valid if
In such a case we could allow a trial function
is a constant For such a trial function
can assume any value unless the quantity inside the brackets vanishes Therefore the variational problem is meaningless unless
This condition implies that net external forces on the system are in equilibrium If these forces are in equilibrium then the variational problem has a solution but it is not unique since an arbitrary constant may be added Further details and examples are in Courant and Hilbert
Both one dimensional and multi dimensional eigenvalue problems can be formulated as variational problems
The Sturm Liouville eigenvalue problem involves a general quadratic form
is restricted to functions that satisfy the boundary conditions
are required to be everywhere positive and bounded away from zero The primary variational problem is to minimize the ratio
satisfying the endpoint conditions It is shown below that the Euler Lagrange equation for the minimizing
It can be shown see Gelfand and Fomin that the minimizing
has two derivatives and satisfies the Euler Lagrange equation The associated
it is the lowest eigenvalue for this equation and boundary conditions The associated minimizing function will be denoted by
This variational characterization of eigenvalues leads to the Rayleigh Ritz method choose an approximating
as a linear combination of basis functions for example trigonometric functions and carry out a finite dimensional minimization among such linear combinations This method is often surprisingly accurate
The next smallest eigenvalue and eigenfunction can be obtained by minimizing
This procedure can be extended to obtain the complete sequence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the problem
The variational problem also applies to more general boundary conditions Instead of requiring that
vanish at the endpoints we may not impose any condition at the endpoints and set
displaystyle Qvarphi =int xxleftpxvarphi 'x+qxvarphi xrightdx+avarphi x+avarphi x
where λ is given by the ratio
vanish at the endpoints the first variation will vanish for all such
satisfies this condition then the first variation will vanish for arbitrary
These latter conditions are the natural boundary conditions for this problem since they are not imposed on trial functions for the minimization but are instead a consequence of the minimization
Eigenvalue problems in higher dimensions are defined in analogy with the one dimensional case For example given a domain
displaystyle Qvarphi =iiint DpXnabla varphi cdot nabla varphi +qXvarphi dxdydz+iint Bsigma Svarphi dS
be the function that minimizes the quotient
with no condition prescribed on the boundary
must also satisfy the natural boundary condition
This result depends upon the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations see Jost and Li Jost for details Many extensions including completeness results asymptotic properties of the eigenvalues and results concerning the nodes of the eigenfunctions are in Courant and Hilbert
Fermat's principle states that light takes a path that locally minimizes the optical length between its endpoints If the
coordinate is chosen as the parameter along the path and
along the path then the optical length is given by
displaystyle delta Aff=int xxleftfrac nxff'xf'xsqrt +f'x+nyxffsqrt +f'xrightdx
After integration by parts of the first term within brackets we obtain the Euler Lagrange equation
The light rays may be determined by integrating this equation This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics
There is a discontinuity of the refractive index when light enters or leaves a lens Let
are constants Then the Euler Lagrange equation holds as before in the region where
and in fact the path is a straight line there since the refractive index is constant At the
may be discontinuous After integration by parts in the separate regions and using the Euler Lagrange equations the first variation takes the form
displaystyle delta Aff=fleftn frac f' sqrt +f' n+frac f'+sqrt +f'+right
is the sine of angle of the incident ray with the
is the sine of angle of the refracted ray with the
axis Snell's law for refraction requires that these terms be equal As this calculation demonstrates Snell's law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of the optical path length
It is expedient to use vector notation let
be the parametric representation of a curve
be its tangent vector The optical length of the curve is given by
displaystyle AC=int ttnXsqrt dot Xcdot dot Xdt
Note that this integral is invariant with respect to changes in the parametric representation of
The Euler Lagrange equations for a minimizing curve have the symmetric form
displaystyle frac ddtP=sqrt dot Xcdot dot Xnabla n
displaystyle P=frac nXdot Xsqrt dot Xcdot dot X
Therefore the integral may also be written as
This form suggests that if we can find a function
at the endpoints of the interval of integration Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related to the study of the level surfaces of
In order to find such a function we turn to the wave equation which governs the propagation of light This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics
The wave equation for an inhomogeneous medium is
is the velocity which generally depends upon
Wave fronts for light are characteristic surfaces for this partial differential equation they satisfy
displaystyle varphi t=cXnabla varphi cdot nabla varphi
We may look for solutions in the form
displaystyle nabla psi cdot nabla psi =n
According to the theory of first order partial differential equations if
along a system of curves the light rays that are given by
These equations for solution of a first order partial differential equation are identical to the Euler Lagrange equations if we make the identification
displaystyle frac dsdt=frac sqrt dot Xcdot dot Xn
is the value of the minimizing integral
as a function of the upper end point That is when a family of minimizing curves is constructed the values of the optical length satisfy the characteristic equation corresponding the wave equation Hence solving the associated partial differential equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem This is the essential content of the Hamilton Jacobi theory which applies to more general variational problems
is defined as the time integral of the Lagrangian
The Lagrangian is the difference of energies
is the kinetic energy of a mechanical system and
its potential energy Hamilton's principle or the action principle states that the motion of a conservative holonomic integrable constraints mechanical system is such that the action integral
is stationary with respect to variations in the path
The Euler Lagrange equations for this system are known as Lagrange's equations
displaystyle frac ddtfrac partial Lpartial dot x=frac partial Lpartial x
and they are equivalent to Newton's equations of motion for such systems
Hamiltonian mechanics results if the conjugate momenta are introduced in place of
by a Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian
The Hamiltonian is the total energy of the system
Analogy with Fermat's principle suggests that solutions of Lagrange's equations the particle trajectories may be described in terms of level surfaces of some function of
This function is a solution of the Hamilton Jacobi equation
