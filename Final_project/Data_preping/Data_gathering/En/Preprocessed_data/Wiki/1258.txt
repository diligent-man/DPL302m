key assessment whether given discount rate npv positive profitable negative loss-making
rate used discount future cash flow present value key variable process
firm's weighted average cost capital tax often used many people believe appropriate use higher discount rate adjust risk opportunity cost factors
variable discount rate higher rate applied cash flow occurring along time span might used reflect yield curve premium long-term debt
another approach choosing discount rate factor decide rate capital needed project could return invested alternative venture
example capital required project earn elsewhere use discount rate npv calculation allow direct comparison made project alternative
re-investment rate defined rate return firm's investment average
analyzing project capital constrained environment may appropriate use reinvestment rate rather firm's weighted average cost capital discount factor
reflects opportunity cost investment rather possibly lower cost capital
npv calculated using variable discount rate known duration investment may better reflect situation one calculated constant discount rate entire investment duration
refer tutorial article written samuel baker detailed relationship npv discount rate
professional investor investment fund committed target specified rate return
case rate return selected discount rate npv calculation
way direct comparison made profitability project desired rate return
intent simply determine whether project add value company using firm's weighted average cost capital may appropriate
trying decide alternative investment order maximize value firm corporate reinvestment rate would probably better choice
using variable rate time discounting guaranteed cash flow differently risk cash flow may superior methodology seldom used practice
using discount rate adjust risk often difficult practice especially internationally difficult well
alternative using discount factor adjust risk explicitly correct cash flow risk element using rnpv similar method discount firm's rate
npv indicator much value investment project add firm
positive value project status positive cash inflow time t
negative value project status discounted cash outflow time t
doe necessarily mean undertaken since npv cost capital may account opportunity cost ie comparison available investments
financial theory choice two mutually exclusive alternative one yielding higher npv selected
positive net present value indicates projected earnings generated project investment present dollar exceeds anticipated cost also present dollars
concept basis net present value rule dictate investment made positive npvs
investment positive npv profitable one negative npv necessarily result net loss internal rate return project fall required rate return
indicator project investment npv ha several advantage disadvantage decision-making
consideration time value money allows npv include relevant time cash flow project
idea consistent goal wealth maximization creating highest wealth shareholders
beyond cash flow timing pattern size difference project provide easy comparison different investment optionshowever npv method also come many disadvantages
first consideration hidden cost project size part npv approach
thus investment decision project substantial hidden cost may accurate
second place npv accurate input number perfectly correct given fact npv requires firm knowledge accurate discount rate timing size cash flows
accuracy npv relies heavily rationality choice discount factor representing investment's true risk premiumtherefore optimal configuration established npv creates lot diversifications
outcome npv presented maximum profitability project along lowest levelized cost investment cost whereas ranking npv investment project display lack consideration project size cost capital
moreover issue related inherent conceptual assumption also one disadvantages
addition difficulty comparing mutually exclusive project different investment horizon exhibited
since unequal project assumed duplicate investment horizon npv approach used compare optimal duration npv
synthesizing relevant advantage disadvantage npv approach provides optimal result combination investment project constrained budget provided based capital rationing situation

corporation must decide whether introduce new product line
recall cost negative outgoing cash flow thus cash flow represented as
company assumes product provide equal benefit year beginning t
simplicity assume company outgoing cash flow initial cost
also make simplifying assumption net cash received paid lumped single transaction occurring last day year
end year product longer provides cash flow discontinued without additional costs
total present value outgoing cash flow simply time t
example final incoming cash flow ha future value ha present value of
taking example reverse equivalent investing present value interest rate compounded year result cash flow future value
although incoming cash flow appear exceed outgoing cash flow future cash flow adjusted using discount rate
cash flow discounted however indicates project would result net loss of
thus npv calculation indicates project disregarded investing project equivalent loss t
concept time value money indicates cash flow different period time cannot accurately compared unless adjusted reflect value period time instance t
present value future cash flow must determined order provide meaningful comparison cash flow different period time
investment horizon possible investment project considered equally acceptable investor eg

shareholder cannot get return money directly assume equivalent level risk
investor could better elsewhere project undertaken firm excess capital turned shareholder dividend stock repurchasesmore realistic problem would also need consider factor generally including smaller time bucket calculation tax including cash flow timing inflation currency exchange fluctuation hedged unhedged commodity cost

example rt generally negative late project eg industrial mining project might clean-up restoration cost stage company owes money high discount rate cautious optimistic
way avoid problem include explicit provision financing loss initial investment explicitly calculate cost financing losses
another common pitfall adjust risk adding premium discount rate
whilst bank might charge higher rate interest risky project doe mean valid approach adjusting net present value risk although reasonable approximation specific cases
one reason approach may work well seen following risk incurred resulting loss discount rate npv reduce effect loss true financial cost
rigorous approach risk requires identifying valuing risk explicitly eg actuarial monte carlo technique explicitly calculating cost financing loss incurred
result future cash flow discounted risk-free rate well risk premium effect compounded subsequent cash flow
compounding result much lower npv might otherwise calculated
certainty equivalent model used account risk premium without compounding effect present value
another issue relying npv doe provide overall picture gain loss executing certain project
see percentage gain relative investment project usually internal rate return efficiency measure used complement npv
