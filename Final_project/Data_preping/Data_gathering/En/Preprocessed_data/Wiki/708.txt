mathematical theory functional analysis krein-milman theorem proposition compact convex set locally convex topological vector space tvss
theorem generalizes infinite-dimensional space arbitrary compact convex set following basic observation convex ie
filled triangle including perimeter area inside equal convex hull three vertex vertex exactly extreme point shape
ha extreme point extreme point non-degenerate closed interval
displaystyle overline operatorname co soverline operatorname co s
example convex hull set three distinct point form either closed line segment collinear else solid filled triangle including perimeter
unit circle convex closed unit disk convex furthermore disk equal convex hull circle
also convex theorem ha corollary first part next theorem also often called krein-milman theorem
main burden proof show enough extreme point convex hull cover of
reason following corollary theorem also often called krein-milman theorem
case corner polygon extreme point needed recover polygon shape
statement theorem false polygon convex many way drawing polygon given point corners
compactness implies convex compactness topological space compact every family closed subset finite intersection property fip ha non-empty intersection kernel empty
definition convex compactness similar characterization compact space term fip except involves closed subset also convex rather closed subsets
assumption local convexity ambient space necessary james robert constructed counter-example non-locally convex space
linearity also needed statement fails weakly compact convex set cat space proved nicolas monod
however theo buehler proved krein-milman theorem doe hold metrically compact cat spaces
barycenter probability measure supported set extreme point of
zermelo-fraenkel set theory zf axiomatic framework axiom choice ac suffices prove version krein-milman theorem given including statement km generalization skm
axiom choice also implies equivalent boolean prime ideal theorem bpi equivalent banach-alaoglu theorem
conversely krein-milman theorem km together boolean prime ideal theorem bpi imply axiom choice
closed unit ball continuous dual space real normed space ha extreme pointfurthermore skm together hahn-banach theorem real vector space hb also equivalent axiom choice
known bpi implies hb equivalent said differently bpi strictly stronger hb
original statement proved mark krein david milman wa somewhat le general form stated here
assertion wa expanded case finite dimension ernst steinitz
however generalize finite infinite dimensional space necessary use closure
