in the mathematical theory of functional analysis the krein milman theorem is a proposition about compact convex sets in locally convex topological vector spaces tvss
this theorem generalizes to infinite dimensional spaces and to arbitrary compact convex sets the following basic observation a convex i e
filled triangle including its perimeter and the area inside of it is equal to the convex hull of its three vertices where these vertices are exactly the extreme points of this shape
this observation also holds for any other convex polygon in the plane

will be a real or complex vector space
for any elements
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
in a vector space the set
displaystyle x y tx t y leq t leq
is called the closed line segment or closed interval between
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
the open line segment or open interval between
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
displaystyle x x varnothing
displaystyle x y
while it is
displaystyle x y tx t y t
displaystyle x neq y
it satisfies
displaystyle x y x y setminus x y
displaystyle x y x y cup x y
the points
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
are called the endpoints of these interval
an interval is said to be non degenerate or proper if its endpoints are distinct
the intervals
displaystyle x x x
displaystyle x y
always contain their endpoints while
displaystyle x x varnothing
displaystyle x y
never contain either of their endpoints
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
are points in the real line
displaystyle mathbb r
then the above definition of
displaystyle x y
is the same as its usual definition as a closed interval
for any
displaystyle p x y in x
the point
displaystyle p
is said to strictly lie between
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
displaystyle p
belongs to the open line segment
displaystyle x y
displaystyle k
is a subset of
displaystyle x
displaystyle p in k
displaystyle p
is called an extreme point of
displaystyle k
if it does not lie between any two distinct points of
displaystyle k
that is if there does not exist
displaystyle x y in k
displaystyle t
such that
displaystyle x neq y
displaystyle p tx t y
in this article the set of all extreme points of
displaystyle k
will be denoted by
extreme
displaystyle operatorname extreme k
for example the vertices of any convex polygon in the plane
displaystyle mathbb r
are the extreme points of that polygon
the extreme points of the closed unit disk in
displaystyle mathbb r
is the unit circle
every open interval and degenerate closed interval in
displaystyle mathbb r
has no extreme points while the extreme points of a non degenerate closed interval
displaystyle x y
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
a set
displaystyle s
is called convex if for any two points
displaystyle x y in s
displaystyle s
contains the line segment
displaystyle x y
the smallest convex set containing
displaystyle s
is called the convex hull of
displaystyle s
and it is denoted by
displaystyle operatorname co s
the closed convex hull of a set
displaystyle s
denoted by
displaystyle overline operatorname co s
is the smallest closed and convex set containing
displaystyle s
it is also equal to the intersection of all closed convex subsets that contain
displaystyle s
and to the closure of the convex hull of
displaystyle s
that is
displaystyle overline operatorname co s overline operatorname co s
where the right hand side denotes the closure of
displaystyle operatorname co s
while the left hand side is notation
for example the convex hull of any set of three distinct points forms either a closed line segment if they are collinear or else a solid that is filled triangle including its perimeter
and in the plane
displaystyle mathbb r
the unit circle is not convex but the closed unit disk is convex and furthermore this disk is equal to the convex hull of the circle
in the case where the compact set
displaystyle k
is also convex the above theorem has as a corollary the first part of the next theorem which is also often called the krein milman theorem
the convex hull of the extreme points of
displaystyle k
forms a convex subset of
displaystyle k
so the main burden of the proof is to show that there are enough extreme points so that their convex hull covers all of
displaystyle k
for this reason the following corollary to the above theorem is also often called the krein milman theorem
to visualized this theorem and its conclusion consider the particular case where
displaystyle k
is a convex polygon
in this case the corners of the polygon which are its extreme points are all that is needed to recover the polygon shape
the statement of the theorem is false if the polygon is not convex as then there are many ways of drawing a polygon having given points as corners
the requirement that the convex set
displaystyle k
be compact can be weakened to give the following strengthened version of the theorem
the property above is sometimes called quasicompactness or convex compactness
compactness implies convex compactness because a topological space is compact if and only if every family of closed subsets having the finite intersection property fip has non empty intersection that is its kernel is not empty
the definition of convex compactness is similar to this characterization of compact spaces in terms of the fip except that it only involves those closed subsets that are also convex rather than all closed subsets
the assumption of local convexity for the ambient space is necessary because james roberts constructed a counter example for the non locally convex space
displaystyle l p
where
displaystyle p
linearity is also needed because the statement fails for weakly compact convex sets in cat spaces as proved by nicolas monod
however theo buehler proved that the krein milman theorem does hold for metrically compact cat spaces
under the previous assumptions on
displaystyle k
displaystyle t
is a subset of
displaystyle k
and the closed convex hull of
displaystyle t
is all of
displaystyle k
then every extreme point of
displaystyle k
belongs to the closure of
displaystyle t
this result is known as milman s partial converse to the krein milman theorem
the choquet bishop de leeuw theorem states that every point in
displaystyle k
is the barycenter of a probability measure supported on the set of extreme points of
displaystyle k
under the zermelo fraenkel set theory zf axiomatic framework the axiom of choice ac suffices to prove all version of the krein milman theorem given above including statement km and its generalization skm
the axiom of choice also implies but is not equivalent to the boolean prime ideal theorem bpi which is equivalent to the banach alaoglu theorem
conversely the krein milman theorem km together with the boolean prime ideal theorem bpi imply the axiom of choice
in summary ac holds if and only if both km and bpi hold
it follows that under zf the axiom of choice is equivalent to the following statement
the closed unit ball of the continuous dual space of any real normed space has an extreme point furthermore skm together with the hahn banach theorem for real vector spaces hb are also equivalent to the axiom of choice
it is known that bpi implies hb but that it is not equivalent to it said differently bpi is strictly stronger than hb
the original statement proved by mark krein and david milman was somewhat less general than the form stated here
earlier hermann minkowski proved that if
displaystyle x
is dimensional then
displaystyle k
equals the convex hull of the set of its extreme points
this assertion was expanded to the case of any finite dimension by ernst steinitz
the krein milman theorem generalizes this to arbitrary locally convex
displaystyle x
however to generalize from finite to infinite dimensional spaces it is necessary to use the closure
banach alaoglu theorem closed ball in the dual space is weak compact
