In the mathematical theory of functional analysis the KreinMilman theorem is a proposition about compact convex sets in locally convex topological vector spaces TVSs
This theorem generalizes to infinite-dimensional spaces and to arbitrary compact convex sets the following basic observation a convex ie
filled triangle including its perimeter and the area inside of it is equal to the convex hull of its three vertices where these vertices are exactly the extreme points of this shape
This observation also holds for any other convex polygon in the plane
will be a real or complex vector space
is called the closed line segment or closed interval between
The open line segment or open interval between
are called the endpoints of these interval
An interval is said to be non-degenerate or proper if its endpoints are distinct
is the same as its usual definition as a closed interval
if it does not lie between any two distinct points of
That is if there does not exist
In this article the set of all extreme points of
For example the vertices of any convex polygon in the plane
are the extreme points of that polygon
The extreme points of the closed unit disk in
Every open interval and degenerate closed interval in
has no extreme points while the extreme points of a non-degenerate closed interval
is called convex if for any two points
The closed convex hull of a set
is the smallest closed and convex set containing
It is also equal to the intersection of all closed convex subsets that contain
and to the closure of the convex hull of

For example the convex hull of any set of three distinct points forms either a closed line segment if they are collinear or else a solid that is filled triangle including its perimeter
the unit circle is not convex but the closed unit disk is convex and furthermore this disk is equal to the convex hull of the circle
In the case where the compact set
is also convex the above theorem has as a corollary the first part of the next theorem which is also often called the KreinMilman theorem
The convex hull of the extreme points of
so the main burden of the proof is to show that there are enough extreme points so that their convex hull covers all of
For this reason the following corollary to the above theorem is also often called the KreinMilman theorem
To visualized this theorem and its conclusion consider the particular case where
In this case the corners of the polygon which are its extreme points are all that is needed to recover the polygon shape
The statement of the theorem is false if the polygon is not convex as then there are many ways of drawing a polygon having given points as corners
be compact can be weakened to give the following strengthened version of the theorem
The property above is sometimes called quasicompactness or convex compactness
Compactness implies convex compactness because a topological space is compact if and only if every family of closed subsets having the finite intersection property FIP has non-empty intersection that is its kernel is not empty
The definition of convex compactness is similar to this characterization of compact spaces in terms of the FIP except that it only involves those closed subsets that are also convex rather than all closed subsets
The assumption of local convexity for the ambient space is necessary because James Roberts constructed a counter-example for the non-locally convex space
Linearity is also needed because the statement fails for weakly compact convex sets in CAT spaces as proved by Nicolas Monod
However Theo Buehler proved that the KreinMilman theorem does hold for metrically compact CAT spaces
This result is known as Milman's partial converse to the KreinMilman theorem
The ChoquetBishopde Leeuw theorem states that every point in
is the barycenter of a probability measure supported on the set of extreme points of
Under the ZermeloFraenkel set theory ZF axiomatic framework the axiom of choice AC suffices to prove all version of the KreinMilman theorem given above including statement KM and its generalization SKM
The axiom of choice also implies but is not equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem BPI which is equivalent to the BanachAlaoglu theorem
Conversely the KreinMilman theorem KM together with the Boolean prime ideal theorem BPI imply the axiom of choice
In summary AC holds if and only if both KM and BPI hold
It follows that under ZF the axiom of choice is equivalent to the following statement
The closed unit ball of the continuous dual space of any real normed space has an extreme pointFurthermore SKM together with the HahnBanach theorem for real vector spaces HB are also equivalent to the axiom of choice
It is known that BPI implies HB but that it is not equivalent to it said differently BPI is strictly stronger than HB
The original statement proved by Mark Krein and David Milman was somewhat less general than the form stated here
equals the convex hull of the set of its extreme points
This assertion was expanded to the case of any finite dimension by Ernst Steinitz
The KreinMilman theorem generalizes this to arbitrary locally convex
however to generalize from finite to infinite dimensional spaces it is necessary to use the closure
