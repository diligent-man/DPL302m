The Societ anonyme belge d'Exploitation de la Navigation a rienne French lit 'Belgian Limited Company for the Exploitation of Aerial Navigation' better known by the acronym Sabena or SABENA was the national airline of Belgium from to with its base at Brussels National Airport After its bankruptcy in SN Brussels Airlines was formed through a takeover of former subsidiary Delta Air Transport and took over part of Sabena's assets in February which became Brussels Airlines after a merger with Virgin Express in March The airline's corporate headquarters were located in the Sabena House on the grounds of Brussels Airport in Zaventem
Sabena began operations on May as the national carrier of Belgium The airline was created by the Belgian government after its predecessor SNETA Syndicat national pour l' tude des transports a riens National Syndicate for the Study of Aerial Transports formed in to pioneer commercial aviation in Belgium ceased operations Sabena operated its first commercial flight from Brussels to London UK on July via Ostend Services to Rotterdam Netherlands and Strasbourg France were launched on April The Strasbourg service was extended to Basle Switzerland on June Amsterdam Netherlands was added on September and Hamburg Germany followed on May via Antwerp D sseldorf and Essen
When Sabena was created the airline was partly funded by Belgians in the Belgian Congo colony who had lost their air service an experimental passenger and cargo company LARA between L opoldville Lisala and Stanleyville a year earlier They expected the new Belgian national airline to fill this gap On February Sabena pioneered a long haul across Africa to Leopoldville capital of the Belgian Congo Throughout its history Sabena had a long tradition of service to African destinations and for a long time these were the only profitable routes served by the airline
Sabena used land planes for its Congo operations and a program of aerodrome construction was initiated in the Congo This was finished in and Sabena immediately began flights within the Belgian colony the main route being Boma L opoldville lisabethville a km mi route over dense jungle First flights were operated with De Havilland DH s although these were quickly replaced by the larger Handley Page W f which had three engines and offered ten seats
By Sabena's fleet including the aircraft used on the Congo network totalled aircraft Its mainstay type was the Fokker F VIIB with a lesser number of smaller Fokker VIIA and Handley Page types It also flew British Westland Wessex aircraft
Sabena occasionally flew to tropical Africa Belgium's Congo colony but mostly these aircraft were shipped out There was no direct flight yet between Belgium and the colony As the s progressed Sabena cooperated with Air France and Deutsche Luft Hansa which also had interests in routes to destinations across Africa
Sabena's first long haul flight to the Congo occurred on February and took five and a half days for which Sabena used a Fokker F VII m aircraft The following year Sabena purchased the Savoia Marchetti SM airliner With a speed of km h mph it reduced the journey time to only four days and the Sabena service ran on alternate weeks to an Air Afrique service
In Europe Sabena opened services to Copenhagen and Malm in and a route to Berlin was initiated in The mainstay pre war airliner that Sabena used in Europe was the successful Junkers Ju m airliner The airline's pre war routes covered almost km within Europe While the Brussels Haren Airport was Sabena's main base the company also operated services from other Belgian airports and had a domestic network that was mainly used by businessmen who wanted to be in their coastal villas for the weekend
In the airline purchased the new Savoia Marchetti SM a development of the S M with a speed of km h mph although it flew services at a cruising speed of about km h mph
At the outbreak of World War II in Sabena's fleet totalled aircraft Its mainstay fleet type was the Savoia Marchetti SM airliner it had of the type and the Junkers Ju m airliner it had five Sabena also had just taken delivery of two Douglas DC s
During the war the airline managed to maintain its Belgian Congo routes but all European services ceased
After the war in Sabena resumed operating a network of intra European scheduled services The fleet initially consisted mainly of Douglas DC s There were thousands of surplus Douglas C Skytrains the military variant of the DC available to help airlines restart operations after the war The airline now flew under the name of SABENA Belgian World Airlines
Sabena started its first transatlantic route to New York City on June initially using unpressurised Douglas DC airliners which were augmented and later replaced by Douglas DC Bs The DC s also restarted the airline's traditional route to the Belgian Congo Sabena was the first airline to introduce transatlantic schedules from the north of England when one of its DC Bs inaugurated the Brussels Manchester New York route on October
The Convair was introduced in to partially replace the DC s that until then had flown most European services As of improved Convair Metropolitan twins began replacing the Convair twins and were used successfully well into the s between European regional destinations
In the long range Douglas DC C was introduced for long haul routes but this plane would begin to be supplanted after only three years by the jet age It remained in service on the transatlantic route until
On June a Soviet Air Force Mikoyan Gurevich MiG NATO reporting name Fagot attacked a Sabena operated Douglas DC on a cargo flight from the United Kingdom to Yugoslavia killing the radio operator and wounding both the captain and engineer Co pilot Douglas Wilson managed to land in Austria but the plane suffered significant damage
For the world exposition in Brussels Sabena leased two Lockheed Super Constellations from Seaboard World Airlines using them mainly on transatlantic routes In the same period there were experiments with helicopter passenger service using Sikorsky S aircraft from Brussels to Antwerp Rotterdam Eindhoven and the Paris heliport at Issy les Moulineaux
saw the introduction of the Boeing intercontinental jet for trans Atlantic flights to New York SABENA was mainland Europe's first airline to operate a jet across the Atlantic BOAC had been flying jet transatlantic services using the de Havilland Comet since October One of Sabena's aircraft became the first Boeing to crash while in commercial service when Flight crashed while preparing to land at Brussels on February The United States Figure Skating Team was aboard the aircraft en route from New York to Prague via Brussels to compete in a figure skating championship
Six Caravelle jetliners were introduced on all medium haul routes in Europe from February being flown on most routes alongside the Convair s until the early s
The beginning of the s saw a major upheaval for Sabena in the Congo Widespread rioting against Belgian colonials in the months leading up to and after the independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo caused thousands of Belgians to flee the country The Belgian government commandeered Sabena's entire long haul fleet to get the refugees back to Europe Independence also meant the end of the impressive regional network of routes that the airline had built up in the Congo since When the new republic began its own airline Air Congo in June Sabena held percent of that airline's shares
The Douglas DC Bs remained in service with Sabena in the mid s although they were no longer used on the airline's main routes The Boeing s and Caravelles became the mainstay types during this decade Boeing s were introduced on important European routes and also some African services from in a unique colour scheme the fin markings incorporated bare metal rudder and white engine colours The only other aircraft to have its own special markings was the McDonnell Douglas DC At this time Fokker F Friendships entered service between regional Belgian airports and European destinations such as London Heathrow
The Boeing was introduced in on transatlantic routes flying alongside the Boeing Cs Sabena like many other trans Atlantic airlines was satisfied with the Boeing s For commercial reasons it was recognised that it had to buy jumbo jets for its prestige services notably New York JFK and as of the mid seventies Chicago O'Hare Sabena purchased only two first generation jumbo jets one named Tante Agathe which means Aunt Agathe in French and it continued to fly the into the late as the Boeing 's last flight occurred in
In the Boeing s on the European network were replaced by Boeing s The McDonnell Douglas DC entered service in In total Sabena purchased five of these convertible Passengers and or freight combi aircraft wide body jets
In Airbus A s were introduced on routes that had high passenger density This aircraft type also introduced a modernisation of the Sabena livery in which a lighter blue was used and the titles on the fuselage were in a more modern style
In June the first of two Boeing aircraft joined the fleet eventually replacing the older s
In an advertisement in National Geographic June volume no Sabena prided itself with a superior inflight service And unlike most European airlines Sabena still offers First Class service within Europe and all the way through This advertisement also stated that Sabena flies to destinations on continents and used the slogan belgian world airlines
In Sabena invited Belgian fashion designer Olivier Strelli to create a new range of uniforms for its cabin crews
A new name Sabena World Airlines and colours were introduced for the s The new livery had an overall white colour and the white circle tail logo in blue on the fin A large Sabena title covered the fuselage in light blue and the name Belgian World Airlines was at times just visible though the title was also painted on the fuselage in small clear letters The s saw further fleet type renewal the DC s were replaced with twin engined Airbus A and the Boeing s with four engined Airbus A
After the liberalisation of the airline industry throughout Europe and the economic consequences of the Gulf War the Belgian government the main shareholder of the company realized that Sabena had little chance of surviving on its own in this very competitive market and began searching for a suitable partner
Sabena remained in a poor financial state and year after year the Belgian government had to cover losses however it was prevented from providing new funds due to EU State Aid rules For help in business due to their financial problems Sabena leased a couple of Boeing s from Air France Many more aircraft were leased for longer periods but had to keep their distinctive French registration numbers
Around SAS tried to merge with the carrier but the merger was blocked by the Belgian authorities In British Airways and KLM purchased stakes in Sabena which were later sold back to the Belgian government In Air France purchased a large minority stake in Sabena which it sold soon after Finally in Swissair purchased a percent stake in Sabena and took over management
In Sabena adopted its third and final logo and its head office was in the Air Terminus building on Rue Cardinal Mercier in Brussels
In Paul Rusesabagina a manager for Sabena owned hotels in the former Belgian territory of Rwanda sheltered over Tutsis and moderate Hutus at the H tel des Mille Collines of Kigali saving them from being slaughtered by the Interahamwe militia during the Rwandan genocide this is depicted in the motion picture Hotel Rwanda
When Swissair took over management of the airline few modifications were made to the aircraft's liveries including a sticker saying Flying together with Swissair
In March and April two McDonnell Douglas MD aircraft both leased from CityBird joined the fleet and such long haul destinations as Newark Montreal and S o Paulo were re introduced Also that year saw the delivery of the last passenger version of the MD from Boeing which merged with McDonnell Douglas a year before
saw new colours introduced to the fleet beginning with an Airbus A One of the latest fleet types that Sabena introduced right after the A and A was the A which saw service in These new planes were part of a record order of Airbus A family aircraft imposed on Sabena when under Swissair management
After an airline recession and the effects on the airline industry of the September attacks in all airlines that flew across the Atlantic suffered Swissair had pledged to invest millions in Sabena but failed to do so partly because the airline had financial problems itself having filed for bankruptcy protection one month prior Sabena filed for legal protection against its creditors on October and went into liquidation on November Fred Chaffart Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sabena read a declaration on this day to explain the decision
November was the final day of operations for Sabena Flight nl operated by an Airbus A registered as OO SCZ from Abidjan Ivory Coast and Cotonou Benin was the last Sabena flight to land in Brussels The flight had passengers and eleven crewmembers
A group of investors managed to take over Delta Air Transport one of Sabena's subsidiaries and transformed it into SN Brussels Airlines That airline merged with Virgin Express in to form a new company Brussels Airlines
The Belgian Parliament formed a committee to investigate the reasons behind the bankruptcy of Sabena and the involvement of Switzerland's flag carrier At the same time the company's administrator investigated possible legal steps against Swissair and its successors in interest Swiss International Air Lines and Lufthansa
In the Belgian government a former major shareholder filed criminal charges against the former Swissair management The former Swissair management was condemned by the judges
On January the Belgian Flemish news program Terzake reported that during the s several members of the board were paid large sums illegally through a Sabena affiliate in Bermuda When Paul Reutlinger became the CEO of the company he stopped the illegal payments Terzake went on to state that this might explain why the Belgian board members remained quiet when it became apparent Swissair was exploiting Sabena and eventually drove the company into bankruptcy
On December Georges Jaspis a former World War II pilot in No Squadron RAF and the Sabena pilot with the most flying hours died Captain Jaspis was the pilot who inaugurated the Manchester to New York service in October and who collected the first Sabena Boeing and He had escaped Belgium during the war and made his way to England where he joined the Royal Air Force He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross He was buried in Opprebais a village south east of Brussels on December The Belgian military attended and a flypast of four F jets in missing man formation was made
The reasons for Sabena's bankruptcy fr nl are numerous One of the direct causes was Swissair not living up to their contractual obligations and failing to inject necessary funds into the company This was because at the time Swissair was having its own financial problems In the so called Hotel Agreement signed on July Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt met with Swissair boss Mario Corti who agreed to inject million into Sabena but the sum was never paid The purchase of new Airbus A family planes imposed under Swissair's management was a burden with which Sabena could not cope
After the bankruptcy a parliamentary commission in Belgium was established to investigate the demise of the airline The Belgian politicians got a part of the blame Rik Daems who at the time was Minister of Public Enterprises and Participations Telecommunication and Middle Classes received the most criticism due to his lack of effort Swissair itself went bankrupt in October and was liquidated in March
The flight schedule of Sabena published in March comprised cities in Europe in Africa in North America and in Asia In addition to its air destinations Sabena also had a ground shuttle service between Valenciennes France and Brussels Airport
