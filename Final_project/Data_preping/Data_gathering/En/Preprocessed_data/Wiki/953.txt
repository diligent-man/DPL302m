the societ anonyme belge d exploitation de la navigation a rienne french lit belgian limited company for the exploitation of aerial navigation better known by the acronym sabena or sabena was the national airline of belgium from to with its base at brussels national airport
after its bankruptcy in sn brussels airlines was formed through a takeover of former subsidiary delta air transport and took over part of sabena s assets in february which became brussels airlines after a merger with virgin express in march
the airline s corporate headquarters were located in the sabena house on the grounds of brussels airport in zaventem
sabena began operations on may as the national carrier of belgium
the airline was created by the belgian government after its predecessor sneta syndicat national pour l tude des transports a riens national syndicate for the study of aerial transports formed in to pioneer commercial aviation in belgium ceased operations
sabena operated its first commercial flight from brussels to london uk on july via ostend
services to rotterdam netherlands and strasbourg france were launched on april
the strasbourg service was extended to basle switzerland on june
amsterdam netherlands was added on september and hamburg germany followed on may via antwerp d sseldorf and essen
when sabena was created the airline was partly funded by belgians in the belgian congo colony who had lost their air service an experimental passenger and cargo company lara between l opoldville lisala and stanleyville a year earlier
they expected the new belgian national airline to fill this gap
on february sabena pioneered a long haul across africa to leopoldville capital of the belgian congo
throughout its history sabena had a long tradition of service to african destinations and for a long time these were the only profitable routes served by the airline
sabena used land planes for its congo operations and a program of aerodrome construction was initiated in the congo
this was finished in and sabena immediately began flights within the belgian colony the main route being boma l opoldville lisabethville a km mi route over dense jungle
first flights were operated with de havilland dh s although these were quickly replaced by the larger handley page w f which had three engines and offered ten seats
by sabena s fleet including the aircraft used on the congo network totalled aircraft
its mainstay type was the fokker f viib with a lesser number of smaller fokker viia and handley page types
it also flew british westland wessex aircraft
sabena occasionally flew to tropical africa belgium s congo colony but mostly these aircraft were shipped out
there was no direct flight yet between belgium and the colony
as the s progressed sabena cooperated with air france and deutsche luft hansa which also had interests in routes to destinations across africa
sabena s first long haul flight to the congo occurred on february and took five and a half days for which sabena used a fokker f vii m aircraft
the following year sabena purchased the savoia marchetti sm airliner
with a speed of km h mph it reduced the journey time to only four days and the sabena service ran on alternate weeks to an air afrique service
in europe sabena opened services to copenhagen and malm in and a route to berlin was initiated in
the mainstay pre war airliner that sabena used in europe was the successful junkers ju m airliner
the airline s pre war routes covered almost km within europe
while the brussels haren airport was sabena s main base the company also operated services from other belgian airports and had a domestic network that was mainly used by businessmen who wanted to be in their coastal villas for the weekend
in the airline purchased the new savoia marchetti sm a development of the s m
with a speed of km h mph although it flew services at a cruising speed of about km h mph
at the outbreak of world war ii in sabena s fleet totalled aircraft
its mainstay fleet type was the savoia marchetti sm airliner it had of the type and the junkers ju m airliner it had five
sabena also had just taken delivery of two douglas dc s
during the war the airline managed to maintain its belgian congo routes but all european services ceased
after the war in sabena resumed operating a network of intra european scheduled services
the fleet initially consisted mainly of douglas dc s
there were thousands of surplus douglas c skytrains the military variant of the dc available to help airlines restart operations after the war
the airline now flew under the name of sabena belgian world airlines
sabena started its first transatlantic route to new york city on june initially using unpressurised douglas dc airliners which were augmented and later replaced by douglas dc bs
the dc s also restarted the airline s traditional route to the belgian congo
sabena was the first airline to introduce transatlantic schedules from the north of england when one of its dc bs inaugurated the brussels manchester new york route on october
the convair was introduced in to partially replace the dc s that until then had flown most european services
as of improved convair metropolitan twins began replacing the convair twins and were used successfully well into the s between european regional destinations
in the long range douglas dc c was introduced for long haul routes but this plane would begin to be supplanted after only three years by the jet age
it remained in service on the transatlantic route until
on june a soviet air force mikoyan gurevich mig nato reporting name fagot attacked a sabena operated douglas dc on a cargo flight from the united kingdom to yugoslavia killing the radio operator and wounding both the captain and engineer
co pilot douglas wilson managed to land in austria but the plane suffered significant damage
for the world exposition in brussels sabena leased two lockheed super constellations from seaboard world airlines using them mainly on transatlantic routes
in the same period there were experiments with helicopter passenger service using sikorsky s aircraft from brussels to antwerp rotterdam eindhoven and the paris heliport at issy les moulineaux
saw the introduction of the boeing intercontinental jet for trans atlantic flights to new york
sabena was mainland europe s first airline to operate a jet across the atlantic boac had been flying jet transatlantic services using the de havilland comet since october

the united states figure skating team was aboard the aircraft en route from new york to prague via brussels to compete in a figure skating championship
six caravelle jetliners were introduced on all medium haul routes in europe from february being flown on most routes alongside the convair s until the early s
the beginning of the s saw a major upheaval for sabena in the congo
widespread rioting against belgian colonials in the months leading up to and after the independence of the democratic republic of the congo caused thousands of belgians to flee the country
the belgian government commandeered sabena s entire long haul fleet to get the refugees back to europe
independence also meant the end of the impressive regional network of routes that the airline had built up in the congo since
when the new republic began its own airline air congo in june sabena held percent of that airline s shares
the douglas dc bs remained in service with sabena in the mid s although they were no longer used on the airline s main routes
the boeing s and caravelles became the mainstay types during this decade
boeing s were introduced on important european routes and also some african services from in a unique colour scheme the fin markings incorporated bare metal rudder and white engine colours
the only other aircraft to have its own special markings was the mcdonnell douglas dc
at this time fokker f friendships entered service between regional belgian airports and european destinations such as london heathrow
the boeing was introduced in on transatlantic routes flying alongside the boeing cs
sabena like many other trans atlantic airlines was satisfied with the boeing s
for commercial reasons it was recognised that it had to buy jumbo jets for its prestige services notably new york jfk and as of the mid seventies chicago o hare
sabena purchased only two first generation jumbo jets one named tante agathe which means aunt agathe in french and it continued to fly the into the late as the boeing s last flight occurred in
in the boeing s on the european network were replaced by boeing s
the mcdonnell douglas dc entered service in
in total sabena purchased five of these convertible passengers and or freight combi aircraft wide body jets
in airbus a s were introduced on routes that had high passenger density
this aircraft type also introduced a modernisation of the sabena livery in which a lighter blue was used and the titles on the fuselage were in a more modern style
in june the first of two boeing aircraft joined the fleet eventually replacing the older s
in an advertisement in national geographic june volume no
sabena prided itself with a superior inflight service
and unlike most european airlines sabena still offers first class service within europe and all the way through this advertisement also stated that sabena flies to destinations on continents and used the slogan belgian world airlines
in sabena invited belgian fashion designer olivier strelli to create a new range of uniforms for its cabin crews
a new name sabena world airlines and colours were introduced for the s
the new livery had an overall white colour and the white circle tail logo in blue on the fin
a large sabena title covered the fuselage in light blue and the name belgian world airlines was at times just visible though the title was also painted on the fuselage in small clear letters
the s saw further fleet type renewal the dc s were replaced with twin engined airbus a and the boeing s with four engined airbus a
after the liberalisation of the airline industry throughout europe and the economic consequences of the gulf war the belgian government the main shareholder of the company realized that sabena had little chance of surviving on its own in this very competitive market and began searching for a suitable partner
sabena remained in a poor financial state and year after year the belgian government had to cover losses however it was prevented from providing new funds due to eu state aid rules
for help in business due to their financial problems sabena leased a couple of boeing s from air france
many more aircraft were leased for longer periods but had to keep their distinctive french registration numbers
around sas tried to merge with the carrier but the merger was blocked by the belgian authorities
in british airways and klm purchased stakes in sabena which were later sold back to the belgian government
in air france purchased a large minority stake in sabena which it sold soon after
finally in swissair purchased a percent stake in sabena and took over management
in sabena adopted its third and final logo and its head office was in the air terminus building on rue cardinal mercier in brussels
in paul rusesabagina a manager for sabena owned hotels in the former belgian territory of rwanda sheltered over tutsis and moderate hutus at the h tel des mille collines of kigali saving them from being slaughtered by the interahamwe militia during the rwandan genocide this is depicted in the motion picture hotel rwanda
when swissair took over management of the airline few modifications were made to the aircraft s liveries including a sticker saying flying together with swissair
in march and april two mcdonnell douglas md aircraft both leased from citybird joined the fleet and such long haul destinations as newark montreal and s o paulo were re introduced
also that year saw the delivery of the last passenger version of the md from boeing which merged with mcdonnell douglas a year before
saw new colours introduced to the fleet beginning with an airbus a
one of the latest fleet types that sabena introduced right after the a and a was the a which saw service in
these new planes were part of a record order of airbus a family aircraft imposed on sabena when under swissair management
after an airline recession and the effects on the airline industry of the september attacks in all airlines that flew across the atlantic suffered
swissair had pledged to invest millions in sabena but failed to do so partly because the airline had financial problems itself having filed for bankruptcy protection one month prior
sabena filed for legal protection against its creditors on october and went into liquidation on november
fred chaffart chairman of the board of directors of sabena read a declaration on this day to explain the decision
november was the final day of operations for sabena
flight nl operated by an airbus a registered as oo scz from abidjan ivory coast and cotonou benin was the last sabena flight to land in brussels
the flight had passengers and eleven crewmembers
a group of investors managed to take over delta air transport one of sabena s subsidiaries and transformed it into sn brussels airlines
that airline merged with virgin express in to form a new company brussels airlines

at the same time the company s administrator investigated possible legal steps against swissair and its successors in interest swiss international air lines and lufthansa
in the belgian government a former major shareholder filed criminal charges against the former swissair management
the former swissair management was condemned by the judges
on january the belgian flemish news program terzake reported that during the s several members of the board were paid large sums illegally through a sabena affiliate in bermuda
when paul reutlinger became the ceo of the company he stopped the illegal payments
terzake went on to state that this might explain why the belgian board members remained quiet when it became apparent swissair was exploiting sabena and eventually drove the company into bankruptcy
on december georges jaspis a former world war ii pilot in no squadron raf and the sabena pilot with the most flying hours died
captain jaspis was the pilot who inaugurated the manchester to new york service in october and who collected the first sabena boeing and
he had escaped belgium during the war and made his way to england where he joined the royal air force
he was awarded the distinguished flying cross
he was buried in opprebais a village south east of brussels on december
the belgian military attended and a flypast of four f jets in missing man formation was made
the reasons for sabena s bankruptcy fr nl are numerous
one of the direct causes was swissair not living up to their contractual obligations and failing to inject necessary funds into the company
this was because at the time swissair was having its own financial problems
in the so called hotel agreement signed on july belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt met with swissair boss mario corti who agreed to inject million into sabena but the sum was never paid
the purchase of new airbus a family planes imposed under swissair s management was a burden with which sabena could not cope
after the bankruptcy a parliamentary commission in belgium was established to investigate the demise of the airline
the belgian politicians got a part of the blame rik daems who at the time was minister of public enterprises and participations telecommunication and middle classes received the most criticism due to his lack of effort
swissair itself went bankrupt in october and was liquidated in march
the flight schedule of sabena published in march comprised cities in europe in africa in north america and in asia
in addition to its air destinations sabena also had a ground shuttle service between valenciennes france and brussels airport
