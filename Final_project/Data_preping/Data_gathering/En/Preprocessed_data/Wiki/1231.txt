On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a approval rating based on reviews The website's consensus reads Beautifully filmed but decidedly dull Evening is a collossal sic waste of a talented cast On Metacritic it has a score of based on reviews from critics indicating mixed or average reviews
Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote Stuffed with actors of variable talent burdened with false labored dialogue and distinguished by a florid visual style better suited to fairy tales and greeting cards this miscalculation underlines what can happen when certain literary works meet the bottom line of the movies It also proves that not every book deserves its own film
In the San Francisco Chronicle Mick LaSalle observed The film arrives at a pessimistic and almost nihilistic view of life as something not very important and then invites us to take strength and comfort in the notion It's not what you'd expect and it's certainly not the typical message It might be the most interesting thing about the picture
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film itself Â½ out of a possible four stars but praised the cast writing the actors provide flashes of brilliance Hugh Dancy scores as the plot's catalyst for tragedy And Claire Danes is stellar as the young Ann Mamie Gummer proves her talent is her own in a star is born performance that signals an exceptional career ahead
In the St Petersburg Times Steve Persall graded the film C and added Strong performances and an author's weak backbone make Evening a curious mistake it is memorable only for lovely period designs and for casting mothers and daughters to ensure better continuity
Justin Chang of Variety wrote The more immediate problem with this ambitious elliptical film is Koltai and editor Allyson C Johnson's difficulty in establishing a narrative rhythm as the back and forth shifts in time that seemed delicately free associative on the page are rendered with considerably less grace onscreen In ways reminiscent of Stephen Daldry's film of The Hours the telling connections between past and present feel calculated rather than authentically illuminating
In Time Richard Schickel said the film represents perhaps the greatest diva round up in modern movie history Wow you might think how bad can that be To which one responds after two lugubrious hours in their company really awful Rarely have so many gifted women labored so tastefully to bring forth such a wee lockjawed mouse This may in part because it was Michael Cunningham author of the book The Hours another stupefying exercise in unspoken angst who was hired to punch up the script Susan Minot was trying to make out of her novel They share screenplay credit for Evening but even in the press kit you can sense her loathing for his work He's sort of Henry James without the cojones and definitely the most constipated sensibility the literary community has lately been in awe of But I suspect that the director Lajos Koltai a Hungarian has even more to do with the film's inertness
Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated Evening as the second worst movie of behind I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry
