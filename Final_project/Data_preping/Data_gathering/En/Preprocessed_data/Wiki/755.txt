the role of african americans in the agricultural history of the united states includes roles as the main work force when they were enslaved on cotton and tobacco plantations in the antebellum south
after the emancipation proclamation in most stayed in farming as very poor sharecroppers who rarely owned land
they began the great migration to cities in the mid th century
about are farmers today
plantation owners brought a mass of slaves from africa and the caribbean and mexico to farm the fields during cotton harvests
black women and children were also enslaved in the industry
the growth of slavery in the united states is closely tied to the expansion of plantation agriculture
the contributions of enslaved people on early american agriculture has largely been discounted and ignored mainly because of the lack of records not created by the slaveholder often writing to justify enslavement
however many plantation owners relied on the agricultural knowledge that africans brought over from across the atlantic
perhaps the best example of this is rice cultivation in south carolina relying on indigenous west african knowledge of growing oryza glaberrima
this specific knowledge was invaluable in transforming south carolina into a rice producing powerhouse
while enslaved african americans on plantations found ways to supplement their meager food rations by cultivating slave gardens
these slave gardens were usually near the slave cabins or remote areas of the plantation and provided slaves with three benefits nourishment financial independence and medicinal uses
these slave gardens allowed enslaved people some level of autonomy and agency when they grew more than they could consume they were able to sell
the great majority of black farmworkers before were enslaved workers on southern farms and plantations
smaller numbers were free employees or farm owners
in south carolina there were about free black farmers in the rural parishes surrounding charleston
as farmers their strategies production and rural lives resembled the poor white neighbors
survival was a high priority and involved establishing economic self sufficiency through concentration on food crops for their own families and then by cultivating social advantages such as having a rich white patron
virginia had a large free black element
by there were free black people living in virginia percent in rural areas
most lived on the eastern shore
one out of eight black people in the state was free and the rest were enslaved in
there were severe legal restrictions and terms of nonvoting not testifying in court not attending schools
newly manumitted ex slaves had to leave the state
however the same property laws were applied allowing free black people to own and operated small farms in
they were patronized by some wealthy white landowners who would hire them for cash wages from time to time
they were especially needed at harvest time and when it was necessary to replant the small tobacco plants
it was a political movement in to expel all free black people from virginia but key white landowners intervened to block the proposal they appreciated and often needed the labor of the free black people
from the point of view of the free black people the small amounts of cash were useful probably even more useful it was to be paid with old clothes used tools or young animals in lieu of cash wages
above all it was essential to their survival to be useful and available to politically powerful white neighbors
after emancipation and the passage of the thirteenth amendment black slaves were legally freed but most of them lacked any kind of material wealth and were thus led into other oppressive relationships
many black agriculturists were subjugated to land tenure agreements and working as sharecroppers tenant farmers and within the crop lien system
southern black cotton farmers faced discrimination from the north
many white democrats were concerned about how many of african americans were being employed in the us cotton industry and the dramatic growth of black landowners
they urged white farmers in the south to take control of the industry which from time to time resulted in strikes by black cotton pickers for instance black people led by the colored farmer s association cfa strikers from memphis organized the cotton pickers strike of in lee county in september which resulted in much violence
black cotton farmers were very important to entrepreneurs which emerged during industrialization in the united states particularly henry ford
the united states emancipation proclamation came into power on january allowing a new journey for people of african ancestry to participate in the u s
agriculture industry in a new way
sharecropping became widespread in the south during and after the reconstruction era
the conditions for black cotton farmers gradually improved during the twentieth century
ralph j
bunche an expert in negro suffrage in the united states observed in that many thousands of black cotton farmers each year now go to the polls stand in line with their white neighbors and mark their ballots independently without protest or intimidation in order to determine government policy toward cotton production control however discrimination towards black people continued as it did in the rest of society and isolated incidents often broke out
on september herbert lee a black cotton farmer and voter registration organizer was shot on the head by white state legislator e
hurst in liberty mississippi
yet the cotton industry continued to be very important for black people in the southern united states much more so than for whites
by the late s around two thirds of all african american tenants and almost three fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms
out of every black farm operators earned at least of their income from cotton farming during this period
studies conducted during the same period indicated that in black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming
in of farms in the nation were black operated less than were managed by black people and of black farm operators were tenants
the cotton industry in the united states hit a crisis in the early s
cotton and tobacco prices collapsed in following overproduction and the boll weevil pest wiped out the sea island cotton crop in
annual production slumped from bales in the s to in the s
in south carolina williamsburg county production fell from bales in to bales in and one farmer in mccormick county produced bales in and just in
as a result of the devastating harvest of some black cotton workers left south carolina and by the s the state population had declined some largely due to cotton stagnation
however it wasn t the collapse of prices or pests which resulted in the mass decline of african american employment in agriculture in the american south
the mechanization of agriculture is undoubtedly the most important reason why many black people moved to northern american cities in the s and s during the great migration as mechanization of agriculture was introduced leaving many unemployed
the hopson planting company produced the first crop of cotton to be entirely planted harvested and baled by machinery in
in the united states department of agriculture vowed to pay some forty thousand black farmers billion in total as compensation for years of undue discrimination
though funds were intended to be distributed by the end of the black farmers had yet to receive the designated remuneration by march
in all farmers in pigford i who filed timely claims had received over billion in payments
more than farmers submitted late claim petitions in pigford i
late claimants in pigford i were able to receive billion in payments in the pigford ii claims process
black farmers in pigford ii received decision letters dated august resulting from the late claims process that closed on may
about pigford ii claims were eventually decided in favor of the farmers and claims were denied
as of there were african american farmers in the united states
the vast majority of african american farmers were in southern states
in the biden administration proposed the american rescue plan which will support agriculture and of this billion will be allocated to disadvantaged farmers black farmers make up a quarter of these farmers
while the plan is associated with the administration s covid stimulus relief packages it is the first wave of relief for black farmers since the extent of the debt relief pigford v
glickman was to offer
picking cotton was often a subject which was mentioned in songs by african american blues and jazz musicians in the s s reflecting their grievances
in jazz pianist duke ellington composed cotton tail and blues musician lead belly wrote cotton fields
in big mama thornton wrote cotton picking blues a number of blues and jazz musicians had worked on cotton plantations
blues pianist joe willie pinetop perkins for instance had once been a tractor driver on a mississippi plantation before enjoying a successful career with muddy waters
lord buckley once sang a song titled black cross pertaining to an educated black farmer murdered by a mob comprising white men
