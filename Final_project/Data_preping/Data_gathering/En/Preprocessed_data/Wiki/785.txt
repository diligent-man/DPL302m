islamic apologetics ha however severely criticized many scholar superficial tendentious even psychologically destructive much term apologetics ha almost become term abuse literature modern islamislamic modernist discourse emerged intellectual movement second quarter nineteenth century era wide-ranging reform initiated across ottoman empire
movement sought harmonise classical islamic theological concept liberal constitutional idea advocated reformulation religious value light drastic social political technological changes
intellectual like namik kemal ce called popular sovereignty natural right citizens
major scholarly figure movement included grand imam al-azhar hassan al-attar d
inspired understanding classical islamic thought rationalist scholar regarded islam religion compatible western philosophy modern science
eventually modernist intellectual formed secret society known ittfak- hamiyet patriotic alliance advocated political liberalism modern constitutionalist ideal popular sovereignty religious discourse
similar early ottoman modernist abduh tried bridge gap enlightenment ideal traditional religious values

ah ce wa sheikh al-azhar university brief period death
project superimposed world nineteenth century extensive body islamic knowledge accumulated different milieu
abduh's death movement wa catalysed demise ottoman caliphate promotion secular liberalism particularly new breed writer pushed fore including egyptian ali abd al-raziq's publication attacking islamic politics first time muslim history
subsequent secular writer trend including farag foda al-ashmawi muhamed khalafallah taha husayn husayn amin et al argued similar tones
abduh wa skeptical towards many hadith tradition ie
towards body report teaching doings saying islamic prophet muhammad
particularly towards tradition reported chain transmission even deemed rigorously authenticated six canonical book hadith known kutub al-sittah
furthermore advocated reassessment traditional assumption even hadith study though devise systematic methodology death
peak early century modernist movement would gradually decline dissolution ottoman empire eventually lost ground conservative reform movement salafism
western oriental scholar like louis massignon began categorising broad swathe scripture-oriented rationalist scholar modernist part paradigm salafiyya theological term wa erroneously perceived reformist slogan

unlike 'abduh afghani rida disciple susbcribed hanbali theology
would openly campaign adherent school like shi'ite critical wahhabi doctrines
rida transformed reformation puritanical movement advanced muslim identitarianism pan-islamism preached superiority islamic culture attacking westernisation
one major hallmark rida's movement wa advocacy theological doctrine obligated establishment islamic state led ulema islamic scholars
rida's fundamentalist doctrine would later adopted islamic scholar islamist movement like muslim brotherhood
according german scholar bassam tibi rida's islamic fundamentalism ha taken muslim brother right wing radical movement founded ha ever since inexorable opposition secular nationalism
islamist movement like muslim brotherhood al-ikhwn al-muslimn highly influenced islamic modernism salafism
founder hassan al-banna wa influenced muhammad abduh salafi student rashid rida
al-banna attacked taqlid official ulama insisted qur'an best-attested ahadith source sharia
however wa syrian salafi scholar rashid rida influenced al-banna most
wa dedicated reader writing rashid rida magazine rida published al-manar
sharing rida's central concern decline islamic civilization al-banna believed trend could reversed returning pure unadulterated form islam
like rida unlike islamic modernist al-banna viewed western secular idea main danger islam modern age
islamic modernist belief co-opted secularist ruler official ulama brotherhood moved traditionalist conservative direction available outlet whose religious cultural sensibility outraged impact westernisation
brotherhood argued salafist solution contemporary challenge faced muslim advocating establishment islamic state implementation shari'ah based salafi revivalism

despite brotherhood salafists advocate implementation sharia emphasizes strict doctrinal adherence teaching prophet muhammad salaf al-salih
salafi-activists long tradition political involvement highly active islamist movement like muslim brotherhood various branch affiliates

historian believe modernist used term salafiyya movement although strongly disputed least one scholar henri lauzire
term salafi wa revived slogan movement among latter-day muslim follower muhammad abduh
popular western discourse early twentieth century term salafiyya stood wide range revivalist reformist rationalist movement arab world sought reconciliation islamic faith various aspect modernity
rise pan-islamism across muslim world first world war collapse ottoman empire would herald emergence salafi religious purism fervently opposed modernist trends
anti-colonial struggle restore khilafah would become top priority manifesting formation muslim brotherhood revolutionary movement established egyptian school teacher hassan al-banna
backed wahhabi clerical elite saudi arabia salafis advocated pan-islamism religious conservatism across muslim world emerged dominant gradually replaced modernist decolonisation period
according abu ammaar yasir qadhirashid rida popularized term 'salaf' describe particular movement spearheaded
movement sought reject ossification madhhabs rethink standard issue fiqh modernity time liberal ways
young scholar name muhammad nasiruddin al-albani read article rida took term used describe another completely different movement
ironically movement rida spearheaded eventually became modernist islam dropped 'salaf' label legal methodology al-albn championed minimal overlap rida's vision islam retained appellation 'salaf'
eventually al-albn's label wa adopted najd dawah well spread trend movement
otherwise century term 'salaf' wa used common label proper noun
therefore term 'salaf' ha attached age-old school theology athar schoolhistorian henri lauzire asserts modernist intellectual like abduh afghani identified movement salafiyya
hand islamic revivalist like mahmud shukri al-alusi ce muhammad rashid rida ce jamal al-din al-qasimi ce etc
used salafiyya term primarily denote traditionalist sunni theology atharism
rida also regarded wahhabi movement part salafiyya trend
apart wahabi najd athari theology could also traced back alusi family iraq ahl-i hadith india scholar rashid rida egypt
rida steered reformist programme towards path fundamentalist counter-reformation
tendency led rida emphasized following salaf al-salih pious predecessor became known salafiyya movement advocated re-generation pristine religious teaching early muslim community
propagation flawed yet conventional notion western scholarship wherein islamic modernist movement 'abduh afghani wa equated salafiyya first attributed french intellectual louis massignon
progressive view early modernist afghani abduh soon replaced puritan athari tradition espoused student zealously denounced idea non-muslims secular ideology like liberalism
theological transformation wa led syed rashid rida adopted strict athari creedal doctrine ibn taymiyyah early twentieth century
salafiyya movement popularised rida would advocate athari-wahhabi theology
promotion ijtihad wa based referring back strictly textual methodology
traditionalist vision wa adopted wahhabi clerical establishment championed influential figure syrian-albanian hadith scholar muhammad nasiruddin al-albani d
scholarly movement enlightened salafism begun declining time death muhammad abduh in
puritanical stance rashid rida accelerated support wahhabi movement transformed salafiyya movement incrementally became commonly regarded traditional salafism
division enlightened salafis inspired abduh traditional salafis represented rashid rida disciple would eventually exacerbate
gradually modernist salafis became totally disassociated salafi label popular discourse would identify tanwiris enlightened islamic modernists
