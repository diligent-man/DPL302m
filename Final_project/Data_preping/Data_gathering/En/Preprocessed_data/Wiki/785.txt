islamic modernism is a movement that has been described as the first muslim ideological response to the western cultural challenge attempting to reconcile the islamic faith with modern values such as democracy civil rights rationality equality and progress
it featured a critical reexamination of the classical conceptions and methods of jurisprudence and a new approach to islamic theology and quranic exegesis tafsir
a contemporary definition describes it as an effort to re read islam s fundamental sources the qur an and the sunna the practice of the prophet by placing them in their historical context and then reinterpreting them non literally in the light of the modern context
it was one of the of several islamic movements including islamic secularism islamism and salafism that emerged in the middle of the th century in reaction to the rapid changes of the time especially the perceived onslaught of western civilization and colonialism on the muslim world
prominent leaders of the movement include sir sayyid ahmed khan namik kemal rifa a al tahtawi muhammad abduh a sheikh of al azhar university for a brief period before his death in and jamal ad din al afghani
since its inception islamic modernism has suffered from co option of its original reformism by both secularist rulers and by the official ulama whose task it is to legitimise rulers actions in religious terms
islamic modernism differs from secularism in that it insists on the importance of religious faith in public life and from salafism or islamism in that it embraces contemporary european institutions social processes and values
one expression of islamic modernism formulated by mahathir mohammed is that only when islam is interpreted so as to be relevant in a world which is different from what it was years ago can islam be regarded as a religion for all ages
during the second half of the th century numerous muslim reformers began efforts to reconcile islamic values with the social and intellectual ideas of the age of enlightenment by purging islam from alleged alterations and adhering to the basic tenets held during the rashidun era
their movement is regarded as the precursor to islamic modernism
the origins of contemporary salafiyya movement from the modernist movement of jamal al din al afghani and muhammad abduh is mentioned by some authors although other scholars note that modernism only influenced salafism
according to quintan wiktorowicz
there has been some confusion in recent years because both the islamic modernists and the contemporary salafis refer referred to themselves as al salafiyya leading some observers to erroneously conclude a common ideological lineage
the earlier salafiyya modernists however were predominantly rationalist asharis
muhammad abduh and his movement have sometimes been referred to as neo mu tazilites in reference to the mu tazila school of theology
some have said abduh s ideas are congruent to mu tazilism
abduh himself denied being either ash ari or a mu tazilite although he only denied being a mu tazilite on the basis that he rejected strict taqlid conformity to one group
according to oxford bibliographies the early islamic modernists al afghani and muhammad abdu used the term salafiyya to refer to their attempt at renovation of islamic thought and this movement is often known in the west as islamic modernism although it is very different from what is called the salafiyya which generally refers to movements such as ahl i hadith wahhabism etc
associate professor of middle eastern history at northwestern university henri lauziere disputes the notion that al afghani and abduh advocated a modernist movement of salafism
according to lauziere based on what the technical term salafism meant to muslim religious specialists until the early twentieth century al afghani and abduh were hardly salafis to begin with
no wonder they never claimed the label for themselves islamic modernism began as an intellectual movement during the tanzimat era and was part of the ottoman constitutional movement and newly emerging patriotic trends of ottomanism during the mid th century
it advocated for novel redefinitions of ottoman imperial structure bureaucratic reforms implementing liberal constitution centralisation parliamentary system and was supportive of the young ottoman movement
although modernist activists agreed with the conservative ottoman clergy in emphasising the muslim character of the empire they also had fierce disputes with them
while the ottoman clerical establishment called for muslim unity through the preservation of the dynastic authority and unquestionable allegiance to the ottoman sultan modernist intellectuals argued that imperial unity was better served through parliamentary reforms and enshrining equal treatment of all ottoman subjects muslim and non muslim
the modernist elites frequently invoked religious slogans to gain support for cultural and educational efforts as well as their political efforts to unite the ottoman empire under a secular constitutional order
on the other hand salafiyya movement emerged as an independent revivalist trend in syria amongst the scholarly circles of scripture oriented damascene ulema during the s
although salafis shared many of the socio political grievances of the modernist activists they held different objectives from both the modernist and the wider constitutionalist movements
while the salafis opposed the autocratic policies of the sultan abdul hamid ii and the ottoman clergy they also intensely denounced the secularising and centralising tendencies of tanzimat reforms brought forth by the constitutionalist activists accusing them of emulating europeans
set apart by their status as ulema salafi scholars called for an islamic solution to the social political and technological challenges faced by muslims by directly turning to the scriptures
opposing monarchy and despotism salafis envisioned an islamic state based on shura consultative system and guided by qualified ulema islamic scholars whose duty was to uphold the pristine islam of the salaf al salih pious forebears
salafi scholars stood for decentralisation demanded more autonomy to arab provinces and called for the integration of reformist ulema to the syrian political leadership
both the salafis and the ottoman clerical elite were locked in bitter political and religious rivalry throughout the late nineteenth and early th centuries with their fierce polemical feuds often ending in violent clashes
some of the famous encounters include mujtahids incident of in which leading salafi figures like jamal al din qasimi was put to trial for their claims of ijtihad a mob attack by supporters of a sufi shaykh on rashid rida at the umayyad mosque in detention and arrest of abd al hamid al zahrawi raids conducted on the homes of various salafi scholars like tahir al jaza iri etc
some themes in modern islamic thought include
the acknowledgement with varying degrees of criticism or emulation of the technological scientific and legal achievements of the west while at the same time objecting to western colonial exploitation of muslim countries and the imposition of western secular values and aiming to develop a modern and dynamic understanding of science among muslims that would strengthen the muslim world and prevent further exploitation
denying that the islamic code of law is unalterable and unchangeable and instead claiming it can adapt itself to the social and political revolutions going on around it
cheragh ali in
invocation of the objectives of islamic law maqasid al sharia in support of public interest or maslahah a secondary source for islamic jurisprudence
this was done by islamic reformists in many parts of the globe to justify initiatives not addressed in classical commentaries but regarded as of urgent political and ethical concern
reinterpreting traditional islamic law using the four traditional sources of islamic jurisprudence the quran the reported deeds and sayings of muhammad hadith consensus of the theologians ijma and juristic reasoning by analogy qiyas plus another source ijtihad independent reasoning to find a solution to a legal question
taking and reinterpreting the first two sources the quran and ahadith to transform the last two ijma and qiyas in order to formulate a reformist project in light of the prevailing standards of scientific rationality and modern social theory
restricting traditional islamic law by limiting its basis to the quran and authentic sunnah limiting the sunna with radical hadith criticism
employing ijtihad not to only in the traditional narrow way to arrive at legal rulings in unprecedented cases where quran hadith and rulings of earlier jurists are silent but for critical independent reasoning in all domains of thought and perhaps even approving of its use by non jurists
a more or less radical re interpretation of the authoritative sources
this is particularly the case with the quranic verses on polygyny the hadd penal punishments jihad and treatment of unbelievers banning of usury or interest on loans riba which conflict with modern views
on the topic of jihad islamic scholars like ibn al amir al san ani muhammad abduh rashid rida ubaidullah sindhi yusuf al qaradawi shibli nomani etc
distinguished between defensive jihad jihad al daf and offensive jihad jihad al talab or jihad of choice
they refuted the notion of consensus on jihad al talab being a communal obligation fard kifaya
in support of this view these scholars referred to the works of classical scholars such as al jassas ibn taymiyya etc
according to ibn taymiyya the reason for jihad against non muslims is not their disbelief but the threat they pose to muslims
citing ibn taymiyya scholars like rashid rida al san ani qaradawi etc
argues that unbelievers need not be fought unless they pose a threat to muslims
thus jihad is obligatory only as a defensive warfare to respond to aggression or perfidy against the muslim community and that the normal and desired state between islamic and non islamic territories was one of peaceful coexistence similarly the th century islamic scholar muhammad ibn abd al wahhab defined jihad as a defensive military action to protect the muslim community and emphasized its defensive aspect in synchrony with later th century islamic writers
according to mahmud shaltut and other modernists unbelief was not sufficient cause for declaring jihad
the conversion to islam by unbelievers in fear of death at the hands of jihadists mujahideen was unlikely to prove sincere or lasting
much preferable means of conversion was education
they pointed to the verse no compulsion is there in religion
on the topic of riba syed ahmad khan fazlur rahman malik muhammad abduh rashid rida abd el razzak el sanhuri muhammad asad mahmoud shaltout all took issue with the jurist orthodoxy that any and all interest was riba and forbidden believing that there was a difference between interest and usury
these jurists took precedent for their position from the classical scholar ibn taymiyya who argued in his treatise the removal of blames from the great imams that scholars are divided on the prohibition of riba al fadl
ibn qayyim al jawziyya the student of ibn taymiyya also distinguished between riba al nasi ah and riba al fadl maintaining that only rib al nasi ah was prohibited by qur an and sunnah definitively while the latter was only prohibited in order to stop the charging of interest
according to him the prohibition of riba al fadl was less severe and it could be allowed in dire need or greater public interest maslaha
hence under a compelling need an item may be sold with delay in return for dirhams or for another weighed substance despite implicating riba al nasi ah
an apologetic which links aspects of the islamic tradition with western ideas and practices and claims western practices in question were originally derived from islam
islamic apologetics has however been severely criticized by many scholars as superficial tendentious and even psychologically destructive so much so that the term apologetics has almost become a term of abuse in the literature on modern islam islamic modernist discourse emerged as an intellectual movement in the second quarter of nineteenth century during an era of wide ranging reforms initiated across the ottoman empire known as the tanzimat c e
the movement sought to harmonise classical islamic theological concepts with liberal constitutional ideas and advocated the reformulation of religious values in light of drastic social political and technological changes
intellectuals like namik kemal c e called for popular sovereignty and natural rights of citizens
major scholarly figures of this movement included the grand imam of al azhar hassan al attar d
ottoman vizier mehmed emin li pasha d
south asian philosopher sayyid ahmad khan d
jamal al din afghani d
inspired by their understanding of classical islamic thought these rationalist scholars regarded islam as a religion compatible with western philosophy and modern science
eventually the modernist intellectuals formed a secret society known as itt fak hamiyet patriotic alliance in which advocated political liberalism and modern constitutionalist ideals of popular sovereignty through religious discourse
the theological views of the azharite scholar muhammad abduh d
were greatly shaped by the th century ottoman intellectual discourse
similar to the early ottoman modernists abduh tried to bridge the gap between enlightenment ideals and traditional religious values
he believed that classical islamic theology was intellectually vigorous and portrayed kalam speculative theology as a logical methodology that demonstrated the rational spirit and vitality of islam
key themes of modernists would eventually be adopted by the ottoman clerical elite who underpinned liberty as a basic islamic principle
portraying islam as a religion that exemplified national development human societal progress and evolution ottoman shaykh al islam musa kazim efendi d
wrote in his article islam and progress published in the religion of islam is not an obstacle to progress
on the contrary it is that which commands and encourages progress it is the very reason for progress itself commencing in the late nineteenth century and impacting the twentieth century muhammed abduh and his followers undertook an educational and social project to defend modernize and revitalize islam to match western institutions and social processes
its most prominent intellectual founder muhammad abduh d
ah ce was sheikh of al azhar university for a brief period before his death
this project superimposed the world of the nineteenth century on the extensive body of islamic knowledge that had accumulated in a different milieu
these efforts had little impact at first
after abduh s death his movement was catalysed by the demise of the ottoman caliphate in and promotion of secular liberalism particularly with a new breed of writers being pushed to the fore including egyptian ali abd al raziq s publication attacking islamic politics for the first time in muslim history
subsequent secular writers of this trend including farag foda al ashmawi muhamed khalafallah taha husayn husayn amin et al have argued in similar tones
abduh was skeptical towards many hadith or traditions i e
towards the body of reports of the teachings doings and sayings of the islamic prophet muhammad
particularly towards those traditions that are reported through few chains of transmission even if they are deemed rigorously authenticated in any of the six canonical books of hadith known as the kutub al sittah
furthermore he advocated a reassessment of traditional assumptions even in hadith studies though he did not devise a systematic methodology before his death
after its peak during the early th century the modernist movement would gradually decline after the dissolution of the ottoman empire in the s and eventually lost ground to conservative reform movements such as salafism
from western oriental scholars like louis massignon began categorising broad swathes of scripture oriented rationalist scholars and modernists as part of the paradigm of salafiyya a theological term which was erroneously perceived as a reformist slogan
following the first world war western colonialism of muslim lands and the advancement of secularist trends islamic reformers felt betrayed by the arab nationalists and underwent a crisis
this schism was epitomised by the ideological transformation of sayyid rashid rida a pupil of abduh who began to resuscitate the treatises of hanbali theologian ibn taymiyyah and became the forerunner of islamist thought by popularising his ideals
unlike abduh and afghani rida and his disciples susbcribed to the hanbali theology
they would openly campaign against adherents of other schools like the shi ites who were critical of wahhabi doctrines
rida transformed the reformation into a puritanical movement that advanced muslim identitarianism pan islamism and preached the superiority of islamic culture while attacking westernisation
one of the major hallmarks of rida s movement was his advocacy of a theological doctrine that obligated the establishment of an islamic state led by the ulema islamic scholars
rida s fundamentalist doctrines would later be adopted by islamic scholars and islamist movements like the muslim brotherhood
according to the german scholar bassam tibi rida s islamic fundamentalism has been taken up by the muslim brethren a right wing radical movement founded in which has ever since been in inexorable opposition to secular nationalism
islamist movements like muslim brotherhood al ikhw n al muslim n were highly influenced by both islamic modernism and salafism
its founder hassan al banna was influenced by muhammad abduh and his salafi student rashid rida
al banna attacked the taqlid of the official ulama and insisted only the qur an and the best attested ahadith should be sources of the sharia
however it was the syrian salafi scholar rashid rida who influenced al banna the most
he was a dedicated reader of the writings of rashid rida and the magazine that rida published al manar
sharing rida s central concern with the decline of islamic civilization al banna too believed that this trend could be reversed only by returning to a pure unadulterated form of islam
like rida and unlike the islamic modernists al banna viewed western secular ideas as the main danger to islam in the modern age
as islamic modernist beliefs were co opted by secularist rulers and official ulama the brotherhood moved in a traditionalist and conservative direction being the only available outlet for those whose religious and cultural sensibilities had been outraged by the impact of westernisation
the brotherhood argued for a salafist solution to the contemporary challenges faced by the muslims advocating the establishment of an islamic state through implementation of the shari ah based on salafi revivalism
although the muslim brotherhood officially describes itself as a salafi movement the quietist salafis often contest their salafist credentials
the brotherhood differs from the purists in their strategy for combating the challenge of modernity and is focused on gaining control of the government
despite this both the brotherhood and salafists advocate the implementation of sharia and emphasizes strict doctrinal adherence to the teachings of prophet muhammad and the salaf al salih
the salafi activists who have a long tradition of political involvement are highly active in islamist movements like the muslim brotherhood and its various branches and affiliates
according to the brotherhood affiliated former egyptian president mohammed morsi the koran is our constitution the prophet muhammad is our leader jihad is our path and death for the sake of allah is our most lofty aspiration sharia sharia and then finally sharia
this nation will enjoy blessing and revival only through the islamic sharia the indonesian islamic organization muhammadiyah was founded in
often described as salafist and sometimes as islamic modernist it emphasized the authority of the qur an and the hadiths opposing syncretism and taqlid blind conformity to the ulema
as of it is said to have veered sharply toward a more conservative brand of islam under the leadership of din syamsuddin the head of the indonesian ulema council
jamal al din al afghani muhammad abduh muhammad al tahir ibn ashur syed ahmad khan and to a lesser extent mohammed al ghazali took some ideals of wahhabism such as endeavor to return to the islamic understanding of the first muslim generations salaf by reopening the doors of juristic deduction ijtihad that they saw as closed
some historians believe modernists used the term salafiyya for their movement although this is strongly disputed by at least one scholar henri lauzi re
american scholar nuh ha mim keller writes
the term salafi was revived as a slogan and movement among latter day muslims by the followers of muhammad abduh
in popular western discourse during the early twentieth century the term salafiyya stood for a wide range of revivalist reformist and rationalist movements in the arab world that sought a reconciliation of islamic faith with various aspects modernity
the rise of pan islamism across the muslim world after the first world war and the collapse of the ottoman empire would herald the emergence of salafi religious purism that fervently opposed modernist trends
the anti colonial struggle to restore the khilafah would become the top priority manifesting in the formation of the muslim brotherhood a revolutionary movement established in by the egyptian school teacher hassan al banna
backed by the wahhabi clerical elites of saudi arabia salafis who advocated pan islamism and religious conservatism across the muslim world emerged dominant and gradually replaced the modernists during the decolonisation period
according to abu ammaar yasir qadhi rashid rida popularized the term salaf to describe a particular movement that he spearheaded
that movement sought to reject the ossification of the madhhabs and rethink through the standard issues of fiqh and modernity at times in very liberal ways
a young scholar by the name of muhammad nasiruddin al albani read an article by rida and then took this term and used it to describe another completely different movement
ironically the movement that rida spearheaded eventually became modernist islam and dropped the salaf label and the legal methodology that al alb n championed with a very minimal overlap with rida s vision of islam retained the appellation salaf
eventually al alb n s label was adopted by the najd da wah as well until it spread in all trends of the movement
otherwise before this century the term salaf was not used as a common label and proper noun
therefore the term salaf has attached itself to an age old school of theology the athar school historian henri lauzi re asserts that modernist intellectuals like abduh and afghani had not identified their movement with salafiyya
on the other hand islamic revivalists like mahmud shukri al alusi c e muhammad rashid rida c e jamal al din al qasimi c e etc
used salafiyya as a term primarily to denote the traditionalist sunni theology atharism
rida also regarded the wahhabi movement as part of the salafiyya trend
apart from the wahhabis of najd athari theology could also be traced back to the alusi family in iraq ahl i hadith in india and scholars such as rashid rida in egypt
after rida steered his reformist programme towards the path of fundamentalist counter reformation
this tendency led by rida emphasized following the salaf al salih pious predecessors and became known as the salafiyya movement which advocated a re generation of pristine religious teachings of the early muslim community
the propagation of the flawed yet once conventional notion in the western scholarship wherein the islamic modernist movement of abduh and afghani was equated with salafiyya is first attributed to the french intellectual louis massignon
the progressive views of the early modernists afghani and abduh were soon replaced by the puritan athari tradition espoused by their students which zealously denounced the ideas of non muslims and secular ideologies like liberalism
this theological transformation was led by syed rashid rida who adopted the strict athari creedal doctrines of ibn taymiyyah during the early twentieth century
the salafiyya movement popularised by rida would advocate for an athari wahhabi theology
their promotion of ijtihad was based on referring back to a strictly textual methodology
its traditionalist vision was adopted by the wahhabi clerical establishment and championed by influential figures such as the syrian albanian hadith scholar muhammad nasiruddin al albani d
c e a h
as a scholarly movement enlightened salafism had begun declining some time after the death of muhammad abduh in
the puritanical stances of rashid rida accelerated by his support to the wahhabi movement transformed salafiyya movement incrementally and became commonly regarded as traditional salafism
the divisions between enlightened salafis inspired by abduh and traditional salafis represented by rashid rida and his disciples would eventually exacerbate
gradually the modernist salafis became totally disassociated from the salafi label in popular discourse and would identify as tanwiris enlightened or islamic modernists
although not all of the figures named below are from the above mentioned movement they all share a more or less modernist thought or and approach

amina wadud united states according to at least one source charles kennedy in pakistan the range of views on the appropriate role of islam in that country as of contains islamic modernists at one end of the spectrum and islamic activists at the other
islamic activists support the expansion of islamic law and islamic practices islamic modernists are lukewarm to this expansion and some may even advocate development along the secularist lines of the west
many orthodox fundamentalist and traditionalist muslims strongly opposed modernism as bid ah and the most dangerous heresy of the day for its association with westernization and western education whereas other orthodox traditionalist muslims even some orthodox muslim scholars think that modernisation of islamic law is not violating the principles of fiqh and it is a form of going back to the qur an and the sunnah
supporters of salafi movement considered modernists neo mu tazila after the medieval islamic school of theology based on rationalism mu tazila
critics argue that the modernist thought is little more than the fusion of western secularism with spiritual aspects of islam
other critics have described the modernist positions on politics in islam as ideological stances
one of the leading islamist thinkers and islamic revivalists abul a la maududi agreed with islamic modernists that islam contained nothing contrary to reason and was superior in rational terms to all other religious systems
however he disagreed with them in their examination of the quran and the sunna using reason as the standard
maududi instead started from the proposition that true reason is islamic and accepted the book and the sunna not reason as the final authority
modernists erred in examining rather than simply obeying the quran and the sunna
critics argue politics is inherently embedded in islam a rejection of the christian and secular principle of render unto caesar what is caesar s
they claim that there is a consensus in muslim political jurisprudence philosophy and practice with regard to the caliphate form of government with a clear structure comprising a caliph assistants mu awinoon governors wulaat judges qudaat and administrators mudeeroon
it is argued that muslim jurists have tended to work with the governments of their times
notable examples are abu yusuf mohammed ibn al hasan shafi i yahya bin said abu hamid al ghazali ismail bin yasa ibn tulun abu zura abu hasan al mawardi and tabari
prominent theologians would counsel the caliph in discharging his islamic duties often on the request of the incumbent caliph
many rulers provided patronage to scholars across all disciplines the most famous being the abassids who funded extensive translation programmes and the building of libraries
