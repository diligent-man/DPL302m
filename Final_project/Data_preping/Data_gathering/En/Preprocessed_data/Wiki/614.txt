takaful arabic sometimes translated as solidarity or mutual guarantee is a co operative system of reimbursement or repayment in case of loss organized as an islamic or sharia compliant alternative to conventional insurance which contains riba usury and gharar excessive uncertainty
under takaful people and companies concerned about hazards make regular contributions donations to be reimbursed or repaid to members in the event of loss and managed on their behalf by a takaful operator
like other islamic finance products takaful is grounded in islamic muamalat commercial and civil acts or dealings branch of islamic law
in the takaful industry had grown to a size of billion of contributions from a figure of billion
the movement has been praised as providing superior alternatives to insurance that reinvigorate human capital emphasize personal
dignity community self help and economic self development but also criticized as having dwindled in scope to an industry of conventional insurance with arabic terminology and language of contract
theoretically takaful is perceived as cooperative or mutual insurance where members contribute a certain sum of money to a common pool
the purpose of this system is not profits but to uphold the principle of bear ye one another s burden
the principles of takaful are as follows
policyholders cooperate among themselves for their common good
policyholders contributions are considered as donations to the fund pool
every policyholder pays his subscription to help those who need assistance
losses are divided and liabilities spread according to the community pooling system
uncertainty is eliminated concerning subscription and compensation
it does not derive advantage at the cost of others muslims scholar have hardly any difference of opinion on the need for managing redeeming and mitigating general business and life risks covered by the insurance business
but whether conventional insurance is forbidden haram is disputed
in its second session december the fiqh academy of the organisation of islamic cooperation also called the international islamic fiqh academy ruled conventional commercial but not social insurance haram forbidden
its ninth resolution stated the commercial insurance contract with a fixed insurance premium as practiced by commercial insurance companies contains substantial gharar which renders the contract defective
consequently it is legally forbidden
islamic scholars began forbidding commercial insurance as early as the late nineteenth century c e
the majority of scholars and fundamentalists i e
most islamic scholars believe commercial insurance is disallowed for muslims because it contains
al gharar uncertainty
al maisir gambling
riba usury they have two main concerns about conventional insurance
the uncertainty if and when the insured event will take place and if it does take place what would be the relationship of compensation to the insurance premium paid
what if the holder of collision insurance policy never has a motor vehicle accident they lose and the insurance company wins
regarding life insurance everyone dies but what if the death occurs after the first payment of a premium for life insurance they win and the insurance company loses this makes the insurance business similar to gambling where the gambler does not know the fate of the game
thus uncertainty in the conventional insurance business is excessive and borders on prohibited gharar
insurance companies invest surplus funds on the basis of interest and pay out a part of such earnings to policyholders as bonuses according to the orthodox interpretation this is riba according to jamal zarabozo the majority of modern muslim such as scholars from islamic fiqh council of the organisation of islamic cooperation the board of the leading scholars of saudi arabia the fiqh council of mecca under the auspices of muslim world league siddiq ad dharir wahbah al zuhayli muhammad mustafa as sinqithi salaah al saawi abdullah al muslih sulaiman thunayaan ali abu al basl abdur rawf al shaadhili faisal maulawi mohammad muslehuddin afzalur rahman and numerous other respected scholars and jurists were unanimously agree that commercial insurance were forbidden
a minority of islamic scholars argue that insurance is not like gambling because in gambling no risk is covered and no damage is mitigated
the gamblers play a game of chance for entertainment and profit in which they can win or lose based on a conscious decision
insurance provides coverage for events out of the insured policyholder s control
when the policyholder collects a payout they are not a winner but a loser who at least has some compensation
furthermore while insurance involves uncertainty statistical techniques and actuarial sciences have progressed to a stage where the insurance company can calculate its risks and benefits with great precision so that the uncertainty involved in insurance can scarcely be called excessive in normal circumstances
islamic scholars supporting takaful point to qur an
and several sayings hadith of the islam prophet muhammad
some examples are
qur anbasis of co operation help one another in al birr and in al taqwa both virtue righteousness and piety but do not help one another in sin and transgression
s rat al m idah verse
hadithgod will always help his servant for as long as he helps others
narratives by imam ahmad ibn hanbal and imam abu daud
basis of responsibility the place of relationships and feelings of people with faith between each other is just like the body when one of its parts is afflicted with pain then the rest of the body will be affected
narratives by imam al bukhari and imam muslim
one true muslim mu min and another true muslim are like a building whereby every part in it strengthens the other part
narratives by imam al bukhari and imam muslim
basis of mutual protection by my life which is in god s power nobody will enter paradise if he does not protect his neighbour who is in distress
narrative of imam ahmad bin hanbal the fundamentals underlying takaful are very similar to co operative and mutual principles to the extent that the co operative and mutual model is one that is accepted under islamic law
the concept of takaful has reportedly been practised in various forms since ad
the first practitioner of takaful were known as zubayr ibn al awwam companion of the prophet as this practice were allowed according to classical scholar consensus such as ibn taymiyyah in his majmu fatawa
in practice takaful were regarded as technically as zero interests banking with fundraising business model
in the eyes of scholars and researchers al zubair entrepreneurship of tafakul has become serious object of study by scholars of islamic institutions regarding the conduct and ethics in business in accordance of islamic fiqh such as dr erwandi tarmizi
additionally modern researchers of islamic banking and islamic financing theorists has delved the business aspect of zubayr during his lifetime as rolemodel
one of the principles of az zubayr business were the ethics of fundraising based business according to sharia
this type of fundraising business consisted of zubayr practice of accepting safety deposits as a loan and investing the money without accepting interest as profit of the business which regarded as usury in islam teaching
according to ali ahmad salih professor of middle east university in jordan this fundraising takaful business of zubayr ibn al awwam were centered in medina with its branches spread in alexandria kufa and basra
ali ahmad salih pointed out the evidences based on the recods of hisham ibn urwah narration in tabaqat al kubra which written by ibn sa d
during abbasid caliphate era such islamic banking system were apparent
there were even one business center named dar uz zubayr in basra that accept any deposits
zafarul islam theorized in his academic journal released by aligarh muslim university that the deposit center were named after zubayr ibn al awwam
meanwhile modern day pakistani islamic business theorist zubair mughal has further observed the model of zubayr ibn al awwam practice of tafakul to avoid the gharar risky business gambling and riba which all forbidden by islamic law
muslim jurists acknowledge that the basis of shared responsibility in the system of aquila as practised between the muslims of mecca and medina laid the foundation of mutual insurance
in the case of insurance as with commercial banks orthodox opinion prevailed and with a consensus among muslim scholars about the legitimacy of takaful and the illegitimacy of conventional insurance the movement for islamizing the contemporary insurance business started around the mid s
in a fatwa was issued by the higher council of saudi arabia in favor of an islamic model of insurance
the international islamic fiqh academy jeddah of the organisation of islamic cooperation also approved takaful as a legitimate form of business in
the islamic insurance company of sudan started as the first takaful company in
by the mid s there were seven takaful companies in sudan dubai saudi arabia bahrain and jordan
the industry grew from billion in to billion in
by the end of total takaful contributions amounted to billion as compared to trillion for conventional insurance
in there were companies around the world engaged in takaful business dedicated takaful companies and five offering takaful products from islamic windows
by there were
as with the traditional forms of insurance reinsurance of a takaful operation may be used known as retakaful
also in aig a non muslim us based company with more than million customers in countries established a takaful subsidiary called aig takaful enaya headquartered in bahrain
as of the leading takaful countries are malaysia and the gulf states
it was reported in that out of total takaful companies are takaful windows however these takaful windows own only of the total takaful assets
there are several models and several variations of how takaful can be implemented
mudharabah model profit sharing the managers shareholders are sharing profit and losses with the policyholders used initially in far east
tabarru based donations tabarru i e
premiums are accumulated into a fund to meet members losses
members are not allowed to take back any contributions or profits from investments
a combination of tabarru and mudharabah bahrain uae and middle east countries
wakala model agency fee received up front from the contributors and transferred to shareholders fund
al waqf based model waqf is a distinct entity and a legal person
according to one critic except for names and terms the essence of both al waqf takaful and conventional insurance is the same and as a consequence this structure has come under a lot of criticism from shari ah scholars
mainly used in pakistan and south africa according to this principle the al mudharib takaful operator accepts payment of the takaful installments or takaful contributions premiums known as ra s ul mal from investors or providers of capital or funds takaful participants acting as sahib ul mal
the contract specifies how the profits or surplus from the operations of the takaful is to be shared in accordance with the principle of al mudharabah between the participants as providers of capital and the takaful operator
the sharing of such profit may be in a ratio of and so forth as mutually agreed between the contracting parties
in order to eliminate the element of uncertainty in the takaful contract the concept of tabarru to donate contribute or give away is incorporated
relating to this concept a participant agrees to relinquish as tabarru a certain proportion of his takaful installments or contributions that he agrees or undertakes to pay should any of his fellow participants suffer a defined loss
this agreement enables him to fulfill his obligation of mutual help and joint guarantee
in essence tabarru enables participants to perform their deeds in assisting fellow participants who might suffer a loss or damage due to a catastrophe or disaster
the sharing of profit or surplus that may emerge from the operations of a takaful is made only after the obligation of assisting the fellow participants has been fulfilled
it is imperative therefore for a takaful operator to maintain adequate assets of the defined funds under its care whilst striving prudently to ensure the funds are sufficiently protected against over exposure
therefore the provision of insurance coverage is in conformity with shariah based on the islamic principles of al takaful and al mudharabah
al mudharabah is the commercial profit sharing contract between the provider or providers of funds for a business venture and the entrepreneur who actually conducts the business
the operation of a takaful may thus be envisaged as the profit sharing business venture between the takaful operator and the individual members of a group of participants who desire to reciprocally guarantee each other against a certain loss or damage that may be inflicted upon any one of them
one complaint made against most takaful by muhammad akram khan is that despite the talk of solidarity most takaful holders do not have any voice in the management of the takaful
the to takaful operator makes all the crucial decisions such as rate of premium risk strategy asset management and allocation of surpluses and profits
the shareholders of the to and not the takaful holders appoint and dismiss managers of the takaful
similarly mahmud el gamal complains that even companies that use the term takaful ta wun cooperative mutual guarantee or insurance are structured with stockholder rather than policyholder ownership despite the ruling of the international islamic fiqh academy that permitted insurance as cooperative insurance built on the principles of voluntary contribution tabarru and mutual cooperation
an exception to this state of affairs can be found in sudan where the takaful holders have more say in the management of the takaful business
whether takaful is significantly different from conventional insurance has been questioned
islamic economist mohammad najatuallah siddiqui writes that the form of organization chosen to take advantage of the law of large numbers does not change the reality
we can make insurance a not for profit activity provided we can ensure efficient management but it does not change the essential nature of what is being done according to rakaan kayali the fact that benefits for the takaful members are distributed as funds allow rather than defined by the policy may lead to conflict among members if for example one member s claim uses up takaful funds so that another member with an equally valid claim a short time later is not compensated or not compensated in full
additionally there has been doubt cast on the legitimacy of claiming that takaful participants are making donations
this is because the word donations implies giving with no expectation of worldly return
this is clearly not the case with takaful participants who are seeking insurance
