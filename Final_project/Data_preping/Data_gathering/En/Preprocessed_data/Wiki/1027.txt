russell who co wrote the screenplay with jeff baena
a self described existential comedy i heart huckabees follows a pair of detectives dustin hoffman and lily tomlin hired to investigate the meaning of the life of their clients jude law jason schwartzman mark wahlberg and naomi watts

young albert markovski heads the local chapter of the open spaces coalition environmental group
one of their current projects is stopping the building of a new chain store big box department stores huckabees
albert is a rival of brad stand a shallow executive at huckabees
brad infiltrates open spaces and charismatically displaces albert as the leader
dawn campbell is brad s live in girlfriend and the face and voice of huckabees appearing in all of the store s ads
after seeing the same conspicuous stranger three times albert contacts a couple of existential detectives bernard and vivian jaffe
they offer him their optimistic brand of existentialism they call universal interconnectivity combining romantic and transcendentalist philosophies and spy on him ostensibly to help him solve the coincidence
fireman tommy corn is another client of the jaffe s with an idealistic obsessively anti petroleum industry philosophy
they introduce albert to tommy as his other and they become friends
tommy grows dissatisfied with the jaffes feeling they are not helping
seeking out other possibilities he ends up abandoning and undermining the jaffes by introducing albert to caterine vauban a former student of the jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing nihilistic absurdist philosophy
caterine teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and problems to synthesize a non thinking state of pure being lifted from their troubles they wish to keep that feeling forever
but she says it is inevitable to be drawn back into human drama and the core truth of it is misery and meaninglessness
to prove her point caterine takes albert into the woods to have sex leaving tommy behind
he finds out about it and feels hurt
she tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama
tommy rejects this idea and leaves them furious and lost
meanwhile in brad s further attempts to undercut albert he and dawn meet with and are influenced by bernard and vivian
in the following days brad and dawn rethink their entire lives she rejects the modeling world looking for deeper meaning while he realizes his whole ascent up the corporate ladder is meaningless as he has focused his whole life on trying to please others and not himself
all the storylines collide when brad s house catches fire
while the fire trucks get stuck in a traffic jam tommy arrives on his bicycle to put out the fire which also trapped dawn inside
as he saves her life they fall in love
meanwhile brad despairs at the destruction of his home the symbol of his material success
albert attains a sort of enlightenment when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the jaffes and caterine to realize the cosmic truth of everything
brad meanwhile is fired from huckabees leaving him rudderless
albert reveals to him that the fire started when he burned brad s jet skis then it spread to the rest of the house
he says they are no different that everything really is inextricably connected but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence
having realized this he refers brad to caterine believing she can help him as she did albert and tommy
albert and tommy talk later about everything that has happened
caterine and the jaffes watch them from afar concluding they can close both of their cases

before directing his first feature spanking the monkey russell intended to make a film about a guy who sits in the back of a chinese restaurant with microphones on every table to surreptitiously listen to everybody s conversations then write perversely personal fortunes for each of the people hitting a writer s block russell could not figure out how to make the film work

ideas in the script stayed with him though and they would later form the basis for the huckabee script
the final idea came to russell in a dream where this female detective she was not following me for criminal reasons but she was following me for spiritual and metaphysical reasons russell who makes a habit of writing his dreams down knew instantly upon reading his summary of the dream that this was the story he wanted to pursue

the process can be seen on a featurette on the film s special edition dvd

russell while working with brion had come across brion s first solo album meaningless
