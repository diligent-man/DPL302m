John Rogers Commons October May was an American institutional economist Georgist progressive and labor historian at the University of WisconsinMadison
Commons was born in Hollansburg Ohio on October
Commons had a religious upbringing which led him to be an advocate for social justice early in life
Commons was considered a poor student and suffered from a mental illness while studying
He was allowed to graduate without finishing because of the potential seen in his intense determination and curiosity
At this time Commons became a follower of Henry George's 'single tax' economics
He carried this 'Georgist' or 'Ricardian' approach to economics with a focus on land and monopoly rents throughout the rest of his life including a proposal for income taxes with higher rates on land rents
After graduating from Oberlin College Commons did two years of graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University where he studied under Richard T
After appointments at Oberlin and Indiana University Commons began teaching at Syracuse University in
In spring Syracuse dismissed him as a radical
Eventually Commons re-entered academia at the University of Wisconsin in
Commons' early work exemplified his desire to unite Christian ideals with the emerging social sciences of sociology and economics
He was a frequent contributor to Kingdom magazine was a founder of the American Institute for Christian Sociology and authored a book in called Social Reform and the Church
He was an advocate of temperance legislation and was active in the national Prohibition Party
By his Wisconsin years Commons' scholarship had become less moralistic and more empirical and he moved away from a religious viewpoint in his ethics and sociology
Commons is best known for developing an analysis of collective action by the state and other institutions which he saw as essential to understanding economics
Commons believed that carefully crafted legislation could create social change that view led him to be known as a socialist radical and incrementalist
Contrary to some published accounts Commons did consider African Americans capable of voting
When he advocated proportional representation he suggested a negro party
He even suggested applying the Thirteenth amendment to the Constitution to force Southern States to allow African Americans to vote
He continued the strong American tradition in institutional economics by such figures as the economist and social theorist Thorstein Veblen
His notion of transaction is one of the most important contributions to Institutional Economics
The institutional theory was closely related to his remarkable successes in fact-finding and drafting legislation on a wide range of social issues for the state of Wisconsin
He drafted legislation establishing Wisconsin's worker's compensation program the first of its kind in the United States
In Commons co-founded the American Association for Labor Legislation AALL with other economists
Commons was a contributor to The Pittsburgh Survey a sociological investigation of a single American city
Fitch wrote The Steel Workers a classic depiction of a key industry in early th-century America
It was one of six key texts to come out of the survey
Witte later known as the father of social security also did his PhD at the University of WisconsinMadison under Commons
He was a leading advocate of proportional representation in the United States writing a book on the subject in and serving as vice-president of the Proportional Representation League
Commons undertook two major studies of the history of labor unions in the United States
Beginning in he edited A Documentary History of American Industrial Society a large work that preserved many original-source documents of the American labor movement
Almost as soon as that work was complete Commons began editing History of Labor in the United States a narrative work which built on the previous -volume documentary history
In Commons published Institutional Economics which laid out his view that institutions were made up of collective actions that along with conflict of interests defined the economy
He believed that institutional economics added collective control of individual transactions to existing economic theory
Commons considered the Scottish economist Henry Dunning Macleod to be the originator of Institutional economics
Today Commons's contribution to labor history is considered equal to his contributions to the theory of institutional economics
He also made valuable contributions to the history of economic thought especially with regard to collective action
He is honored at the University of Wisconsin in Madison with rooms and clubs named for him
Commons was the mentor of many outstanding economists and has been credited with originating the Wisconsin Idea in which university faculty serve as advisors to state government
and Nell Commons House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places
An institution is defined as collective action in control liberation and expansion of individual action —Institutional Economics American Economic Review vol
But the smallest unit of the institutional economists is a unit of activity — a transaction with its participants
Transactions intervene between the labor of the classic economists and the pleasures of the hedonic economists simply because it is society that controls access to the forces of nature and transactions are not the exchange of commodities but the alienation and acquisition between individuals of the rights of property and liberty created by society which must therefore be negotiated between the parties concerned before labor can produce or consumers can consume or commodities be physically exchanged —Institutional Economics American Economic Review vol
