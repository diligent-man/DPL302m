a prayer wheel is a cylindrical wheel tibetan wylie khor lo on a spindle made from metal wood stone leather or coarse cotton widely used in tibet and areas where tibetan culture is predominant
traditionally a mantra is written in ranjana script or tibetan script on the outside of the wheel
the mantra om mani padme hum is most commonly used but other mantras may be used as well
also sometimes depicted are dakinis protectors and very often the eight auspicious symbols ashtamangala
at the core of the cylinder is a life tree often made of wood or metal with certain mantras written on or wrapped around it
many thousands or in the case of larger prayer wheels millions of mantras are then wrapped around this life tree
according to the tibetan buddhist tradition based on the lineage texts regarding prayer wheels spinning such a wheel will have much the same meritorious effect as orally reciting the prayers
prayer wheel or mani wheel tibetan wylie mani chos khor
the tibetan term is a contraction mani itself is a contraction of sanskrit cintamani chos is tibetan for dharma and khor or khorlo means chakrano
the common term prayer wheel is a double misnomer
a long strip of rolled up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras rather than prayers per se is inside the cylinder
the term mantra mill in contrast to prayer wheel is perhaps a better translation of the tibetan khor lo since a mill refers to a turning process that generates a particular output in this case generating merit
the first prayer wheels which are driven by wind have been used in tibet and china since the fourth century
the concept of the prayer wheel is a physical manifestation of the phrase turning the wheel of dharma which describes the way in which the buddha taught
historians such as ferdinand d
lessing fr de sv have argued that the prayer wheels developed from chinese revolving bookcases chinese pinyin zhu n l n z ng popular among buddhist monasteries
according to the tibetan tradition the prayer wheel lineage traces back to the famous indian master nagarjuna
tibetan texts also say that the practice was taught by the indian buddhist masters tilopa and naropa as well as the tibetan masters marpa and milarepa
kawaguchi mentions in his book that the prayer wheel originated in the mani lhakhang where je tsongkhapa invented it
prayer wheels originated from the school of shakyamuni sutra volume pagoda and temple which states that
according to the lineage texts on prayer wheels prayer wheels are used to accumulate wisdom and merit good karma and to purify negativities bad karma
in buddhism buddhas and bodhisattvas have created a variety of skillful means upaya to help bring practitioners ever closer to realizing enlightenment
the idea of spinning mantras relates to numerous tantric practices whereby the tantric practitioner visualizes mantras revolving around the nadis and especially around the meridian chakras such as the heart and crown
therefore prayer wheels are a visual aid for developing one s capacity for these types of tantric visualizations
the spiritual method for those practicing with a prayer wheel is very specific with slight variations according to different buddhist sects
the practitioner most often spins the wheel clockwise as the direction in which the mantras are written is that of the movement of the sun across the sky
on rare occasions advanced tantric practitioners such as those of senge dongma the lion faced dakini spin prayer wheels counterclockwise to manifest a more wrathful protective energy
as the practitioner turns the wheel it is best to focus the mind and repeat the om mani padme hum mantra
not only does this increase the merit earned by the wheel s use but it is a mind stabilization technique that trains the mind while the body is in motion
intoning the mani mantra with mindfulness and the bodhicitta motivation dramatically enhances the effects of the prayer wheel
however it is said that even turning it while distracted has benefits and merits and it is stated in the lineage text that even insects that cross a prayer wheel s shadow will get some benefit
each revolution is as meritorious as reading the inscription aloud as many times as it is written on the scroll and this means that the more om mani padme hum mantras that are inside a prayer wheel the more powerful it is
it is best to turn the wheel with a gentle rhythm and not too fast or frantically
while turning smoothly one keeps in mind the motivation and spirit of compassion and bodhichitta the noble mind that aspires to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings
the benefits attributed to the practice of turning the wheel are vast
not only does it help wisdom compassion and bodhichitta arise in the practitioner it also enhances siddhis spiritual powers such as clairvoyance precognition reading others thoughts etc the practitioner can repeat the mantra as many times as possible during the turning of the wheel stabilizing a calm meditative mind
at the end of a practice session there is a tibetan buddhist tradition of dedicating any accumulated merits that one may have gathered during practice to the benefit of all sentient beings
then om ah hum times
this is customary with tibetans upon completing any buddhist practice including the practice of the prayer wheel
thubten zopa rinpoche has commented that installing a prayer wheel has the capacity to completely transform a place which becomes peaceful pleasant and conducive to the mind
simply touching a prayer wheel is said to bring great purification to negative karmas and obscurations
the handheld prayer wheel mani lag khor has a cylindrical generally sheet metal body often beautifully embossed mounted on a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of turbinella conch shell
the cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a small weight allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist
the weighted chain known as a governor in western technology stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case
when the prayer wheel is spun in prayer the mantras inside become potent with the person s intent allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit
prayer wheels larger than human size are to be seen in separate rooms in tibetan buddhist temples and can be set in motion by pilgrims
with the help of a small bell the number of revolutions can be counted
the cylinders of fixed prayer wheels are often inscribed with the formula om mani padme hum meaning jewel in the lotus in ornamental lantsa ranjana letters
many monasteries around tibet have large fixed metal wheels set side by side in a row
passersby can turn the entire row of wheels simply by sliding their hands over each one
they are set in motion by pilgrims who circumambulate the building in a clockwise direction
this type of prayer wheel is simply a prayer wheel that is turned by flowing water
the water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into
this wheel is turned by the heat of a candle or electric light
the light emitted from the prayer wheel then purifies the negative karmas of the living beings it touches
this type of wheel is turned by wind
the wind that touches the prayer wheel helps alleviate the negative karma of those it touches
some prayer wheels are powered by electric motors
thardo khorlo as these electric wheels are sometimes known contain one thousand copies of the mantra of chenrezig and many copies of other mantras
the thardo khorlo can be accompanied by lights and music if one so chooses
electricity can certainly be considered similar to the above sources of energy for pw water fire wind
the merit generated by the pw is due to the power of the dharma texts and mantras not necessarily the power which rotates them
these pw turn all day all night all through the year
the lamas and practitioners who build maintain and pay for the electricity rightly help to generate and dedicate the merit
