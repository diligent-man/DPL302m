scott fitzgerald sinclair lewis ezra pound sherwood anderson and henri matisse would meet
in stein published a quasi memoir of her paris years the autobiography of alice b
toklas written in the voice of alice b
toklas her life partner
the book became a literary bestseller and vaulted stein from the relative obscurity of the cult literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention
two quotes from her works have become widely known rose is a rose is a rose is a rose and there is no there there with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of oakland
her books include q e d
about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of stein s friends fernhurst a fictional story about a love triangle three lives the making of americans and tender buttons
her activities during world war ii have been the subject of analysis and commentary
as a jew living in nazi occupied france stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector and indeed to ensure her physical safety through the protection of the powerful vichy government official and nazi collaborator bernard fa
after the war ended stein expressed admiration for another nazi collaborator vichy leader marshal p tain
stein the youngest of a family of five children was born on february in allegheny pennsylvania which merged with pittsburgh in to upper middle class jewish parents daniel stein and amelia n e keyser stein
her father was a wealthy businessman with real estate holdings
german and english were spoken in their home
gertrude s siblings were michael simon bertha and leo
when stein was three years old she and her family moved to vienna and then paris
accompanied by governesses and tutors the steins endeavored to imbue their children with the cultured sensibilities of european history and life
after a year long sojourn abroad they returned to america in settling in oakland california where her father became director of san francisco s streetcar lines the market street railway
stein attended first hebrew congregation of oakland s sabbath school
during their residence in oakland they lived for four years on a ten acre lot and stein built many memories of california there
she would often go on excursions with her brother leo with whom she developed a close relationship
stein found formal schooling in oakland unstimulating but she often read shakespeare wordsworth scott burns smollett fielding and more
when stein was years old her mother died
three years later her father died as well
stein s eldest brother michael stein age then took over the family business holdings moved his four siblings to san francisco where he now was a director of the market street cable railway company and in arranged for gertrude and another sister bertha to live with their mother s family in baltimore
here she lived with her uncle david bachrach who in had married gertrude s maternal aunt fanny keyser
in baltimore stein met claribel and etta cone who held saturday evening salons that she would later emulate in paris
the cones shared an appreciation for art and conversation about it and modeled a domestic division of labor that stein would replicate in her relationship with alice b
toklas
stein attended radcliffe college then an annex of harvard university from to and was a student of psychologist william james
with james s supervision stein and another student leon mendez solomons performed experiments on normal motor automatism a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking
these experiments yielded examples of writing that appeared to represent stream of consciousness a psychological theory often attributed to james and the style of modernist authors virginia woolf and james joyce
in behavioral psychologist b
skinner interpreted stein s difficult poem tender buttons as an example of normal motor automatism
in a letter stein wrote during the s she explained that she never accepted the theory of automatic writing t here can be automatic movements but not automatic writing
writing for the normal person is too complicated an activity to be indulged in automatically she did publish an article in a psychological journal on spontaneous automatic writing while at radcliffe but the unconscious and the intuition even when james himself wrote about them never concerned her
at radcliffe she began a lifelong friendship with mabel foote weeks whose correspondence traces much of the progression of stein s life
in stein spent the summer in woods hole massachusetts studying embryology at the marine biological laboratory
she received her a b
bachelor of arts magna cum laude from radcliffe in
william james who had become a committed mentor to stein at radcliffe recognizing her intellectual potential and declaring her his most brilliant woman student encouraged stein to enroll in medical school
although stein professed no interest in either the theory or practice of medicine she enrolled at johns hopkins school of medicine in
in her fourth year stein failed an important course lost interest and left
ultimately medical school had bored her and she had spent many of her evenings not applying herself to her studies but taking long walks and attending the opera
stein s tenure at johns hopkins was marked by challenges and stress
men dominated the medical field and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed
writing of this period in her life in things as they are stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture struggling to find her own identity which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role
her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn according to linda wagner martin stein s controversial stance on women s medicine caused problems with the male faculty and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree
asked to give a lecture to a group of baltimore women in stein gave a controversial speech titled the value of college education for women undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle class audience
in the lecture stein maintained
while a student at johns hopkins and purportedly still na ve about sexual matters stein experienced an awakening of her latent sexuality
sometime in or she became infatuated with mary bookstaver who was involved in a relationship with a medical student mabel haynes
witnessing the relationship between the two women served for stein as her erotic awakening
the unhappy love triangle demoralized stein arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies
in stein s brother leo stein left for london and stein followed
the following year the two relocated to paris where leo hoped to pursue an art career
from until when they dissolved their common household gertrude and her brother leo shared living quarters near the luxembourg gardens on the left bank of paris in a two story apartment with the adjacent studio located on the interior courtyard at rue de fleurus th arrondissement
here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance
the gallery space was furnished with imposing renaissance era furniture from florence italy
the paintings lined the walls in tiers trailing many feet to the ceiling
initially illuminated by gaslight the artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to world war i
leo stein cultivated important art world connections enabling the stein holdings to grow over time
the art historian and collector bernard berenson hosted gertrude and leo in his english country house in facilitating their introduction to paul c zanne and the dealer ambroise vollard
vollard was heavily involved in the c zanne art market and he was the first important contact in the paris art world for both leo and gertrude
the joint collection of gertrude and leo stein began in late when michael stein announced that their trust account had accumulated a balance of francs
they spent this at vollard s gallery buying gauguin s sunflowers and three tahitians c zanne s bathers and two renoirs
the art collection increased and the walls at rue de fleurus were rearranged continually to make way for new acquisitions
in the first half of the steins acquired c zanne s portrait of mme c zanne and delacroix s perseus and andromeda
shortly after the opening of the salon d automne of on october the steins acquired matisse s woman with a hat and picasso s young girl with a flower basket
in picasso completed portrait of gertrude stein which remained in her collection until her death
henry mcbride art critic for the new york sun did much for stein s reputation in the united states publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure
of the art collection at rue de fleurus mcbride commented i n proportion to its size and quality
it is just about the most potent of any that i have ever heard of in history mcbride also observed that gertrude collected geniuses rather than masterpieces
she recognized them a long way off
by early leo and gertrude stein s studio had many paintings by henri manguin pierre bonnard pablo picasso paul c zanne pierre auguste renoir honor daumier henri matisse and henri de toulouse lautrec
their collection was representative of two famous art exhibitions that took place during their residence together in paris and to which they contributed either by lending their art or by patronizing the featured artists
the steins elder brother michael and sister in law sarah sally acquired a large number of henri matisse paintings gertrude s friends from baltimore claribel and etta cone collected similarly eventually donating their art collection virtually intact to the baltimore museum of art
while numerous artists visited the stein salon many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at rue de fleurus
where renoir c zanne matisse and picasso s works dominated leo and gertrude s collection the collection of michael and sarah stein emphasized matisse
in april leo relocated to settignano italy near florence and the art collection was divided
the division of the steins art collection was described in a letter by leo
leo departed with sixteen renoirs and relinquishing the picassos and most of matisse to his sister took only a portrait sketch picasso had done of him
he remained dedicated to c zanne nonetheless leaving all the artist s works with his sister taking with him only a c zanne painting of apples
the split between brother and sister was acrimonious
stein did not see leo stein again until after world war i and then through only a brief greeting on the street in paris
after this accidental encounter they never saw or spoke to each other again
the steins holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons
after stein s and leo s households separated in she continued to collect examples of picasso s art which had turned to cubism a style leo did not appreciate
at her death gertrude s remaining collection emphasized the artwork of picasso and juan gris most of her other pictures having been sold
gertrude stein s personality has dominated the provenance of the stein art legacy
it was however her brother leo who was the astute art appraiser
alfred barr jr the founding director of new york s museum of modern art said that between the years of and leo was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of th century painting in the world after the artworks were divided between the two stein siblings it was gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the s
she concentrated on the work of juan gris andr masson and sir francis rose
in stein asserted painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art
in in a preface for the first exhibition of spanish painter francisco riba rovira who painted a portrait of her stein wrote i explained that for me all modern painting is based on what c zanne nearly made instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make
when he could not make a thing he hijacked it and left it
he insisted on showing his incapacity he spread his lack of success showing what he could not do became an obsession for him
people influenced by him were also obsessed with the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage
it was natural to do so even inevitable that soon became an art in peace and war and matisse concealed and insisted at the same time that c zanne could not realize and picasso concealed played and tormented all these things
the only one who wanted to insist on this problem was juan gris
he persisted by deepening the things which c zanne wanted to do but it was too hard a task for him it killed him
and now here we are i find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what c zanne could not do but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make to create the objects which have to exist for and in themselves and not in relation the gatherings in the stein home brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art
dedicated attendees included pablo picasso ernest hemingway f
scott fitzgerald sinclair lewis ezra pound gavin williamson thornton wilder sherwood anderson francis cyril rose bob brown ren crevel lisabeth de gramont francis picabia claribel cone mildred aldrich jane peterson carl van vechten and henri matisse
saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors
it was stein s partner alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance who met in a separate room
from alice entertained the wives new york times i am a person acted upon not a person who acts alice told one of gertrude s biographers when guests showed up alice was called upon to entertain their wives
the ladies were of course second class citizens
gertrude attributed the beginnings of the saturday evening salons to matisse as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of c zanne matisse brought people everybody brought somebody and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance and it was in this way that saturday evenings began
among picasso s acquaintances who frequented the saturday evenings were fernande olivier picasso s mistress georges braque artist andr derain artist max jacob poet guillaume apollinaire poet marie laurencin artist and apollinaire s mistress henri rousseau painter and joseph stella
hemingway frequented stein s salon but the two had an uneven relationship
they began as close friends with hemingway admiring stein as a mentor but they later grew apart especially after stein called hemingway yellow in the autobiography of alice b
toklas
upon the birth of his son hemingway asked stein to be the godmother of his child
while stein has been credited with inventing the term lost generation for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been world war i and its aftermath there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase two by hemingway and one by stein
during the summer of stein advised the young composer and writer paul bowles to go to tangier where she and alice had vacationed
stein s writing can be placed in three categories hermetic works best illustrated by the making of americans the hersland family popularized writing such as the autobiography of alice b
toklas and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years of which brewsie and willie is a good example
her works include novels plays stories libretti and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic playful repetitive and humorous style
typical quotes are rose is a rose is a rose is a rose out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question out of an eye comes research out of selection comes painful cattle about her childhood home in oakland there is no there there and the change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared
sugar is not a vegetable
these stream of consciousness experiments rhythmical essays or portraits were designed to evoke the excitingness of pure being and can be seen as literature s answer to visual art styles and forms such as cubism plasticity and collage
many of the experimental works such as tender buttons have since been interpreted by critics as a feminist reworking of patriarchal language
these works were well received by avant garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success
despite stein s work on automatic writing with william james she did not see her work as automatic but as an excess of consciousness
though stein collected cubist paintings especially those of picasso the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of c zanne
particularly he influenced her idea of equality distinguished from universality the whole field of the canvas is important
rather than a figure ground relationship stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other it is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints
stein explained t he important thing
is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality
her use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the bottom nature of her characters such as in the making of americans where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as as i was saying and there will be now a history of her stein used many anglo saxon words and avoided words with too much association
social judgment is absent in her writing so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing
anxiety fear and anger are also absent and her work is harmonic and integrative
stein predominantly used the present progressive tense creating a continuous presence in her work which grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles especially commonality and centeredness
grahn describes play as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience rather than the emotional manipulation that is a characteristic of linear writing stein uses play in addition stein s work is funny and multilayered allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements
lastly grahn argues that one must insterstand
engage with the work to mix with it in an active engagement rather than figuring it out figure it in in using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience she wrote the autobiography of alice b
toklas the book would become her first best seller
despite the title it was actually stein s autobiography
the style was quite similar to that of the alice b
toklas cookbook which was written by toklas
many critics speculated that toklas actually had written the autobiography of alice b
toklas despite toklas repeatedly denying authorship
several of stein s writings have been set to music by composers including virgil thomson s operas four saints in three acts and the mother of us all and james tenney s setting of rose is a rose is a rose is a rose as a canon dedicated to philip corner beginning with a on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words e g
a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
while living in paris stein began submitting her writing for publication
her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences
her first critically acclaimed publication was three lives
in mildred aldrich introduced stein to mabel dodge luhan and they began a short lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy mabel dodge promoted gertrude s legend in the united states
mabel was enthusiastic about stein s sprawling publication the makings of americans and at a time when stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers privately published copies of portrait of mabel dodge at villa curonia
dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the th regiment armory show in the first avant garde art exhibition in america
in addition she wrote the first critical analysis of stein s writing to appear in america in speculations or post impressionists in prose published in a special march publication of arts and decoration
foreshadowing stein s later critical reception dodge wrote in speculations
stein and carl van vechten the noted critic and photographer became acquainted in paris in
the two became lifelong friends devising pet names for each other van vechten was papa woojums and stein baby woojums
van vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of stein s literary work in the united states in effect becoming her american agent
in october stein arrived in america after a year absence
disembarking from the ocean liner in new york she encountered a throng of reporters
front page articles on stein appeared in almost every new york city newspaper
as she rode through manhattan to her hotel she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her us tour
an electric sign in times square announced to all that gertrude stein has arrived her six month tour of the country encompassed days of travel criss crossing states and visiting cities
stein prepared her lectures for each stop over in a formally structured way and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue
she spoke reading from notes and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation
stein s effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations
at the time some maintained that stein s audiences by and large did not understand her lectures some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in judging that stein suffered from a speech disorder palilalia which caused her to stutter over words and phrases
the predominant feeling however was that stein was a compelling presence a fascinating personality who could hold listeners with the musicality of her language
in washington d c
stein was invited to have tea with the president s wife eleanor roosevelt
in beverly hills california she visited actor and filmmaker charlie chaplin who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her
stein left america in may a newly minted american celebrity with a commitment from random house who had agreed to become the american publisher for all of her future works
the chicago daily tribune wrote after stein s return to paris no writer in years has been so widely discussed so much caricatured so passionately championed
stein completed q e d her first novel on october
one of the earliest coming out stories it is about a romantic affair involving stein and her friends mabel haynes grace lounsbury and mary bookstaver and occurred between and while she was studying at johns hopkins in baltimore
in stein began fernhurst a fictional account of a scandalous three person romantic affair involving a dean m
carey thomas a faculty member from bryn mawr college mary gwinn and a harvard graduate alfred hodder
mellow asserts that fernhurst is a decidedly minor and awkward piece of writing
it includes some commentary that gertrude mentioned in her autobiography when she discussed the fateful twenty ninth year during which
mellow observes that in year old gertrude had evidently determined that the small hard reality of her life would be writing
stein attributed the inception of three lives to the inspiration she received from a portrait c zanne had painted of his wife and which was in the stein collection
she credited this as a revelatory moment in the evolution of her writing style
stein described
she began three lives during the spring of and finished it the following year
gertrude stein stated the date for her writing of the making of americans was
her biographer has uncovered evidence that it actually began in and did not end until
stein compared her work to james joyce s ulysses and to marcel proust s in search of lost time
her critics were less enthusiastic about it
stein wrote the bulk of the novel between and and evidence from her manuscripts suggests three major periods of revision during that time
the manuscript remained mostly hidden from public view until when at the urging of ernest hemingway ford madox ford agreed to publish excerpts in the transatlantic review
in the paris based contact press published a limited run of the novel consisting of copies
a much abridged edition was published by harcourt brace in but the full version remained out of print until something else press republished it in
in a new definitive edition was published by dalkey archive press with a foreword by william gass
gertrude s matisse and picasso descriptive essays appeared in alfred stieglitz s august edition of camera work a special edition devoted to picasso and matisse and represented her first publication
of this publication gertrude said h e was the first one that ever printed anything that i had done
and you can imagine what that meant to me or to any one
stein s descriptive essays apparently began with her essay of alice b
toklas a little prose vignette a kind of happy inspiration that had detached itself from the torrential prose of the making of americans
stein s early efforts at word portraits are catalogued by mellow and under individual s names in kellner
matisse and picasso were subjects of early essays later collected and published in geography and plays and portraits and prayers
her subjects included several ultimately famous personages and her subjects provided a description of what she observed in her saturday salons at rue de fleurus ada alice b

tender buttons is the best known of stein s hermetic works
it is a small book separated into three sections food objects and rooms each containing prose under subtitles
its publication in caused a great dispute between mabel dodge luhan and stein because mabel had been working to have it published by another publisher
mabel wrote at length about what she viewed as the bad choice of publishing it with the press gertrude selected
evans wrote gertrude
stein ignored mabel s exhortations and published copies of the book in
an antiquarian copy was valued at over in
it is currently in print and was re released as tender buttons the corrected centennial edition by city lights publishers in march
in an interview with robert bartlett haas in a transatlantic interview stein insisted that this work was completely realistic in the tradition of gustave flaubert stating the following i used to take objects on a table like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the reference of objects remained central to her work although the representation of them had not
scholar marjorie perloff had said of stein that u nlike her contemporaries eliot pound moore she does not give us an image however fractured of a carafe on a table rather she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know
the publication of the autobiography of alice b
toklas lifted gertrude stein from literary obscurity to almost immediate celebrity in the united states
although popular with the american public stein received considerable backlash from individuals portrayed in her book
eugene jolas editor of the avant garde journal transition published a pamphlet titled testimony against gertrude stein in which artists such as henri matisse and georges braque expressed their objections to stein s portrayal of the parisian community of artists and intellectuals
braque in his response criticized she had entirely misunderstood cubism which she sees simply in terms of personalities
published posthumously by yale university press in with an introduction by thornton wilder four in america creates alternative biographies of ulysses s
grant as a religious leader wilbur wright as a painter george washington as a novelist and henry james as a military general
stein met her life partner alice b
toklas on september on toklas s first day in paris at sarah and michael stein s apartment
on meeting stein toklas wrote
soon thereafter stein introduced toklas to pablo picasso at his bateau lavoir studio where he was at work on les demoiselles d avignon
in they summered in fiesole italy toklas staying with harriet lane levy the companion of her trip from the united states and her housemate until alice moved in with stein and leo in
that summer stein stayed with michael and sarah stein their son allan and leo in a nearby villa
gertrude and alice s summer of is memorialized in images of the two of them in venice at the piazza in front of saint mark s
toklas arrived in with harriet levy with toklas maintaining living arrangements with levy until she moved to rue de fleurus in
in an essay written at the time stein humorously discussed the complex efforts involving much letter writing and victorian niceties to extricate levy from toklas s living arrangements
in harriet stein considers levy s nonexistent plans for the summer following her nonexistent plans for the winter
during the early summer of gertrude bought three paintings by juan gris roses glass and bottle and book and glasses
soon after she purchased them from daniel henry kahnweiler s gallery the great war began kahnweiler s stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to paris
gris who before the war had entered a binding contract with kahnweiler for his output was left without income
gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures
stein and toklas had plans to visit england to sign a contract for the publication of three lives to spend a few weeks there and then journey to spain
they left paris on july and returned on october
when britain declared war on germany stein and toklas were visiting alfred north whitehead in england
after a supposed three week trip to england that stretched to three months due to the war they returned to france where they spent the first winter of the war
with money acquired from the sale of stein s last matisse woman with a hat to her brother michael she and toklas vacationed in spain from may through the spring of
during their interlude in majorca spain gertrude continued her correspondence with mildred aldrich who kept her apprised of the war s progression and eventually inspired gertrude and alice to return to france to join the war effort
toklas and stein returned to paris in june and acquired a ford automobile with the help of associates in the united states gertrude learned to drive it with the help of her friend william edwards cook
gertrude and alice then volunteered to drive supplies to french hospitals in the ford they named auntie after gertrude s aunt pauline who always behaved admirably in emergencies and behaved fairly well most times if she was flattered
during the s stein and toklas became famous with the mass market publication of the autobiography of alice b
toklas
she and alice had an extended lecture tour in the united states during this decade
they also spent several summers in the town of bilignin in the ain district of eastern france situated in the picturesque region of the rh ne alpes
the two women doted on their beloved poodle named basket whose successor basket ii comforted alice in the years after gertrude s death
with the outbreak of world war ii stein and toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in bilignin ain in the rh ne alpes region
gertrude and alice who were both jewish escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to bernard fa who was a collaborator with the vichy regime and had connections to the gestapo or possibly because gertrude was an american and a famous author
gertrude s book wars i have seen written before the german surrender and before the liberation of german concentration camps likened the german army to keystone cops
when fa was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war gertrude and alice campaigned for his release
several years later toklas would contribute money to fa s escape from prison
after the war stein was visited by many young american soldiers
the august issue of life magazine featured a photo of stein and american soldiers posing in front of hitler s bunker in berchtesgaden
they are all giving the nazi salute and stein is wearing the traditional alpine cap accompanied by the text off we all went to see germany
in the s a cabinet in the yale university beinecke library which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years was opened and found to contain some love letters written by stein and toklas
they were made public for the first time revealing intimate details of their relationship
stein s endearment for toklas was baby precious in turn stein was for toklas mr
cuddle wuddle
stein is the author of one of the earliest coming out stories q e d published in as things as they are written in and suppressed by the author
the story written during travels after leaving college is based on a three person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at johns hopkins in baltimore
the affair was complicated as stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of romantic friendship as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it
stein maintained at the time that she detested passion in its many disguised forms
the relationships of stein s acquaintances mabel haynes and grace lounsbury ended as haynes started one with mary bookstaver also known as may bookstaver
stein became enamored of bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship
bookstaver haynes and lounsbury all later married men
stein began to accept and define her pseudo masculinity through the ideas of otto weininger s sex and character
weininger though jewish by birth considered jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity
as stein equated genius with masculinity her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question
more positive affirmations of stein s sexuality began with her relationship with alice b
toklas
ernest hemingway describes how alice was gertrude s wife in that stein rarely addressed his hemingway s wife and he treated alice the same leaving the two wives to chat
the more affirming essay miss furr and miss skeene is one of the first homosexual revelation stories to be published
the work like q e d is informed by stein s growing involvement with a homosexual community though it is based on lesbian partners maud hunt squire and ethel mars
the work contains the word gay over times perhaps the first published use of the word gay in reference to same sex relationships and those who have them
a similar essay of gay men begins more obviously with the line sometimes men are kissing but is less well known
in tender buttons stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with highly condensed layers of public and private meanings created by wordplay including puns on the words box cow and in titles such as tender buttons
along with stein s widely known rose is a rose is a rose is a rose quotation there is no there there is also one of her most famous
it appears in her work everybody s autobiography random house p
and is often applied to the city of her childhood oakland california
defenders and critics of oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in after coming to san francisco on a book tour
she took a ferry to oakland to visit the farm she grew up on and the house she lived in near what is now th avenue and e
th street in oakland
the house had been razed and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on washington street now th avenue
stein wrote
tommy orange s novel there there about native americans living in oakland takes its name from this quotation
according to janet malcolm s contested account in two lives gertrude and alice stein was a vocal critic of franklin d
roosevelt and the new deal
some stress stein s queer feminist pro immigration and democratic politics although her statements on immigration need to be seen in context of the time and world events
in a interview published in the new york times she stated that is the reason why i do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in america today
we need the stimulation of new blood
it is best to favor healthy competition
there is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance
but if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant
the french may not like the competition of foreigners but they let them in
they accept the challenge and derive the stimulus
i am surprised that there is not more discussion of immigration in the united states than there is
we have got rid of prohibition restrictions and it seems to me the next thing we should do is to relax the severity of immigration restrictions
she publicly endorsed general francisco franco during the spanish civil war and admired vichy leader marshal philippe p tain
some have argued for a more nuanced view of stein s collaborationist activity arguing that it was rooted in her wartime predicament and status as a jew in nazi occupied france
similarly stein commented in on benito mussolini adolf hitler franklin d
roosevelt joseph stalin and leon trotsky there is too much fathering going on just now and there is no doubt about it fathers are depressing
while identified with the modernist movements in art and literature stein s political affiliations were a mix of reactionary and progressive ideas
she was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics
to stein the industrial revolution had acted as a negative societal force disrupting stability degrading values and subsequently affecting cultural decline
stein idealized the th century as the golden age of civilization epitomized in america as the era of its founding fathers and what was in france the glory of its pre revolutionary ancien r gime
at the same time she was pro immigrant pro democratic and anti patriarchal
her last major work was the libretto of the feminist opera the mother of us all about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time brewsie and willie expressed strong support for american g i s
a compendium of source material confirms that stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful vichy government official bernard fa
stein had met fa in and he became her dearest friend during her life according to alice b
toklas
fa had been the primary translator of stein s work into french and subsequently masterminded her american book tour which gave stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir the autobiography of alice b
toklas
fa s influence was instrumental in avoiding nazi confiscation of stein s historically significant and monetarily valuable collection of artwork which throughout the war years was housed in stein s paris rue christine apartment under locked safeguard
in at fa s suggestion stein consented to translate into english some pages of speeches made by marshal philippe p tain
in her introduction stein crafts an analogy between george washington and p tain
she writes of the high esteem in which p tain is held by his countrymen france respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with hitler
conceived and targeted for an american readership stein s translations were ultimately never published in the united states
random house publisher bennett cerf had read the introduction stein had written for the translations and been horrified by what she had produced
although jewish stein collaborated with vichy france a regime that deported more than jews to nazi concentration camps of whom only percent survived the holocaust
in stein wrote that petain s policies were really wonderful so simple so natural so extraordinary
this was stein s contention in the year when the town of culoz where she and toklas resided saw the removal of its jewish children to auschwitz
it is difficult to say however how aware stein was of these events
as she wrote in wars i have seen however near a war is it is always not very near
even when it is here stein had stopped translating petain s speeches three years previously in
stein was able to condemn the japanese attack at pearl harbor while simultaneously maintaining the dissonant acceptance of hitler as conqueror of europe
journalist lanning warren interviewed stein in her paris apartment in a piece published in the new york times magazine on may
stein seemingly ironically proclaimed that hitler merited the nobel peace prize
the saxon element is always destined to be dominated
the germans have no gift at organizing
they can only obey
and obedience is not organization
organization comes from community of will as well as community of action
and in america our democracy has been based on community of will and effort
i say hitler ought to have the peace prize because he is removing all elements of contest and struggle from germany
by driving out the jews and the democratic left elements he is driving out everything that conduces to activity
that means peace given that after the war stein commented that the only way to ensure world peace was to teach the germans disobedience this stein interview has come to be interpreted as an ironic jest made by a practiced iconoclast hoping to gain attention and provoke controversy
in an effort to correct popular mainstream misrepresentations of stein s wartime activity a dossier of articles by critics and historians has been gathered for the online journal jacket
how much of stein s wartime activities were motivated by the real exigencies of self preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon
however her loyalty to p tain may have gone beyond expedience
she had been urged to leave france by american embassy officials friends and family when that possibility still existed but declined to do so
in an essay written for the atlantic monthly in november stein wrote about her decision not to leave france it would be awfully uncomfortable and i am fussy about my food stein continued to praise p tain after the war ended this at a time when p tain had been sentenced to death by a french court for treason
author djuna barnes provided a caustic assessment of stein s book wars i have seen
you do not feel that she stein is ever really worried about the sorrows of the people
her concerns at its highest pitch is a well fed apprehension others have argued that some of the accounts of stein s war time activities have amounted to a witch hunt
stein died on july at the age of after surgery for stomach cancer at the american hospital in neuilly sur seine near paris
she was interred in paris in p re lachaise cemetery
later alice b
toklas was buried alongside her
according to the famous version of her last moments before having been taken into surgery stein asked her partner toklas what is the answer after toklas replied to stein that there was no answer stein countered by sinking back into her bed murmuring then there is no question
her companion toklas however has given two other versions of the encounter neither of which agrees with the canonical version above
writing in the june edition of the new yorker janet malcolm describes
stein named writer and photographer carl van vechten as her literary executor and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death
sherwood anderson in his public introduction to stein s publication of geography and plays wrote
in a private letter to his brother karl anderson said as for stein i do not think her too important
i do think she had an important thing to do not for the public but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material
