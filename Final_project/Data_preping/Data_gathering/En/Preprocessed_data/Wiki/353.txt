phenol also called carbolic acid is an aromatic organic compound with the molecular formula c h oh
it is a white crystalline solid that is volatile
the molecule consists of a phenyl group c h bonded to a hydroxy group oh
mildly acidic it requires careful handling because it can cause chemical burns
phenol was first extracted from coal tar but today is produced on a large scale about billion kg year from petroleum derived feedstocks
it is an important industrial commodity as a precursor to many materials and useful compounds
it is primarily used to synthesize plastics and related materials
phenol and its chemical derivatives are essential for production of polycarbonates epoxies bakelite nylon detergents herbicides such as phenoxy herbicides and numerous pharmaceutical drugs
phenol is an organic compound appreciably soluble in water with about g dissolving in ml m
homogeneous mixtures of phenol and water at phenol to water mass ratios of and higher are possible
the sodium salt of phenol sodium phenoxide is far more water soluble
phenol is a weak acid
in aqueous solution in the ph range ca
it is in equilibrium with the phenolate anion c h o also called phenoxide
c h oh c h o hphenol is more acidic than aliphatic alcohols
the differing pka is attributed to resonance stabilization of the phenoxide anion
in this way the negative charge on oxygen is delocalized on to the ortho and para carbon atoms through the pi system
an alternative explanation involves the sigma framework postulating that the dominant effect is the induction from the more electronegative sp hybridised carbons the comparatively more powerful inductive withdrawal of electron density that is provided by the sp system compared to an sp system allows for great stabilization of the oxyanion
in support of the second explanation the pka of the enol of acetone in water is making it only slightly less acidic than phenol pka
thus the greater number of resonance structures available to phenoxide compared to acetone enolate seems to contribute very little to its stabilization
however the situation changes when solvation effects are excluded
a recent in silico comparison of the gas phase acidities of the vinylogues of phenol and cyclohexanol in conformations that allow for or exclude resonance stabilization leads to the inference that about of the increased acidity of phenol is attributable to inductive effects with resonance accounting for the remaining difference
in carbon tetrachloride and alkane solvents phenol hydrogen bonds with a wide range of lewis bases such as pyridine diethyl ether and diethyl sulfide
the enthalpies of adduct formation and the oh ir frequency shifts accompanying adduct formation have been studied
phenol is classified as a hard acid which is compatible with the c e ratio of the ecw model with ea and ca
the relative acceptor strength of phenol toward a series of bases versus other lewis acids can be illustrated by c b plots
the phenoxide anion is a strong nucleophile with a nucleophilicity comparable to the one of carbanions or tertiary amines
it can react at both its oxygen or carbon sites as an ambident nucleophile see hsab theory
generally oxygen attack of phenoxide anions is kinetically favored while carbon attack is thermodynamically preferred see thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control
mixed oxygen carbon attack and by this a loss of selectivity is usually observed if the reaction rate reaches diffusion control
phenol exhibits keto enol tautomerism with its unstable keto tautomer cyclohexadienone but only a tiny fraction of phenol exists as the keto form
the equilibrium constant for enolisation is approximately which means only one in every ten trillion molecules is in the keto form at any moment
the small amount of stabilisation gained by exchanging a c c bond for a c o bond is more than offset by the large destabilisation resulting from the loss of aromaticity
phenol therefore exists essentially entirely in the enol form
substituted cyclohexadienone can undergo a dienone phenol rearrangement in acid conditions and form stable disubstituted phenol
phenoxides are enolates stabilised by aromaticity
under normal circumstances phenoxide is more reactive at the oxygen position but the oxygen position is a hard nucleophile whereas the alpha carbon positions tend to be soft
phenol is highly reactive toward electrophilic aromatic substitution
the enhance nucleophilicity is attributed to donation pi electron density from o into the ring
many groups can be attached to the ring via halogenation acylation sulfonation and related processes
phenol s ring is so strongly activated that bromination and chlorination lead readily to polysubstitution
phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid at room temperature to give a mixture of nitrophenol and nitrophenol while with concentrated nitric acid additional nitro groups are introduced e g
to give trinitrophenol
aqueous solutions of phenol are weakly acidic and turn blue litmus slightly to red
phenol is neutralized by sodium hydroxide forming sodium phenate or phenolate but being weaker than carbonic acid it cannot be neutralized by sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate to liberate carbon dioxide

because of phenol s commercial importance many methods have been developed for its production but the cumene process is the dominant technology
accounting for of production is the cumene process also called hock process
it involves the partial oxidation of cumene isopropylbenzene via the hock rearrangement compared to most other processes the cumene process uses relatively mild conditions and relatively inexpensive raw materials
for the process to be economical both phenol and the acetone by product must be in demand
in worldwide demand for acetone was approximately million tonnes percent of which was satisfied with acetone produced by the cumene process
a route analogous to the cumene process begins with cyclohexylbenzene
it is oxidized to a hydroperoxide akin to the production of cumene hydroperoxide
via the hock rearrangement cyclohexylbenzene hydroperoxide cleaves to give phenol and cyclohexanone
cyclohexanone is an important precursor to some nylons
the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol is theoretically possible and of great interest but it has not been commercialized

phenol is a component in liquid liquid phenol chloroform extraction technique used in molecular biology for obtaining nucleic acids from tissues or cell culture samples
depending on the ph of the solution either dna or rna can be extracted
phenol is widely used as an antiseptic
its use was pioneered by joseph lister see history section
from the early s to the s it was used in the production of carbolic soap
concentrated phenol liquids are commonly used for permanent treatment of ingrown toe and finger nails a procedure known as a chemical matrixectomy
the procedure was first described by otto boll in
since that time it has become the chemical of choice for chemical matrixectomies performed by podiatrists
concentrated liquid phenol can be used topically as a local anesthetic for otology procedures such as myringotomy and tympanotomy tube placement as an alternative to general anesthesia or other local anesthetics
it also has hemostatic and antiseptic qualities that make it ideal for this use
phenol spray usually at phenol as an active ingredient is used medically to treat sore throat
it is the active ingredient in some oral analgesics such as chloraseptic spray tcp and carmex
phenol is so inexpensive that it attracts many small scale uses
it is a component of industrial paint strippers used in the aviation industry for the removal of epoxy polyurethane and other chemically resistant coatings
phenol derivatives have been used in the preparation of cosmetics including sunscreens hair colorings and skin lightening preparations
however due to safety concerns phenol is banned from use in cosmetic products in the european union and canada
phenol was discovered in by friedlieb ferdinand runge who extracted it in impure form from coal tar
runge called phenol karbols ure coal oil acid carbolic acid
coal tar remained the primary source until the development of the petrochemical industry

the antiseptic properties of phenol were used by sir joseph lister in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery
lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be thoroughly cleaned
he then covered the wounds with a piece of rag or lint covered in phenol or carbolic acid as he called it
the skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic germ free techniques in surgery
joseph lister was a student at university college london under robert liston later rising to the rank of surgeon at glasgow royal infirmary
lister experimented with cloths covered in carbolic acid after studying the works and experiments of his contemporary louis pasteur in sterilizing various biological media
lister was inspired to try to find a way to sterilize living wounds which could not be done with the heat required by pasteur s experiments
in examining pasteur s research lister began to piece together his theory that patients were being killed by germs
he theorized that if germs could be killed or prevented no infection would occur
lister reasoned that a chemical could be used to destroy the micro organisms that cause infection
meanwhile in carlisle england officials were experimenting with a sewage treatment using carbolic acid to reduce the smell of sewage cess pools
having heard of these developments and having himself previously experimented with other chemicals for antiseptic purposes without much success lister decided to try carbolic acid as a wound antiseptic
he had his first chance on august when he received a patient an eleven year old boy with a tibia bone fracture which pierced the skin of his lower leg
ordinarily amputation would be the only solution
however lister decided to try carbolic acid
after setting the bone and supporting the leg with splints lister soaked clean cotton towels in undiluted carbolic acid and applied them to the wound covered with a layer of tin foil leaving them for four days
when he checked the wound lister was pleasantly surprised to find no signs of infection just redness near the edges of the wound from mild burning by the carbolic acid
reapplying fresh bandages with diluted carbolic acid the boy was able to walk home after about six weeks of treatment
by march when the first results of lister s work were published in the lancet he had treated a total of eleven patients using his new antiseptic method
of those only one had died and that was through a complication that was nothing to do with lister s wound dressing technique
now for the first time patients with compound fractures were likely to leave the hospital with all their limbs intact
richard hollingham blood and guts a history of surgery p
before antiseptic operations were introduced at the hospital there were sixteen deaths in thirty five surgical cases
almost one in every two patients died
after antiseptic surgery was introduced in the summer of there were only six deaths in forty cases
the mortality rate had dropped from almost per cent to around per cent
it was a remarkable achievement

the toxic effect of phenol on the central nervous system discussed below causes sudden collapse and loss of consciousness in both humans and animals a state of cramping precedes these symptoms because of the motor activity controlled by the central nervous system
injections of phenol were used as a means of individual execution by nazi germany during the second world war
it was originally used by the nazis in as part of the aktion t euthanasia program
the germans learned that extermination of smaller groups was more economical by injection of each victim with phenol
phenol injections were given to thousands of people
maximilian kolbe was also killed with a phenol injection after surviving two weeks of dehydration and starvation in auschwitz when he volunteered to die in place of a stranger
approximately one gram is sufficient to cause death
phenol is a normal metabolic product excreted in quantities up to mg l in human urine

it is also one of the chemical compounds found in castoreum
this compound is ingested from the plants the beaver eats
phenol is a measurable component in the aroma and taste of the distinctive islay scotch whisky generally ppm but it can be over ppm in the malted barley used to produce whisky
this amount is different from and presumably higher than the amount in the distillate
cryptanaerobacter phenolicus is a bacterium species that produces benzoate from phenol via hydroxybenzoate
rhodococcus phenolicus is a bacterium species able to degrade phenol as sole carbon source
phenol and its vapors are corrosive to the eyes the skin and the respiratory tract
its corrosive effect on skin and mucous membranes is due to a protein degenerating effect
repeated or prolonged skin contact with phenol may cause dermatitis or even second and third degree burns
inhalation of phenol vapor may cause lung edema
the substance may cause harmful effects on the central nervous system and heart resulting in dysrhythmia seizures and coma
the kidneys may be affected as well
long term or repeated exposure of the substance may have harmful effects on the liver and kidneys
there is no evidence that phenol causes cancer in humans
besides its hydrophobic effects another mechanism for the toxicity of phenol may be the formation of phenoxyl radicals
since phenol is absorbed through the skin relatively quickly systemic poisoning can occur in addition to the local caustic burns
resorptive poisoning by a large quantity of phenol can occur even with only a small area of skin rapidly leading to paralysis of the central nervous system and a severe drop in body temperature
the ld for oral toxicity is less than mg kg for dogs rabbits or mice the minimum lethal human dose was cited as mg kg
the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr u s
department of health and human services states the fatal dose for ingestion of phenol is from to g
chemical burns from skin exposures can be decontaminated by washing with polyethylene glycol isopropyl alcohol or perhaps even copious amounts of water
removal of contaminated clothing is required as well as immediate hospital treatment for large splashes
this is particularly important if the phenol is mixed with chloroform a commonly used mixture in molecular biology for dna and rna purification
phenol is also a reproductive toxin causing increased risk of miscarriage and low birth weight indicating retarded development in utero
the word phenol is also used to refer to any compound that contains a six membered aromatic ring bonded directly to a hydroxyl group oh
thus phenols are a class of organic compounds of which the phenol discussed in this article is the simplest member
