amartya sen was born in a hindu baidya family in bengal british india
rabindranath tagore gave amartya sen his name bengali romanized morto lit immortal or heavenly
sen s family was from wari and manikganj dhaka both in present day bangladesh
his father ashutosh sen was professor of chemistry at dhaka university development commissioner in delhi and then chairman of the west bengal public service commission
he moved with his family to west bengal in
sen s mother amita sen was the daughter of kshiti mohan sen the eminent sanskritist and scholar of ancient and medieval india who was a close associate of rabindranath tagore
sen served as the second vice chancellor of visva bharati university from to
sen began his school education at st gregory s school in dhaka in
in the fall of sen was admitted to patha bhavana shantiniketan where he completed his school education
the school had many progressive features such as distaste for examinations or competitive testing
in addition the school stressed cultural diversity and embraced cultural influences from the rest of the world
in he went to presidency college calcutta where he earned a b a
in economics with first in the first class with a minor in mathematics as a graduating student of the university of calcutta
while at presidency sen was diagnosed with oral cancer and given a chance of living five years
with radiation treatment he survived and in he moved to trinity college cambridge where he earned a second b a
in economics in with a first class topping the list as well
at this time he was elected president of the cambridge majlis
while sen was officially a phd student at cambridge though he had finished his research in he was offered the position of first professor and first head of the economics department of the newly created jadavpur university in calcutta
he is still the youngest chairman to have headed the department of economics
he served in that position starting the new economics department from to
meanwhile sen was elected to a prize fellowship at trinity college which gave him four years of freedom to do anything he liked he made the radical decision to study philosophy
sen explained the broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines for example social choice theory makes intense use of mathematical logic and also draws on moral philosophy and so does the study of inequality and deprivation but also because i found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own his interest in philosophy however dates back to his college days at presidency where he read books on philosophy and debated philosophical themes
one of the books he was most interested in was kenneth arrow s social choice and individual values
in cambridge there were major debates between supporters of keynesian economics and the neo classical economists who were skeptical of keynes
because of a lack of enthusiasm for social choice theory in both trinity and cambridge sen chose a different subject for his phd thesis which was on the choice of techniques in
the work had been completed earlier except for advice from his adjunct supervisor in india professor a k
dasgupta given to sen while teaching and revising his work at jadavpur under the supervision of the brilliant but vigorously intolerant post keynesian joan robinson
quentin skinner notes that sen was a member of the secret society cambridge apostles during his time at cambridge
during amartya sen visited the massachusetts institute of technology on leave from trinity college
sen s work on choice of techniques complemented that of maurice dobb
in a developing country the dobb sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity due to technological change to raise the rate of accumulation
in other words workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive
sen s papers in the late s and early s helped develop the theory of social choice which first came to prominence in the work by the american economist kenneth arrow
arrow had most famously shown that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives options any ranked order voting system will in at least some situations inevitably conflict with what many assume to be basic democratic norms
sen s contribution to the literature was to show under what conditions arrow s impossibility theorem applied as well as to extend and enrich the theory of social choice informed by his interests in history of economic thought and philosophy
in sen published poverty and famines an essay on entitlement and deprivation a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food
sen also argued that the bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised food prices thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up
sen s interest in famine stemmed from personal experience
as a nine year old he witnessed the bengal famine of in which three million people died
this staggering loss of life was unnecessary sen later concluded
he presents data that there was an adequate food supply in bengal at the time but particular groups of people including rural landless labourers and urban service providers like barbers did not have the means to buy food as its price rose rapidly due to factors that include acquisitions by the military panic buying hoarding and price gouging all of them connected to the war in the region
in poverty and famines sen revealed that in many cases of famine food supplies were not significantly reduced
in bengal for example food production while down on the previous year was higher than in previous non famine years
sen points to a number of social and economic factors such as declining wages unemployment rising food prices and poor food distribution which led to starvation
his capabilities approach focuses on positive freedom a person s actual ability to be or do something rather than on negative freedom approaches which are common in economics and simply focuses on non interference
in the bengal famine rural laborers negative freedom to buy food was not affected
however they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything they did not have the functioning of nourishment nor the capability to escape morbidity
in addition to his important work on the causes of famines sen s work in the field of development economics has had considerable influence in the formulation of the human development report published by the united nations development programme
this annual publication that ranks countries on a variety of economic and social indicators owes much to the contributions by sen among other social choice theorists in the area of economic measurement of poverty and inequality
sen s revolutionary contribution to development economics and social indicators is the concept of capability developed in his article equality of what
he argues that governments should be measured against the concrete capabilities of their citizens
this is because top down development will always trump human rights as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt is a right something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away
for instance in the united states citizens have a right to vote
to sen this concept is fairly empty
in order for citizens to have a capacity to vote they first must have functionings
these functionings can range from the very broad such as the availability of education to the very specific such as transportation to the polls
only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice
it is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society
for an example of the capabilities approach in practice see martha nussbaum s women and human development
he wrote a controversial article in the new york review of books entitled more than million women are missing see missing women of asia analyzing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world particularly asia
other studies including one by emily oster had argued that this is an overestimation though oster has since then recanted her conclusions
in sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book development as freedom
sen argues that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy rather than simply focusing on metrics such as gdp or income per capita
sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the partition of india in
on one morning a muslim daily labourer named kader mia stumbled through the rear gate of sen s family home bleeding from a knife wound in his back
because of his extreme poverty he had come to sen s primarily hindu neighbourhood searching for work his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood
the price of kader mia s economic unfreedom was his death
kader mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it
this experience led sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age
in development as freedom sen outlines five specific types of freedoms political freedoms economic facilities social opportunities transparency guarantees and protective security
political freedoms refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinize the authorities
economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself
any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people
social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace allowing individuals to live better lives
transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction
protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery
before sen s work these had been viewed as only the ends of development luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income
however sen argues that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development
he elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well
in this regard he discusses the correlation between social opportunities of education and health and how both of these complement economic and political freedoms as a healthy and well educated person is better suited to make informed economic decisions and be involved in fruitful political demonstrations etc
a comparison is also drawn between china and india to illustrate this interdependence of freedoms
both countries were working towards developing their economies china since and india since
welfare economics seeks to evaluate economic policies in terms of their effects on the well being of the community
sen who devoted his career to such issues was called the conscience of his profession
his influential monograph collective choice and social welfare which addressed problems related to individual rights including formulation of the liberal paradox justice and equity majority rule and the availability of information about individual conditions inspired researchers to turn their attention to issues of basic welfare
sen devised methods of measuring poverty that yielded useful information for improving economic conditions for the poor
for instance his theoretical work on inequality provided an explanation for why there are fewer women than men in india and in china despite the fact that in the west and in poor but medically unbiased countries women have lower mortality rates at all ages live longer and make a slight majority of the population
sen claimed that this skewed ratio results from the better health treatment and childhood opportunities afforded boys in those countries as well as sex selective abortions
governments and international organisations handling food crises were influenced by sen s work
his views encouraged policy makers to pay attention not only to alleviating immediate suffering but also to finding ways to replace the lost income of the poor for example through public works and to maintain stable prices for food
a vigorous defender of political freedom sen believed that famines do not occur in functioning democracies because their leaders must be more responsive to the demands of the citizens
in order for economic growth to be achieved he argued social reforms such as improvements in education and public health must precede economic reform
in sen published a book called the idea of justice
based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory but also on his philosophical thoughts sen presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of john rawls or john harsanyi
in opposition to rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians immanuel kant jean jacques rousseau or david hume and inspired by the philosophical works of adam smith and mary wollstonecraft sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realisations oriented instead of being transcendental and institutional
however he still regards institutions and processes as being equally important
as an alternative to rawls s veil of ignorance sen chose the thought experiment of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice
he also stressed the importance of public discussion understanding democracy in the sense of john stuart mill and a focus on people s capabilities an approach that he had co developed including the notion of universal human rights in evaluating various states with regard to justice
sen began his career both as a teacher and a research scholar in the department of economics jadavpur university as a professor of economics in

in august during the clampdown and curfew in kashmir for more than two weeks after the indian revocation of jammu and kashmir s special status sen criticized the government and said as an indian i am not proud of the fact that india after having done so much to achieve a democratic norm in the world where india was the first non western country to go for democracy that we lose that reputation on the grounds of action that have been taken
he regarded the detention of kashmiri political leaders as a classical colonial excuse to prevent backlash against the indian government s decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve kashmiri people
sen spent much of his later life as a political writer and activist
he was outspoken about narendra modi s leadership in india
in an interview with the new york times he claimed that modi s fearmongering among the indian people was anti democratic
the big thing that we know from john stuart mill is that democracy is government by discussion and if you make discussion fearful you are not going to get a democracy no matter how you count the votes he disagreed with modi s ideology of hindu nationalism and advocated for a more integrated and diverse ideology that reflects the heterogeneity of india
