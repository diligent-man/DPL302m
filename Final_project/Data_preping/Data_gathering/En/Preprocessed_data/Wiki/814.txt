John Hogg was a British naturalist who wrote about amphibians birds plants reptiles and protists In he became a member of the Royal Society
John Hogg is credited with the creation of a fourth kingdom accompanying Carl Linnaeus's Lapides Plantae and Animalia to classify Life namely Protoctista
In the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus formalized living things into two supergroups in his monumental Systema Naturae All organisms were placed into the Kingdoms Plantae and Animalia Linnaeus added a third kingdom of the natural world in Lapides rocks These were deemed to be similar to plants in that they were neither living nor sentient ie not having senses They were further characterised as solid bodied
In Hogg created a fourth kingdom the Regnum Primigenum or Protoctista His rationale was simply that a kingdom of 'first beings' was necessary as these entities were believed to have existed prior to plants and animals
Hogg attempted to justify his arguments for a fourth kingdom with Spongilla a freshwater green sponge that was an animal known to exude oxygen in the light However the photosynthesis was later shown to be a result of symbiotic 'algae'
Such an attempt to apply non reductionist thought to classification systems during a period of biological debate made Hogg a protagonist within the field of nineteenth century biology along with Ernst Haeckel and Charles Darwin
