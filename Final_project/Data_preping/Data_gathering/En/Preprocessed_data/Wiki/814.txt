john hogg was a british naturalist who wrote about amphibians birds plants reptiles and protists
in he became a member of the royal society
john hogg is credited with the creation of a fourth kingdom accompanying carl linnaeus s lapides plantae and animalia to classify life namely protoctista
in the swedish botanist carl linnaeus formalized living things into two supergroups in his monumental systema naturae
all organisms were placed into the kingdoms plantae and animalia
linnaeus added a third kingdom of the natural world in lapides rocks
these were deemed to be similar to plants in that they were neither living nor sentient i e
not having senses
they were further characterised as solid bodied
in hogg created a fourth kingdom the regnum primigenum or protoctista
his rationale was simply that a kingdom of first beings was necessary as these entities were believed to have existed prior to plants and animals
hogg attempted to justify his arguments for a fourth kingdom with spongilla a freshwater green sponge that was an animal known to exude oxygen in the light
however the photosynthesis was later shown to be a result of symbiotic algae
such an attempt to apply non reductionist thought to classification systems during a period of biological debate made hogg a protagonist within the field of nineteenth century biology along with ernst haeckel and charles darwin
