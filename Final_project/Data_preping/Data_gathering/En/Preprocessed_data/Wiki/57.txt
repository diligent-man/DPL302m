english law also known as english and welsh law or english common law is the common law legal system of england and wales comprising mainly criminal law and civil law each branch having its own courts and procedures
although the common law has historically been the foundation and prime source of english law the most authoritative law is statutory legislation which comprises acts of parliament regulations and by laws
in the absence of any statutory law the common law with its principle of stare decisis forms the residual source of law based on judicial decisions custom and usage
common law is made by sitting judges who apply both statutory law and established principles which are derived from the reasoning from earlier decisions
equity is the other historic source of judge made law
common law can be amended or repealed by parliament
not being a civil law system it has no comprehensive codification
however most of its criminal law has been codified from its common law origins in the interests both of certainty and of ease of prosecution
for the time being murder remains a common law crime rather than a statutory offence
although scotland and northern ireland form part of the united kingdom and share westminster as a primary legislature they have separate legal systems outside english law
international treaties such as the european union s treaty of rome or the hague visby rules have effect in english law only when adopted and ratified by act of parliament
adopted treaties may be subsequently denounced by executive action unless the denouncement or withdraw would affect rights enacted by parliament
in this case executive action cannot be used owing to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty
this principle was established in the case of r miller v secretary of state for exiting the european union in
criminal law is the law of crime and punishment whereby the crown prosecutes the accused
civil law is concerned with tort contract families companies and so on
civil law courts operate to provide a party who has an enforceable claim with a remedy such as damages or a declaration
in this context civil law is the system of codified law that is prevalent in europe
civil law is founded on the ideas of roman law
by contrast english law is the archetypal common law jurisdiction built upon case law
in this context common law means the judge made law of the king s bench whereas equity is the judge made law of the now defunct court of chancery
equity is concerned mainly with trusts and equitable remedies
equity generally operates in accordance with the principles known as the maxims of equity
the reforming judicature acts of the s amalgamated the courts into one supreme court of judicature which was directed to administer both law and equity
the neo gothic royal courts of justice in the strand london were built shortly afterward to celebrate these reforms
public law is the law governing relationships between individuals and the state
private law encompasses relationships between private individuals and other private entities but may also cover private relationships between the government and private entities
a remedy is the means given by law for the recovery of a right or of compensation for its infringement
most remedies are available only from the court but some are self help remedies for instance a party who lawfully wishes to cancel a contract may do so without leave and a person may take his own steps to abate a private nuisance
formerly most civil actions claiming damages in the high court were commenced by obtaining a writ issued in the queen s name
after writs have merely required the parties to appear and writs are no longer issued in the name of the crown
now after the woolf reforms of almost all civil actions other than those connected with insolvency are commenced by the completion of a claim form as opposed to a writ originating application or a summons
in england there is a hierarchy of sources as follows
legislation primary and secondary
the case law rules of common law and equity derived from precedent decisions
parliamentary conventions
general customs
books of authoritythe rule of european union law in england previously of prime importance has been ended as a result of brexit
primary legislation in the uk may take the following forms
acts of parliament
acts of the scottish parliament
acts of the senedd or previously acts of the national assembly for wales and measures of the national assembly for wales
statutory rules of the northern ireland assemblyorders in council are a sui generis category of legislation
secondary or delegated legislation in england includes
statutory instruments and ministerial orders
by laws of metropolitan boroughs county councils and town councilsstatutes are cited in this fashion short title year e g

this became the usual way to refer to acts from onwards previously acts were cited by their long title with the regnal year of the parliamentary session when they received royal assent and the chapter number
for example the pleading in english act which required pleadings to be in english and not law french was referred to as edw

common law is a term with historical origins in the legal system of england
it denotes in the first place the judge made law that developed from the early middle ages as described in a work published at the end of the th century the history of english law before the time of edward i in which pollock and maitland expanded the work of coke th century and blackstone th century
specifically the law developed in england s court of common pleas and other common law courts which became also the law of the colonies settled initially under the crown of england or later of the united kingdom in north america and elsewhere and this law as further developed after those courts in england were reorganised by the supreme court of judicature acts passed in the s and developed independently in the legal systems of the united states and other jurisdictions after their independence from the united kingdom before and after the s
the term is used in the second place to denote the law developed by those courts in the same periods pre colonial colonial and post colonial as distinct from within the jurisdiction or former jurisdiction of other courts in england the court of chancery the ecclesiastical courts and the admiralty court
in the oxford english dictionary common law is described as the unwritten law of england administered by the king s courts which purports to be derived from ancient usage and is embodied in the older commentaries and the reports of abridged cases as opposed in that sense to statute law and as distinguished from the equity administered by the chancery and similar courts and from other systems such as ecclesiastical law and admiralty law
for usage in the united states the description is the body of legal doctrine which is the foundation of the law administered in all states settled from england and those formed by later settlement or division from them
professor john makdisi s article the islamic origins of the common law in the north carolina law review theorized that english common law was influenced by medieval islamic law
makdisi drew comparisons between the royal english contract protected by the action of debt and the islamic aqd the english assize of novel disseisin a petty assize adopted in the at the assizes of clarendon and the islamic istihqaq and the english jury and the islamic lafif in the classical maliki school of islamic jurisprudence and argued that these institutions were transmitted to england by the normans through the close connection between the norman kingdoms of roger ii in sicily ruling over a conquered islamic administration and henry ii in england makdisi also argued that the law schools known as inns of court in england which he asserts are parallel to madrasahs may have also originated from islamic law
he states that the methodology of legal precedent and reasoning by analogy qiyas are also similar in both the islamic and common law systems
other legal scholars such as monica gaudiosi gamal moursi badr and a
hudson have argued that the english trust and agency institutions which were introduced by crusaders may have been adapted from the islamic waqf and hawala institutions they came across in the middle east
paul brand also notes parallels between the waqf and the trusts used to establish merton college by walter de merton who had connections with the knights templar
in the concept of time immemorial often applied in common law was defined as being any time before july i e
before richard i s accession to the english throne
since english law has been a common law not a civil law system in other words no comprehensive codification of the law has taken place and judicial precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive
this may be a legacy of the norman conquest of england when a number of legal concepts and institutions from norman law were introduced to england
in the early centuries of english common law the justices and judges were responsible for adapting the system of writs to meet everyday needs applying a mixture of precedent and common sense to build up a body of internally consistent law
an example is the law merchant derived from the pie powder courts named from a corruption of the french pieds poudr s dusty feet implying ad hoc marketplace courts
following montesquieu s theory of the separation of powers only parliament has the power to legislate but if a statute is ambiguous then the courts have exclusive power to decide its true meaning using the principles of statutory interpretation
since the courts have no authority to legislate the legal fiction is that they declare rather than create the common law
the house of lords took this declaratory power a stage further in dpp v shaw where in creating the new crime of conspiracy to corrupt public morals viscount simonds claimed the court had a residual power to protect the moral welfare of the state
as parliament became ever more established and influential parliamentary legislation gradually overtook judicial law making such that today s judges are able to innovate only in certain very narrowly defined areas
england exported its common law and statute law to most parts of the british empire and many aspects of that system have survived after independence from british rule and the influences are often reciprocal
english law prior to the american revolutionary wars american war of independence is still an influence on united states law and provides the basis for many american legal traditions and principles
after independence english common law still exerted influence over american common law for example byrne v boadle which first applied the res ipsa loquitur doctrine
jurisdictions that have kept to the common law may incorporate modern legal developments from england and english decisions are usually persuasive in such jurisdictions
in the united states each state has its own supreme court with final appellate jurisdiction resulting in the development of state common law
the us supreme court has the final say over federal matters
by contrast in australia one national common law exists
after britain s colonial period jurisdictions that had inherited and adopted england s common law developed their courts of final appeal in differing ways jurisdictions still under the british crown are subject to the judicial committee of the privy council in london
for a long period the british dominions used london s privy council as their final appeal court although one by one they eventually established their local supreme court
new zealand was the last dominion to abandon the privy council setting up its own supreme court in
even after independence many former british colonies in the commonwealth continued to use the privy council as it offered a readily available high grade service
in particular several caribbean island nations found the privy council advantageous
britain is a dualist in its relationship with international law so international treaties must be formally ratified by parliament and incorporated into statute before such supranational laws become binding in the uk
britain has long been a major trading nation exerting a strong influence on the law of shipping and maritime trade
the english law of salvage collisions ship arrest and carriage of goods by sea are subject to international conventions which britain played a leading role in drafting
many of these conventions incorporate principles derived from english common law and documentary procedures
the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland comprises three legal jurisdictions england and wales scotland and northern ireland
although scotland and northern ireland form part of the united kingdom and share the parliament at westminster as the primary legislature they have separate legal systems
scotland became part of the uk over years ago but scots law has remained remarkably distinct from english law
the uk s highest civil appeal court is the supreme court of the united kingdom whose decisions and those of its predecessor the house of lords unless obviously limited to a principle of distinct english and welsh scottish or northern irish law are binding on all three uk jurisdictions as in donoghue v stevenson a scots case that forms the basis of the uk s law of negligence
unlike scotland and northern ireland wales is not a separate jurisdiction within the united kingdom
the customary laws of wales within the kingdom of england were abolished by king henry viii s laws in wales acts which brought wales into legal conformity with england
while wales now has a devolved parliament the senedd any legislation it passes must adhere to circumscribed subjects under the government of wales act to other legislation of the british parliament or to any order in council given under the authority of the act
any reference to england in legislation between and is deemed to include wales
as to later legislation any application to wales must be expressed under the welsh language act and the jurisdiction is since correctly and widely referred to as england and wales
devolution has granted some political autonomy to wales via the national assembly for wales which gained its power to pass primary legislation until the government of wales act in force since the welsh general election
the legal system administered through civil and criminal courts is unified throughout england and wales
this is different from northern ireland for example which did not cease to be a distinct jurisdiction when its legislature was suspended see northern ireland temporary provisions act
a major difference is use of the welsh language as laws concerning it apply in wales and not in the rest of the united kingdom
the welsh language act is an act of the parliament of the united kingdom which put the welsh language on an equal footing with the english language in wales with regard to the public sector
welsh may also be spoken in welsh courts
