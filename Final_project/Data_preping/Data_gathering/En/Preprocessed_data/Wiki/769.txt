franti ek ern uncredited karel zeman a czech film director and animator was deeply influenced by the novels of jules verne making four feature films between and and drawing extensively on verne s voyages extraordinaires series
the first of these journey to the beginning of time was inspired by journey to the center of the earth and featured a scene in which its heroes directly acknowledged their fondness for reading verne
the second of zeman s verne based films was vyn lez zk zy the later ones were the stolen airship based on two years vacation and on the comet based on hector servadac
the main literary source material for vyn lez zk zy was verne s novel facing the flag
however rather than a straightforward literal adaptation of the novel zeman conceived the film as if the story were being retold by one of its characters the young engineer simon hart
moreover since facing the flag included many memorable vernian motifs including submarines volcanoes mysterious figures in possession of powerful technologies and other ideas zeman also opted to include themes and elements from other verne novels
for example the undersea sequences include references to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and the aircraft albatross from robur the conqueror
another verne novel the mysterious island may also have supplied some details
the film also pays tribute to the style of the pioneering early filmmaker georges m li s
zeman likely saw m li s s work at the czech national film archive in prague where hand colored prints were available of the impossible voyage the witch and the diabolic tenant
zeman freely used details from m li s s style as inspiration for example vyn lez zk zy s piston powered steam engine and submarine are creatively adapted variants of those in the impossible voyage
other possible cinematic sources include fritz lang s film metropolis sergei eisenstein s film battleship potemkin and possibly even stuart paton s version of leagues under the sea
the film has long been noted for its unique visual style which faithfully recreates that of the victorian line engravings by douard riou l on benett and others featured in the original editions of verne s novels
according to karel zeman s daughter ludmila zeman as a child i remember i had all the books with those beautiful engravings
i really can t visualize the story any other way
and my father felt because he adored verne it can only be a good re telling to use the same techniques
karel zeman in explaining his process elaborated on the same point
much of this impression was created in camera thanks to the film s production design
zeman s crew made and used hard rubber paint rollers to add engraving like hatching to scenery and costumes
in a review of the film pauline kael noted that there are more stripes more patterns on the clothing the decor and on the image itself than a sane person can easily imagine to complete the effect zeman and his crew composited the film with various forms of animation including traditional cut out and stop motion along with miniature effects and matte paintings all designed to keep the engraving style seamlessly consistent
even stock footage clips of birds sea waves and other details were adapted for the effect by printing the film with lined filters and matted in sky backgrounds
to match the visuals zeman directed his actors to move in a decorously stylized fashion commenting my heroes were not allowed even to sneeze or scratch their heads they had to adapt themselves completely to their unreal surroundings
the film s score was written by zden k li ka a highly regarded film composer known for his skill with musical characterizations and humor as well as for his innovative use of electronic music techniques
in the mid th century he was the foremost czech composer of fantasy film scores
the score is written in an old fashioned style complementing the quaintness of the visuals and often redolent of the film s imaginary machinery
liska would suggest editing cuts to the director to speed up the rhythm of the film and to make his music flow more smoothly with what is on screen
the main theme reminiscent of a music box is scored for harpsichord accompanied by a chamber ensemble of string instruments and woodwinds
the love theme apparently based on the song tit willow from the gilbert and sullivan comic opera the mikado is likewise played by woodwinds and a muted harpsichord
li ka s score also includes various shorter cues such as a short pathos filled theme for the sinking of the ship amelie keyboard strikes matching the attacks on the giant octopus and a serene finale for string orchestra
the film s score remains one of li ka s most notable works
vyn lez zk zy treats the scientific themes of jules verne s novels with gently satiric affection implicitly praising verne s style while deliberately pointing up the quaintness of the science involved
in an interview ludmila zeman summed up the film s themes saying that verne always warned that even if the future is technologically perfect with all these mod cons it needs love it needs poetry it needs magic
he believed only these can make people feel happy and loved

following the american release the film won several additional high profile admirers
the new york times critic howard thompson found it fresh funny and highly imaginative with a marvelous eyeful of trick effects
pauline kael was similarly glowing calling the film a wonderful giddy science fantasy and adding that zeman sustains the victorian tone with its delight in the magic of science that makes verne seem so playfully archaic
charles stinson of the los angeles times began his highly positive film review by saying the fabulous world of jules verne is precisely that
for once the title writers and the press agents have been found failing to exaggerate
they d better watch it
thanks to the american release the film was nominated for science fiction s hugo award for best dramatic presentation
the film however was not a box office success in america where the well established hollywood science fiction film tradition had led audiences to expect heightened realism rather than zeman s deliberately stylized visuals
bill warren in his encyclopedia of s science fiction films keep watching the skies wrote that vyn lez zk zy was the best film covered in this book as well as the best movie ever adapted from a work by verne

caligari as one of the great visual and stylistic triumphs of the cinematic medium and that zeman s process really does need to be seen to be believed

could it be that old special effects dependent upon camera tricks and theatrical invention stir something sympathetic in us that glossy pixels do not inviting us not just to dream along with the fantasy but also the painstaking creation thereof
