in the religion of ancient rome a haruspex plural haruspices also called aruspex was a person trained to practise a form of divination called haruspicy haruspicina the inspection of the entrails exta hence also extispicy extispicium of sacrificed animals especially the livers of sacrificed sheep and poultry
the reading of omens specifically from the liver is also known by the greek term hepatoscopy also hepatomancy
the roman concept is directly derived from etruscan religion as one of the three branches of the disciplina etrusca
such methods continued to be used well into the middle ages especially among christian apostates and pagans
the latin terms haruspex and haruspicina are from an archaic word haru entrails intestines cognate with hernia protruding viscera and hira empty gut pie er and from the root spec to watch observe
the greek h patosk pia is from h par liver and skop to examine
the babylonians were famous for hepatoscopy
this practice is mentioned in the book of ezekiel
one babylonian clay model of a sheep s liver dated between and bc is conserved in the british museum
the assyro babylonian tradition was also adopted in hittite religion
at least thirty six liver models have been excavated at hattusa
of these the majority are inscribed in akkadian but a few examples also have inscriptions in the native hittite language indicating the adoption of haruspicy as part of the native vernacular cult
roman haruspicy was a form of communication with the gods
rather than strictly predicting future events this form of roman divination allowed humans to discern the attitudes of the gods and react in a way that would maintain harmony between the human and divine worlds pax deorum
before taking important actions especially in battle romans conducted animal sacrifices to discover the will of the gods according to the information gathered through reading the animals entrails
the entrails most importantly the liver but also the lungs and heart contained a large number of signs that indicated the gods approval or disapproval
these signs could be interpreted according to the appearance of the organs for example if the liver was smooth shiny and full or rough and shrunken
the etruscans looked for the caput iocineris or head of the liver
it was considered a bad omen if this part was missing from the animal s liver
the haruspex would then study the flat visceral side of the liver after examining the caput iocineris
haruspicy in ancient italy originated with the etruscans
textual evidence for etruscan divination comes from an etruscan inscription the priest laris pulenas bce epitaph mentions a book he wrote on haruspicy
a collection of sacred texts called the etrusca disciplina written in etruscan were essentially guides on different forms of divination including haruspicy and augury
in addition a number of archeological artifacts depict etruscan haruspicy
these include a bronze mirror with an image of a haruspex dressed in etruscan priest s clothing holding a liver while a crowd gathers near him
another significant artifact relating to haruspicy in ancient italy is the piacenza liver
this bronze model of a sheep s liver was found by chance by a farmer in
names of gods are etched into the surface and organized into different sections
artifacts depicting haruspicy exist from the ancient roman world as well such as stone relief carvings located in trajan s forum
