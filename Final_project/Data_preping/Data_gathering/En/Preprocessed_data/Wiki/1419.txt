In the United States military stop-loss is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service ETS date and up to their contractually agreed end of active obligated service EAOS
It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station PCS move for a member still in military service
Stop-loss was used immediately before and during the Persian Gulf War
Since then it has been used during deployments to Somalia Haiti Bosnia Kosovo and after the September attacks and the subsequent War on Terror
The policy has been legally challenged several times
However federal courts have consistently found that military service members contractually agree that their term of service may be involuntarily extended until the end of their obligated service
Stop-loss was created by the United States Congress after the Vietnam War
Its use is founded on Title United States Code Section a which states in part
the President may suspend any provision of law relating to promotion retirement or separation applicable to any member of the armed forces who the President determines is essential to the national security of the United States and Paragraph c of DD Form The Armed Forces Enlistment Contract which states In the event of war my enlistment in the Armed Forces continues until six months after the war ends unless the enlistment is ended sooner by the President of the United States
During enlistment in any branch of the US
Armed Forces all service members are required to sign an initial contract with an eight-year service obligation
The enlistment contract for a person going on active duty generally stipulates an initial period of active duty from two to six years followed by service in a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States for the remainder of the eight-year obligation
Service members whose ETS retirement or end of service obligation date falls during a deployment may be involuntarily extended until the end of their unit's deployment
The controversy regarding stop-loss focuses mainly on the aspect involving involuntary extension of a service member's initial active duty service obligation
For service members opposed to involuntary extension it represents implementation of a desultory clause in their contract which alters their expectation of an end of term of service date
It also exposes them to the risk of an additional or prolonged combat deployment
For opponents involuntary extension is contrary to the notion of voluntary service and undermines popular support for the conflict

But in at the commencement of Operation Desert Storm President George HW
Bush issued Executive Order declaring a national emergency and Executive Order which delegated to the Secretary of Defense who could redelegate further the President's authority under USC
§ c authorizing the President to suspend any provision of law relating to military retirement or separation of anyone determined to be essential
It was pursuant to this provision and executive order that Craig was after some confusion ordered to Saudi Arabia
He filed a petition for habeas corpus based on App
§ c which forbids involuntary extensions of enlistments unless Congress not merely the President declares war or a national emergency
The Court noted that Craig was relying on App
§ c while the government was relying on USC
§ c the two provisions apparently in conflict
The Court sided with the government primarily on the ground that USC
c was enacted more recently than App
§c based on the presumptions that Congress was aware of the earlier law when it enacted the later law and that the later law effectively amended or repealed the earlier law notwithstanding the sections were in different locations in the codification
Further the Court was reluctant when the provisions were in evident conflict to impair the President's ability to respond to a matter of national security
