an honorary degree is an academic degree for which a university or other degree awarding institution has waived all of the usual requirements
it is also known by the latin phrases honoris causa for the sake of the honour or ad honorem to the honour
the degree is typically a doctorate or less commonly a master s degree and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution or no previous postsecondary education
an example of identifying a recipient of this award is as follows doctorate in business administration hon causa
the degree is often conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished visitor s contributions to a specific field or to society in general
it is sometimes recommended that such degrees be listed in one s curriculum vitae cv as an award and not in the education section
with regard to the use of this honorific the policies of institutions of higher education generally ask that recipients refrain from adopting the misleading title and that a recipient of an honorary doctorate should restrict the use of the title dr before their name to any engagement with the institution of higher education in question and not within the broader community
theodore hesburgh held the record for most honorary degrees having been awarded during his lifetime
the practice dates back to the middle ages when for various reasons a university might be persuaded or otherwise see fit to grant exemption from some or all of the usual statutory requirements for the award of a degree
the earliest honorary degree on record was awarded to lionel woodville in the late s by the university of oxford
he later became bishop of salisbury
in the late th century the granting of honorary degrees became quite common especially on the occasion of royal visits to oxford or cambridge
on the visit of james i to oxford in for example forty three members of his retinue fifteen of whom were earls or barons received the degree of master of arts and the register of convocation explicitly states that these were full degrees carrying the usual privileges such as voting rights in convocation and congregation
there were also some special cases for example the critic john ruskin suffered some kind of physical or mental breakdown in and dropped out of the university of oxford
he returned to oxford in and sat a single exam and was awarded an honorary fourth class degree
honorary degrees are usually awarded at regular graduation ceremonies at which the recipients are often invited to make a speech of acceptance before the assembled faculty and graduates an event which often forms the highlight of the ceremony
generally universities nominate several persons each year for honorary degrees these nominations usually go through several committees before receiving approval
nominees are generally not told until a formal approval and invitation are made often it is perceived that the system is shrouded in secrecy and occasionally seen as political and controversial
the term honorary degree is a slight misnomer honoris causa degrees are not considered of the same standing as substantive degrees earned by the standard academic processes of courses and original research except perhaps where the recipient has demonstrated an appropriate level of academic scholarship that would ordinarily qualify him or her for the award of a substantive degree
recipients of honorary degrees typically wear the same academic dress as recipients of substantive degrees although there are a few exceptions honorary graduates at the university of cambridge wear the appropriate full dress gown but not the hood and those at the university of st andrews wear a black cassock instead of the usual full dress gown
an ad eundem or jure officii degree is sometimes considered honorary although these are only conferred on an individual who has already achieved a comparable qualification at another university or attained an office requiring the appropriate level of scholarship
under certain circumstances a degree may be conferred on an individual for both the nature of the office they hold and the completion of a dissertation
the dissertation et jure dignitatis is considered to be a full academic degree
see below
although higher doctorates such as doctor of science doctor of letters etc
are often awarded honoris causa in many countries notably england and scotland ireland australia and new zealand it is formally possible to earn such a degree as a substantive one
this typically involves the submission of a portfolio of peer refereed research usually undertaken over a number of years which has made a substantial contribution to the academic field in question
the university will appoint a panel of examiners who will consider the case and prepare a report recommending whether or not the degree be awarded
usually the applicant must have some strong formal connection with the university in question for example full time academic staff or graduates of several years standing
some universities seeking to differentiate between substantive and honorary doctorates have a degree often duniv or doctor of the university which is used for these purposes with the other higher doctorates reserved for formally examined academic scholarship
the archbishop of canterbury has the authority to award degrees
these lambeth degrees are sometimes erroneously thought to be honorary however the archbishops have for many centuries had the legal authority originally as the representatives of the pope later confirmed by a act of henry viii to award degrees and regularly do so to people who have either passed an examination or are deemed to have satisfied the appropriate requirements
between the two extremes of honoring celebrities and formally assessing a portfolio of research some universities use honorary degrees to recognize achievements of intellectual rigor

some learned societies award honorary fellowships in the same way as honorary degrees are awarded by universities for similar reasons
a typical example of university regulations is honorary graduates may use the approved post nominal letters
it is not customary however for recipients of an honorary doctorate to adopt the prefix dr in some universities it is however a matter of personal preference for an honorary doctor to use the formal title of doctor regardless of the background circumstances for the award
written communications where an honorary doctorate has been awarded may include the letters h c after the award to indicate that status
the recipient of an honorary degree may add the degree title postnominally but it should always be made clear that the degree is honorary by adding honorary or honoris causa or h c in parentheses after the degree title
in some countries a person who holds an honorary doctorate may use the title doctor prenominally abbreviated dr h c or dr h c
sometimes they use hon before the degree letters for example hon dmus
in recent years some universities have adopted entirely separate postnominal titles for honorary degrees
this is in part due to the confusion that honorary degrees have caused
for example an honorary doctorate from the auckland university of technology takes the special title hond since it is now common in certain countries to use certain degrees such as lld or hond as purely honorary
some universities including the open university grant doctor of the university duniv degrees to selected nominees while awarding phd or edd degrees to those who have fulfilled the academic requirements

some universities and colleges have the custom of awarding a master s degree to every scholar appointed as a full professor who had never earned a degree there

schools such as brown university the university of pennsylvania and harvard university also award tenured faculty who do not have a degree from their respective schools the am ad eundem
these ad eundem or jure officii degrees are earned degrees not honorary because they recognize formal learning
similarly a jure dignitatis degree is awarded to someone who has demonstrated eminence and scholarship by being appointed to a particular office
thus for example a dd doctor of divinity might be conferred upon a bishop on the occasion of his consecration or a judge created lld legum doctor or dcl doctor of civil law upon his or her appointment to the judicial bench
these also are properly considered substantive rather than honorary degrees
