we knew we wanted to stay in video games so starting a company seemed like a good idea he spent years at interplay and i was there for
when we were first out there trying to figure out what to do next we kinda felt like we were in exile and we made fake cards with a fake company name just to have a card to go to e with
and before we ever thought of the name inxile brian put as his job description on the cards leader in exile people got such a kick out of that card we kept saying in exile in exile in exile so much that we just thought why not make up a new word and so we did

in november microsoft studios announced they were in the final stages of acquiring inxile as well as obsidian entertainment another studio known for its role playing games
according to fargo they were approached in april by noah musler one of microsoft s business development executives that had former ties to the studio who suggested the possibility of acquisition
fargo believed the acquisition was beneficial for the studio as at the time they were in the uncanny valley between more independent game development and high budget aaa games where there was a significant difference in expectations on quality and pricing of the game
microsoft s support would help them make games that are closer to aaa games and better compete in the current state of the industry
