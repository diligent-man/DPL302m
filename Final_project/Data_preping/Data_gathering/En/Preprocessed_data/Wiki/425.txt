In an interview with Joystiq inXile's President Matthew Findley shared some of the company's history I worked with Brian Fargo at Interplay for a number of years and we both left Interplay at the same time We knew we wanted to stay in video games so starting a company seemed like a good idea he spent years at Interplay and I was there for When we were first out there trying to figure out what to do next we kinda felt like we were in exile and we made fake cards with a fake company name just to have a card to go to E with And before we ever thought of the name inXile Brian put as his job description on the cards Leader in exile People got such a kick out of that card we kept saying in exile in exile in exile so much that we just thought Why not make up a new word And so we did
