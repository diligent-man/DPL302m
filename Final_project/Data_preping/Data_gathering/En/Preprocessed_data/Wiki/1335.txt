the greco turkish war of was fought between greece and the turkish national movement during the partitioning of the ottoman empire in the aftermath of world war i between may and october
the greek campaign was launched primarily because the western allies particularly british prime minister david lloyd george had promised greece territorial gains at the expense of the ottoman empire recently defeated in world war i
greek claims stemmed from the fact that anatolia had been part of ancient greece and the byzantine empire before the ottomans conquered the area in the th th centuries
the armed conflict started when the greek forces landed in smyrna now i zmir on may
they advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of anatolia including the cities of manisa bal kesir ayd n k tahya bursa and eski ehir
their advance was checked by turkish forces at the battle of sakarya in
the greek front collapsed with the turkish counter attack in august and the war effectively ended with the recapture of smyrna by turkish forces and the great fire of smyrna
as a result the greek government accepted the demands of the turkish national movement and returned to its pre war borders thus leaving east thrace and western anatolia to turkey
the allies abandoned the treaty of s vres to negotiate a new treaty at lausanne with the turkish national movement
the treaty of lausanne recognized the independence of the republic of turkey and its sovereignty over anatolia istanbul and eastern thrace
the greek and turkish governments agreed to engage in a population exchange
the geopolitical context of this conflict is linked to the partitioning of the ottoman empire which was a direct consequence of world war i and involvement of the ottomans in the middle eastern theatre
the greeks received an order to land in smyrna by the triple entente as part of the partition
during this war the ottoman government collapsed completely and the ottoman empire was divided amongst the victorious entente powers with the signing of the treaty of s vres on august
there were a number of secret agreements regarding the partitioning of the ottoman empire at the end of world war i
the triple entente had made contradictory promises about post war arrangements concerning greek hopes in asia minor
the western allies particularly british prime minister david lloyd george had promised greece territorial gains at the expense of the ottoman empire if greece entered the war on the allied side
these included eastern thrace the islands of imbros i mroz since july g k eada and tenedos bozcaada and parts of western anatolia around the city of smyrna which contained sizable ethnic greek populations
the italian and anglo french repudiation of the agreement of st jean de maurienne signed on april which settled the middle eastern interest of italy was overridden with the greek occupation as smyrna i zmir was part of the territory promised to italy
before the occupation the italian delegation to the paris peace conference angry about the possibility of the greek occupation of western anatolia left the conference and did not return to paris until may
the absence of the italian delegation from the conference ended up facilitating lloyd george s efforts to persuade france and the united states to support greece and prevent italian operations in western anatolia
according to some historians it was the greek occupation of smyrna that created the turkish national movement
arnold j
toynbee argues the war between turkey and greece which burst out at this time was a defensive war for safeguarding of the turkish homelands in anatolia
it was a result of the allied policy of imperialism operating in a foreign state the military resources and powers of which were seriously under estimated it was provoked by the unwarranted invasion of a greek army of occupation according to others the landing of the greek troops in smyrna was part of eleftherios venizelos s plan inspired by the megali idea to liberate the large greek populations in the asia minor
prior to the great fire of smyrna smyrna had a bigger greek population than the greek capital athens
athens before the population exchange between greece and turkey had a population of while smyrna according to ottoman sources in had a greek population exceeding
one of the reasons proposed by the greek government for launching the asia minor expedition was that there was a sizeable greek speaking orthodox christian population inhabiting anatolia that needed protection
greeks had lived in asia minor since antiquity and before the outbreak of world war i up to million greeks lived in the ottoman empire
the suggestion that the greeks constituted the majority of the population in the lands claimed by greece has been contested by a number of historians
cedric james lowe and michael l
dockrill also argued that greek claims about smyrna were at best debatable since greeks constituted perhaps a bare majority more likely a large minority in the smyrna vilayet which lay in an overwhelmingly turkish anatolia precise demographics are further obscured by the ottoman policy of dividing the population according to religion rather than descent language or self identification
on the other hand contemporaneous british and american statistics support the point that the greek element was the most numerous in the region of smyrna counting while muslims were
greek prime minister venizelos stated to a british newspaper that greece is not making war against islam but against the anachronistic ottoman government and its corrupt ignominious and bloody administration with a view to expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of greeks
to an extent the above danger may have been overstated by venizelos as a negotiating card on the table of s vres in order to gain the support of the allied governments
for example the young turks were not in power at the time of the war which makes such a justification less straightforward
most of the leaders of that regime had fled the country at the end of world war i and the ottoman government in constantinople was already under british control
furthermore venizelos had already revealed his desires for annexation of territories from the ottoman empire in the early stages of world war i before these massacres had taken place
in a letter sent to greek king constantine in january he wrote that i have the impression that the concessions to greece in asia minor
would be so extensive that another equally large and not less rich greece will be added to the doubled greece which emerged from the victorious balkan wars
through its failure the greek invasion may have instead exacerbated the atrocities that it was supposed to prevent
arnold j
toynbee blamed the policies pursued by great britain and greece and the decisions of the paris peace conference as factors leading to the atrocities committed by both sides during and after the war the greeks of pontus and the turks of the greek occupied territories were in some degree victims of mr
venizelos s and mr
lloyd george s original miscalculations at paris
one of the main motivations for initiating the war was to realize the megali great idea a core concept of greek nationalism
the megali idea was an irredentist vision of a restoration of a greater greece on both sides of the aegean that would incorporate territories with greek populations outside the borders of the kingdom of greece which was initially very small roughly half the size of the present day greek republic
from the time of greek independence from the ottoman empire in the megali idea had played a major role in greek politics
greek politicians since the independence of the greek state had made several speeches on the issue of the historic inevitability of the expansion of the greek kingdom for instance greek politician ioannis kolettis voiced this conviction in the assembly in there are two great centres of hellenism
athens is the capital of the kingdom
constantinople is the great capital the city the dream and hope of all greeks
the great idea was not merely the product of th century nationalism
it was in one of its aspects deeply rooted in many greeks religious consciousnesses
this aspect was the recovery of constantinople for christendom and the reestablishment of the christian byzantine empire which had fallen in
ever since this time the recovery of st
sophia and the city had been handed down from generation to generation as the destiny and aspiration of the greek orthodox the megali idea besides constantinople included most traditional lands of the greeks including crete thessaly epirus macedonia thrace the aegean islands cyprus the coastlands of asia minor and pontus on the black sea
asia minor was an essential part of the greek world and an area of enduring greek cultural dominance
in antiquity from late bronze age up to the roman conquest greek city states had even exercised political control of most of the region except the period ca
bc when it was part of the achaimenid persian empire
later during middle ages the region had belonged to the byzantine empire until the th century when the first seljuk turk raids reached it
the national schism in greece was the deep split of greek politics and society between two factions the one led by eleftherios venizelos and the other by king constantine that predated world war i but escalated significantly over the decision on which side greece should support during the war
the united kingdom had hoped that strategic considerations might persuade constantine to join the cause of the allies but the king and his supporters insisted on strict neutrality especially whilst the outcome of the conflict was hard to predict
in addition family ties and emotional attachments made it difficult for constantine to decide which side to support during world war i
the king s dilemma was further increased when the ottomans and the bulgarians both having grievances and aspirations against the greek kingdom joined the central powers
though constantine did remain decidedly neutral prime minister of greece eleftherios venizelos had from an early point decided that greece s interests would be best served by joining the entente and started diplomatic efforts with the allies to prepare the ground for concessions following an eventual victory
the disagreement and the subsequent dismissal of venizelos by the king resulted in a deep personal rift between the two which spilled over into their followers and the wider greek society
greece became divided into two radically opposed political camps as venizelos set up a separate state in northern greece and eventually with allied support forced the king to abdicate
in may after the exile of constantine veniz los returned to athens and allied with the entente
greek military forces though divided between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of venizelism began to take part in military operations against the bulgarian army on the border
the act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post world war i greece
the country s foremost political formations the venizelist liberals and the royalists already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre war politics reached a state of outright hatred towards each other
both parties viewed the other s actions during the first world war as politically illegitimate and treasonous
this enmity inevitably spread throughout greek society creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the failed asia minor campaign and resulted in much social unrest in the inter war years
the military aspect of the war began with the armistice of mudros
the military operations of the greco turkish war can be roughly divided into three main phases the first phase spanning the period from may to october encompassed the greek landings in asia minor and their consolidation along the aegean coast
the second phase lasted from october to august and was characterised by greek offensive operations
the third and final phase lasted until august when the strategic initiative was held by the turkish army
on may twenty thousand greek soldiers landed in smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the greek french and british navies
legal justifications for the landings was found in article of the armistice of mudros which allowed the allies to occupy any strategic points in the event of any situation arising which threatens the security of allies the greeks had already brought their forces into eastern thrace apart from constantinople and its region
the christian population of smyrna mainly greeks and armenians according to different sources either formed a minority or a majority compared to muslim turkish population of the city
the greek army also consisted of armenian volunteers
the majority of the greek population residing in the city greeted the greek troops as liberators
during the summer of the greek army launched a series of successful offensives in the directions of the b y k menderes river meander valley bursa prusa and ala ehir philadelphia
the overall strategic objective of these operations which were met by increasingly stiff turkish resistance was to provide strategic depth to the defence of izmir smyrna
to that end the greek zone of occupation was extended over all of western and most of north western anatolia
in return for the contribution of the greek army on the side of the allies the allies supported the assignment of eastern thrace and the millet of smyrna to greece
this treaty ended the first world war in asia minor and at the same time sealed the fate of the ottoman empire
henceforth the ottoman empire would no longer be a european power
on august the ottoman empire signed the treaty of s vres ceding to greece thrace up to the chatalja lines
more importantly turkey renounced to greece all rights over imbros and tenedos retaining the small territories of constantinople the islands of marmara and a tiny strip of european territory
the straits of bosporus were placed under an international commission as they were now open to all
turkey was furthermore forced to transfer to greece the exercise of her rights of sovereignty over smyrna in addition to a considerable hinterland merely retaining a flag over an outer fort though greece administered the smyrna enclave its sovereignty remained nominally with the sultan
according to the provisions of the treaty smyrna was to maintain a local parliament and if within five years time she asked to be incorporated within the kingdom of greece the provision was made that the league of nations would hold a plebiscite to decide on such matters
the treaty was never ratified by the ottoman empire nor greece
in october the greek army advanced further east into anatolia with the encouragement of lloyd george who intended to increase pressure on the turkish and ottoman governments to sign the treaty of s vres
this advance began under the liberal government of eleftherios venizelos but soon after the offensive began venizelos fell from power and was replaced by dimitrios gounaris
the strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the turkish nationalists and force mustafa kemal into peace negotiations
the advancing greeks still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill equipped turkish forces
yet they met with little resistance as the turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement
churchill said the greek columns trailed along the country roads passing safely through many ugly defiles and at their approach the turks under strong and sagacious leadership vanished into the recesses of anatolia
during october king alexander who had been installed on the greek throne on june when his father constantine was pushed into exile by the venizelists was bitten by a monkey kept at the royal gardens and died within days from sepsis
after king alexander died without heirs the legislative elections scheduled to be held on november suddenly became the focus of a new conflict between the supporters of venizelos and the royalists
the anti venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government which due to the war had stayed in power without elections since
at the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in asia minor without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would happen
on the contrary venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere
the majority of the greek people were both war weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the venizelists so opted for change
to the surprise of many venizelos won only out of the total seats
the crushing defeat obliged venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country
to this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned
the new government under dimitrios gounaris prepared for a plebiscite on the return of king constantine
noting the king s hostile stance during world war i the allies warned the greek government that if he should be returned to the throne they would cut off all financial and military aid to greece
a month later a plebiscite called for the return of king constantine
soon after his return the king replaced many of the world war i venizelist officers and appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior positions
the leadership of the campaign was given to anastasios papoulas while king constantine himself assumed nominally the overall command
the high commissioner in smyrna aristeidis stergiadis however was not removed
in addition many of the remaining venizelist officers resigned appalled by the regime change
a group of officers headed by georgios kondylis formed in constantinople a national defence organization which reinforced with venizelist deserters soon started to criticize the royalist government of athens
the greek army which had secured smyrna and the asia minor coast was purged of most of venizelos s supporters while it marched on ankara
however tension inside the army between the two factions remained
by december the greeks had advanced on two fronts approaching eski ehir from the north west and from smyrna and had consolidated their occupation zone
in early they resumed their advance with small scale reconnaissance incursions that met stiff resistance from entrenched turkish nationalists who were increasingly better prepared and equipped as a regular army
the greek advance was halted for the first time at the first battle of i n n on january
even though this was a minor confrontation involving only one greek division it held political significance for the fledgling turkish revolutionaries
this development led to allied proposals to amend the treaty of s vres at a conference in london where both the turkish revolutionary and ottoman governments were represented
although some agreements were reached with italy france and britain the decisions were not agreed to by the greek government who believed that they still retained the strategic advantage and could yet negotiate from a stronger position
the greeks initiated another attack on march the second battle of i n n where the turkish troops fiercely resisted and finally halted the greeks on march
the british favoured a greek territorial expansion but refused to offer any military assistance in order to avoid provoking the french
the turkish forces received arms assistance from soviet russia
by this time all other fronts had been settled in favour of the turks freeing more resources for the main threat of the greek army
france and italy concluded private agreements with the turkish revolutionaries in recognition of their mounting strength
they viewed greece as a british client and sold military equipment to the turks
the new bolshevik government of russia became friendly to the turkish revolutionaries as shown in the treaty of moscow
the bolsheviks supported mustafa kemal and his forces with money and ammunition
in alone bolshevik russia supplied the kemalists with rifles over million rifle cartridges and shells as well as kg lb of gold bullion
in the subsequent two years the amount of aid increased
between june and july a reinforced greek army of nine divisions launched a major offensive the greatest thus far against the turkish troops commanded by ismet in n on the line of afyonkarahisar k tahya eski ehir
the plan of the greeks was to cut anatolia in two as the above towns were on the main rail lines connecting the hinterland with the coast
eventually after breaking the stiff turkish defences they occupied these strategically important centres
instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists military capacity the greek army halted
in consequence and despite their defeat the turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on the east of the sakarya river where they organised their last line of defence
this was the major decision that sealed the fate of the greek campaign in anatolia
the state and army leadership including king constantine prime minister dimitrios gounaris and general anastasios papoulas met at k tahya where they debated the future of the campaign
the greeks with their faltering morale rejuvenated failed to appraise the strategic situation that favoured the defending side instead pressed for a final solution the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the turks and attack their last line of defence close to ankara
the military leadership was cautious and asked for more reinforcements and time to prepare but did not go against the politicians
only a few voices supported a defensive stance including ioannis metaxas
constantine by this time had little actual power and did not argue either way
after a delay of almost a month that gave time to the turks to organise their defence seven of the greek divisions crossed east of the sakarya river
following the retreat of the turkish troops under ismet in n in the battle of k tahya eski ehir the greek army advanced afresh to the sakarya river sangarios in greek less than kilometres mi west of ankara
constantine s battle cry was to angira and the british officers were invited in anticipation to a victory dinner in the city of kemal
it was envisaged that the turkish revolutionaries who had consistently avoided encirclement would be drawn into battle in defence of their capital and destroyed in a battle of attrition
despite the soviet help supplies were short as the turkish army prepared to meet the greeks
owners of private rifles guns and ammunition had to surrender them to the army and every household was required to provide a pair of underclothing and sandals
meanwhile the turkish parliament not happy with the performance of ismet in n as the commander of the western front wanted mustafa kemal and chief of general staff fevzi akmak to take control
greek forces marched kilometres mi for a week through the desert to reach attack positions so the turks could see them coming
food supplies were tons of bread and salt sugar and tea the rest to be found on the way
the advance of the greek army faced fierce resistance which culminated in the day battle of sakarya august september
the turkish defense positions were centred on series of heights and the greeks had to storm and occupy them
the turks held certain hilltops and lost others while some were lost and recaptured several times over
yet the turks had to conserve men for the greeks held the numerical advantage
the crucial moment came when the greek army tried to take haymana kilometres mi south of ankara but the turks held out
greek advances into anatolia had lengthened their lines of supply and communication and they were running out of ammunition
the ferocity of the battle exhausted both sides but the greeks were the first to withdraw to their previous lines
the thunder of cannon was plainly heard in ankara throughout the battle
that was the furthest in anatolia the greeks would advance and within a few weeks they withdrew in an orderly manner back to the lines that they had held in june
the turkish parliament awarded both mustafa kemal and fevzi akmak with the title of field marshal for their service in this battle
to this day no other person has received this five star general title from the turkish republic
having failed to reach a military solution greece appealed to the allies for help but early in britain france and italy decided that the treaty of s vres could not be enforced and had to be revised
in accordance with this decision under successive treaties the italian and french troops evacuated their positions leaving the greeks exposed
in march the allies proposed an armistice
feeling that he now held the strategic advantage mustafa kemal declined any settlement while the greeks remained in anatolia and intensified his efforts to re organise the turkish military for the final offensive against the greeks
at the same time the greeks strengthened their defensive positions but were increasingly demoralised by the inactivity of remaining on the defensive and the prolongation of the war
the greek government was desperate to get some military support from the british or at least secure a loan so it developed an ill thought plan to force the british diplomatically by threatening their positions in constantinople but this never materialised
the occupation of constantinople would have been an easy task at this time because the allied troops garrisoned there were much fewer than the greek forces in thrace two divisions
the end result though was instead to weaken the greek defences in smyrna by withdrawing troops
the turkish forces on the other hand were recipients of significant assistance from soviet russia
on april the soviet authorities supplied the turkish consul critical quantities of arms and ammunition sufficient for three turkish divisions
on may the soviet government handed over gold rubles to turkey the balance of the credit of gold rubles
voices in greece increasingly called for withdrawal and demoralizing propaganda spread among the troops
some of the removed venizelist officers organised a movement of national defense and planned a coup to secede from athens but never gained venizelos s endorsement and all their actions remained fruitless
historian malcolm yapp wrote that
the turks finally launched a counter attack on august what has come to be known to the turks as the great offensive b y k taarruz
the major greek defense positions were overrun on august and afyon fell next day
on august the greek army was defeated decisively at the battle of dumlup nar with many of its soldiers captured or slain and a large part of its equipment lost
this date is celebrated as victory day a national holiday in turkey and salvage day of k tahya
during the battle the greek generals nikolaos trikoupis and kimon digenis were captured by the turkish forces
general trikoupis learned only after his capture that he had been recently appointed commander in chief in general hatzianestis place
according to the greek army general staff major generals nikolaos trikoupis and kimon digenis surrendered on august by the village of karaja hissar due to lack of ammunitions food and supplies on september mustafa kemal issued his famous order to the turkish army armies your first goal is the mediterranean forward
on september eski ehir was captured and the greek government asked britain to arrange a truce that would at least preserve its rule in smyrna
however kemal mustafa atat rk had categorically refused to acknowledge even a temporary greek occupation of smyrna calling it a foreign occupation and pursued an aggressive military policy instead
bal kesir and bilecik were taken on september and ayd n the next day
manisa was taken on september
the government in athens resigned
turkish cavalry entered smyrna on september
gemlik and mudanya fell on september with an entire greek division surrendering
the expulsion of the greek army from anatolia was completed on september
as historian george lenczowski has put it once started the offensive was a dazzling success
within two weeks the turks drove the greek army back to the mediterranean sea
the vanguards of turkish cavalry entered the outskirts of smyrna on september
on the same day the greek headquarters had evacuated the town
the turkish cavalry rode into the town around eleven o clock on the saturday morning of september
on september with the possibility of social disorder mustafa kemal was quick to issue a proclamation sentencing to death any turkish soldier who harmed non combatants
a few days before the turkish capture of the city mustafa kemal s messengers distributed leaflets with this order written in greek
mustafa kemal said that the ankara government would not be held responsible for any occurrence of a massacre
atrocities were committed against greek and armenian populaces and their properties were pillaged
most of the eye witness reports identified troops from the turkish army having set the fire in the city
the greek and armenian quarters of the city were burned the turkish as well as jewish quarters stood
after re capturing smyrna turkish forces headed north for the bosporus the sea of marmara and the dardanelles where the allied garrisons were reinforced by british french and italian troops from constantinople
in an interview with george ward price published in the daily mail september mustafa kemal stated that our demands remain the same after our recent victory as they were before
we ask for asia minor thrace up to the river maritsa and constantinople
we must have our capital and i should in that case be obliged to march on constantinople with my army which will be an affair of only a few days
i must prefer to obtain possession by negotiation though naturally i cannot wait indefinitely
around this time several turkish officers were sent to infiltrate secretly into constantinople to help organize turkish population living in the city in the event of a war
for instance ernest hemingway who was at the time a war correspondent for the newspaper toronto star reported that
the british cabinet initially decided to resist the turks if necessary at the dardanelles and to ask for french and italian help to enable the greeks to remain in eastern thrace
the british government also issued a request for military support from its dominions
the response from the dominions was negative with the exception of new zealand
furthermore italian and french forces abandoned their positions at the straits and left the british alone to face the turks
on september mustafa kemal s troops moved into the straits zones and refused british requests to leave
the british cabinet was divided on the matter but eventually any possible armed conflict was prevented
british general charles harington allied commander in constantinople kept his men from firing on turks and warned the british cabinet against any rash adventure
the greek fleet left constantinople upon his request
the british finally decided to force the greeks to withdraw behind the maritsa in thrace
this convinced mustafa kemal to accept the opening of armistice talks
the armistice of mudanya was concluded on october
the allies britain france and italy retained control of eastern thrace and the bosporus
the greeks were to evacuate these areas
the agreement came into force starting october one day after the greek side agreed to sign it
the armistice of mudanya was followed by the treaty of lausanne
separate from this treaty turkey and greece came to an agreement covering an exchange of populations
over one million greek orthodox christians were displaced most of them were resettled in attica and the newly incorporated greek territories of macedonia and thrace and were exchanged with about muslims displaced from greek territories
the greeks estimated despite warnings from the french and british not to underestimate the enemy that they would need only three months to defeat the already weakened turks on their own
exhausted from four years of bloodshed no allied power had the will to engage in a new war and relied on greece
during the conference of london in february the greek prime minister kalogeropoulos revealed that the morale of the greek army was excellent and their courage was undoubted he added that in his eyes the kemalists were not regular soldiers they merely constituted a rabble worthy of little or no consideration
still the allies had doubts about greek military capacity to advance in anatolia facing vast territories long lines of communication financial shortcomings of the greek treasury and above all the toughness of the turkish peasant soldier
after the greek failure to rout and defeat the new established turkish army in the first and second battle of i n n the italians began to evacuate their occupation zone in southwestern anatolia in july
furthermore the italians also claimed that greece had violated the limits of the greek occupation laid down by the council of four
france on the other hand had its own front in cilicia with the turkish nationalists
the french like the other allied powers had changed their support to the turks in order to build a strong buffer state against the bolsheviks and were looking to leave
after the greeks had failed again to knock out the turks in the decisive battle of sakarya the french finally signed the treaty of ankara with the turks in late october
in addition the allies did not fully allow the greek navy to effect a blockade of the black sea coast which could have restricted turkish imports of food and material
still the greek navy bombarded some larger ports june and july inebolu july trabzon sinop august rize trabzon september arakl terme trabzon october izmit june samsun
the greek navy was able to blockade the black sea coast especially before and during the first and second i n n k tahya eski ehir and sakarya battles preventing weapon and ammunition shipments
having adequate supplies was a constant problem for the greek army
although it was not lacking in men courage or enthusiasm it was soon lacking in nearly everything else
due to her poor economy greece could not sustain long term mobilisation
according to a british report from may anatolian greeks armenians and circassians served under arms in the greek occupation of this number were circassians
in comparison the turks also had difficulties to find enough fit men as a result of million military casualties during world war i
very soon the greek army exceeded the limits of its logistical structure and had no way of retaining such a large territory under constant attack by initially irregular and later regular turkish troops
the idea that such large force could sustain offensive by mainly living off the land proved wrong
although the greek army had to retain a large territory after september the greek army was more motorized than the turkish army
the greek army had in addition to animals for transportation trucks and automobiles ambulances according to the greek army history directorate total number of trucks including ambulances was
only of them have been used for the advance to angora also camels and a great number of ox and horse carts whereas the turkish army relied on transportation with animals
they had animals of whom were used as horse carts ox carts tumbrels and phaetons but only trucks and automobiles ambulances
as the supply situation worsened for the greeks things improved for the turks
after the armistice of mudros the allies had dissolved the ottoman army confiscated all ottoman weapons and ammunition hence the turkish national movement which was in the progress of establishing a new army was in desperate need of weapons
in addition to the weapons not yet confiscated by the allies they enjoyed soviet support from abroad in return for giving batum to the soviet union
the soviets also provided monetary aid to the turkish national movement not to the extent that they promised but almost in sufficient amount to make up the large deficiencies in the promised supply of arms
one of the main reasons for soviet support was that allied forces were fighting on russian soil against the bolshevik regime therefore the turkish opposition was much favored by moscow
the italians were embittered from their loss of the smyrna mandate to the greeks and they used their base in antalya to arm and train turkish troops to assist the kemalists against the greeks
a british military attach who inspected the greek army in june was quoted as saying more efficient fighting machine than i have ever seen it later he wrote the greek army of asia minor which now stood ready and eager to advance was the most formidable force the nation had ever put into field
its morale was high
judged by balkan standards its staff was capable its discipline and organization good turkish troops had a determined and competent strategic and tactical command manned by world war i veterans
the turkish army enjoyed the advantage of being in defence executed in the new form of area defence
mustafa kemal presented himself as revolutionary to the communists protector of tradition and order to the conservatives patriot soldier to the nationalists and a muslim leader for the religious so he was able to recruit all turkish elements and motivate them to fight
the turkish national movement attracted sympathizers especially from the muslims of the far east countries
the khilafet committee in bombay started a fund to help the turkish national struggle and sent both financial aid and constant letters of encouragement
not all of the money arrived and mustafa kemal decided not use the money that was sent by the khilafet committee
the money was restored in the ottoman bank
after the war it was later used for the founding of the t rkiye i bankas
rudolph j
rummel estimated that from to various turkish regimes killed from to over armenians greeks and assyrians
rummel estimates that armenian civilians and greek civilians were killed by turkish forces during the turkish war of independence between and
however he also gives the figures in his study of between to million dead of whom millions were armenian greek nestorians turks circassians and others in line
british historian and journalist arnold j
toynbee stated that when he toured the region he saw numerous greek villages that had been burned to the ground
toynbee also stated that the turkish troops had clearly individually and deliberately burned down each house in these villages pouring petrol on them and taking care to ensure that they were totally destroyed
there were massacres throughout the period of the turkish war of independence especially of armenians in the east and the south and against the greeks in the black sea region
sivas province governor ebubekir h z m tepeyran said in that the massacres were so horrible that he could not bear to report them
he referred to the atrocities committed against greeks in the black sea region and according to the official tally greeks were murdered in by the central army under the command of nurettin pasha who is infamous for the killing of archbishop chrysostomos
some parliamentary deputies demanded that nurettin pasha be sentenced to death and it was decided to put him on trial although the trial was later revoked by the intervention of mustafa kemal
taner ak am wrote that according to one newspaper nurettin pasha had proposed the killing of all the remaining greek and armenian populations in anatolia a suggestion rejected by mustafa kemal
these sentiments mainly arose from the desire for vengeance following the ethnic cleansings committed by greek army systematically throughout the failed campaign
there were also several contemporary western newspaper articles reporting the atrocities committed by turkish forces against christian populations living in anatolia mainly greek and armenian civilians
for instance according to the london times the turkish authorities frankly state it is their deliberate intention to let all the greeks die and their actions support their statement an irish paper the belfast news letter wrote the appalling tale of barbarity and cruelty now being practiced by the angora turks is part of a systematic policy of extermination of christian minorities in asia minor according to the christian science monitor the turks felt that they needed to murder their christian minorities due to christian superiority in terms of industriousness and the consequent turkish feelings of jealousy and inferiority
the paper wrote the result has been to breed feelings of alarm and jealousy in the minds of the turks which in later years have driven them to depression
they believe that they cannot compete with their christian subjects in the arts of peace and that the christians and greeks especially are too industrious and too well educated as rivals
therefore from time to time they have striven to try and redress the balance by expulsion and massacre
that has been the position generations past in turkey again if the great powers are callous and unwise enough to attempt to perpetuate turkish misrule over christians according to the newspaper the scotsman on august in the feival district of karamusal south east of ismid in asia minor the turks massacred christians
there were also massacres during this period against armenians continuing the policies of the armenian genocide according to some western newspapers
on february greek villages in the pontus region were burnt to the ground
an american newspaper the atlanta observer wrote the smell of the burning bodies of women and children in pontus said the message comes as a warning of what is awaiting the christian in asia minor after the withdrawal of the hellenic army in the first few months of greeks were killed by advancing kemalist forces according to belfast news letter
according to the philadelphia evening bulletin the turks continued the practice of slavery seizing women and children for their harems and raping numerous women
the christian science monitor wrote that turkish authorities also prevented missionaries and humanitarian aid groups from assisting greek civilians who had their homes burned the turkish authorities leaving these people to die despite abundant aid
the christian science monitor wrote the turks are trying to exterminate the greek population with more vigor than they exercised towards the armenians in
atrocities against pontic greeks living in the pontus region is recognized in greece and cyprus as the pontian genocide
according to a proclamation made in by the then governor of new york where a sizeable population of greek americans resides george pataki the greeks of asia minor endured immeasurable cruelty during a turkish government sanctioned systematic campaign to displace them destroying greek towns and villages and slaughtering additional hundreds of thousands of civilians in areas where greeks composed a majority as on the black sea coast pontus and areas around smyrna those who survived were exiled from turkey and today they and their descendants live throughout the greek diaspora
by september the turkish army had entered smyrna with the greek authorities having left two days before
large scale disorder followed with the christian population suffering under attacks from soldiers and turkish inhabitants
the greek archbishop chrysostomos had been lynched by a mob which included turkish soldiers and on september a fire from the armenian quarter of the city had engulfed the christian waterfront of the city leaving the city devastated
the responsibility for the fire is a controversial issue some sources blame turks and some sources blame greeks or armenians
some to greeks and armenians were killed in the fire and accompanying massacres
british historian arnold j
toynbee wrote that there were organized atrocities following the greek landing at smyrna on may
he also stated that he and his wife were witnesses to the atrocities perpetrated by greeks in the yalova gemlik and izmit areas and they not only obtained abundant material evidence in the shape of burnt and plundered houses recent corpses and terror stricken survivors but also witnessed robbery by greek civilians and arson by greek soldiers in uniform as they were being perpetrated
toynbee wrote that as soon as the greek army landed they started committing atrocities against turkish civilians as they laid waste the fertile maeander meander valley and forced thousands of turks to take refuge outside the borders of the areas controlled by the greeks
secretary of state for the colonies and later prime minister of the united kingdom winston churchill comparing the specific activities with the genocide policies perpetrated by the turkish side noted that the greek atrocities were on a minor scale compared to the appalling deportations of greeks from the trebizond and samsun district
during the battle of bergama the greek army committed a massacre against turkish civilians in menemen killing and injuring people
some turkish sources claim that the death count of the menemen massacre was
on june a massacre occurred in i zmit killing more than turkish civilians according to arnold j
toynbee
harold armstrong a british officer who was a member of the inter allied commission reported that as the greeks pushed out from smyrna they massacred and raped civilians and burned and pillaged as they went
johannes kolmodin was a swedish orientalist in smyrna
he wrote in his letters that the greek army had burned turkish villages
in one village the greek army demanded gold liras to spare the town however after payment the village was still sacked
the inter allied commission consisting of british french american and italian officers and the representative of the geneva international red cross m
gehri prepared two separate collaborative reports on their investigations of the gemlik yalova peninsula massacres
these reports found that greek forces committed systematic atrocities against the turkish inhabitants
and the commissioners mentioned the burning and looting of turkish villages the explosion of violence of greeks and armenians against the turks and a systematic plan of destruction and extinction of the moslem population
in their report of may the inter allied commission stated also that this plan is being carried out by greek and armenian bands which appear to operate under greek instructions and sometimes even with the assistance of detachments of regular troops
the inter allied commission also stated that the destruction of villages and the disappearance of the muslim population might have as its objective to create in this region a political situation favourable to the greek government
the allied investigation also pointed that the specific events were reprisals for the general turkish oppression of the past years and especially for the turkish atrocities committed in the marmara region one year before when several greek villages had been burned and thousands of greeks massacred
arnold j
toynbee wrote that they obtained convincing evidence that similar atrocities had been started in wide areas all over the remainder of the greek occupied territories since june
he argued that the situation of the turks in smyrna city had become what could be called without exaggeration a reign of terror it was to be inferred that their treatment in the country districts had grown worse in proportion however toynbee omits to notice that the allied report concluded that the ismid peninsula atrocities committed by the turks have been considerable and more ferocious than those on the part of the greeks
in general as reported by a british intelligence report the turkish inhabitants of the occupied zone have in most cases accepted the advent of greek rule without demur and in some cases undoubtedly prefer it to the turkish nationalist regime which seems to have been founded on terrorism
british military personnel observed that the greek army near u ak was warmly welcomed by the muslim population for being freed from the license and oppression of the turkish nationalist troops there were occasional cases of misconduct by the greek troops against the muslim population and the perpetrators were prosecuted by the greek authorities while the worst miscreants were a handful of armenians recruited by the greek army who were then sent back to constantinople
justin mccarthy reports that during the negotiations for the treaty of lausanne the chief negotiator of the turkish delegation ismet pasha i n n gave an estimate of million anatolian turks that had been exiled or died in the area of greek occupation
of these mccarthy estimates that refuged and died with many if not most of those who died being refugees as well
the comparison of census figures shows that anatolian muslims had become refugees or had died
however mccarthy s work has faced harsh criticism by scholars who have characterized mccarthy s views as indefensibly biased towards turkey and the turkish official position as well as engaging in genocide denial
as part of the lausanne treaty greece recognized the obligation to make reparations for damages caused in anatolia though turkey agreed to renounce all such claims due to greece s difficult financial situation
according to a number of sources the retreating greek army carried out a scorched earth policy while fleeing from anatolia during the final phase of the war
historian of the middle east sydney nettleton fisher wrote that the greek army in retreat pursued a burned earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless turkish villagers in its path norman m
naimark noted that the greek retreat was even more devastating for the local population than the occupation
james loder park the u s
vice consul in constantinople at the time toured much of the devastated area immediately after the greek evacuation and reported the situation in the surrounding cities and towns of i zmir he has seen such as the fire of manisa
kinross wrote already most of the towns in its path were in ruins
one third of ushak no longer existed
alashehir was no more than a dark scorched cavity defacing the hillside
village after village had been reduced to an ash heap
out of the eighteen thousand buildings in the historic holy city of manisa only five hundred remained
in one of the examples of the greek atrocities during the retreat on february in the turkish village of karatepe in ayd n vilayeti after being surrounded by the greeks all the inhabitants were put into the mosque then the mosque was burned
the few who escaped fire were shot
the italian consul m
miazzi reported that he had just visited a turkish village where greeks had slaughtered some sixty women and children
this report was then corroborated by captain kocher the french consul
according to the population exchange treaty signed by both the turkish and greek governments greek orthodox citizens of turkey and turkish and greek muslim citizens residing in greece were subjected to the population exchange between these two countries
approximately orthodox christians being ethnic greeks and ethnic turks from turkey and about turks and greek muslims from greece were uprooted from their homelands
norman naimark claimed that this treaty was the last part of an ethnic cleansing campaign to create an ethnically pure homeland for the turks historian dinah shelton similarly wrote that the lausanne treaty completed the forcible transfer of the country s greeks
a large part of the greek population was forced to leave their ancestral homelands of ionia pontus and eastern thrace between
these refugees as well as greek americans with origins in anatolia were not allowed to return to their homelands after the signing of the treaty of lausanne
