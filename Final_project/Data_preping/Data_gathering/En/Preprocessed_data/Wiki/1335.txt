prior great fire smyrna smyrna bigger greek population greek capital athens
athens population exchange greece turkey population smyrna according ottoman source greek population exceeding
one reason proposed greek government launching asia minor expedition wa wa sizeable greek-speaking orthodox christian population inhabiting anatolia needed protection
greek lived asia minor since antiquity outbreak world war million greek lived ottoman empire

one main motivation initiating war wa realize megali great idea core concept greek nationalism
megali idea wa irredentist vision restoration greater greece side aegean would incorporate territory greek population outside border kingdom greece wa initially small roughly half size present-day greek republic
time greek independence ottoman empire megali idea played major role greek politics
greek politician since independence greek state made several speech issue historic inevitability expansion greek kingdom instance greek politician ioannis kolettis voiced conviction assembly two great centre hellenism
wa one aspect deeply rooted many greeks' religious consciousnesses
aspect wa recovery constantinople christendom reestablishment christian byzantine empire fallen in

asia minor wa essential part greek world area enduring greek cultural dominance
antiquity late bronze age roman conquest greek city-state even exercised political control region except period ca
later middle age region belonged byzantine empire century first seljuk turk raid reached it
national schism greece wa deep split greek politics society two faction one led eleftherios venizelos king constantine predated world war escalated significantly decision side greece support war
united kingdom hoped strategic consideration might persuade constantine join cause ally king supporter insisted strict neutrality especially whilst outcome conflict wa hard predict
addition family tie emotional attachment made difficult constantine decide side support world war i
king's dilemma wa increased ottoman bulgarian grievance aspiration greek kingdom joined central powers
though constantine remain decidedly neutral prime minister greece eleftherios venizelos early point decided greece's interest would best served joining entente started diplomatic effort ally prepare ground concession following eventual victory
