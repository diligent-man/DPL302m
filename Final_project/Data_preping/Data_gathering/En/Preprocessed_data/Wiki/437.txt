roselands has now become the place for the sixth form to study however some subjects such as science cannot be taught in roselands since there is no facility to and as a consequence some sixth form students have to go to the main building

the main objective of the old ignatian association is to serve the interests of the former pupils of the college
they provide spiritual social recreational and sporting facilities so that they may serve the interests of not only the old ignatians but also of current pupils
although having been in existence for many years the old ignatian association changed dramatically in the early s
through the efforts of a dedicated and enthusiastic group of old ignatians a sports ground was acquired and a pavilion built on a site in woodford
in the s the proposed motorway the m caused the association to be subject to a compulsory purchase order and they were left without a suitable meeting place throughout the late s
in the old ignatians purchased a former sports ground in turkey street enfield and made plans to build their new headquarters there
their plans were to re establish a social centre and to provide some new sporting facilities that were not available in the woodford centre
their plan also was to make sure that the facilities at the new site not only cater to sports minded people but the less so as well
in after obtaining planning permission for the new pavilion building began
the now completed pavilion named the loyola ground was opened in and is used by the association as well as the school for sporting social and many other events
the old ignatian football club is open to former and present pupils of the college to play football on saturday afternoons throughout the season
they run teams plus a vets side on a sunday so every level of ability is catered for
with the new clubhouse completed the oifc once again had a place they could call home after many years without a base
they now play their home matches on the main pitch as well as sharing the schools bulls cross pitches at the loyola ground on saturday afternoons
most old ignatians will recall the form of corporal punishment administered at the school
the cane was never used instead it was the ferula whale bone covered in a heavy rubber called gutta percha which was administered on both hands half the awarded strokes on each
two types of ferula or tolly were used the one mentioned above for the lower school and a longer one for the upper school
in serious cases the punishment would be twice six on both hands but administered on separate days on account of the hand becoming numb
the ferula was usually administered in the current technology wing on the bottom floor
adding psychological to corporal punishment offenders were given a week to decide when they would receive their ferula otherwise additional punishment was liable to be added according to the school rules
corporal punishment ended in the early s
nowadays discipline is in the form of a detention which is hour long and takes place after school with the subject tutor
in extreme circumstances teachers can issue a hour detention called an slt detention
for serious offences pupils can either be placed in manresa in school suspension or excluded fixed term suspension or full term expelled
