Originally the school only used two floors for years to and the Sixth Form occupied the rd floor However overcrowding again became a problem and the school acquired the Roselands building from the Jesuits who had a place of residence there The school also built another floor on top of the current technology wing to serve as the first line block In this extension project a section dedicated to the study of music and a gym commonly known to students as the new gym were built In there was another extension which added several new rooms to the side of the building one of which is the current staff room In a further extension known as the Octagon was built
Roselands was originally built as a place of residence for the Jesuit community However as the number of priests in Roselands diminished the Jesuits no longer saw fit to occupy the Roselands site and sold off the building to the main school Roselands has now become the place for the Sixth Form to study however some subjects such as science cannot be taught in Roselands since there is no facility to and as a consequence some sixth form students have to go to the main building
The Octagon is a two story octagonal building on the site which houses the computer suite and the Loyola Library and was opened in On the top floor there was an ICT suite which contained computers as well as various smaller offices dedicated to tasks such as housing the servers and ICT teachers However this has since been refurbished again and the upper storey now houses a chapel On the bottom floor is a library containing a vast array of books primarily for study but there is a large selection of fiction too The library is open at lunch time for pupils to study in
