e prime short for english prime or english prime sometimes denoted or e is a version of the english language that excludes all forms of the verb to be including all conjugations contractions and archaic forms
some scholars advocate using e prime as a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing
a number of other scholars have criticized e prime s utility
david bourland jr who had studied under alfred korzybski devised e prime as an addition to korzybski s general semantics in the late s
bourland published the concept in a essay entitled a linguistic note writing in e prime originally published in general semantics bulletin
the essay quickly generated controversy within the general semantics field partly because practitioners of general semantics sometimes saw bourland as attacking the verb to be as such and not just certain usages
bourland collected and published three volumes of essays in support of his innovation
the first co edited by paul dennithorne johnston bore the title to be or not an e prime anthology
for the second more e prime to be or not ii published in he added a third editor jeremy klein
bourland and johnston then edited a third book e prime iii a third anthology published in
in the english language the verb to be also known as the copula has several distinct functions
identity of the form noun copula definite noun the cat is my only pet the cat is garfield
class membership of the form definite noun copula noun garfield is a cat
class inclusion of the form noun copula noun a cat is an animal
predication of the form noun copula adjective the cat is furry
auxiliary of the form noun copula verb the cat is sleeping the cat is being bitten by the dog
the examples illustrate two different uses of be as an auxiliary
in the first be is part of the progressive aspect used with ing on the verb in the second it is part of the passive as indicated by the perfect participle of a transitive verb
existence of the form there copula noun there is a cat
location of the form noun copula place phrase the cat is on the mat the cat is here bourland sees specifically the identity and predication functions as pernicious but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity
in the case of the existence form and less idiomatically the location form one might for example simply substitute the verb exists
other copula substitutes in english include taste feel smell sound grow remain stay and turn among others a user of e prime might use instead of to be
words not used in e prime include be being been am is isn t are aren t was wasn t were and weren t
contractions formed from a pronoun and a form of to be are also not used including i m you re we re they re he s she s it s there s here s where s how s what s who s and that s
e prime also prohibits contractions of to be found in nonstandard dialects of english such as ain t
one could rewrite the different functions of to be as follows
the cat is my only pet i have only a pet cat
the cat is garfield i call my cat garfield
garfield is a cat i call my cat garfield
a cat is an animal cat denotes an animal
the cat is furry the cat feels furry
the cat is sleeping the cat sleeps
the dog is chasing the cat the dog chases the cat
there is a cat i can see a cat
the cat is on the mat the cat sits on the mat
the cat is here i have the cat with me bourland and other advocates also suggest that use of e prime leads to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict
kellogg and bourland describe misuse of the verb to be as creating a deity mode of speech allowing even the most ignorant to transform their opinions magically into god like pronouncements on the nature of things
while teaching at the university of florida alfred korzybski counseled his students to eliminate the infinitive and verb forms of to be from their vocabulary whereas a second group continued to use i am you are they are statements as usual
for example instead of saying i am depressed a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally primed verb and to say something else such as i feel depressed when or i tend to make myself depressed about
korzybski observed improvement of one full letter grade by students who did not generalize by using that infinitive
albert ellis advocated the use of e prime when discussing psychological distress to encourage framing these experiences as temporary see also solution focused brief therapy and to encourage a sense of agency by specifying the subject of statements
according to ellis rational emotive behavior therapy has favored e prime more than any other form of psychotherapy and i think it is still the only form of therapy that has some of its main books written in e prime
however ellis did not always use e prime because he believed it interferes with readability

these authors observed that a communication under the copula ban can remain extremely unclear and imply prejudice while losing important speech patterns such as identities and identification
further prejudices and judgments that are made are more difficult to notice or refute
james d
french a computer programmer at the university of california berkeley summarized ten arguments against e prime in the context of general semantics as follows
the elimination of a whole class of sentences results in fewer alternatives and is likely to make writing less rather than more interesting
one can improve bad writing more by reducing use of the verb to be than by eliminating it
effective writing techniques are not relevant to general semantics as a discipline and therefore should not be promoted as general semantics practice
the context often ameliorates the possible harmful effects from the use of the is of identity and the is of predication so it is not necessary to eliminate all such sentences
for example george is a judge in response to a question of what he does for a living would not be a questionable statement
to be statements do not only convey identity but also asymmetrical relations x is higher than y negation a is not b location berlin is in germany auxiliary i am going to the store etc forms we would also have to sacrifice
eliminating to be from english has little effect on eliminating identity
for example a statement of apparently equal identification the silly ban on copula continues can be made without the copula assuming an identity rather than asserting it consequently hampering our awareness of it
identity in the language is not the same thing as the far more important identity in reaction identification
general semantics cuts the link between the two through the practice of silence on the objective levels adopting a self reflexive attitude e g as i see it it seems to me etc and by the use of quotation marks without using e prime
the advocates of e prime have not proven that it is easier to eliminate the verb to be from the english language than it is to eliminate just the is of identity and the is of predication
it may well be easier to do the latter for many people
one of the best languages for time binding is mathematics which relies heavily on the notion of equivalence and equality
for the purposes of time binding it may be better to keep to be in the language while only cutting the link between identity in the language and identification in our reactions
e prime makes no distinction between statements that cross the principles of general semantics and statements that do not
it lacks consistency with the other tenets of general semantics and should not be included into the discipline according to an article written in e prime and advocating a role for e prime in esl and efl programs published by the office of english language programs of the bureau of educational and cultural affairs in the state department of the united states requiring students to avoid the verb to be on every assignment would deter students from developing other fundamental skills of fluent writing
