computer science specifically computability theory computational complexity theory model computation model describes output mathematical function computed given input
using model allows studying performance algorithm independently variation specific particular implementation specific technology
model computation classified three category sequential model functional model concurrent models
nondeterministic model useful practical computation used study computational complexity algorithms
model differ expressive power example function computed finite state machine also computed turing machine vice versa
field runtime analysis algorithm common specify computational model term primitive operation allowed unit cost simply unit-cost operations
commonly used example random-access machine ha unit cost read write access memory cells
