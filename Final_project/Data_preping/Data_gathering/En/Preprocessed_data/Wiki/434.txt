jewish heresy refers to those beliefs which contradict the traditional doctrines of rabbinic judaism including theological beliefs and opinions about the practice of halakha jewish religious law
jewish tradition contains a range of statements about heretics including laws for how to deal with them in a communal context and statements about the divine punishment they are expected to receive
the greek term for heresy originally denoted division sect religious or philosophical party is applied by josephus to the three jewish sects sadducees pharisees and essenes
in the sense of a schism to be deprecated the word occurs in corinthians galatians and particularly in peter hence heretic in the sense of factious titus
the specific rabbinical term for heresies or religious divisions due to an unlawful spirit is minim lit
kinds of belief the singular min for heretic or gnostic is coined idiomatically like goy and am ha aretz see gnosticism
the law you shall not cut yourselves is interpreted by the rabbis you shall not form divisions but shall form one bond after amos a
troop
besides the term min for heretic the talmud uses the words itzonim outsiders apikoros and kofer ba torah or kofer ba ikkar he who denies the fundamentals of faith also poresh mi darke tzibbur he who deviates from the customs of the community
it is said that all these groups are consigned to gehinnom for all eternity and have no possibility of a portion in the world to come
the mishnah says the following have no share in the world to come he who denies that the torah is divinely revealed lit
comes from heaven and the api oros rabbi akiva says also he who reads heretical books sefarim itzonim
this is explained in the talmud to mean sifrei tzedukim sadducean writings but this is an alteration by the censor of sifre ha minim books of the gnostics or heretics
the biblical verse that you seek not after your own heart is explained as you shall not turn to heretic views minut which lead your heart away from god
the birkat haminim is a malediction on heretics
the belief that the curse was directed at christians was sometimes cause for persecution of jews
modern scholarship has generally evaluated that the birkat haminim probably did originally include jewish christians before christianity became markedly a gentile and in the eyes of the rabbinic sages idolatrous religion
in summarizing the talmudic statements concerning heretics in sanhedrin maimonides says
however abraham ben david in his critical notes objects to maimonides characterizing as heretics all those who attribute corporeality to god and he insinuates that the kabbalists are not heretics
in the same sense all biblical critics who like abraham ibn ezra in his notes on deuteronomy doubt or deny the mosaic authorship of every portion of the pentateuch would protest against the maimonidean or talmudic see sanh
a conception of heresy
the talmud states that the punishment for some kinds of heretic is to be lowered into a pit but not raised out of it meaning that there are types of people who may legitimately be killed
the jerusalem talmud states that there were at the time of the destruction of the temple no less than twenty four kinds of minim
maimonides wrote that it is a mitzvah however to eradicate jewish traitors minnim and apikorsim and to cause them to descend to the pit of destruction since they cause difficulty to the jews and sway the people away from god the heretic was excluded from a portion in the world to come he was consigned to gehenna to eternal punishment but the jewish courts of justice never attended to cases of heresy they were left to the judgment of the community
the sentiment against the heretic was much stronger than that against the pagan
while the pagan brought his offerings to the temple in jerusalem and the priests accepted them the sacrifices of the heretic were not accepted
the relatives of the heretic did not observe the laws of mourning after his death but donned festive garments and ate and drank and rejoiced
torah scrolls tefillin and mezuzot written by a heretic were burned and an animal slaughtered by a heretic was forbidden food
books written by heretics did not render the hands impure they might not be saved from fire on the sabbath
a heretic s testimony was not admitted in evidence in jewish courts and if an israelite found an object belonging to a heretic he was forbidden to return it to him
a jew who rejected jewish practice could receive a status similar to one who rejected jewish belief
the mumar le hachis one who transgresses out of spite for god as opposed to the mumar le teavon one who transgresses due to his inability to resist the temptation of illicit pleasure was placed by some of the rabbis in the same category as the minim
even if he habitually transgressed one law only for example if he defiantly violated one of the dietary laws out of spite for god he was not allowed to perform any religious function nor could he testify in a jewish court because if one denies one divinely ordinated law it is akin to his denial of its godly origin
one who violated the sabbath publicly or worshiped idols could not participate in the eruv chazerot nor could he write a bill of divorce
one who would not permit himself to be circumcised could not perform the ceremony on another
while the court could not compel the mumar to divorce his wife even though she demanded it they would compel him to support her and her children and to pay her an allowance until he agreed to a divorce
at his death those who are present need not tear their garments as they would by a fellow jew
the mumar who repented and desired readmittance into the jewish community was obliged to take a ritual immersion the same as the convert
if he claimed to be a good jew although he was alleged to have worshiped idols in another town he was believed when no benefit could have accrued to him from such a course
the definitions of heresy are sometimes different in certain orthodox jewish circles
some haredis consider many works of maimonides to be heretical due to his more liberal interpretations of the torah
that being said many orthodox jews also hold maimonides mishneh torah to a very high regard
a number of haredi jews consider the conservative reconstructionist and reform and open orthodoxy movements to be heretical due to the concessions and changes that they have made to traditional judaism and even smaller number of hasidic groups such as satmar and the neturei karta consider the state of israel to be a heretical institution
ultimately the majority of orthodox jews consider individual secular jews and those who drive on the sabbath eat non kosher foods and in other ways violate the ways of their ancestors as tinok shenishbim that are not responsible for their actions as opposed to heretics who purposefully and knowingly deny god
tinok shenishba hebrew literally captured infant among gentiles is a talmudical term for a jew who sins inadvertently due to having been raised without an appreciation for the judaism practiced by their distant and perhaps not so distant ancestors
as with most instances of talmudic terminology derived from a specific scenario but applied to wider metaphorical analogies an individual doesn t literally have to have been captured as an infant to fall within the definition of a tinok shenishba
this approach is widely held across orthodox judaism they are not accountable for their distance from complete jewish observance
that it applies to the many unaffiliated and unobservant jews in contemporary society is the basis for the various orthodox jewish outreach professionals and organizations even non professionals make efforts to draw them closer
