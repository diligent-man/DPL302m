arthur neville chamberlain frs t e mb rl n march november was a british politician of the conservative party who served as prime minister of the united kingdom from may to may
he is best known for his foreign policy of appeasement and in particular for his signing of the munich agreement on september ceding the german speaking sudetenland region of czechoslovakia to nazi germany led by adolf hitler
following the german invasion of poland on september which marked the beginning of the second world war chamberlain announced the declaration of war on germany two days later and led the united kingdom through the first eight months of the war until his resignation as prime minister on may
after working in business and local government and after a short spell as director of national service in and chamberlain followed his father joseph chamberlain and elder half brother austen chamberlain in becoming a member of parliament in the general election for the new birmingham ladywood division at the age of
he declined a junior ministerial position remaining a backbencher until
he was rapidly promoted in to minister of health and then chancellor of the exchequer
after a short lived labour led government he returned as minister of health introducing a range of reform measures from to
he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer in the national government in
chamberlain succeeded stanley baldwin as prime minister on may
his premiership was dominated by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive germany and his actions at munich were widely popular among the british at the time
in response to hitler s continued aggression chamberlain pledged the united kingdom to defend poland s independence if the latter were attacked an alliance that brought his country into war after the german invasion of poland
the failure of allied forces to prevent the german invasion of norway caused the house of commons to hold the historic norway debate in may
chamberlain s conduct of the war was heavily criticised by members of all parties and in a vote of confidence his government s majority was greatly reduced
accepting that a national government supported by all the main parties was essential chamberlain resigned the premiership because the labour and liberal parties would not serve under his leadership
although he still led the conservative party he was succeeded as prime minister by his colleague winston churchill
until ill health forced him to resign on september chamberlain was an important member of the war cabinet as lord president of the council heading the government in churchill s absence
chamberlain died aged on november of cancer six months after leaving the premiership
chamberlain s reputation remains controversial among historians the initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as guilty men published in july which blamed chamberlain and his associates for the munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war
most historians in the generation following chamberlain s death held similar views led by churchill in the gathering storm
some later historians have taken a more favourable perspective of chamberlain and his policies citing government papers released under the thirty year rule and arguing that going to war with germany in would have been disastrous as the uk was unprepared
nonetheless chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst british prime ministers
chamberlain was born on march in a house called southbourne in the edgbaston district of birmingham
he was the only son of the second marriage of joseph chamberlain who later became mayor of birmingham and a cabinet minister
his mother was florence kenrick a cousin of william kenrick mp she died when he was a small boy
joseph chamberlain had had another son austen chamberlain by his first marriage
the chamberlain family were unitarian though joseph lost personal religious faith by the time neville was six years old and never required religious adherence of his children
neville who disliked attending worship services of any kind and showed no interest in organized religion described himself as a unitarian with no stated faith and also a reverent agnostic
neville chamberlain was educated at home by his elder sister beatrice chamberlain and later at rugby school
joseph chamberlain then sent neville to mason college now university of birmingham
neville chamberlain had little interest in his studies there and in his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants
within six months he became a salaried employee
in an effort to recoup diminished family fortunes joseph chamberlain sent his younger son to establish a sisal plantation on andros island in the bahamas
neville chamberlain spent six years there but the plantation was a failure and joseph chamberlain lost
on his return to england neville chamberlain entered business purchasing with assistance from his family hoskins company a manufacturer of metal ship berths
chamberlain served as managing director of hoskins for years during which time the company prospered
he also involved himself in civic activities in birmingham
in as governor of birmingham general hospital and along with no more than fifteen other dignitaries chamberlain became a founding member of the national united hospitals committee of the british medical association
at forty chamberlain was expecting to remain a bachelor but in he fell in love with anne cole a recent connection by marriage and married her the following year
they met through his aunt lilian the canadian born widow of joseph chamberlain s brother herbert who in had married anne cole s uncle alfred clayton cole a director of the bank of england
she encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and was to be his constant companion helper and trusted colleague fully sharing his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as an mp
the couple had a son and a daughter
chamberlain initially showed little interest in politics though his father and half brother were in parliament
during the khaki election of he made speeches in support of joseph chamberlain s liberal unionists
the liberal unionists were allied with the conservatives and later merged with them under the name unionist party which in became known as the conservative and unionist party
in neville chamberlain successfully stood as a liberal unionist for birmingham city council for the all saints ward located within his father s parliamentary constituency
chamberlain was made chairman of the town planning committee
under his direction birmingham soon adopted one of the first town planning schemes in britain
the start of the first world war in prevented implementation of his plans
in chamberlain became lord mayor of birmingham
apart from his father joseph five of chamberlain s uncles had also attained the chief birmingham civic dignity they were joseph s brother richard chamberlain william and george kenrick charles beale who had been four times lord mayor and sir thomas martineau
as a lord mayor in wartime chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard
he halved the lord mayor s expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent
in chamberlain was appointed a member of the central control board on liquor traffic
in december prime minister david lloyd george offered chamberlain the new position of director of national service with responsibility for co ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces
his tenure was marked by conflict with lloyd george in august having received little support from the prime minister chamberlain resigned
the relationship between chamberlain and lloyd george would thereafter be one of mutual hatred
chamberlain decided to stand for the house of commons and was adopted as unionist candidate for birmingham ladywood
after the war ended a general election was called almost immediately
the campaign in this constituency was notable because his liberal party opponent was margery corbett ashby one of the seventeen women who stood for parliament at the first election at which women were eligible to do so
chamberlain reacted to this intervention by being one of the few male candidates to specifically target women voters deploying his wife issuing a special leaflet headed a word to the ladies and holding two meetings in the afternoon
chamberlain was elected with almost of the vote and a majority of
he was years old which remains to date the greatest age at which any future prime minister has first been elected to the commons
chamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work
he was chairman of the national unhealthy areas committee and in that role had visited the slums of london birmingham leeds liverpool and cardiff
consequently in march bonar law offered him a junior post at the ministry of health on behalf of the prime minister but chamberlain was unwilling to serve under lloyd george and was offered no further posts during lloyd george s premiership
when law resigned as party leader austen chamberlain took his place as head of the unionists in parliament
unionist leaders were willing to fight the election in coalition with the lloyd george liberals but on october unionist mps held a meeting at which they voted to fight the election as a single party
lloyd george resigned as did austen chamberlain and law was recalled from retirement to lead the unionists as prime minister
many high ranking unionists refused to serve under law to the benefit of chamberlain who rose over the course of ten months from backbencher to chancellor of the exchequer
law initially appointed chamberlain postmaster general and chamberlain was sworn of the privy council
when sir arthur griffith boscawen the minister of health lost his seat in the election and was defeated in a by election in march by future home secretary james chuter ede law offered the position to chamberlain
two months later law was diagnosed with advanced terminal throat cancer
he immediately resigned and was replaced by chancellor of the exchequer stanley baldwin
in august baldwin promoted chamberlain to the position of chancellor of the exchequer
chamberlain served only five months in the office before the conservatives were defeated in the general election
ramsay macdonald became the first labour prime minister but his government fell within months necessitating another general election
by a margin of only votes chamberlain narrowly defeated the labour candidate oswald mosley who later led the british union of fascists
believing he would lose if he stood again in birmingham ladywood chamberlain arranged to be adopted for birmingham edgbaston the district of the city where he was born and which was a much safer seat which he would hold for the rest of his life
the unionists won the election but chamberlain declined to serve again as chancellor preferring his former position as minister of health
within two weeks of his appointment as minister of health chamberlain presented the cabinet with an agenda containing pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted
before he left office in of the bills had passed into law
chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected poor law boards of guardians which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for rates
many of the boards were controlled by labour and such boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able bodied unemployed
in chamberlain initiated the local government act to abolish the poor law boards entirely
chamberlain spoke in the commons for two and a half hours on the second reading of the bill and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties
the bill passed into law
though chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the general strike in general he had poor relations with the labour opposition
future labour prime minister clement attlee complained that chamberlain always treated us like dirt and in april chamberlain wrote more and more do i feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity his poor relations with the labour party later played a major part in his downfall as prime minister
baldwin called a general election for may resulting in a hung parliament with labour holding the most seats
baldwin and his government resigned and labour under macdonald again took office
in the macdonald government faced a serious crisis as the may report revealed that the budget was unbalanced with an expected shortfall of million
the labour government resigned on august and macdonald formed a national government supported by most conservative mps
chamberlain once again returned to the ministry of health
after the general election in which supporters of the national government mostly conservatives won an overwhelming victory macdonald designated chamberlain as chancellor of the exchequer
chamberlain proposed a tariff on foreign goods and lower or no tariffs on goods from the colonies and the dominions
joseph chamberlain had advocated a similar policy imperial preference neville chamberlain laid his bill before the house of commons on february and concluded his address by noting the appropriateness of his seeking to enact his father s proposal
at the end of the speech sir austen chamberlain walked down from the backbenches and shook his brother s hand
the import duties act passed parliament easily
chamberlain presented his first budget in april
he maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed at the inception of the national government
interest on the war debt was a major cost
chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of britain s war debt from to
between and chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt
chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the united states could be negotiated
in june britain hosted the world monetary and economic conference which came to nothing as us president franklin d
roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation
by chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and reverse many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office
he told the commons we have now finished the story of bleak house and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of great expectations
the unemployed assistance board uab established by the unemployment act was largely chamberlain s creation and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument
moreover chamberlain saw the importance of providing some interest in life for the large numbers of men never likely to get work and out of this realisation was to come the responsibility of the uab for the welfare not merely the maintenance of the unemployed
defence spending had been heavily cut in chamberlain s early budgets
by faced with a resurgent germany under hitler s leadership see german re armament he was convinced of the need for rearmament
chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the royal air force realising that britain s historical bulwark the english channel was no defence against air power
in macdonald stood down as prime minister and baldwin became prime minister for the third time
in the general election the conservative dominated national government lost seats from its massive majority but still retained an overwhelming majority of in the house of commons
during the campaign deputy labour leader arthur greenwood had attacked chamberlain for spending money on rearmament saying that the rearmament policy was the merest scaremongering disgraceful in a statesman of mr chamberlain s responsible position to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments
chamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the abdication crisis
he wrote in his diary that wallis simpson edward viii s intended wife was an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the king but is exploiting him for her own purposes
she has already ruined him in money and jewels in common with the rest of the cabinet except duff cooper he agreed with baldwin that the king should abdicate if he married simpson and on december he and baldwin both stressed that the king should make his decision before christmas by one account he believed that the uncertainty was hurting the christmas trade
the king abdicated on december four days after the meeting
soon after the abdication baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after the coronation of king george vi and queen elizabeth
on may two weeks after the coronation baldwin resigned advising the king to send for chamberlain
austen did not live to see his brother s appointment as prime minister having died two months earlier
upon his appointment chamberlain considered calling a general election but with three and a half years remaining in the current parliament s term he decided to wait
at he was the second oldest person in the th century behind sir henry campbell bannerman to become prime minister for the first time and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the conservative party until the next election and then step down in favour of a younger man with foreign secretary anthony eden a likely candidate
from the start of chamberlain s premiership a number of would be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position
chamberlain had disliked what he considered to be the overly sentimental attitude of both baldwin and macdonald on cabinet appointments and reshuffles
although he had worked closely with the president of the board of trade walter runciman on the tariff issue chamberlain dismissed him from his post instead offering him the token position of lord privy seal which an angry runciman declined
chamberlain thought runciman a member of the liberal national party to be lazy
soon after taking office chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two year policy programmes
these reports were to be integrated with the intent of co ordinating the passage of legislation through the current parliament the term of which was to expire in november
at the time of his appointment chamberlain s personality was not well known to the public though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years
according to chamberlain biographer robert self these appeared relaxed and modern showing an ability to speak directly to the camera
chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues an attempt by his parliamentary private secretary lord dunglass later prime minister himself as alec douglas home to bring him to the commons smoking room to socialise with colleagues ended in embarrassing silence
chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated press management system employed by a prime minister up to that time with officials at number led by his chief of press george steward convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge and should espouse the government line
chamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions
one reason he sought the settlement of european issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs
soon after attaining the premiership chamberlain obtained passage of the factories act
this act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories and placed limits on the working hours of women and children
in parliament enacted the coal act which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits
another major law passed that year was the holidays with pay act
though the act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay it led to a great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for the working classes
the housing act provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance and maintained rent control
chamberlain s plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in
likewise the raising of the school leaving age to scheduled for implementation on september did not go into effect
relations between the united kingdom and the irish free state had been strained since the appointment of amon de valera as president of the executive council
the anglo irish trade war sparked by the withholding of money that ireland had agreed to pay the united kingdom had caused economic losses on both sides and the two nations were anxious for a settlement
the de valera government also sought to sever the remaining ties between ireland and the uk such as ending the king s status as irish head of state
as chancellor chamberlain had taken a hard line stance against concessions to the irish but as premier sought a settlement with ireland being persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other dominions
talks had been suspended under baldwin in but resumed in november
de valera sought not only to alter the constitutional status of ireland but to overturn other aspects of the anglo irish treaty most notably the issue of partition as well as obtaining full control of the three treaty ports which had remained in british control
britain on the other hand wished to retain the treaty ports at least in time of war and to obtain the money that ireland had agreed to pay
the irish proved very tough negotiators so much so that chamberlain complained that one of de valera s offers had presented united kingdom ministers with a three leafed shamrock none of the leaves of which had any advantages for the uk with the talks facing deadlock chamberlain made the irish a final offer in march which acceded to many irish positions though he was confident that he had only given up the small things and the agreements were signed on april
the issue of partition was not resolved but the irish agreed to pay million to the british
there was no provision in the treaties for british access to the treaty ports in time of war but chamberlain accepted de valera s oral assurance that in the event of war the british would have access
conservative backbencher winston churchill attacked the agreements in parliament for surrendering the treaty ports which he described as the sentinel towers of the western approaches
when war came de valera denied britain access to the treaty ports under irish neutrality
churchill railed against these treaties in the gathering storm stating that he never saw the house of commons more completely misled and that members were made to feel very differently about it when our existence hung in the balance during the battle of the atlantic chamberlain believed that the treaty ports were unusable if ireland was hostile and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with dublin
chamberlain sought to conciliate germany and make the nazi state a partner in a stable europe
he believed germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of its colonies and during the rhineland crisis of march he had stated that if we were in sight of an all round settlement the british government ought to consider the question of restoration of colonies
the new prime minister s attempts to secure such a settlement were frustrated because germany was in no hurry to talk to britain
foreign minister konstantin von neurath was supposed to visit britain in july but cancelled his visit
lord halifax the lord president of the council visited germany privately in november and met hitler and other german officials
both chamberlain and british ambassador to germany nevile henderson pronounced the visit a success
foreign office officials complained that the halifax visit made it appear britain was too eager for talks and the foreign secretary anthony eden felt that he had been bypassed
chamberlain also bypassed eden while the latter was on holiday by opening direct talks with italy an international pariah for its invasion and conquest of ethiopia
at a cabinet meeting on september chamberlain indicated that he saw the lessening of the tension between this country and italy as a very valuable contribution toward the pacification and appeasement of europe which would weaken the rome berlin axis chamberlain also set up a private line of communication with the italian duce benito mussolini through the italian ambassador count dino grandi
in february hitler began to press the austrian government to accept anschlu or union between germany and austria
chamberlain believed that it was essential to cement relations with italy in the hope that an anglo italian alliance would forestall hitler from imposing his rule over austria
eden believed that chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with italy and holding out the prospect of de jure recognition of italy s conquest of ethiopia
chamberlain concluded that eden would have to accept his policy or resign
the cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for chamberlain and despite efforts by other cabinet members to prevent it eden resigned from office
in later years eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement churchill described him in the second world war as one strong young figure standing up against long dismal drawling tides of drift and surrender but many ministers and mps believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation
chamberlain appointed lord halifax as foreign secretary in eden s place
in march austria became a part of germany in the anschluss
though the beleaguered austrians requested help from britain none was forthcoming
britain did send berlin a strong note of protest
in addressing the cabinet shortly after german forces crossed the border chamberlain placed blame on both germany and austria
chamberlain noted
on march the day after the anschluss chamberlain addressed the house of commons and strongly condemned the methods used by the germans in the takeover of austria
chamberlain s address met with the approval of the house
with austria absorbed by germany attention turned to hitler s obvious next target the sudetenland region of czechoslovakia
with three million ethnic germans the sudetenland represented the largest german population outside the reich and hitler began to call for the union of the region with germany
britain had no military obligations toward czechoslovakia but france and czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact and both the french and czechoslovaks also had an alliance with the soviet union
after the fall of austria the cabinet s foreign policy committee considered seeking a grand alliance to thwart germany or alternatively an assurance to france of assistance if the french went to war
instead the committee chose to advocate that czechoslovakia be urged to make the best terms it could with germany
the full cabinet agreed with the committee s recommendation influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that britain could do to help the czechs in the event of a german invasion
chamberlain reported to an amenable house that he was unwilling to limit his government s discretion by giving commitments
britain and italy signed an agreement on april
in exchange for de jure recognition of italy s ethiopian conquest italy agreed to withdraw some italian volunteers from the nationalist pro franco side of the spanish civil war
by this point the nationalists strongly had the upper hand in that conflict and they completed their victory the following year
later that month the new french prime minister douard daladier came to london for talks with chamberlain and agreed to follow the british position on czechoslovakia
in may czech border guards shot two sudeten german farmers who were trying to cross the border from germany into czechoslovakia without stopping for border controls
this incident caused unrest among the sudeten germans and germany was then said to be moving troops to the border
in response to the report prague moved troops to the german border
halifax sent a note to germany warning that if france intervened in the crisis on czechoslovakia s behalf britain might support france
tensions appeared to calm and chamberlain and halifax were applauded for their masterly handling of the crisis
though it was not known at the time it later became clear that germany had had no plans for a may invasion of czechoslovakia
nonetheless the chamberlain government received strong and almost unanimous support from the british press
negotiations between the czech government and the sudeten germans dragged on through mid
they achieved little result sudeten leader konrad henlein was under private instructions from hitler not to reach an agreement
on august walter runciman by now lord runciman travelled to prague as a mediator sent by the british government
over the next two weeks runciman met separately with henlein czechoslovak president edvard bene and other leaders but made no progress
on august
chamberlain met his cabinet and ambassador henderson and secured their backing with only first lord of the admiralty duff cooper dissenting against chamberlain s policy to pressure czechoslovakia into making concessions on the ground that britain was then in no position to back up any threat to go to war
chamberlain realised that hitler would likely signal his intentions in his september speech at the annual nuremberg rally and so he discussed with his advisors how to respond if war seemed likely
in consultation with his close advisor sir horace wilson chamberlain set out plan z
if war seemed inevitable chamberlain would fly to germany to negotiate directly with hitler
lord runciman continued his work attempting to pressure the czechoslovak government into concessions
on september there was an altercation involving sudeten members of the czechoslovak parliament in the north moravian city of ostrava m hrisch ostrau in german
the germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident though the prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing czech police who had been involved
as the tempest grew runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after hitler s speech
the mission never resumed
there was tremendous tension in the final days before hitler s speech on the last day of the rally as britain france and czechoslovakia all partially mobilised their troops
thousands gathered outside downing street on the night of the speech
at last hitler addressed his wildly enthusiastic followers
the following morning september chamberlain and the cabinet were informed by secret service sources that all german embassies had been told that germany would invade czechoslovakia on september
convinced that the french would not fight daladier was privately proposing a three power summit to settle the sudeten question chamberlain decided to implement plan z and sent a message to hitler that he was willing to come to germany to negotiate
hitler accepted and chamberlain flew to germany on the morning of september this was the first time excepting a short jaunt at an industrial fair that chamberlain had ever flown
chamberlain flew to munich and then travelled by rail to hitler s retreat at berchtesgaden
the face to face meeting lasted about three hours
hitler demanded the annexation of the sudetenland and through questioning him chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that hitler had no designs on the remainder of czechoslovakia or on the areas in eastern europe which had german minorities
after the meeting chamberlain returned to london believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved
under the proposals made at berchtesgaden the sudetenland would be annexed by germany if a plebiscite in the sudetenland favoured it
czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations principally the french pledge to the czechoslovaks
the french agreed to the requirements
under considerable pressure the czechoslovaks also agreed causing the czechoslovak government to fall
chamberlain flew back to germany meeting hitler in bad godesberg on september
hitler brushed aside the proposals of the previous meeting saying that won t do any more
hitler demanded immediate occupation of the sudetenland and that polish and hungarian territorial claims on czechoslovakia be addressed
chamberlain objected strenuously telling hitler that he had worked to bring the french and czechoslovaks into line with germany s demands so much so that he had been accused of giving in to dictators and had been booed on his departure that morning
hitler was unmoved
that evening chamberlain told lord halifax that the meeting with herr hitler had been most unsatisfactory
the following day hitler kept chamberlain waiting until mid afternoon when he sent a five page letter in german outlining the demands he had made orally the previous day
chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with the czechoslovaks and suggested that hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to the french and czechoslovaks
the leaders met again late on the evening of september a meeting which stretched into the early morning hours
hitler demanded that fleeing czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them
he extended his deadline for occupation of the sudetenland to october the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of czechoslovakia
the meeting ended amicably with chamberlain confiding to hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in europe in the same spirit
hitler hinted that the sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in europe
chamberlain flew back to london saying it is up to the czechs now
hitler s proposals met with resistance not only from the french and czechoslovaks but also from some members of chamberlain s cabinet
with no agreement in sight war seemed inevitable
chamberlain issued a press statement calling on germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for british help in obtaining the concessions it sought
on the evening of september chamberlain addressed the nation by radio and after thanking those who wrote to him stated
on september chamberlain called on hitler to invite him to germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving the british french germans and italians
hitler replied favourably and word of this response came to chamberlain as he was winding up a speech in the house of commons which sat in gloomy anticipation of war
chamberlain informed the house of this in his speech
the response was a passionate demonstration with members cheering chamberlain wildly
even diplomats in the galleries applauded
lord dunglass later commented there were a lot of appeasers in parliament that day
on the morning of september chamberlain left heston aerodrome to the east of today s heathrow airport for his third and final visit to germany
on arrival in munich the british delegation was taken directly to the f hrerbau where daladier mussolini and hitler soon arrived
the four leaders and their translators held an informal meeting hitler said that he intended to invade czechoslovakia on october
mussolini distributed a proposal similar to hitler s bad godesberg terms
in reality the proposal had been drafted by german officials and transmitted to rome the previous day
the four leaders debated the draft and chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the czechoslovak government and citizens but hitler refused to consider this
the leaders were joined by advisors after lunch and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the italian draft agreement
late that evening the british and french left for their hotels saying that they had to seek advice from their respective capitals
meanwhile the germans and italians enjoyed the feast which hitler had intended for all the participants
during this break chamberlain advisor sir horace wilson met with the czechoslovaks he informed them of the draft agreement and asked which districts were particularly important to them
the conference resumed at about pm and was mostly in the hands of a small drafting committee
at am the munich agreement was ready for signing though the signing ceremony was delayed when hitler discovered that the ornate inkwell on his desk was empty
chamberlain and daladier returned to their hotel and informed the czechoslovaks of the agreement
the two prime ministers urged quick acceptance by the czechoslovaks of the agreement since the evacuation by the czechs was to begin the following day
at pm the czechoslovak government in prague objected to the decision but agreed to its terms
before leaving the f hrerbau chamberlain requested a private conference with hitler
hitler agreed and the two met at hitler s apartment in the city later that morning
chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the germans not bomb prague if the czechs resisted to which hitler seemed agreeable
chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed anglo german agreement which contained three paragraphs including a statement that the two nations considered the munich agreement symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again according to chamberlain hitler interjected ja ja yes yes
the two men signed the paper then and there
when later that day german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop remonstrated with hitler for signing it the f hrer replied oh don t take it so seriously
that piece of paper is of no further significance whatever chamberlain on the other hand patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said i ve got it word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before chamberlain s return causing delight among many in london but gloom for churchill and his supporters
chamberlain returned to london in triumph
large crowds mobbed heston where he was met by the lord chamberlain the earl of clarendon who gave him a letter from king george vi assuring him of the empire s lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to buckingham palace to report
the streets were so packed with cheering people that it took chamberlain an hour and a half to journey the nine miles km from heston to the palace
after reporting to the king chamberlain and his wife appeared on the palace balcony with the king and queen
he then went to downing street both the street and the front hall of number were packed
as he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first floor window someone called to him neville go up to the window and say peace for our time chamberlain turned around and responded no i don t do that sort of thing nevertheless in his statement to the crowd chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor benjamin disraeli upon the latter s return from the congress of berlin
king george issued a statement to his people after the magnificent efforts of the prime minister in the cause of peace it is my fervent hope that a new era of friendship and prosperity may be dawning among the peoples of the world when the king met duff cooper who resigned as first lord of the admiralty over the munich agreement he told cooper that he respected people who had the courage of their convictions but could not agree with him
he wrote to his mother queen mary that the prime minister was delighted with the results of his mission as are we all she responded to her son with anger against those who spoke against chamberlain he brought home peace why can t they be grateful most newspapers supported chamberlain uncritically and he received thousands of gifts from a silver dinner service to many of his trademark umbrellas
the commons discussed the munich agreement on october
though cooper opened by setting forth the reasons for his resignation and churchill spoke harshly against the pact no conservative voted against the government
only between and abstained including churchill eden cooper and harold macmillan
in the aftermath of munich chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament
he told the cabinet in early october i t would be madness for the country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way
for the time being therefore we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good later in october he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing convinced that such an action would show hitler that chamberlain had decided to abandon munich
chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with hitler at munich would lead toward a general settlement of european disputes but hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord
having considered a general election immediately following munich chamberlain instead reshuffled his cabinet
by the end of the year public concerns caused chamberlain to conclude that to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled house of commons by a general election would be suicidal
despite hitler s relative quietness as the reich absorbed the sudetenland foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy chamberlain
he made trips to paris and rome hoping to persuade the french to hasten their rearmament and mussolini to be a positive influence on hitler
several of his cabinet members led by foreign secretary lord halifax began to draw away from the appeasement policy
halifax was by now convinced that munich though better than a european war had been a horrid business and humiliating
public revulsion over the pogrom of kristallnacht on november made any attempt at a rapprochement with hitler unacceptable though chamberlain did not abandon his hopes
still hoping for reconciliation with germany chamberlain made a major speech in birmingham on january in which he expressed his desire for international peace and had an advance copy sent to hitler at berchtesgaden
hitler seemed to respond in his reichstag speech on january he stated that he wanted a long peace
chamberlain was confident that improvements in british defence since munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table
this belief was reinforced by a german official s conciliatory speech welcoming ambassador henderson back to berlin after an absence for medical treatment in britain
chamberlain responded with a speech in blackburn on february hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade and was gratified when his comments were printed in german newspapers
with matters appearing to improve chamberlain s rule over the house of commons was firm and he was convinced the government would romp home in a late election
on march germany invaded the czech provinces of bohemia and moravia including prague
though chamberlain s initial parliamentary response was according to biographer nick smart feeble within hours he had spoken more forcefully against the german aggression
in another birmingham speech on march chamberlain warned that hitler was attempting to dominate the world by force and that no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made the prime minister questioned whether the invasion of czechoslovakia was the end of an old adventure or the beginning of a new and whether it was a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force colonial secretary malcolm macdonald said whereas the prime minister was once a strong advocate of peace he has now definitely swung around to the war point of view this speech was met with widespread approval in britain and recruitment for the armed services increased considerably
chamberlain set out to build an interlocking series of defence pacts among the remaining european countries as a means of deterring hitler from war
he sought an agreement among britain france the ussr and poland whereby the first three would go to the assistance of poland if her independence were threatened but polish mistrust of the soviet union caused those negotiations to fail
instead on march chamberlain informed an approving house of commons of british and french guarantees that they would lend poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened polish independence
in the ensuing debate eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government
even churchill and lloyd george praised chamberlain s government for issuing the guarantee to poland
the prime minister took other steps to deter hitler from aggression
he doubled the size of the territorial army created a ministry of supply to expedite the provision of equipment to the armed forces and instituted peacetime conscription
the italian invasion of albania on april led to guarantees being given to greece and romania
on june handley page received an order for hampden twin engined medium bombers and by september the chain of radar stations girding the british coast was fully operational
chamberlain was reluctant to seek a military alliance with the soviet union he distrusted joseph stalin ideologically and felt that there was little to gain given the recent massive purges in the red army
much of his cabinet favoured such an alliance and when poland withdrew her objection to an anglo soviet alliance chamberlain had little choice but to proceed
the talks with soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov to which britain sent only a low level delegation dragged on over several months and eventually foundered on august when poland and romania refused to allow soviet troops to be stationed on their territories
a week after the failure of these talks the soviet union and germany signed the molotov ribbentrop pact committing the countries to non aggression toward each other
a secret agreement divided up poland in the event of war
chamberlain had disregarded rumours of a soviet german rapprochement and was dismissive of the publicly announced pact stating that it in no way affected british obligations toward poland
on august chamberlain had henderson deliver a letter to hitler telling him that britain was fully prepared to comply with its obligations to poland
hitler instructed his generals to prepare for an invasion of poland telling them our enemies are small worms
i saw them at munich
germany invaded poland in the early morning of september
the british cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to germany that unless it withdrew from polish territory the uk would carry out its obligations to poland
when the house of commons met at pm chamberlain and labour deputy leader arthur greenwood deputising for the sick clement attlee entered the chamber to loud cheers
chamberlain spoke emotionally laying the blame for the conflict on hitler
no formal declaration of war was immediately made
french foreign minister georges bonnet stated that france could do nothing until its parliament met on the evening of september
bonnet was trying to rally support for a munich style summit proposed by the italians to be held on september
the british cabinet demanded that hitler be given an ultimatum at once and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of september that war be declared forthwith
chamberlain and halifax were convinced by bonnet s pleas from paris that france needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation and postponed the expiry of the ultimatum which had in fact not yet been served
chamberlain s lengthy statement to the house of commons made no mention of an ultimatum and the house received it badly
when greenwood rose to speak for the working classes conservative backbencher and former first lord of the admiralty leo amery shouted speak for england arthur implying that the prime minister was not doing so
chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with paris and tried to dispel fears that the french were weakening
he had little success too many members knew of bonnet s efforts
national labour mp and diarist harold nicolson later wrote in those few minutes he flung away his reputation the seeming delay gave rise to fears that chamberlain would again seek a settlement with hitler
chamberlain s last peacetime cabinet met at that night with a thunderstorm raging outside and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in berlin at nine o clock the following morning to expire two hours later before the house of commons convened at noon
at am september chamberlain addressed the nation by radio stating that the united kingdom was at war with germany
that afternoon chamberlain addressed the house of commons first sunday session in over years
he spoke to a quiet house in a statement which even opponents termed restrained and therefore effective
chamberlain instituted a war cabinet and invited the labour and liberal parties to join his government but they declined
he restored churchill to the cabinet as first lord of the admiralty with a seat in the war cabinet
chamberlain also gave eden a government post dominions secretary but not a seat in the small war cabinet
the new first lord proved to be a difficult cabinet colleague deluging the prime minister with a sea of lengthy memos
chamberlain castigated churchill for sending so many memos as the two met in war cabinet every day
chamberlain suspected correctly as it proved after the war that these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the book that he will write hereafter chamberlain was also able to deter some of churchill s more extreme plans such as operation catherine which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the baltic sea with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to germany
with the naval war the only significant front involving the british in the early months of the conflict the first lord s obvious desire to wage a ruthless victorious war established him as a leader in waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues
with little land action in the west the initial months of the war were dubbed the bore war later renamed the phoney war by journalists
chamberlain in common with most allied officials and generals felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament
the prime minister was reluctant to go too far in altering the british economy
the government submitted an emergency war budget about which chamberlain stated the only thing that matters is to win the war though we may go bankrupt in the process government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between september and march
despite these difficulties chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as and almost in april
in early the allies approved a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of norway a neutral country including the key port of narvik and possibly also to seize the iron mines at g llivare in northern sweden from which germany obtained much of its iron ore
as the baltic froze in winter the iron ore was then sent south by ship from narvik
the allies planned to begin by mining norwegian waters thus provoking a german reaction in norway and then would occupy much of the country
unforeseen by the allies germany had also planned to occupy norway and on april german troops occupied denmark and began an invasion of norway
german forces quickly overran much of the country
the allies sent troops to norway but they met with little success and on april the war cabinet ordered a withdrawal
the prime minister s opponents decided to turn the adjournment debate for the whitsun recess into a challenge to chamberlain who soon heard about the plan
after initial anger chamberlain determined to fight
what became known as the norway debate opened on may and lasted for two days
the initial speeches including chamberlain s were nondescript but admiral of the fleet sir roger keyes member for portsmouth north in full uniform delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the norway campaign though he excluded churchill from criticism
leo amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing oliver cromwell s words on dissolving the long parliament you have sat here too long for any good you are doing
depart i say and let us have done with you
in the name of god go when labour announced that they would call for a division of the house of commons chamberlain called upon his friends and i still have some friends in this house to support the government tonight because the use of the word friends was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues and according to biographer robert self many mps took it that way it was an error of judgment for chamberlain to refer to party loyalty when the gravity of the war situation required national unity lloyd george joined the attackers and churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government
when the division took place the government which had a normal majority of over prevailed by only with mps in receipt of the government whip voting against it with between and abstaining
chamberlain spent much of may in meetings with his cabinet colleagues
many conservative mps even those who had voted against the government indicated on may and in the days following that they did not wish chamberlain to depart but rather would seek to reconstruct his government
chamberlain decided that he would resign unless the labour party was willing to join his government and so he met with attlee later that day
attlee was unwilling but agreed to consult his national executive then meeting in bournemouth
chamberlain favoured halifax as the next prime minister but halifax proved reluctant to press his own claims thinking that his position in the house of lords would limit his effectiveness in the house of commons and churchill emerged as the choice
the following day germany invaded the low countries and chamberlain considered remaining in office
attlee confirmed that labour would not serve under chamberlain though they were willing to serve under someone else
accordingly chamberlain went to buckingham palace to resign and advise the king to send for churchill
churchill later expressed gratitude to chamberlain for not advising the king to send for halifax who would have commanded the support of most government mps
in a resignation broadcast that evening chamberlain told the nation
queen elizabeth told chamberlain that her daughter princess elizabeth wept as she heard the broadcast
churchill wrote to express his gratitude for chamberlain s willingness to stand by him in the nation s hour of need and baldwin the only living former prime minister besides chamberlain and lloyd george wrote you have passed through fire since we were talking together only a fortnight ago and you have come out pure gold
in a departure from usual practice chamberlain did not issue any resignation honours list
with chamberlain remaining leader of the conservative party and with many mps still supporting him and distrusting the new prime minister churchill refrained from any purge of chamberlain loyalists
churchill wished chamberlain to return to the exchequer but he declined convinced that this would lead to difficulties with the labour party
instead he accepted the post of lord president of the council with a seat in the shrunken five member war cabinet
when chamberlain entered the house of commons on may for the first time since his resignation mps lost their heads they shouted they cheered they waved their order papers and his reception was a regular ovation the house received churchill coolly some of his great speeches to the chamber such as we shall fight on the beaches met with only half hearted enthusiasm
chamberlain s fall from power left him deeply depressed he wrote few men can have known such a reversal of fortune in so short a time he especially regretted the loss of chequers as a place where i have been so happy though after a farewell visit there by the chamberlains on june he wrote i am content now that i have done that and shall put chequers out of my mind as lord president chamberlain assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the war cabinet during churchill s many absences
attlee later remembered him as free from any of the rancour he might have felt against us
he worked very hard and well a good chairman a good committeeman always very businesslike as chairman of the lord president s committee he exerted great influence over the wartime economy
halifax reported to the war cabinet on may with the low countries conquered and french prime minister paul reynaud warning that france might have to sign an armistice that diplomatic contacts with a still neutral italy offered the possibility of a negotiated peace
halifax urged following up and seeing if a worthwhile offer could be obtained
the battle over the course of action within the war cabinet lasted three days chamberlain s statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the matter should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the war cabinet to reject negotiations
twice in may churchill broached the subject of bringing lloyd george into the government
each time chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if lloyd george were appointed a minister
churchill did not appoint lloyd george but brought up the subject with chamberlain again early in june
this time chamberlain agreed to lloyd george s appointment provided lloyd george gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud
lloyd george declined to serve in churchill s government
chamberlain worked to bring his conservative party in line behind churchill working with the chief whip david margesson to overcome members suspicions and dislikes of the prime minister
on july after the british attack on the french fleet churchill entered the chamber to a great cheer from conservative mps orchestrated by the two and the prime minister was almost overcome with emotion at the first cheer he had received from his own party s benches since may
churchill returned the loyalty refusing to consider labour and liberal attempts to expel chamberlain from the government
when criticisms of chamberlain appeared in the press and when chamberlain learned that labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of parliament as a platform to attack him he told churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking labour
the prime minister intervened with the labour party and the press and the criticism ceased according to chamberlain like turning off a tap
in july a polemic titled guilty men was released by cato a pseudonym for three journalists future labour leader michael foot former liberal mp frank owen and the conservative peter howard
it attacked the record of the national government alleging that it had failed to prepare adequately for war
it called for the removal of chamberlain and other ministers who had allegedly contributed to the british disasters of the early part of the war
the short book sold more than copies many of which were passed from hand to hand and went into editions in the first few months despite not being carried by several major bookshops
according to historian david dutton its impact upon chamberlain s reputation both among the general public and within the academic world was profound indeed
chamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health except for occasional attacks of gout but by july he was in almost constant pain
he sought treatment and later that month entered hospital for surgery
surgeons discovered that he was suffering from terminal bowel cancer but they concealed it from him instead telling him that he would not require further surgery
chamberlain resumed work in mid august
he returned to his office on september but renewed pain compounded by the night time bombing of london which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest sapped his energy and he left london for the last time on september returning to highfield park in heckfield
chamberlain offered his resignation to churchill on september
the prime minister was initially reluctant to accept but as both men realised that chamberlain would never return to work churchill finally allowed him to resign
the prime minister asked if chamberlain would accept the highest order of british chivalry the order of the garter of which his brother had been a member
chamberlain refused saying he would prefer to die plain mr chamberlain like my father before me unadorned by any title
in the short time remaining to him chamberlain was angered by the short cold and for the most part depreciatory press comments on his retirement according to him written without the slightest sign of sympathy for the man or even any comprehension that there may be a human tragedy in the background the king and queen drove down from windsor to visit the dying man on october
chamberlain received hundreds of sympathetic letters from friends and supporters
he wrote to john simon who had served as chancellor of the exchequer in chamberlain s government
chamberlain died of bowel cancer on november at the age of
a funeral service took place at westminster abbey five days later on thursday november
however due to wartime security concerns the date and time were not widely publicised
chamberlain s former private secretary john colville functioned as the service s usher whilst both winston churchill and lord halifax acted as pallbearers
after cremation his ashes were interred in the abbey next to those of bonar law
churchill eulogised chamberlain in the house of commons three days after his death although some chamberlain supporters found churchill s oratory to be faint praise of the late prime minister churchill added less publicly whatever shall i do without poor neville i was relying on him to look after the home front for me amongst others who paid tribute to chamberlain in the commons and in the house of lords on november were foreign secretary lord halifax st earl of halifax edward wood the leader of the labour party clement attlee and the liberal party leader and air minister sir archibald sinclair
david lloyd george the only former prime minister remaining in the commons had been expected to speak but absented himself from the proceedings
ever close to his family the executors of chamberlain s will were his cousins wilfred byng kenrick and sir wilfrid martineau both of whom like chamberlain were lord mayors of birmingham
a few days before his death neville chamberlain wrote
guilty men was not the only second world war tract that damaged chamberlain s reputation
we were not all wrong published in took a similar tack to guilty men arguing that liberal and labour mps and a small number of conservatives had fought against chamberlain s appeasement policies
the author liberal mp geoffrey mander had voted against conscription in
another polemic against conservative policies was why not trust the tories written by gracchus who was later revealed to be future labour minister aneurin bevan which castigated the conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of baldwin and chamberlain
though a few conservatives offered their own versions of events most notably mp quintin hogg in his the left was never right by the end of the war there was a very strong public belief that chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgements that had nearly caused britain s defeat
chamberlain s reputation was devastated by these attacks from the left
in with the publication of the gathering storm the first volume of churchill s six volume set the second world war chamberlain sustained an even more serious assault from the right
while churchill stated privately this is not history this is my case his series was still hugely influential
churchill depicted chamberlain as well meaning but weak blind to the threat posed by hitler and oblivious to the fact that according to churchill hitler could have been removed from power by a grand coalition of european states
churchill suggested that the year s delay between munich and war worsened britain s position and criticised chamberlain for both peacetime and wartime decisions
in the years following the publication of churchill s books few historians questioned his judgment
anne chamberlain the former premier s widow suggested that churchill s work was filled with matters that are not real misstatements that could easily be corrected but wholesale omissions and assumptions that certain things are now recognised as facts which actually have no such position
many of chamberlain s family letters and his extensive personal papers were bequeathed by his family in to the birmingham university archives
during the war the chamberlain family had commissioned historian keith feiling to produce an official biography and gave him access to chamberlain s private diaries and papers
while feiling had the right of access to official papers as the official biographer of a recently deceased person he may not have been aware of the provision and the cabinet secretary denied his requests for access
though feiling produced what historian david dutton described in as the most impressive and persuasive single volume biography of chamberlain completed during the war and published in he could not repair the damage already done to chamberlain s reputation
conservative mp iain macleod s biography of chamberlain was the first major biography of a revisionist school of thought on chamberlain
the same year a
taylor in his the origins of the second world war found that chamberlain had adequately rearmed britain for defence though a rearmament designed to defeat germany would have taken massive additional resources and described munich as a triumph for all that was best and most enlightened in british life
and for those who had courageously denounced the harshness and short sightedness of versailles
the adoption of the thirty year rule in made available many of the papers of the chamberlain government over the subsequent three years helping to explain why chamberlain acted as he did
the resultant works greatly fuelled the revisionist school although they also included books that strongly criticised chamberlain such as keith middlemas s diplomacy of illusion which portrayed chamberlain as a seasoned politician with strategic blindness when it came to germany
released papers indicated that contrary to claims made in guilty men chamberlain had neither ignored the advice of the foreign office nor had he disregarded and run roughshod over his cabinet
other released papers showed that chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst european governments like that later advocated by churchill but had rejected it on the ground that the division of europe into two camps would make war more not less likely
they also showed that chamberlain had been advised that the dominions pursuing independent foreign policies under the statute of westminster had indicated that chamberlain could not depend on their help in the event of a continental war
the chiefs of staff report which indicated that britain could not forcibly prevent germany from conquering czechoslovakia was first publicly known at this time
in reaction to the revisionist school of thought regarding chamberlain a post revisionist school emerged beginning in the s using the released papers to justify the initial conclusions of guilty men
oxford historian r
parker argued that chamberlain could have forged a close alliance with france after the anschluss in early and begun a policy of containment of germany under the auspices of the league of nations
while many revisionist writers had suggested that chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions parker argued that chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies
in his two volumes chamberlain and appeasement and churchill and appeasement parker stated that chamberlain due to his powerful obstinate personality and his skill in debate caused britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence
parker also suggested that had churchill held high office in the second half of the s churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred hitler and perhaps would have caused hitler s domestic opponents to procure his removal
in british historian alan allport concludes neville chamberlain was
vain mean casually bigoted boring ungrateful spiteful obstinate and friendless
egotistical but also insecure and thin skinned he cultivated close relations with the fleet street barons and lobby correspondents and gloried in favourable newspaper reports about himself yet complained bitterly that the press was always attacking him dutton observes that chamberlain s reputation for good or ill will probably always be closely tied to evaluation of his policy toward germany
