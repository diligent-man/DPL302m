tez was a mobile payments service by google targeted at users in india later folded into the new google pay app on august
it operated atop the unified payments interface developed by the national payments corporation of india
tez worked on the vast majority of india s smartphones with apps for both android and ios with the android app supporting english hindi tamil bengali gujarati kannada marathi and telugu
there were plans to release the app in other emerging countries including vietnam indonesia and thailand
tez is the hindi word for fast
within days after being launched tez got about million installations
over million transactions were made on the app as of october
tez is currently accepted by pvr cinemas redbus mcdonald s act broadband state government electricity boards and is expected to be joined by a number of other businesses like dish tv jet airways and domino s vi voda idea swiggy zomato uber ola clubfactory zappfresh amazon flipkart and many more businesses
google is also working with existing advertisers and online e commerce platforms like shopify and payment aggregators like billdesk and payu
google also plans to add even more ways to pay on tez e g credit cards and wallets
select phones from manufacturer partners lava nokia mobile and panasonic will come in with tez preinstalled
the app is compatible with the vast majority of android and ios devices
the application does not require users to share any personal information such as mobile numbers or usernames like other payment applications
instead it uses audio qr codes that rely on sound transmitted at a frequency inaudible to the human ear from the payee handset to the merchant handset
this technology does away with the need for nfc chips on the handsets giving it an advantage because a significant number of smartphones in india and other developing markets do not have nfc chips embedded
