prescribed nausea vomiting due motion sickness source chemotherapy vertigo mnire's disease
cinnarizine wa first synthesized r janssen pharmaceutica in
nonproprietary name derived cinnamyl substituent one nitrogen atom combined generic ending rizine antihistaminicscerebral peripheral vasodilators
ha also cited one used drug seasickness within british royal navy
cinnarizine predominantly used treat nausea vomiting associated motion sickness vertigo mnire's disease cogan's syndrome
fact one select drug ha shown beneficial effect chronic treatment vertigo tinnitus associated meniere's disease
however due increased level drowsiness caused medication generally limited use pilot aircrew must dependably alert
clinical study n treatment cinnarizine reduced occurrence moderate vertigo experience extreme vertigo by
act interfering signal transmission vestibular apparatus inner ear vomiting centre hypothalamus limiting activity vestibular hair cell send signal movement
disparity signal processing inner ear motion receptor visual sens abolished confusion brain whether individual moving standing reduced
vomiting motion sickness could physiological compensatory mechanism brain keep individual moving adjust signal perception true evolutionary reason malady currently unknown
prescribed balance problem vertigo cinnarizine typically taken two three time daily depending amount dose used treat motion sickness pill taken least two hour travelling every four hour travel
however recent study comparing effect cinnarizine transdermal scopolamine treatment seasickness concluded scopolamine wa reported significantly effective fewer adverse side effect cinnarizine
led conclusion transdermal scopolamine likely better option treatment motion sickness naval crew sea travelers
beyond anti-vertigo treatment cinnarizine could also viewed nootropic drug vasorelaxating ability due calcium channel blockade happen mostly brain fact also used labyrinthine sedative
cinnarizine inhibits flow calcium red blood cell increase elasticity cell wall thereby increasing flexibility making blood le viscous
allows blood travel efficiently effectively narrowed vessel order bring oxygen damaged tissue
also effectively combined nootropics primarily piracetam combination drug potentiates boosting brain oxygen supply
animal study comparing effectiveness cinnarizine flunarizine derivative cinnarizine time stronger treatment transient global cerebral ischemia wa found cinnarizine helped improve functional abnormality ischemia help damage neurons
flunarizine hand offered neuronal protection wa le effective treating subsequent behavioral changes
additionally cinnarizine used scuba diver without increased risk central nervous system oxygen toxicity result seizure high risk closed-circuit oxygen diving
also relevant diver could potentially undergo hypobaric decompression therapy us high oxygen pressure could also affected cinnarizine-induced cns oxygen toxicity risk
however cinnarizine doe heighten toxicity risk fact evidence even seems suggest cinnarizine may beneficial helping delay toxicity central nervous system
also evidence cinnarizine may used effective anti-asthma medication taken regularly
cinnarizine ha also found valuable second-line treatment idiopathic urticarial vasculitis
side effect experienced taking cinnarizine range mild quite severe
possible side effect include drowsiness sweating dry mouth headache skin problem lethargy gastrointestinal irritation hypersensitivity reaction well movement problemsmuscle rigidity tremor
cinnarizine cause drowsiness blurred vision important user make sure reaction normal driving operating machinery job could dangerous fully alert able see well
cinnarizine also known cause acute chronic parkinsonism due affinity receptor strongly counter-suggests actual usefulness improving neurohealth
cinnarizine's antagonistic effect dopamine receptor striatum lead symptom depression tremor muscle rigidity tardive dyskinesia akathisia characterized drug-induced parkinson's disease second leading cause parkinson's
evidence suggests one metabolite cinnarizine c- ha active role contributing development drug-induced parkinson's
also note estimated new parkinson's case linked administration either cinnarizine flunarizine making cinnarizine drug-induced parkinson's serious issue
people especially risk elderly patient particular woman patient taking drug longer amount time
also evidence suggests patient family history parkinson's genetic predisposition disease likely develop drug induced form disease result cinnarizine treatment
addition antagonizing receptor treatment cinnarizine ha also shown lead reduced presynaptic dopamine serotonin well alteration vesicular transport dopamine
shown chronic treatment cinnarizine build drug concentration high enough interfere proton electrochemical gradient necessary packaging dopamine vesicles
cinnarizine pka act protonophore prevents mgatp-dependent production electrochemical gradient crucial transport storage dopamine vesicle thereby lower level dopamine basal ganglion neuron lead parkinson's symptoms
additionally several case pediatric adult cinnarizine overdose reported effect including range symptom somnolence coma vomiting hypotonia stupor convulsions
cognitive complication likely result antihistaminic effect cinnarizine motor effect product antidopaminergic properties
case overdose patient brought observed hospital potential neurological complications
cinnarizine commonly taken orally tablet form frequency amount dosage varying depending reason taking medication
ingested substance absorbed quite rapidly reach peak plasma concentration hour post-administration
cmax maximum level drug tested area typically blood plasma ha measured ngml tmax amount time drug present max amount blood wa hours
auc area curve extrapolated infinity used estimate bioavailability wa nghml
however mean terminal half-life elimination young volunteer subject administered mg cinnarizine wa found hours
study administered mg dos cinnarizine twice day twelve day healthy volunteer observed cinnarizine build body steady-state accumulation factor of
however auct amount time day wa significantly different auc wa estimated single dose administration
weakly basic also lipophilic compound low aqueous solubility cinnarizine able cross blood brain barrier simple diffusion
property able exert effect cerebral blood flow brain
bioavailability orally administered cinnarizine typically low variable due high incidence degradation
however ha found administered intravenously lipid emulsion better pharmacokinetics tissue distribution achieved
lipid emulsion administration higher auc lower clearance solution form meant wa increased bioavailability cinnarizine allowing improved therapeutic effect
plasma pharmacokinetics cinnarizine administered intravenously follows three-compartment model first fast distribution phase followed slower distribution phase ending slow elimination
v steady state apparent volume distribution lipid emulsion administration wa x lower lkg cinnarizine given solution lkg wa found significantly le cinnarizine wa taken lung brain lipid emulsion condition
significant would reduce likelihood toxic side effect central nervous system
cinnarizine classified selective antagonist t-type voltage-operated calcium ion channel binding block channel keep inert
also known antihistaminic antiserotoninergic antidopaminergic effect binding h histamine receptor dopaminergic receptors
ic half-maximal inhibitory concentration cinnarizine smooth muscle contraction inhibition mm ha shown drug preferentially bind target calcium channel open opposed closed conformation
treatment nausea motion sickness wa previously hypothesized cinnarizine exerts effect inhibiting calcium current voltage gated channel type ii vestibular hair cell within inner ear
however recent evidence support idea pharmacologically relevant level m-m cinnarizine lessening vestibular vertigo blocking calcium channel rather inhibiting potassium k current activated heightened hydrostatic pressure hair cells
true cinnarizine doe abolish calcium current vestibular hair cell well occurs higher concentration drug m
inhibition current work lessen vertigo motion-induced nausea dampening over-reactivity vestibular hair cell send information balance motion brain
administration cinnarizine completely metabolized within body metabolite eliminated one third urine two third solid waste
