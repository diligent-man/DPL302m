displaystyle wedge
is the truth functional operator of logical conjunction the and of a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true
the logical connective that represents this operator is typically written as
displaystyle wedge
displaystyle a land b
is true if and only if
displaystyle a
is true and
displaystyle b
is true
an operand of a conjunction is a conjunct
beyond logic the term conjunction also refers to similar concepts in other fields
in natural language the denotation of expressions such as english and
in programming languages the short circuit and control structure
in set theory intersection
in lattice theory logical conjunction greatest lower bound
in predicate logic universal quantification and is usually denoted by an infix operator in mathematics and logic it is denoted by
displaystyle wedge
or in electronics and in programming languages or and
in jan ukasiewicz s prefix notation for logic the operator is k for polish koniunkcja
logical conjunction is an operation on two logical values typically the values of two propositions that produces a value of true if and only if both of its operands are true
the conjunctive identity is true which is to say that and ing an expression with true will never change the value of the expression
in keeping with the concept of vacuous truth when conjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary arity the empty conjunction and ing over an empty set of operands is often defined as having the result true
the truth table of
displaystyle a land b
in systems where logical conjunction is not a primitive it may be defined as
displaystyle a land b neg a to neg b
displaystyle a land b neg neg a lor neg b
as a rule of inference conjunction introduction is a classically valid simple argument form
the argument form has two premises a and b
intuitively it permits the inference of their conjunction
therefore a and b or in logical operator notation
displaystyle a
displaystyle b
displaystyle vdash a land b
here is an example of an argument that fits the form conjunction introduction
bob likes apples
bob likes oranges
therefore bob likes apples and bob likes oranges conjunction elimination is another classically valid simple argument form
intuitively it permits the inference from any conjunction of either element of that conjunction
a and b
therefore a or alternatively
a and b
therefore b in logical operator notation
displaystyle a land b
displaystyle vdash a
or alternatively
displaystyle a land b
displaystyle vdash b
a conjunction
displaystyle a land b
is proven false by establishing either
displaystyle neg a
displaystyle neg b
in terms of the object language this reads
displaystyle neg a to neg a land b
this formula can be seen as a special case of
displaystyle a to c to a land b to c
displaystyle c
is a false proposition
displaystyle a
implies
displaystyle neg b
then both
displaystyle neg a
as well as
displaystyle a
prove the conjunction false
displaystyle a to neg b to neg a land b
in other words a conjunction can actually be proven false just by knowing about the relation of its conjuncts and not necessary about their truth values
this formula can be seen as a special case of
displaystyle a to b to c to a land b to c
displaystyle c
is a false proposition
either of the above are constructively valid proofs by contradiction
commutativity yes
associativity yes
distributivity with various operations especially with or
idempotency yes
monotonicity yes
truth preserving yeswhen all inputs are true the output is true
falsehood preserving yeswhen all inputs are false the output is false

if using binary values for true and false then logical conjunction works exactly like normal arithmetic multiplication
in high level computer programming and digital electronics logical conjunction is commonly represented by an infix operator usually as a keyword such as and an algebraic multiplication or the ampersand symbol sometimes doubled as in
many languages also provide short circuit control structures corresponding to logical conjunction
logical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations where corresponds to false and to true
and the operation can also be applied to two binary words viewed as bitstrings of equal length by taking the bitwise and of each pair of bits at corresponding positions
for example
and this can be used to select part of a bitstring using a bit mask
for example and extracts the fifth bit of an bit bitstring
in computer networking bit masks are used to derive the network address of a subnet within an existing network from a given ip address by anding the ip address and the subnet mask
logical conjunction and is also used in sql operations to form database queries
the curry howard correspondence relates logical conjunction to product types
the membership of an element of an intersection set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical conjunction x a b if and only if x a x b
through this correspondence set theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction such as associativity commutativity and idempotence
as with other notions formalized in mathematical logic the logical conjunction and is related to but not the same as the grammatical conjunction and in natural languages
english and has properties not captured by logical conjunction
for example and sometimes implies order having the sense of then
for example they got married and had a child in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child
the word and can also imply a partition of a thing into parts as the american flag is red white and blue here it is not meant that the flag is at once red white and blue but rather that it has a part of each color
