sarcoma botryoides or botryoid sarcoma is a subtype of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma that can be observed in the walls of hollow mucosa lined structures such as the nasopharynx common bile duct urinary bladder of infants and young children or the vagina in females typically younger than age
the name comes from the gross appearance of grape bunches botryoid in greek
for botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina the most common clinical finding is vaginal bleeding but vaginal bleeding is not specific for sarcoma botryoides other vaginal cancers are possible
they may appear as a polypoid mass somewhat yellow in color and are friable thus they possibly may break off leading to vaginal bleeding or infections
under the microscope one can see rhabdomyoblasts that may contain cross striations
tumor cells are crowded in a distinct layer beneath the vaginal epithelium cambium layer
spindle shaped tumor cells that are desmin positive
the disease used to be uniformly fatal with a year survival rate between and
as a result treatment was radical surgery
new multidrug chemotherapy regimens with or without radiation therapy are now used in combination with less radical surgery with good results although outcome data are not yet available
sarcoma botryoides normally is found in children under years of age
onset of symptoms occurs at age years months on average
cases of older women with this condition have also been reported
