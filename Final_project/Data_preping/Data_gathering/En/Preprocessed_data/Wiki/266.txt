The Royal College of Science for Ireland RCScI was an institute for higher education in Dublin which existed from to specialising in physical sciences and applied science
Stephen's Green moving in to a purpose-built Royal College of Science building on Merrion Street now known as Government Buildings
In it was absorbed into University College Dublin UCD as the faculty of Science and Engineering
The Museum of Economic Geology was founded by the Dublin Castle administration in with chemist Robert Kane as curator and a focus on mining in Ireland similar to the Museum of Practical Geology in London
In Kane was promoted to director expanding its remit and renaming it the Museum of Irish Industry MII
In a new Science and Art Department was created within the Whitehall administration and in the MII placed under its remit
A School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts was created modelled on the Royal School of Mines in London with four professorships shared jointly by the MII school and the Royal Dublin Society RDS
The MII and School shared premises at St
Stephen's Green acquired in and fitted out by
In a select committee of the UK parliament recommended that the MII and School be entirely separated from the RDS and broadened into a government-supported College of Science for Ireland
In HM Treasury agreed and in a commission was appointed by the education committee of the Privy Council
The commission headed by William Parsons rd Earl of Rosse outlined the scope and functions of the proposed college and the RCScI mission statement on September was
The object of the Royal College of Science is to supply as far as practicable a Complete Course of instruction in Science applicable to the Industrial Arts especially those which may be classed broadly under the heads of Mining Agriculture Engineering and Manufactures and to aid in the instruction of Teachers for the local Schools of ScienceGeorge Sigerson complained in that the RCScI was less open to Catholics than the MII had been
The RCScI's remit was later changed to exclude include agriculture and include Physics and Natural Science
The number of students enrolled increased gradually
By the RCScI had chairs of Mining and Mineralogy Physics Chemistry Zoology Botany Geology Applied Mathematics and Mechanism Descriptive Geometry and Engineering
In control was transferred from the Science and Art Department in London to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Dublin headed by Horace Plunkett
A new building was proposed in and a site from Merrion Street to Kildare Street was chosen in in the plan was extended to include government administrative offices as well as the new college
The new building was designed by Sir Aston Webb the foundation stone was laid in by Edward VII and it was opened in by George V
In the RCScI was absorbed into UCD where it became the UCD Science and Engineering faculties
Science moved to UCD's Earlsfort Terrace building and on to Belfield in the s Engineering moved from Merrion Street to Belfield in
The RCScI building was then absorbed into Government Buildings with the rest of Aston Webb's complex lavishly renovated by Charles Haughey and used to house the Department of the Taoiseach
