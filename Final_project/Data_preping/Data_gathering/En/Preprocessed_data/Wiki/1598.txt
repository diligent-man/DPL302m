a request for proposal rfp is a document that solicits proposal often made through a bidding process by an agency or company interested in procurement of a commodity service or valuable asset to potential suppliers to submit business proposals
it is submitted early in the procurement cycle either at the preliminary study or procurement stage
an rfp is used where the request requires technical expertise specialized capability or where the product or service being requested does not yet exist and the proposal may require research and development to create whatever is being requested
the rfp presents preliminary requirements for the commodity or service and may dictate to varying degrees the exact structure and format of the supplier s response
effective rfps typically reflect the strategy and short long term business objectives providing detailed insight upon which suppliers will be able to offer a matching perspective
similar requests include a request for quotation rfq whereby the customer may simply be looking for a price quote and a request for information rfi where the customer needs more information from vendors before submitting an rfp
an rfi is typically followed by an rfp or rfq
in principle an rfp
informs suppliers that an organization is looking to procure and encourages them to make their best effort
requires the company to specify what it proposes to purchase
if the requirements analysis has been prepared properly it can be incorporated quite easily into the request document
alerts suppliers that the selection process is competitive
allows for wide distribution and response
ensures that suppliers respond factually to the identified requirements
is generally expected to follow a structured evaluation and selection procedure so that an organization can demonstrate impartiality a crucial factor in public sector procurements an rfp typically involves more than a request for the price
examples of such are choosing requirements the timetable for the project the rfp package format and obtain clearance for the rfi package format
other requested information may include basic corporate information and history financial information can the company deliver without risk of bankruptcy technical capability used on major procurements of services where the item has not previously been made or where the requirement could be met by varying technical means product information such as stock availability and estimated completion period and customer references that can be checked to determine a company s suitability including educational and military background of its employees on the project college graduates and those with advanced college degrees may add value from the bidder
the ubiquitous availability of the internet has made many government agencies turn either to state run or vendor operated websites which provide listings of rfps as well as rfis and rfqs
many allow vendors to sign up at no charge to receive e mails of requests either generally or for specific categories of product or service for which there is an interest
in some cases the entire process is done on line with responses as scanned documents or pdf files uploaded to the server in other cases or for legal reasons a response must be sent in hard copy form and or on cd dvd disc or flash drive by mail or delivery service
in the militaries of many countries an rfp is often raised to fulfill an operational requirement or after which the military procurement authority will normally issue a detailed technical specification against which tenders i e bids will be made by potential contractors
in the civilian use an rfp is usually part of a complex sales process also known as enterprise sales
rfps often include specifications of the item project or service for which a proposal is requested
the more detailed the specifications the better the chances that the proposal provided will be accurate
generally rfps are sent to an approved supplier or vendor list
the bidders return a proposal by a set date and time
late proposals may or may not be considered depending on the terms of the initial rfp
the proposals are used to evaluate the suitability as a supplier vendor or institutional partner
typically organizations follow a detailed vendor screening process to short list the vendors who should be invited for further rounds of negotiation
this screening process could either be vendor scoring models or internal discussions within the buyer organization
discussions may be held on the proposals often to clarify technical capabilities or to note errors in a proposal or in many cases to negotiate on the price
in most instances only selected bidders may be invited to participate in subsequent bids or may be asked to submit their best technical and financial proposal commonly referred to as a best and final offer bafo
subsequent changes can be referred to as the best and revised final offer barfo
once both the parties i e
a buyer organization and seller organization agree on the technical and commercial terms and conditions of the proposal they could move on to next steps like contract signing statement of work which would formalize the purchase transactions
today many organizations are becoming more collaborative in the development of rfps this is especially true for universities and other major public entities making major technology purchases
rfp issuing groups ask for specific use cases rather than providing a list of features and ensure they have the opportunity to include demonstrations webinars and meetings as part of the rfp process to ensure they have a strong understanding of all competing products before making a purchase
an rfp template is a document that is used to create a formal request for proposal
it is usually created by the person who will be issuing the rfp
the template can be used as a guide for those who are responding to the rfp
the purpose of an rfp template is to provide all of the necessary information and instructions in order for someone to respond with a proposal that meets all of the requirements set out in the document
a well written rfp template will include sections on
purpose
scope
requirements
timeline
budget
roles and responsibilities
qualifications and experience requirementsa request for association rfa also known as request for partnership or request for alliance is a proposal from one party to another for acting together usually in business and sharing the benefits of this joint action
a request for expression s of interest rfei is part of the eoi expression of interest discovery process in order to gather information regarding the potential procurement of the services sought similar to the rfq sometimes done prior to publishing an rfp
a request for information rfi is a proposal requested from a potential seller or a service provider to determine what products and services are potentially available in the marketplace to meet a buyer s needs and to know the capability of a seller in terms of offerings and strengths of the seller
rfis are commonly used on major procurements where a requirement could potentially be met through several alternate means
an rfi however is not an invitation to bid is not binding on either the buyer or sellers and may or may not lead to an rfp or rfq
a request for quotation rfq is used when discussions with bidders are not required mainly when the specifications of a product or service are already known and when price is the main or only factor in selecting the successful bidder
an rfq may also be used prior to issuing a full blown rfp to determine general price ranges
in this scenario products services or suppliers may be selected from the rfq results to bring in to further research in order to write a more fully fleshed out rfp
in commercial business practice the rfq is the most popularly used form of rfx with many companies not understanding the distinction between the rfx s and so defaulting to rfq
a request for qualifications rfq also known as pre qualification questionnaire pqq is a document often distributed before initiation of the rfp process
it is used to gather vendor information from multiple companies to generate a pool of prospects
this eases the rfp review process by preemptively short listing candidates which meet the desired qualifications
a request for solution rfs is similar to a rfp but more open and general
this allows the vendor or supplier the most flexibility of all rfx in expressing their solution or their product and service combination
a request for tender rft also known as invitation to tender itt is more commonly used by governments
