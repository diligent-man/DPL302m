European New Zealanders also known by the Māori-language loanword Pākehā are New Zealanders of European descent
Most European New Zealanders are of British and Irish ancestry with significantly smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as Germans Poles historically noted as German due to Partitions of Poland French Dutch Croats and other South Slavs Greeks and Scandinavians
Statistics New Zealand maintains the national classification standard for ethnicity
European is one of the six top-level ethnic groups alongside Māori Pacific Peoples Asian Middle EasternLatin AmericanAfrican MELAA and Other
Within the top-level European group are two second-level ethnic groups New Zealand European and Other European
New Zealand European consists of New Zealanders of European descent while Other European consists of migrant European ethnic groups
Other Europeans also includes some people of indirect European descent including Americans Canadians South Africans and Australians
According to the New Zealand census people identified as European with people identifying as New Zealand European
British Captain James Cook sailed to New Zealand in prior to him was Dutch man Abel Tasman in
The establishment of British colonies in Australia from and the boom in whaling and sealing in the Southern Ocean brought many Europeans to the vicinity of New Zealand
Whalers and sealers were often itinerant and the first real settlers were missionaries and traders in the Bay of Islands area from
Some of the early visitors stayed and lived with Māori tribes as Pākehā Māori
Often whalers and traders married Māori women of high status which served to cement trade and political alliances as well as bringing wealth and prestige to the tribe
By there was a population of about non-Māori which included a total of about runaway convicts and seamen
The seamen often lived in New Zealand for a short time before joining another ship a few months later
In there were Europeans living in the North Island
Violence against European shipping mainly due to mutual cultural misunderstandings the ongoing musket wars between Māori tribes due to the recent relatively sudden introduction of firearms into the Māori world cultural barriers and the lack of an established European law and order made settling in New Zealand a risky prospect
By the late s the average missionary would claim that many Māori were nominally Christian many of the Māori slaves that had been captured during the Musket Wars had been freed and cannibalism had been largely stamped out
By this time many Māori especially in the north could read and write in their native language and to a lesser extent English
European migration has resulted in a deep legacy being left on the social and political structures of New Zealand
Early visitors to New Zealand included whalers sealers missionaries mariners and merchants attracted to natural resources in abundance
They came from the Australian colonies Great Britain and Ireland Germany forming the next biggest immigrant group after the British and Irish France Portugal the Netherlands Denmark the United States and Canada
In representatives of the British Crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi with Māori chiefs throughout New Zealand motivated by plans for a French colony at Akaroa and land purchases by the New Zealand Company in
British sovereignty was then proclaimed over New Zealand in May
Some would later argue that the proclamation of sovereignty was in direct conflict with the treaty which in its Māori version had guaranteed sovereignty Rangatiratanga to the Māori who signed it
By the end of the s the European and Māori populations were of a similar size as immigration and natural increase boosted European numbers
Following the formalising of British sovereignty the organised and structured flow of migrants from Great Britain and Ireland began
Government-chartered ships like the clipper Gananoque and the Glentanner carried immigrants to New Zealand
Typically clipper ships left British ports such as London and travelled south through the central Atlantic to about degrees south to pick up the strong westerly winds that carried the clippers well south of South Africa and Australia
Ships would then head north once in the vicinity of New Zealand
The Glentanner migrant ship of tonnes made two runs to New Zealand and several to Australia carrying tonne of passengers and cargo
Travel time was about to +⁄ months to New Zealand
Cargo carried on the Glentanner for New Zealand included coal slate lead sheet wine beer cart components salt soap and passengers' personal goods
On the passage the ship carried official passengers most of them government assisted
On the return trip the ship carried a wool cargo worth pounds
In the s discovery of gold started a gold rush in Otago
By more than British and Irish settlers lived throughout New Zealand
The Otago Association actively recruited settlers from Scotland creating a definite Scottish influence in that region while the Canterbury Association recruited settlers from the south of England creating a definite English influence over that region
In the s most migrants settled in the South Island due to gold discoveries and the availability of flat grass covered land for pastoral farming
The low number of Māori about and the absence of warfare gave the South Island many advantages
It was only when the New Zealand wars ended that The North Island again became an attractive destination
In the s the MP Julius Vogel borrowed millions of pounds from Britain to help fund capital development such as a nationwide rail system lighthouses ports and bridges and encouraged mass migration from Britain
Other smaller groups of settlers came from Germany Scandinavia and other parts of Europe as well as from China and India but British and Irish settlers made up the vast majority and did so for the next years
There were people identifying as being part of the European ethnic group at the New Zealand census making up of New Zealand's population
This is an increase of people since the census and an increase of people since the census
There were males and females giving a sex ratio of males per female
The median age was years with people aged under years aged to aged to and aged or older
In terms of population distribution of Europeans live in the North Island and live in the South Island
The Waimakariri District has the highest concentration of Europeans at followed by the Tasman District and the Grey District
The Ōtara-Papatoetoe local board area in Auckland has the lowest concentration at followed by the Māngere-Ōtāhuhu local board area and the Manurewa local board area
The Wairoa District has the lowest concentration of European people outside Auckland at
The first general Census of New Zealand population was taken November- December
Subsequent censuses were taken in and and thereafter at five-yearly intervals until
The table shows the ethnic composition of New Zealand population at each census since the early twentieth century
Europeans are still the largest ethnic group in New Zealand
Their proportion of the total New Zealand population has been decreasing gradually since the Census
Most census reports do not separate European New Zealanders from the broader European ethnic category which was the largest broad ethnic category in the Census
Europeans comprised percent of respondents in compared with percent in the census
The apparent drop in this figure was due to Statistics New Zealand's acceptance of 'New Zealander' as a distinct response to the ethnicity question and their placement of it within the Other ethnic category along with an email campaign asking people to give it as their ethnicity in the Census
In previous censuses these responses were counted belonging to the European New Zealanders group and Statistics New Zealand plans to return to this approach for the Census
Eleven percent of respondents identified as New Zealanders in the Census or as something similar eg
Kiwi well above the trend observed in previous censuses and higher than the percentage seen in other surveys that year
In April Statistics New Zealand announced a review of their official ethnicity standard citing this debate as a reason and a draft report was released for public comment
In response the New Zealand Herald opined that the decision to leave the question unchanged in and rely on public information efforts was rather too hopeful and advocated a return to something like the approach
This asked people which of several identities apply to you instead of the more recent question What ethnic group do you belong to
nfd - not further defined insufficient data to classify the response further
nec - not elsewhere classified no classification exists for the responseThe term Pākehā or Pakeha the etymology of which is unclear is used interchangeably with European New Zealanders
The census used the wording New Zealand European Pākehā in the ethnicity question however the word Pākehā was subsequently removed after what Statistics New Zealand called a significant adverse reaction to its use to identify ethnicity
In the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study carried out by The University of Auckland found no evidence that the word was derogatory of the overall respondents to the survey chose the option Pākehā to describe themselves with the remainder preferring New Zealander New Zealand European or simply Kiwi
The term Palagi pronounced Palangi is Samoan in origin and is used in similar ways to Pākehā usually by people of Samoan or other Pacific Island descent
The New Zealand census statistics reported citizens with British English Scottish Irish Welsh and Celtic origins
Historically a sense of 'Britishness' has figured prominently in the identity of many New Zealanders
As late as the s it was common for New Zealanders to refer to themselves as British such as when Prime Minister Keith Holyoake described Sir Edmund Hillary's successful ascent of Mount Everest as putting the British race and New Zealand on top of the world
New Zealand passports described nationals as British Subject and New Zealand Citizen until when this was changed to New Zealand Citizen
While European identity predominates political discourse in New Zealand today the term British is still used by some New Zealanders to explain their ethnic origins
Others see the term as better describing previous generations for instance journalist Colin James referred to we ex-British New Zealanders in a speech
It remains a relatively uncontroversial descriptor of ancestry
As the earliest colonists of New Zealand settlers from England and their descendants often held positions of power and made or helped make laws often because many had been involved in government back in England
The lineage of most of the national founders of New Zealand was British especially English such as
James Busby from Scotland with English and Scottish parents drafted the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand and with William Hobson co-authored the Treaty of Waitangi
Captain William Hobson from Waterford Ireland is the principal author of the Treaty of Waitangi and the first governor of New ZealandVarious other founders of New Zealand have also been unofficially recognised
Captain James Cook the Englishman who voyaged to and claimed New Zealand for the crown
Captain Arthur Phillip Englishman first governor of New South Wales founder of the first colony with nominal authority over all of Australia east of the th meridian including all of New Zealand bar the southernmost part of South Island
Sir George Grey English and Irish parents the third governor of New Zealand and the eleventh New Zealand Prime Minister
Henry Sewell English parents the first New Zealand Prime MinisterThe culture of New Zealand is essentially a Western culture influenced by the unique geography of New Zealand the diverse input of Māori and other Pacific people the British colonisation of New Zealand that began in and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration that followed
Evidence of a significant Anglo-Celtic heritage includes the predominance of the English language the common law the Westminster system of government Christianity Anglicanism as the once dominant religion and the popularity of British sports such as rugby and cricket all of which are part of the heritage that has shaped modern New Zealand
European settlement increased through the early decades of the th century with numerous trading stations established especially in the North
The experiences of European New Zealanders have endured in New Zealand music cinema and literature
The early Pākehā settlers and later organised European settlers identifies themselves as the nationality of their former nations—typically British
Historian Fiona Barker states New Zealanders saw their country as playing a special role as a loyal member of the British Empire and for a long time New Zealand aspired to be a ‘Britain of the South’ However by the mid-th century a distinctive identity had cemented
Michael King a leading writer and historian on Pākehā identity discussed the concept of distinct European New Zealander practices and imaginations in his books Being Pākehā and Being Pākehā Now and the edited collection Pakeha The Quest for Identity in New Zealand conceptualising Pākehā as New Zealand's second indigenous culture
By contrast Māori art historian Jonathan Mane-Wheoki described Pākehā as the people who define themselves by what they are not
Who want to forget their origins their history their cultural inheritance who want Maori likewise to deny their origins so that we can all start off afresh
Where Pākehā identity is located commonly New Zealand kitsch and symbols from marketing such as the Chesdale Cheese men are used as signifiers and might more appropriately be called Kiwiana
New Zealand English is a major variety of the English language and is used throughout New Zealand
Having an official status in the Constitution New Zealand English is the one of the country's official languages and is the first language of the majority of the population
New Zealand English began to diverge from British English after the English language was established in New Zealand by colonists during the th century
It arose from the intermingling of early settlers from a great variety of mutually intelligible dialectal regions of the British Isles and quickly developed into a distinct variety of English
New Zealand English differs from other varieties of English in vocabulary accent pronunciation register grammar and spelling
The earliest form of New Zealand English was first spoken by the children of the colonists born into the colony of New Zealand
This first generation of children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation
The New Zealand-born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of dialects from all over the British Isles in particular from Ireland and South East England
The native-born children of the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them and with it expressed peer solidarity
Even when new settlers arrived this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech
The most commonly spoken European languages other than English in New Zealand are French and German
Another area of cultural influence are New Zealand Patriotic songs
God Defend New Zealand is a national anthem of New Zealand - Created by the Irish-born composer Thomas Bracken the song was first performed in and was sung in New Zealand as a patriotic song
It has equal status with God Save the Queen but God Defend New Zealand is more commonly used
It did not gain its status as an official anthem until following a petition to Parliament asking God Defend New Zealand to be made the national anthem in
God Save the Queen - New Zealand's other official national anthem and was the sole national anthem until
God Save the Queen is also the national anthem of the United Kingdom and was adopted in
It is now most often played only when the sovereign Governor-General or other member of the Royal Family is present or in other situations where a royal anthem would be used or on some occasions such as Anzac DayScottish architect Sir Basil Spence provided the original conceptual design of the Beehive in
The detailed architectural design was undertaken by the New Zealand government architect Fergus Sheppard and structural design of the building was undertaken by the Ministry of Works
The Beehive was built in stages between and
Angus constructed the first stage - the podium underground car park and basement for a national civil defence centre and Gibson O'Connor constructed the ten floors of the remainder of the building
Bellamy's restaurant moved into the building in the summer of and Queen Elizabeth II Queen of New Zealand unveiled a plaque in the reception hall in February
The Prime Minister Robert Muldoon formally opened the building in May
The government moved into the upper floors in
The annex facing Museum Street was completed in
In July Heritage New Zealand declared the Beehive of outstanding heritage significance for its central role in the governance of New Zealand
Many of the more imposing structures in and around Dunedin and Christchurch were built in the latter part of the th century as a result of the economic boom following the Central Otago Gold Rush
A common style for these landmarks is the use of dark basalt blocks and facings of cream-coloured Oamaru stone a form of limestone mined at Weston in North Otago
Notable buildings in this style include Dunedin Railway Station the University of Otago Registry Building Christchurch Arts Centre Knox Church Dunedin ChristChurch Cathedral Christchurch Christ's College Christchurch Garrison Hall Dunedin parts of the Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings and Otago Boys' High School
There are many places in New Zealand named after people and places in Europe especially the United Kingdom the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands as a result of the many English Scottish Welsh Irish Dutch and other European settlers and explorers
These include the name New Zealand itself as described below along with several notable cities and regions
New Zealand In Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland
British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand
Auckland Both the city and region as well as the former province are named after George Eden Earl of Auckland whose title comes from the town of West Auckland Durham in England
Canterbury the region and former province are named after Canterbury England
Christchurch the original name of the city Christ Church was decided prior to the ships' arrival at the Association's first meeting on March
The exact basis for the name is not known
It has been suggested that it is named for Christchurch in Dorset England for Canterbury Cathedral or in honour of Christ Church Oxford
The last explanation is the one generally accepted
Dunedin comes from Dn ideann the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh the Scottish capital
Wellington Both the city and region as well as the former province are named after Arthur Wellesley st Duke of Wellington whose title comes from the town of Wellington Somerset in EnglandSmall pockets of settlers from other European countries add to the identity and place names of specific New Zealand regions most notably the Scandinavian-inspired place names of Dannevirke and Norsewood in southern Hawke's Bay
All of the ancestors of the forty Prime Ministers of New Zealand were European and Anglo-Celtic English Scottish Northern Irish Welsh or Irish
Some ancestors of three Prime Ministers did not originate from Britain or Ireland some of the ancestors of David Lange were Germans some of the ancestors of Julius Vogel and Francis Bell were European Jews and some of John Key's ancestors were Jewish Austrian migrants his mother's side
