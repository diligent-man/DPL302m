the evolutionary origin of religions and religious behavior is a field of study related to evolutionary psychology the origin of language and mythology and cross cultural comparison of the anthropology of religion
some subjects of interest include neolithic religion evidence for spirituality or cultic behavior in the upper paleolithic and similarities in great ape behavior
humanity s closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos
these primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived between six and eight million years ago
it is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor
barbara king argues that while non human primates are not religious they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of religion
these traits include high intelligence a capacity for symbolic communication a sense of social norms realization of self of continuity
there is inconclusive evidence that homo neanderthalensis may have buried their dead which is evidence of the use of ritual
the use of burial rituals is thought to be evidence of religious activity and there is no other evidence that religion existed in human culture before humans reached behavioral modernity
other lines of evidence have revealed that homo neanderthalensis made cave art which would be a manner of symbolic thinking comparable to the manner required for religious thought
elephants demonstrate rituals around their deceased which include long periods of silence and mourning at the point of death and a process of returning to grave sites and caressing the remains
some evidence suggests that many species grieve death and loss
in this set of theories the religious mind is one consequence of a brain that is large enough to formulate religious and philosophical ideas
during human evolution the hominid brain tripled in size peaking years ago
much of the brain s expansion took place in the neocortex
the cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neural computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception thought language attention episodic memory and voluntary movement
according to dunbar s theory the relative neocortex size of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species
the neocortex size correlates with a number of social variables that include social group size and complexity of mating behaviors
in chimpanzees the neocortex occupies of the brain whereas in modern humans it occupies of the brain
robin dunbar argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the speciation of archaic homo sapiens about years ago
his study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as language and religion
the study is based on a regression analysis of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids
stephen jay gould suggests that religion may have grown out of evolutionary changes which favored larger brains as a means of cementing group coherence among savanna hunters after that larger brain enabled reflection on the inevitability of personal mortality
lewis wolpert argues that causal beliefs that emerged from tool use played a major role in the evolution of belief
the manufacture of complex tools requires creating a mental image of an object which does not exist naturally before actually making the artifact
furthermore one must understand how the tool would be used that requires an understanding of causality
accordingly the level of sophistication of stone tools is a useful indicator of causal beliefs
wolpert contends use of tools composed of more than one component such as hand axes represents an ability to understand cause and effect
however recent studies of other primates indicate that causality may not be a uniquely human trait
for example chimpanzees have been known to escape from pens closed with multiple latches which was previously thought could only have been figured out by humans who understood causality
chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead and notice things that have only aesthetic value like sunsets both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality
the difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree
the degree of comprehension in an animal depends upon the size of the prefrontal cortex the greater the size of the prefrontal cortex the deeper the comprehension
religion requires a system of symbolic communication such as language to be transmitted from one individual to another
philip lieberman states human religious thought and moral sense clearly rest on a cognitive linguistic base
from this premise science writer nicholas wade states
like most behaviors that are found in societies throughout the world religion must have been present in the ancestral human population before the dispersal from africa years ago
although religious rituals usually involve dance and music they are also very verbal since the sacred truths have to be stated
if so religion at least in its modern form cannot pre date the emergence of language
it has been argued earlier that language attained its modern state shortly before the exodus from africa
if religion had to await the evolution of modern articulate language then it too would have emerged shortly before years ago another view distinguishes individual religious belief from collective religious belief
while the former does not require prior development of language the latter does
the individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it
this activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it
the theory is belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise
the resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief
a socially accepted hypothesis becomes dogmatic backed by social sanction
language consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero
as pure social conventions signals of this kind cannot evolve in a darwinian social world they are a theoretical impossibility
being intrinsically unreliable language works only if one can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society namely one where symbolic cultural facts sometimes called institutional facts can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement
in any hunter gatherer society the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ritual
transcending the continuity versus discontinuity divide some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation that by generating unprecedented levels of public trust liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant
ritual speech coevolution theory exemplifies this approach
scholars in this intellectual camp point to the fact that even chimpanzees and bonobos have latent symbolic capacities that they rarely if ever use in the wild
objecting to the sudden mutation idea these authors argue that even if a chance mutation were to install a language organ in an evolving bipedal primate it would be adaptively useless under all known primate social conditions
a very specific social structure one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on cheap signals words an evolutionarily stable strategy
the animistic nature of early human language could serve as the handicap like cost that helped to ensure the reliability of communication
the attribution of spiritual essence to everything surrounding early humans served as a built in mechanism that provided instant verification and ensured
the inviolability of one s speech
animal vocal signals are for the most part intrinsically reliable
when a cat purrs the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal s contented state
the signal is trusted not because the cat is inclined to be honest but because it just cannot fake that sound
primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable but they remain reliable for the same reason because they are hard to fake
primate social intelligence is machiavellian self serving and unconstrained by moral scruples
monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive each other while at the same time remaining constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves
paradoxically it is theorized that primates resistance to deception is what blocks the evolution of their signalling systems along language like lines
language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable
words automatically fail this test
frans de waal and barbara king both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality
although morality awareness may be a unique human trait many social animals such as primates dolphins and whales have been known to exhibit pre moral sentiments
according to michael shermer the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals particularly the great apes
de waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile
pre moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups
for any social species the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism
for example a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders
being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food
this is evident among animals that hunt in packs to take down large or dangerous prey
all social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place
social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment
however higher order primates also have a sense of fairness
chimpanzees live in fission fusion groups that average individuals
it is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size
based on the size of extant hunter gatherer societies recent paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals
as community size increased over the course of human evolution greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required
morality may have evolved in these bands of to people as a means of social control conflict resolution and group solidarity
according to dr
de waal human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies
psychologist matt j
rossano argues that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural agents
by including ever watchful ancestors spirits and gods in the social realm humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups
the adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival
rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality
according to rossano s teaching individual religious belief is thus initially epistemological not ethical in nature
cognitive scientists underlined that religions may be explained as a result of the brain architecture that developed early in the genus homo in the course of the evolutionary history of life
however there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind
the two main schools of thought hold
either that religion evolved due to natural selection and has selective advantage
or that religion is an evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations stephen jay gould for example saw religion as an exaptation or a spandrel in other words religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons
such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm agent detection the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events etiology and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs desires and intentions theory of mind
these three adaptations among others allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise e g
thunder lightning movement of planets complexity of life
the emergence of collective religious belief identified such agents as deities that standardized the explanation
some scholars have suggested that religion is genetically hardwired into the human condition
one controversial proposal the god gene hypothesis states that some variants of a specific gene the vmat gene predispose to spirituality
another view builds on the concept of the triune brain the reptilian brain the limbic system and the neocortex proposed by paul d
maclean
collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love fear and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through socio biological conditioning and social sanction
individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion
the limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is therefore stronger than it much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex
yet another view is that the behavior of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their biological fitness so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in a religion
specifically rituals beliefs and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity and allow it to function better when under stress
this would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism particularly in facilitating the evolution of hierarchies of warriors which if true may be why many modern religions tend to promote fertility and kinship
still another view proposed by fred h
previc sees human religion as a product of an increase in dopaminergic functions in the human brain and of a general intellectual expansion beginning around thousand years ago kya
dopamine promotes an emphasis on distant space and time which can correlate with religious experience
while the earliest extant shamanic cave paintings date to around kya the use of ocher for rock art predates this and there is clear evidence for abstract thinking along the coast of south africa kya
paul bloom suggests that certain early emergent cognitive biases
make it natural to believe in gods and spirits
the exact time when humans first became religious remains unknown however research in evolutionary archaeology shows credible evidence of religious cum ritualistic behavior from around the middle paleolithic era thousand years ago
the earliest evidence of religious thought is based on the ritual treatment of the dead
most animals display only a casual interest in the dead of their own species
ritual burial thus represents a significant change in human behavior
ritual burials represent an awareness of life and death and a possible belief in the afterlife
philip lieberman states burials with grave goods clearly signify religious practices and concern for the dead that transcends daily life
the earliest evidence for treatment of the dead comes from atapuerca in spain
at this location the bones of individuals believed to be homo heidelbergensis have been found in a pit
neanderthals are also contenders for the first hominids to intentionally bury the dead
they may have placed corpses into shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones
the presence of these grave goods may indicate an emotional connection with the deceased and possibly a belief in the afterlife
neanderthal burial sites include shanidar in iraq and krapina in croatia and kebara cave in israel
the earliest known burial of modern humans is from a cave in israel located at qafzeh
human remains have been dated to years ago
human skeletons were found stained with red ocher
a variety of grave goods were found at the burial site
the mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons
philip lieberman states
matt rossano suggests that the period between and years before present following the retreat of humans from the levant to africa was a crucial period in the evolution of religion
the use of symbolism in religion is a universal established phenomenon
archeologist steven mithen contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas
because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others
this problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art
when translated into material form supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand
due to the association of art and religion evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts
art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas
wentzel van huyssteen states that the translation of the non visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms
some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with middle stone age sites in africa
from at least years ago there is evidence of the use of pigments such as red ocher
pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes
among extant hunter gatherer populations around the world red ocher is still used extensively for ritual purposes
it has been argued that it is universal among human cultures for the color red to represent blood sex life and death
the use of red ocher as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect
some scientists such as richard klein and steven mithen only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas
upper paleolithic cave art provides some of the most unambiguous evidence of religious thought from the paleolithic
cave paintings at chauvet depict creatures that are half human and half animal
organized religion traces its roots to the neolithic revolution that began years ago in the near east but may have occurred independently in several other locations around the world
the invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a sedentary lifestyle
the consequences of the neolithic revolution included a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development
the transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment
while bands and small tribes possess supernatural beliefs these beliefs do not serve to justify a central authority justify transfer of wealth or maintain peace between unrelated individuals
organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability through the following ways
justifying the central authority which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services
bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals
however states and nations are composed of many thousands of unrelated individuals
jared diamond argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity
in his book guns germs and steel he argues that the leading cause of death among hunter gatherer societies is murder
religions that revolved around moralizing gods may have facilitated the rise of large cooperative groups of unrelated individuals the states born out of the neolithic revolution such as those of ancient egypt and mesopotamia were theocracies with chiefs kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and spiritual leaders
anthropologists have found that virtually all state societies and chiefdoms from around the world have been found to justify political power through divine authority
this suggests that political authority co opts collective religious belief to bolster itself
following the neolithic revolution the pace of technological development cultural evolution intensified due to the invention of writing years ago
symbols that became words later on made effective communication of ideas possible
printing invented only over a thousand years ago increased the speed of communication exponentially and became the main spring of cultural evolution
writing is thought to have been first invented in either sumeria or ancient egypt and was initially used for accounting
soon after writing was used to record myth
the first religious texts mark the beginning of religious history
the pyramid texts from ancient egypt are one of the oldest known religious texts in the world dating to between and bce
writing played a major role in sustaining and spreading organized religion
in pre literate societies religious ideas were based on an oral tradition the contents of which were articulated by shamans and remained limited to the collective memories of the society s inhabitants
with the advent of writing information that was not easy to remember could easily be stored in sacred texts that were maintained by a select group clergy
humans could store and process large amounts of information with writing that otherwise would have been forgotten
writing therefore enabled religions to develop coherent and comprehensive doctrinal systems that remained independent of time and place
writing also brought a measure of objectivity to human knowledge
formulation of thoughts in words and the requirement for validation made mutual exchange of ideas and the sifting of generally acceptable from not acceptable ideas possible
the generally acceptable ideas became objective knowledge reflecting the continuously evolving framework of human awareness of reality that karl popper calls verisimilitude a stage on the human journey to truth
