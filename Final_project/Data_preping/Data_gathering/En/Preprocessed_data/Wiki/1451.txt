lewis wolpert argues causal belief emerged tool use played major role evolution belief
manufacture complex tool requires creating mental image object doe exist naturally actually making artifact
furthermore one must understand tool would used requires understanding causality
accordingly level sophistication stone tool useful indicator causal beliefs
wolpert contends use tool composed one component hand ax represents ability understand cause effect
however recent study primate indicate causality may uniquely human trait
example chimpanzee known escape pen closed multiple latch wa previously thought could figured human understood causality
chimpanzee also known mourn dead notice thing aesthetic value like sunset may considered component religion spirituality

religion await evolution modern articulate language would emerged shortly year agoanother view distinguishes individual religious belief collective religious belief
former doe require prior development language latter does
individual human brain ha explain phenomenon order comprehend relate it
activity predates far emergence language may caused it
theory belief supernatural emerges hypothesis arbitrarily assumed individual explain natural phenomenon cannot explained otherwise
resulting need share individual hypothesis others lead eventually collective religious belief
socially accepted hypothesis becomes dogmatic backed social sanction

frans de waal barbara king view human morality grown primate sociality
although morality awareness may unique human trait many social animal primate dolphin whale known exhibit pre-moral sentiments
according michael shermer following characteristic shared human social animal particularly great apes
de waal contends social animal restrain alter behavior group living worthwhile
pre-moral sentiment evolved primate society method restraining individual selfishness building cooperative groups
social specie benefit part altruistic group outweigh benefit individualism
example lack group cohesion could make individual vulnerable attack outsiders
part group may also improve chance finding food
evident among animal hunt pack take large dangerous prey
social order maintained certain rule expected behavior dominant group member enforce order punishment
likely early ancestor human lived group similar size
based size extant hunter-gatherer society recent paleolithic hominid lived band hundred individuals
community size increased course human evolution greater enforcement achieve group cohesion would required
morality may evolved band people mean social control conflict resolution group solidarity
de waal human morality ha two extra level sophistication found primate societies
rossano argues religion emerged morality built upon morality expanding social scrutiny individual behavior include supernatural agents
including ever-watchful ancestor spirit god social realm human discovered effective strategy restraining selfishness building cooperative groups
rossano referring collective religious belief social sanction institutionalized morality
according rossano's teaching individual religious belief thus initially epistemological ethical nature
cognitive scientist underlined religion may explained result brain architecture developed early genus homo course evolutionary history life
however disagreement exact mechanism drove evolution religious mind
either religion evolved due natural selection ha selective advantage
religion evolutionary byproduct mental adaptationsstephen jay gould example saw religion exaptation spandrel word religion evolved byproduct psychological mechanism evolved reasons
mechanism may include ability infer presence organism might harm agent detection ability come causal narrative natural event etiology ability recognize people mind belief desire intention theory mind
three adaptation among others allow human imagine purposeful agent behind many observation could readily explained otherwise eg
emergence collective religious belief identified agent deity standardized explanation
one controversial proposal god gene hypothesis state variant specific gene vmat gene predispose spirituality
another view build concept triune brain reptilian brain limbic system neocortex proposed paul d
collective religious belief draw upon emotion love fear gregariousness deeply embedded limbic system socio-biological conditioning social sanction
individual religious belief utilizes reason based neocortex often varies collective religion
limbic system much older evolutionary term neocortex therefore stronger much way reptilian stronger limbic system neocortex
yet another view behavior people participate religion make feel better improves biological fitness genetic selection favor people willing believe religion
specifically ritual belief social contact typical religious group may serve calm mind example reducing ambiguity uncertainty due complexity allow function better stress
would allow religion used powerful survival mechanism particularly facilitating evolution hierarchy warrior true may many modern religion tend promote fertility kinship

paul bloom suggests certain early emergent cognitive biases
exact time human first became religious remains unknown however research evolutionary archaeology show credible evidence religious-cum-ritualistic behavior around middle paleolithic era thousand year ago
earliest evidence religious thought based ritual treatment dead
ritual burial thus represents significant change human behavior
ritual burial represent awareness life death possible belief afterlife
philip lieberman state burial grave good clearly signify religious practice concern dead transcends daily life
location bone individual believed homo heidelbergensis found pit
neanderthal also contender first hominid intentionally bury dead
may placed corps shallow graf along stone tool animal bones
presence grave good may indicate emotional connection deceased possibly belief afterlife

art symbolism demonstrates capacity abstract thought imagination necessary construct religious ideas
wentzel van huyssteen state translation non-visible symbolism enabled early human ancestor hold belief abstract terms
earliest evidence symbolic behavior associated middle stone age site africa
least year ago evidence use pigment red ocher
pigment little practical use hunter gatherer thus evidence use interpreted symbolic ritual purposes
among extant hunter gatherer population around world red ocher still used extensively ritual purposes
ha argued universal among human culture color red represent blood sex life death

anthropologist found virtually state society chiefdoms around world found justify political power divine authority
suggests political authority co-opts collective religious belief bolster itself
following neolithic revolution pace technological development cultural evolution intensified due invention writing year ago
symbol became word later made effective communication idea possible
printing invented thousand year ago increased speed communication exponentially became main spring cultural evolution
writing thought first invented either sumeria ancient egypt wa initially used accounting
pyramid text ancient egypt one oldest known religious text world dating bce
writing played major role sustaining spreading organized religion
pre-literate society religious idea based oral tradition content articulated shaman remained limited collective memory society's inhabitants
advent writing information wa easy remember could easily stored sacred text maintained select group clergy
human could store process large amount information writing otherwise would forgotten
writing therefore enabled religion develop coherent comprehensive doctrinal system remained independent time place
formulation thought word requirement validation made mutual exchange idea sifting generally acceptable acceptable idea possible
generally acceptable idea became objective knowledge reflecting continuously evolving framework human awareness reality karl popper call 'verisimilitude' stage human journey truth
