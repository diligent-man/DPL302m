the city of atlanta georgia in fulton county was an important rail and commercial center during the american civil war
although relatively small in population the city became a critical point of contention during the atlanta campaign in when a powerful union army approached from union held tennessee
the fall of atlanta was a critical point in the civil war giving the north more confidence and along with the victories at mobile bay and winchester leading to the re election of president abraham lincoln and the eventual dissolution of the confederacy
the capture of the gate city of the south was especially important for lincoln as he was in a contentious election campaign against the democratic opponent george b
mcclellan
the city that would become atlanta began as the endpoint of the western and atlantic railroad aptly named terminus in
atlanta grew quickly with the completion of the georgia railway in and the macon western in
the city was incorporated in and extended mile in all directions from the zero mile post
in atlanta was a relatively small city ranking th in the united states in size with a population of according to the united states u s census
however it was the th largest city in what became the confederate states of america
a large number of machine shops foundries and other industrial concerns were soon established in atlanta
the population swelled to nearly as workers arrived for these new factories and warehouses
the city was a vital transportation and logistics center with several major railroads in the area
the western atlantic railroad connected the city with chattanooga tennessee miles to the north
the georgia railway connected the city with augusta to the east and the confederate powderworks on the savannah river
the macon western connected atlanta to macon and savannah to its south
the fourth line atlanta and west point railroad completed in connected atlanta with west point georgia
at west point the line linked up with the western railway of alabama thus connecting atlanta with montgomery to its west
a series of roads radiated out from the city in all directions connecting atlanta with neighboring towns and states
thought to be relatively safe from union forces early in the war atlanta rapidly became a concentration point for the confederate quartermasters and logistics experts warehouses were filled with food forage supplies ammunition clothing and other materiel critical to the confederate states of america armies operating in the western theater
some of the major manufacturing facilities supporting the confederate war effort were
the atlanta rolling mill established before the war was significantly expanded and provided a major source for armor plating for confederate navy ironclads including the css virginia
it also refurbished railroad tracks
the confederate pistol factory made pistols
the novelty iron works produced ordnance supplies
confederate arsenal was located at the northwest corner of walton and peachtree street
the empire manufacturing company made railroad cars and bar iron
winship foundry produced great quantities of metal products railroad supplies freight cars and iron bolts
atlanta machine works produced ordnance
the cannons produced by the atlanta machine works were rifled at the western and atlantic roundhouse
withers and solomon solomon foundry made buttons spurs bits buckles etc
a flour mill was located at the northwest corner of marietta and north avenue
hammond marshall sword factory manufactured swords
atlanta steam tannery made leather goods for the army
the naval ordnance works was set up in early by lieutenant david porter mccorkle using stores and machinery he was able to move to atlanta from new orleans before it fell
the works produced gun carriages and inch shells for the confederate navy
the confederate iron and brass foundry produced all kinds of iron and brass works in addition to the transportation and manufacturing facilities there were several hospitals in atlanta
the general hospital was located on the fairground on fair street
the distribution hospital was located on the southeast corner of alabama and pryor streets
the atlanta female institute on courtland street was used as a hospital
the atlanta medical college was used as a surgical hospital
kiles hotel on decatur and loyd streets was used as a hospital
a hotel on peachtree was used as a hospital
the convalescent hospital was located on the ponder property at means street and ponder avenue
the hospital for contagious diseases was located on acres of property taken from william markham on july general joseph e
johnston issued orders that all hospitals and munitions works in atlanta be evacuated
on july colonel josiah georgas ordnance chief in richmond issued orders to colonel m
wright commanding the arsenal in atlanta send the bulk of machinery stores to augusta and to columbia s c send workmen in same direction when it becomes necessary
a number of newspapers flourished in atlanta during the civil war
among the more prominent ones were the atlanta southern confederacy and the daily intelligencer both of which moved to macon georgia during the union occupation in
the daily intelligencer was the only atlanta paper to survive the war and resume publication from atlanta after union forces began their march to the sea
concerned after the fall of vicksburg on july that atlanta would be a logical target for future union army attacks jeremy f
gilmer chief of the confederate engineer bureau contacted captain lemuel p
grant chief engineer of the department of georgia and asked him to survey possible enemy crossings of the chattahoochee river a broad waterway that offered some protection from a northern approach
grant complied and after a thorough investigation and survey explained that the fortification of atlanta would involve an expenditure second only to the defense of richmond
captain grant planned a cordon of enclosed works within supporting distance of each other with twelve to fifteen strong forts sited specially for artillery and connected by infantry entrenchments in a perimeter between and miles in extent
gilmer gave grant the approval to develop a plan to ring atlanta with forts and earthworks along the key approaches to the city
gilmer advised that the earthen forts should be connected by a line of rifle pits with ditches felled timbers or other obstruction to impede an infantry charge
gilmer also suggested that the perimeter should be far enough from the town to prevent the enemy coming within bombarding distance
general gilmer knew that the construction of the atlanta fortification would by its scope impact private property
he advised col
wright
headquarters etc
charleston s
c october
wright
commanding atlanta ga
colonel in order to make the works constructed for the defense of atlanta effective the timber must be cut down in front of the lines for a distance of say to cubic yards and the cutting should be continuous
the true rule should be to clear away as far as our own guns can command the ground well and no farther as the ranges of the enemy s artillery are generally greater than ours
the work ought to be commenced at once as it will require some time to complete it the forest in front of the batteries to be cleared away first
in all cases have the trees thrown from the lines and the branches that stand up from the felled trees cut off so that they may offer no cover
the stumps ought not to be high

the wagon and portable darkroom of photographer george n
barnard is visible in the photograph
confederate palisades on north side of atlanta georgia
as to damages for putting up works on private lands and cutting timber they should be assessed by impartial and intelligent persons
a good plan one that we have resorted to in previous cases is to appoint an officer of good judgment and the local proprietors to select a second to make the appraisements and report the same to the engineer officer captain grant for transmission to the engineer bureau
that office will have the appraisement examined and make such indorsements thereon as may be thought just and proper and then forward them to the attorney general whose duty it is by law to examine them and if the claims be well founded to ask congress to appropriate for their payment
should the two appraisers fail to agree they must choose a third as umpire
in each case the property damaged should be described with care
i would like to have the indorsements of yourself and captain grant on the appraisements before they are forwarded to the engineer bureau
it is not necessary to apply to richmond concerning the exterior lines
if you have the labor press them forward at once particularly on the front
direct captain grant to apply to the engineer bureau for all necessary funds
if needed a reasonable supply of intrenching tools axes c can be sent him on his application but i hope you have sufficient from the battle field of chickamauga
i am colonel very respectfully your obedient servant
gilmer
major general and chief of engineer bureaucaptain grant planned a series of redoubts forming a mile km circle over a mile km out from the center of town
these would be interlinked with a series of earthworks and trenches along with rows of abatis and other impediments to enemy troops
construction on the extensive defensive works began in august
they were bounded on the north by high ground the present location of the fox theatre the west by ashby street the south by mcdonough drive and the east by what is today known as grant park
gilmer inspected the completed work in december and gave his approval
because of how the subsequent campaign unfolded most of these fortifications were never really put to the test
by late october captain grant had nearly completed his encirclement of atlanta and the number of forts had risen to seventeen
of the seventeen planned forts thirteen had been completed
due to topographical features of the land and the manning requirements for the fortifications grant s design had by necessity left atlanta within artillery range
the section of the line protecting the north west approach to atlanta was inside the city limits
to help protect this area an additional string of forts was constructed further out from the city
a report from captain grant to gen
wright places the length of the fortifications at miles and requiring about troops to fully man the line
in addition to the fortifications surrounding atlanta the local militia was reorganized by brig
wright during march
the militia was composed exclusively of detailed soldiers and exempts all those liable to conscription
the total strength was men
in as feared by jeremy f

each army commander will accept battle on anything like fair terms but if the army reach within cannon range of the city without receiving artillery or musketry fire he will halt form a strong line with batteries in position and await orders
if fired on from the forts or buildings of atlanta no consideration must be paid to the fact that they are occupied by families but the place must be cannonaded without the formality of a demand
the general in chief will be with the center of the army viz with or near general schofield

in total these four cannons fired over rounds on atlanta
on august general sherman reported that
there are no official records of the number of people killed by the bombardment of atlanta
during the early part of august several attempts were made to cut the two remaining rail lines to atlanta using cavalry
even though the union cavalry successfully tore up sections of the rail line they were not able to do sufficient damage to prevent the confederate forces from easily repairing the affected sections of railroad
union forces also continued to probe the confederate lines looking for weak spots
even though no frontal assault was ever made on atlanta there was a constant skirmishing between the lines and casualties occurred on both sides
on august the atlanta and west point railroad was cut near red oak station
on august the union forces withdrew from their entrenchments around atlanta

finding them too extensive for the number of troops planned to garrison atlanta capt
poe designed a new set of fortifications
the new line was less than three miles in length along a system of heights nearer the center of town
this new line passed through the northern part of town rendering the destruction of a great many buildings necessary
