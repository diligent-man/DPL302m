The city of Atlanta Georgia in Fulton County was an important rail and commercial center during the American Civil War
Although relatively small in population the city became a critical point of contention during the Atlanta Campaign in when a powerful Union Army approached from Union-held Tennessee
The fall of Atlanta was a critical point in the Civil War giving the North more confidence and along with the victories at Mobile Bay and Winchester leading to the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln and the eventual dissolution of the Confederacy
The capture of the Gate City of the South was especially important for Lincoln as he was in a contentious election campaign against the Democratic opponent George B
The city that would become Atlanta began as the endpoint of the Western and Atlantic Railroad aptly named Terminus in
Atlanta grew quickly with the completion of The Georgia Railway in and the Macon Western in
The city was incorporated in and extended mile in all directions from the zero-mile post
In Atlanta was a relatively small city ranking th in the United States in size with a population of according to the United States US Census
However it was the th-largest city in what became the Confederate States of America
A large number of machine shops foundries and other industrial concerns were soon established in Atlanta
The population swelled to nearly as workers arrived for these new factories and warehouses
The city was a vital transportation and logistics center with several major railroads in the area
The Western Atlantic Railroad connected the city with Chattanooga Tennessee miles to the north
The Georgia Railway connected the city with Augusta to the east and the Confederate Powderworks on the Savannah River
The Macon Western connected Atlanta to Macon and Savannah to its south
The fourth line Atlanta and West Point Railroad completed in connected Atlanta with West Point Georgia
At West Point the line linked up with the Western Railway of Alabama thus connecting Atlanta with Montgomery to its west
A series of roads radiated out from the city in all directions connecting Atlanta with neighboring towns and states
Thought to be relatively safe from Union forces early in the war Atlanta rapidly became a concentration point for the Confederate quartermasters and logistics experts warehouses were filled with food forage supplies ammunition clothing and other materiel critical to the Confederate States of America armies operating in the Western Theater
Some of the major manufacturing facilities supporting the Confederate war effort were
The Atlanta Rolling Mill established before the war was significantly expanded and provided a major source for armor plating for Confederate Navy ironclads including the CSS Virginia
The Novelty Iron Works produced ordnance supplies
Confederate Arsenal was located at the northwest corner of Walton and Peachtree Street
The Empire Manufacturing Company made Railroad cars and bar iron
Winship Foundry produced great quantities of metal products railroad supplies freight cars and iron bolts
The cannons produced by the Atlanta Machine Works were rifled at the Western and Atlantic Roundhouse
Withers and Solomon Solomon Foundry made buttons spurs bits buckles etc
A Flour Mill was located at the northwest corner of Marietta and North Avenue
Atlanta Steam Tannery made leather goods for the army
The Naval Ordnance Works was set up in early by Lieutenant David Porter McCorkle using stores and machinery he was able to move to Atlanta from New Orleans before it fell
The works produced gun carriages and -inch shells for the Confederate navy
The Confederate Iron and Brass Foundry produced all kinds of iron and brass worksIn addition to the transportation and manufacturing facilities there were several hospitals in Atlanta
The General Hospital was located on the fairground on Fair Street
The Distribution Hospital was located on the southeast corner of Alabama and Pryor Streets
The Atlanta Female Institute on Courtland Street was used as a hospital
The Atlanta Medical College was used as a surgical hospital
Kiles Hotel on Decatur and Loyd Streets was used as a hospital
A hotel on Peachtree was used as a hospital
The convalescent hospital was located on the Ponder property at Means Street and Ponder Avenue
The hospital for contagious diseases was located on acres of property taken from William MarkhamOn July General Joseph E
Johnston issued orders that all hospitals and munitions works in Atlanta be evacuated
On July Colonel Josiah Georgas ordnance chief in Richmond issued orders to Colonel M
Wright commanding the arsenal in Atlanta Send the bulk of machinery stores to Augusta and to Columbia SC send workmen in same direction when it becomes necessary
A number of newspapers flourished in Atlanta during the Civil War
Among the more prominent ones were the Atlanta Southern Confederacy and the Daily Intelligencer both of which moved to Macon Georgia during the Union occupation in
The Daily Intelligencer was the only Atlanta paper to survive the war and resume publication from Atlanta after Union forces began their March to the Sea
Concerned after the fall of Vicksburg on July that Atlanta would be a logical target for future Union Army attacks Jeremy F
Gilmer Chief of the Confederate Engineer Bureau contacted Captain Lemuel P
Grant Chief Engineer of the Department of Georgia and asked him to survey possible enemy crossings of the Chattahoochee River a broad waterway that offered some protection from a northern approach
Grant complied and after a thorough investigation and survey explained that the fortification of Atlanta would involve an expenditure second only to the defense of Richmond
Captain Grant planned a cordon of enclosed works within supporting distance of each other with twelve to fifteen strong forts sited specially for artillery and connected by infantry entrenchments in a perimeter between and miles in extent
Gilmer gave Grant the approval to develop a plan to ring Atlanta with forts and earthworks along the key approaches to the city
Gilmer advised that the earthen forts should be connected by a line of rifle pits with ditches felled timbers or other obstruction to impede an infantry charge
Gilmer also suggested that the perimeter should be far enough from the town to prevent the enemy coming within bombarding distance
General Gilmer knew that the construction of the Atlanta Fortification would by its scope impact private property
COLONEL In order to make the works constructed for the defense of Atlanta effective the timber must be cut down in front of the lines for a distance of say to cubic yards and the cutting should be continuous
The true rule should be to clear away as far as our own guns can command the ground well and no farther as the ranges of the enemy's artillery are generally greater than ours
The work ought to be commenced at once as it will require some time to complete it the forest in front of the batteries to be cleared away first
In all cases have the trees thrown from the lines and the branches that stand up from the felled trees cut off so that they may offer no cover
The stumps ought not to be high

Confederate palisades on north side of Atlanta Georgia
As to damages for putting up works on private lands and cutting timber they should be assessed by impartial and intelligent persons
A good plan one that we have resorted to in previous cases is to appoint an officer of good judgment and the local proprietors to select a second to make the appraisements and report the same to the engineer officer Captain Grant for transmission to the Engineer Bureau
That office will have the appraisement examined and make such indorsements thereon as may be thought just and proper and then forward them to the Attorney-General whose duty it is by law to examine them and if the claims be well founded to ask Congress to appropriate for their payment
Should the two appraisers fail to agree they must choose a third as umpire
In each case the property damaged should be described with care
I would like to have the indorsements of yourself and Captain Grant on the appraisements before they are forwarded to the Engineer Bureau
It is not necessary to apply to Richmond concerning the exterior lines
If you have the labor press them forward at once particularly on the front
Direct Captain Grant to apply to the Engineer Bureau for all necessary funds
If needed a reasonable supply of intrenching tools axes c can be sent him on his application but I hope you have sufficient from the battle-field of Chickamauga
I am colonel very respectfully your obedient servant
Major-General and Chief of Engineer BureauCaptain Grant planned a series of redoubts forming a -mile km circle over a mile km out from the center of town
These would be interlinked with a series of earthworks and trenches along with rows of abatis and other impediments to enemy troops
Construction on the extensive defensive works began in August
They were bounded on the north by high ground the present location of the Fox Theatre the west by Ashby Street the south by McDonough Drive and the east by what is today known as Grant Park
Gilmer inspected the completed work in December and gave his approval
Because of how the subsequent campaign unfolded most of these fortifications were never really put to the test
By late October Captain Grant had nearly completed his encirclement of Atlanta and the number of forts had risen to seventeen
Of the seventeen planned forts thirteen had been completed
Due to topographical features of the land and the manning requirements for the fortifications Grant's design had by necessity left Atlanta within artillery range
The section of the line protecting the north west approach to Atlanta was inside the city limits
To help protect this area an additional string of forts was constructed further out from the city
A report from Captain Grant to Gen
Wright places the length of the fortifications at ½ miles and requiring about troops to fully man the line
In addition to the fortifications surrounding Atlanta the local militia was reorganized by Brig
The militia was composed exclusively of detailed soldiers and exempts all those liable to conscription
Gilmer Atlanta did indeed become the target of a major Union invasion
The area now covered by metropolitan Atlanta was the scene of several fiercely contested battles including the Battle of Peachtree Creek the Battle of Atlanta Battle of Ezra Church and the Battle of Jonesboro
John Bell Hood evacuated Atlanta after a five-week siege mounted by Union Gen
William Sherman and ordered all public buildings and possible Confederate assets destroyed
In the spring of the Confederate Army of Tennessee commanded by General Joseph E
Johnston was entrenched near the city of Dalton Georgia
In early May Union forces under the command of Maj
By early July the Confederate forces had been forced back to the outskirts of Atlanta
Both the Union and Confederate forces used the Western Atlantic Railroad to supply their troops
The last remaining natural obstacle separating the Union forces from Atlanta was the Chattahoochee River
By July the Federal forces had secured three good crossings over the Chattahoochee one at Powers' Ferry a second at the mouth of Soap Creek and a third at the shallow ford near Roswell Georgia
The federal forces rested and moved troops around to prepare for their advance on the city of Atlanta beginning on July
Sherman sent orders via telegraph to Gen
Rousseau then stationed at Decatur Alabama with a force of cavalry to cut the rail line linking Atlanta with Montgomery Alabama
Rousseau's men cut about miles of the rail line west of Opelika Alabama as well as three miles of the branch toward Columbus Georgia and two miles towards West Point Georgia
Rousseau's cavalry force then joined General Sherman in Marietta Georgia on July
Union cavalry forces under the command of Brig
Kenner Garrard supported by a brigade of infantry cut the Georgia Railroad that connected Atlanta with Augusta Georgia near the town of Stone Mountain GA on July
Johnston was relieved of command of the Confederate forces
General John Bell Hood was given command of the Army of Tennessee
General Sherman issued Special Order detailing the Union advance on Atlanta on July
Special Order In the Field near Decatur Ga
The whole army will move on Atlanta by the most direct roads tomorrow July beginning at a
I Major-General Thomas from the direction of Buck Head his left to connect with General Schofields right about two miles northeast of Atlanta about lot near the houses marked as Hu
II Major-General Schofield by the road leading from Doctor Powell's to Atlanta
III Major-General McPherson will follow one or more roads direct from Decatur to Atlanta following substantially the railroad
Each army commander will accept battle on anything like fair terms but if the army reach within cannon-range of the city without receiving artillery or musketry fire he will halt form a strong line with batteries in position and await orders
If fired on from the forts or buildings of Atlanta no consideration must be paid to the fact that they are occupied by families but the place must be cannonaded without the formality of a demand
The general-in-chief will be with the center of the army viz with or near General Schofield
With the Union forces spread out over such a wide front General Hood launched an attack against the Union right at Peachtree Creek on July
The Confederate advance was repulsed at the Battle of Peach Tree Creek
The Confederates then launched a second attack on July this time against the Union left east of Atlanta near the Augusta railroad
The Confederates were again repulsed with heavy losses at the Battle of Atlanta
During the Battle of Atlanta Union General James B
General Sherman had now cut two of the four rail lines leading into Atlanta
In an effort to cut the Confederate supply lines between West Point GA and Atlanta General Sherman moved forces along the west side of Atlanta
General Hood sent two of his corps to protect his supply lines
Expecting an attack the Union forces entrenched near Ezra Church
The Confederates attacked on July and were repulsed in the Battle of Ezra Church
Even though the Union forces were victorious in the Battle of Ezra Church the Union forces failed to cut the rail line supplying Atlanta from West Point
The Union forces continued to move south on the west side of Atlanta but the Confederates were able to extend their lines to match these movements
The two sides once again clashed on August at Utoy Creek
The Union forces were repulsed with heavy losses and failed in an attempt to break the Atlanta and West Point Railroad
On July Battery H First Illinois Light Artillery commanded by Capt
Francis De Gress came into battery near the Troup Hurt Home
De Gress opened fire on downtown Atlanta from this point
The shelling of Atlanta continued from July until August
In addition to the cannons the Union forces had with them four -inch siege cannons were brought by rail from Chattanooga
These four cannons began firing on the city on August
In total these four cannons fired over rounds on Atlanta
There are no official records of the number of people killed by the bombardment of Atlanta
During the early part of August several attempts were made to cut the two remaining rail lines to Atlanta using cavalry
Even though the Union cavalry successfully tore up sections of the rail line they were not able to do sufficient damage to prevent the Confederate forces from easily repairing the affected sections of railroad
Union forces also continued to probe the Confederate lines looking for weak spots
Even though no frontal assault was ever made on Atlanta there was a constant skirmishing between the lines and casualties occurred on both sides
On August the Atlanta and West Point Railroad was cut near Red Oak Station
On August the Union forces withdrew from their entrenchments around Atlanta
Part of the Union forces pulled back to prepare defensive positions at the Chattahoochee River while the remainder of the Union forces marched south of Atlanta to attack the Macon Western Railroad
On August September the Confederate forces once again failed to stop the Union troops at the Battle of Jonesboro
With all of his supply lines cut General Hood abandoned Atlanta
On the night of September his troops marched out of the city to Lovejoy Georgia
General Hood ordered that the rail cars filled with ammunition and other military supplies be destroyed
The resulting fire and explosions were heard for miles
In his Official Report General Sherman stated
On September Major General Slocum in command of the XX Corp near the Chattahoochee River sent reconnaissance parties towards Atlanta
Calhoun and several prominent citizens rode out Marietta St
under a flag of truce to surrender the city of Atlanta to the Union Army
John Coburn and formally surrendered the city to him
When General Slocum received word that the Confederates had evacuated Atlanta he moved forward seven brigades to occupy Atlanta
On September General Sherman was with the bulk of his troops near Lovejoy's Station when he received word from Gen
Slocum that the confederates had withdrawn from Atlanta
He immediately ordered Slocum to take possession of Atlanta and to advise all people that he intended to have all civilians leave the city
When General Sherman decided not to pursue the Confederate forces commanded by General Hood on September he issued Special Field Orders No
The Army of the Cumberland commanded by Maj
The Army of the Tennessee commanded by Maj
Howard was to move to East Point and the head of Camp Creek while the Army of the Ohio commanded by Maj
General Sherman established his headquarters in the two and one-half-story home of John Neal located on Washington St
After the Federal troops left Atlanta it was noted that Sherman had left the Neal house in excellent condition with the furniture stored in the parlor and disturbed but little
General George Thomas made his headquarters in the Greek revival home of William Herrington and his son-in-law Austin Leyden
The house was located on the west side of Peachtree Street between Ellis and Cain Streets
In the th century this lot would be occupied by a department store

Le Duc Home of the Mayor James CalhounOn September Sherman reported to Maj
Halleck that his whole Army was encamped around Atlanta
Howard was in Atlanta and that Gen
At the time of his report to Halleck he had not heard from Gen
Howard but he assumed he was in East Point
He promised his troops rest and pay
The federal forces occupied Atlanta until November when they began their March to the Sea
During this approximately days General Sherman and his troops would not only keep an eye on Gen
Hood and the Confederate army but evacuate all civilians from Atlanta build their own shelters construct fortifications forage for fresh food some would get a furloughs to visit home and finally destroy all assets of military value in Atlanta
On September the commander of the Provost Guard of Atlanta Col
William Cogswell issued the following order All families now living in Atlanta the male representatives of which are in the service of the Confederate states or who have gone south would leave the city within five days
They will pass the lines and go South …The next day Lt
Morse the provost marshal instructed that the population was to assemble at the City Hall for registration on September
Those planning to go South were permitted to take wearing apparel a limited amount of furniture and a small quantity of food
When General Sherman informed General Hood of his intent to evacuate all the citizens from Atlanta a series of heated letters were exchanged between the two generals
Mayor Calhoun also appealed to Sherman to relent but to no avail
On September General Sherman issued special order No The city of Atlanta being exclusively required for warlike purposes will at once be vacated by all except the armies of the United States
The order also instructs the chief engineer to survey the city for the permanent defense and to mark all structures that stand in his way to be set apart for destruction
The order also prohibited soldiers from occupying any house
The order allowed soldiers to use boards shingles or materials of buildings barns sheds warehouses and shanties to build their own quarters
On September the mayor of Atlanta James M
Calhoun notified its citizens that they would have to evacuate the city
Each citizen was required to register with Lt
Le Duc the number of adults children servants and a count of the number of packages or parcels they were taking with them
Le Duc sat behind a table on the porch of Richard Peters house at Mitchell and Forsyth Streets
He began registering and issuing travel permits to the citizens that were evacuating Atlanta to the South
Together they all they carried packages of baggage
Poe to construct new defensive works around Atlanta
Poe first evaluated the existing Confederate fortifications
Finding them too extensive for the number of troops planned to garrison Atlanta Capt
Poe designed a new set of fortifications
The new line was less than three miles in length along a system of heights nearer the center of town
This new line passed through the northern part of town rendering the destruction of a great many buildings necessary
Sherman approved of the plan but instructed Capt
On September the confederate forces commanded by Gen
Hood began moving from their position near Lovejoy Station GA and crossed to the west side of the Chattahoochee River on September
Sherman began moving five of his Army Corps the IV XIV XV XVII and the XXIII Corps to try to defeat the Confederates in the field
Slocum was left in Atlanta to guard the city
With only one corps remaining in Atlanta Gen
Poe to begin the construction of the new inner defense line
Poe and his Engineering detachment began constructing the new fortifications on October
During the first week he was assisted by soldiers of the XX Corps
Sherman that they had completed positions for thirty guns
Work continued until November with a much smaller work force until preparations for the March to the Sea began
Sherman realized that the occupation of Atlanta would tie up substantial manpower resources so he devised a plan to abandon Atlanta
The plan called for the destruction of all military assets within the city the reorganization of the forces under his command and for reinforcing Gen
Once these preparations were completed he and his troops would set out on a campaign designed to destroy the state of Georgia's war-making capabilities and the will of its population to continue the war
Halleck that he now consider myself authorized to execute my plan to destroy the railroad from Chattanooga to Atlanta including the latter city modified by General Grant from Dalton c strike out into the heart of Georgia and make for Charleston Savannah or the mouth of the Apalachicola
On that same day he notified Col
Amos Beckwith in Atlanta that Hood will escape me
I want to prepare for my big raid
On the st of November I want nothing but what is necessary to war
Send all trash to the rear at once and have on hand thirty days food and but little forage
I propose to abandon Atlanta and the railroad back to Chattanooga and sally forth to ruin Georgia and bring up on the seashore
I will go down the Coosa until sure that Hood has gone to Blue Mountain Additionally he notified Col
Easton in Chattanooga Go in person to superintend the repairs of the railroad and make all orders in my name that will expedite its completion
I want it finished to bring back to Chattanooga the sick wounded and surplus trash
On the st of November I want nothing in front of Chattanooga save what we can use as food and clothing and haul in our wagons
There is plenty of corn in the country and we only want forage for the posts
I allow ten days to do all this by which time I expect to be near Atlanta
On October General Sherman informed Major-General Thomas of his planned March to the Sea
Part of his plan was to insure that Gen
Thomas had sufficient strength to hold Tennessee or if Hood followed Sherman into Georgia Gen
Thomas was instructed to move south as far as Columbus Miss and Selma
General Stanley with the IV Corps was assigned to Gen
Poe to develop plans for the destruction of Atlanta as a transportation hub and as a war material manufacturing center
Cogswell ordered his officers in the three provost regiments to begin planning the demolition of designated buildings and areas of the city assigned to them and the railroad
The plan of destruction was to include the buildings to be destroyed the method and manpower needed and time estimates to complete the work
The rd Massachusetts was to destroy the area around Whitehall and Peachtree
The nd Massachusetts was assigned the Car Shed and structures to its east while the th Pennsylvania would target things to the Northwest including the Western and Atlantic roundhouse and gasworks

Destroy the bridges completely and then move your command to-morrow to Kingston and beyond passing General Davis command On Nov
Poe in Atlanta received instructions from Gen
Sherman You may commence the work of destruction at once but don't use fire until toward the last moment
The work of destroying Atlanta's military assets began under the direction of the Chief Engineer Capt
Poe on Nov and would continue until the evening of November
In his official report Captain Poe states
Sherman returned to the city on Nov
After a plea by Father Thomas O'Reilly of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church Sherman did not burn the city's churches or hospitals
However the remaining war resources were then destroyed in Atlanta and in Sherman's March to the Sea
One of the major buildings that was destroyed was Edward A
Poe would bemoan the destruction of private property that occurred
On November the work of destroying the military assets continued in downtown under Capt
Poe while the bulk of the Union forces began their March to the Sea
The Union forces now consisted of approximately men divided into two wings each wing comprised two Corps
