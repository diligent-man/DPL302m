his first novel the big sleep was published in
in addition to his short stories chandler published seven novels during his lifetime an eighth in progress at the time of his death was completed by robert b
parker
all but playback have been made into motion pictures some more than once
in the year before his death he was elected president of the mystery writers of america
chandler had an immense stylistic influence on american popular literature
he is a founder of the hard boiled school of detective fiction along with dashiell hammett james m
cain and other black mask writers
the protagonist of his novels philip marlowe like hammett s sam spade is considered by some to be synonymous with private detective
both were played in films by humphrey bogart whom many consider to be the quintessential marlowe
at least three of chandler s novels have been regarded as masterpieces farewell my lovely the little sister and the long goodbye
the long goodbye was praised in an anthology of american crime stories as arguably the first book since hammett s the glass key published more than twenty years earlier to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery
four of his novels appear on the british based crime writers association poll of the best crime fiction novels ever published
chandler was born in in chicago the son of florence dart thornton and maurice benjamin chandler
he spent his early years in plattsmouth nebraska living with his mother and father near his cousins and his aunt his mother s sister and uncle
chandler s father an alcoholic civil engineer who worked for the railway abandoned the family
to obtain the best possible education for ray his mother originally from ireland moved them to the area of upper norwood in what is now the london borough of croydon england in
another uncle a successful lawyer in waterford ireland reluctantly supported them
while they lived with chandler s maternal grandmother
raymond was a first cousin to the actor max adrian a founding member of the royal shakespeare company max s mother mabel was a sister of florence thornton
chandler was classically educated at dulwich college london a public school whose alumni include the authors p
wodehouse and c
forester
he spent some of his childhood summers in waterford with his mother s family
he did not go to university instead spending time in paris and munich improving his foreign language skills
in he was naturalized as a british subject in order to take the civil service examination which he passed
he then took an admiralty job lasting just over a year
his first poem was published during that time
chandler disliked the servility of the civil service and resigned to the consternation of his family became a reporter for the daily express and also wrote for the westminster gazette
he was unsuccessful as a journalist but he published reviews and continued writing romantic poetry
an encounter with the slightly older richard barham middleton is said to have influenced him into postponing his career as writer
i met
also a young bearded and sad eyed man called richard middleton
shortly afterwards he committed suicide in antwerp a suicide of despair i should say
the incident made a great impression on me because middleton struck me as having far more talent than i was ever likely to possess and if he couldn t make a go of it it wasn t very likely that i could accounting for that time he said of course in those days as now there were clever young men who made a decent living as freelances for the numerous literary weeklies but i was distinctly not a clever young man
nor was i at all a happy young man
in he borrowed money from his waterford uncle who expected it to be repaid with interest and returned to america visiting his aunt and uncle before settling in san francisco for a time where he took a correspondence course in bookkeeping finishing ahead of schedule
his mother joined him there in late
encouraged by chandler s attorney oilman friend warren lloyd they moved to los angeles in where he strung tennis rackets picked fruit and endured a time of scrimping and saving
he found steady employment with the los angeles creamery
in he traveled to vancouver where in august he enlisted in the canadian expeditionary force
he saw combat in the trenches in france with the th battalion c e f
the canadian scottish regiment was twice hospitalized with spanish flu during the pandemic and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling royal air force raf when the war ended
after the armistice he returned to los angeles by way of canada and soon began a love affair with pearl eugenie cissy pascal a married woman years his senior and the stepmother of gordon pascal with whom chandler had enlisted
cissy amicably divorced her husband julian in but chandler s mother disapproved of the relationship and refused to sanction the marriage
for the next four years chandler supported both his mother and cissy
after the death of florence chandler on september he was free to marry cissy
they were married on february
having begun in as a bookkeeper and auditor chandler was by a highly paid vice president of the dabney oil syndicate but his alcoholism absenteeism promiscuity with female employees and threatened suicides contributed to his dismissal a year later
in straitened financial circumstances during the great depression chandler turned to his latent writing talent to earn a living teaching himself to write pulp fiction by analyzing and imitating a novelette by erle stanley gardner
chandler s first professional work blackmailers don t shoot was published in black mask magazine in
according to genre historian herbert ruhm chandler who worked slowly and painstakingly revising again and again had taken five months to write the story
erle stanley gardner could turn out a pulp story in three or four days and turned out an estimated one thousand
his first novel the big sleep was published in featuring the detective philip marlowe speaking in the first person
in chandler described in a letter to his english publisher hamish hamilton why he began reading pulp magazines and later wrote for them
wandering up and down the pacific coast in an automobile i began to read pulp magazines because they were cheap enough to throw away and because i never had at any time any taste for the kind of thing which is known as women s magazines
this was in the great days of the black mask if i may call them great days and it struck me that some of the writing was pretty forceful and honest even though it had its crude aspect
i decided that this might be a good way to try to learn to write fiction and get paid a small amount of money at the same time
i spent five months over an word novelette and sold it for
after that i never looked back although i had a good many uneasy periods looking forward his second marlowe novel farewell my lovely became the basis for three movie versions adapted by other screenwriters including the film murder my sweet which marked the screen debut of the marlowe character played by dick powell whose depiction of marlowe chandler applauded
literary success and film adaptations led to a demand for chandler himself as a screenwriter
he and billy wilder co wrote double indemnity based on james m
cain s novel of the same title
the noir screenplay was nominated for an academy award
said wilder i would just guide the structure and i would also do a lot of the dialogue and he chandler would then comprehend and start constructing too wilder acknowledged that the dialogue which makes the film so memorable was largely chandler s
chandler s only produced original screenplay was the blue dahlia
he had not written a denouement for the script and according to producer john houseman chandler concluded he could finish the script only if drunk with the assistance of round the clock secretaries and drivers which houseman agreed to
the script gained chandler s second academy award nomination for screenplay
chandler collaborated on the screenplay of alfred hitchcock s strangers on a train an ironic murder story based on patricia highsmith s novel which he thought implausible
chandler clashed with hitchcock and they stopped talking after hitchcock heard chandler had referred to him as that fat bastard
hitchcock made a show of throwing chandler s two draft screenplays into the studio trash can while holding his nose but chandler retained the lead screenwriting credit along with czenzi ormonde
in the chandlers moved to la jolla an affluent coastal neighborhood of san diego california where chandler wrote two more philip marlowe novels the long goodbye and his last completed work playback
the latter was derived from an unproduced courtroom drama screenplay he had written for universal studios
four chapters of a novel unfinished at his death were transformed into a final philip marlowe novel poodle springs by the mystery writer and chandler admirer robert b
parker in
parker shares the authorship with chandler
parker subsequently wrote a sequel to the big sleep entitled perchance to dream which was salted with quotes from the original novel
chandler s final marlowe short story circa was entitled the pencil
it later provided the basis of an episode of the hbo miniseries philip marlowe private eye starring powers boothe as marlowe
in the princess and the pedlar a previously unknown comic operetta with libretto by chandler and music by julian pascal was discovered among the uncatalogued holdings of the library of congress
the work was never published or produced
it has been dismissed by the raymond chandler estate as no more than a curiosity a small team under the direction of the actor and director paul sand is seeking permission to produce the operetta in los angeles
cissy chandler died in after a long illness
heartbroken and drunk chandler neglected to inter her cremated remains and they sat for years in a storage locker in the basement of cypress view mausoleum
after cissy s death chandler s loneliness worsened his propensity for clinical depression he returned to drinking alcohol never quitting it for long and the quality and quantity of his writing suffered
in he attempted suicide
in the long embrace raymond chandler and the woman he loved judith freeman says it was a cry for help given that he called the police beforehand saying he planned to kill himself
chandler s personal and professional life were both helped and complicated by the women to whom he was attracted notably helga greene his literary agent jean fracasse his secretary sonia orwell george orwell s widow and natasha spender stephen spender s wife
chandler regained his u s
citizenship in while retaining his british rights too
after a respite in england he returned to la jolla
he died at scripps memorial hospital of pneumonial peripheral vascular shock and prerenal uremia according to the death certificate in
helga greene inherited chandler s estate after prevailing in a lawsuit filed by fracasse contesting chandler s holographic codicil to his will
chandler is buried at mount hope cemetery in san diego california
as frank macshane noted in his biography the life of raymond chandler chandler wished to be cremated and placed next to cissy in cypress view mausoleum
instead he was buried in mount hope because he had left no funeral or burial instructions
in chandler historian loren latker with the assistance of attorney aissa wayne daughter of john wayne brought a petition to disinter cissy s remains and reinter them with chandler in mount hope
after a hearing in september in san diego superior court judge richard s
whitney entered an order granting latker s request
on february cissy s ashes were conveyed from cypress view to mount hope and interred under a new grave marker above chandler s as they had wished
about people attended the ceremony which included readings by the rev
randal gardner powers boothe judith freeman and aissa wayne
the shared gravestone reads dead men are heavier than broken hearts a quotation from the big sleep
chandler s original gravestone placed by jean fracasse and her children is still at the head of his grave the new one is at the foot
in his introduction to trouble is my business a collection of many of his short stories chandler provided insight on the formula for the detective story and how the pulp magazines differed from previous detective stories
chandler also described the struggle that writers of pulp fiction had in following the formula demanded by the editors of the pulp magazines
critics and writers including w
auden evelyn waugh and ian fleming greatly admired chandler s prose
in a radio discussion with chandler fleming said that chandler offered some of the finest dialogue written in any prose today
contemporary mystery writer paul levine has described chandler s style as the literary equivalent of a quick punch to the gut
chandler s swift moving hardboiled style was inspired mostly by dashiell hammett but his sharp and lyrical similes are original the muzzle of the luger looked like the mouth of the second street tunnel he had a heart as big as one of mae west s hips dead men are heavier than broken hearts i went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor chandler s writing redefined the private eye fiction genre led to the coining of the adjective chandleresque and inevitably became the subject of parody and pastiche
yet the detective philip marlowe is not a stereotypical tough guy but a complex sometimes sentimental man with few friends who attended university who speaks some spanish and sometimes admires mexicans and blacks and who is a student of chess and classical music
he is a man who refuses a prospective client s fee for a job he considers unethical
the high regard in which chandler is generally held today is in contrast to the critical sniping that stung the author during his lifetime
in a march letter to blanche knopf published in selected letters of raymond chandler he wrote the thing that rather gets me down is that when i write something that is tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder i get panned for being tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder and then when i try to tone down a bit and develop the mental and emotional side of a situation i get panned for leaving out what i was panned for putting in the first time
although his work enjoys general acclaim today chandler has been criticized for certain aspects of his writing
the washington post reviewer patrick anderson described his plots as rambling at best and incoherent at worst notoriously even chandler did not know who murdered the chauffeur in the big sleep and anderson criticized chandler s treatment of black female and homosexual characters calling him a rather nasty man at times
anderson nevertheless praised chandler as probably the most lyrical of the major crime writers
chandler s short stories and novels are evocatively written conveying the time place and ambiance of los angeles and environs in the s and s
the places are real if pseudonymous bay city is santa monica gray lake is silver lake and idle valley a synthesis of wealthy san fernando valley communities
playback is the only one of his novels not to have been cinematically adapted
arguably the most notable adaptation is the big sleep by howard hawks with humphrey bogart as philip marlowe
william faulkner was a co writer of the screenplay
chandler s few screenwriting efforts and the cinematic adaptation of his novels proved stylistically and thematically influential on the american film noir genre
notable for its revised take on the marlowe character transplanting the novel to the s is robert altman s neo noir adaptation of the long goodbye
chandler was also a perceptive critic of detective fiction his essay the simple art of murder is the canonical essay in the field
british songwriter robyn hitchcock paid homage to chandler in the song raymond chandler evening on the album element of light
in the th issue of the influential cyberpunk fanzine cheap truth vincent omniaveritas conducted a fictitious interview with chandler
the interview opines that chandler s views towards the potential for respectability in pulp and genre fiction could also be applied to science fiction specifically the cyberpunk movement
it also derides chandler s now famous caricature of pulp science fiction
