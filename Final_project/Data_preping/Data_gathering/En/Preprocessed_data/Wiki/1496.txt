plasma protein binding refers degree medication attach protein within blood
le bound drug efficiently traverse cell membrane diffuse
common blood protein drug bind human serum albumin lipoprotein glycoprotein globulins
depending specific drug's affinity plasma protein proportion drug may become bound plasma protein remainder unbound
protein binding reversible chemical equilibrium exist bound unbound state that
protein drug protein-drug complexnotably unbound fraction exhibit pharmacologic effects
remaining fraction unbound fraction actually active may excreted
bound portion may act reservoir depot drug slowly released unbound form
since unbound form metabolized andor excreted body bound fraction released order maintain equilibrium
since albumin alkalotic acidic neutral drug primarily bind albumin
significant various medical condition may affect level albumin alpha- acid glycoprotein lipoproteins
change level free drug change volume distribution free drug may distribute tissue leading decrease plasma concentration profile
drug rapidly undergo metabolism clearance dependent hepatic blood flow
drug slowly undergo metabolism change unbound fraction drug directly change clearance drug
note commonly used method measuring drug concentration level plasma measure bound well unbound fraction drugthe fraction unbound altered number variable concentration drug body amount quality plasma protein drug bind plasma proteins
higher drug concentration would lead higher fraction unbound plasma protein would saturated drug excess drug would unbound
amount plasma protein decreased catabolism malnutrition liver disease renal disease would also higher fraction unbound
additionally quality plasma protein may affect many drug-binding site protein
using drug time sometimes affect other's fraction unbound
drug b also given displace drug protein thereby increasing drug a's fraction unbound
may increase effect drug since unbound fraction may exhibit activity
note drug increase unbound fraction hence drug a's pharmacological effect potentially double depending whether free molecule get target eliminated metabolism excretion
however effect really noticeable closed system pool available protein could potentially exceeded number drug molecules
biological system human animal open system molecule gained lost redistributed protein pool capacity almost never exceeded number drug molecules
drug bound mean drug molecule bound blood protein blood protein bound drug
two highly protein-bound drug b added biological system lead initial small increase concentration free drug drug b ejects drug proteins
however free drug available redistribution body tissue andor excretion
mean total amount drug system decrease quite rapidly keeping free drug fraction concentration free drug divided total drug concentration constant yielding almost change clinical effect
effect drug displacing changing clinical effect though important example vastly overestimated usually common example incorrectly used display importance effect anticoagulant warfarin
since low therapeutic index indicates high risk toxicity using drug potential increase warfarin concentration could dangerous lead hemorrhage
horse true warfarin phenylbutazone administered concurrently horse develop bleeding issue fatal
often explained due effect phenylbutazone ejecting warfarin plasma protein thus increasing concentration free warfarin increasing anticoagulant effect
however real problem phenylbutazone interferes liver's ability metabolize warfarin free warfarin cannot metabolized properly excreted
