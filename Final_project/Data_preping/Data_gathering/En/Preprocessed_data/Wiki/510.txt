the london daily news was a short lived london newspaper owned by robert maxwell
it was published from february to july it was re published in with ownership changing to samuel leach with www londondaily news
the london daily news was intended to be a hour paper challenging the local dominance of the evening standard
for the city that never sleeps the paper that never stops ran the promotional slogan
the standard s owners associated newspapers responded by reviving the evening news at a lower price to squeeze the london daily news out of the market
a price war ensued finishing with the london daily news selling at p and the evening news at p
maxwell was dismissive when he heard about the cut price evening news
he told the bbc the evening standard and lord rothermere are so worried about their monopoly which the london daily news is finally breaking and so scared about the huge demand for our paper that they ve brought out a cheapo evening news which is really a joke after the london daily news collapsed the evening standard s publishers associated newspapers continued the evening news for some months as a separate brand aiming for a more downmarket readership than the evening standard before re absorbing it into its sister publication and former rival
the london daily news was the first home of the alex cartoon later published by the independent and the daily telegraph
maxwell admitted defeat on july an hour after paying undisclosed damages to associated newspapers for accusing it of lying about the evening standard s circulation figures
starting the london daily news which published four editions a day had cost him million then about million reuters estimated
his paper was selling less than copies when minimum sales targets were by this time reuters reported maxwell as commenting
the paper exposed a scandal relating to war crimes in sri lanka when it revealed and confirmed the presence of british mercenaries of the secret kms unit working with sri lankan troops and the subsequent termination of this following the discovery of atrocities committed against the tamil population
the kms mercenaries walked out after complaining that the sri lankan special task force was running out of control and was indiscriminately killing and torturing tamil civilians
human rights lawyer karen parker cited the news article in one of her ngo interventions criticising the government of sri lanka at the united nations human rights commission
