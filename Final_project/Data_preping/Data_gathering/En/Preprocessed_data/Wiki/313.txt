Germantown Academy, informally known as GA and originally known as the Union School, is the oldest nonsectarian day school in the United States
The school was founded on December 6, 1759, by a group of prominent Germantown citizens in the Green Tree Tavern on the Germantown Road
Germantown Academy enrolls students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade and is located in the Philadelphia suburb of Fort Washington, having moved from its original Germantown campus in 1965
The original campus (see Old Germantown Academy and Headmasters' Houses) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places
The school shares the oldest continuous high school football rivalry with the William Penn Charter School.
The Union School was founded on the evening of December 6, 1759, at the Green Tree Tavern on Germantown Avenue
The school was founded by prominent members of the Germantown community who wished to provide a country school for their children
As some of the founders and residents of Germantown were of German descent, it was decided that the school be opened with both English and German speaking departments
The founders chose David James Dove to head the English department and Hilarius Becker of Bernheim, Germany, to head the German school
In 1761, land was given to the school by trustee Charles Bensell, and a schoolhouse with its iconic belfry was constructed.
The school found itself in the crossroads of early American history
In 1777, the Battle of Germantown was fought on the front lawn of trustee Benjamin Chew at his home Cliveden less than a mile from campus
During the American Revolution, the school served as a hospital and camp for British soldiers
Legend says that the British officers played the first game of cricket in America on the Academy's front lawn
After the war, the school was visited by President George Washington
Washington sent his adopted step-grandson George Washington Parke Custis to the Academy during the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia
The school was visited by the Marquis de Lafayette on his 1825 visit to America and hosted Fernando, the adopted son of South American liberator Simón Bolívar
In 1830, Amos Bronson Alcott, father of Louisa May Alcott, was appointed headmaster and attempts were made to co-educate the school but were quickly abandoned.
After the Civil War, the school was in decline, with a small student body and outdated facilities
In 1877, Dr
William Kershaw was appointed headmaster
Under his leadership, the Academy gained prominence and expanded its activities with the introduction of the Inter-Academic League (1887), The Belfry Club, one of the oldest high school drama clubs in the country (1894), and The Academy Monthly (1885), one of the oldest student literary magazines still in existence
During his headmastership, GA graduated a future University of Pennsylvania president, a Supreme Court justice, and a primate of the Episcopal Church.
In 1915, Dr
Kershaw retired and Dr
Samuel E
Osbourn was appointed headmaster
Under Dr
Osbourn's leadership, the school increased in size, focused on scholarship and continued to produce some of Philadelphia's finest citizens
Under Osbourn, GA established the eighth oldest Cum Laude Society chapter in the nation and started an endowment.
After the World Wars, GA was led by headmaster Donald Miller who was instrumental in the move from Germantown to the current Fort Washington campus
By the 1960s, more and more lower income minority families moved into Germantown and GA families left Germantown for the nearby suburbs
Historically this is called "White Flight" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight )
In five years, "The Miracle of Fort Washington" (a term coined by Judge Jerome O'Neill, '28) occurred as the school moved from city to suburb
In this transition, GA coeducated, accepting girls in 1961 with the first co-ed class graduating in 1968.
The school colors are red, black, and blue
Originally, red, white, and blue, the white was changed to black upon the death of Abraham Lincoln in 1865
Another legend suggests that GA changed its colors so its cricket team would not be confused with the nearby Philadelphia Cricket Club (with red, black, and yellow as club colors) team, as the white would turn to yellow after long and hot matches.
GA/PC Day is an annual tradition where GA plays against its rival William Penn Charter School in football, soccer, field hockey, cross country, girls' tennis, water polo, and golf
The football game brings alumni back from both schools and reunions are held the weekend of the games
The competition is the oldest of its kind dating back to 1886.
Lower School Field Day is an annual tradition that brings the red and blue teams into fierce competition
The teams are generational for existing GA families and is a staple to the school spring calendar.
The Belfry serves as a symbol of the old and new school as both buildings in Germantown and Fort Washington had identical structures
It is the namesake for the drama club and is used as symbol on GA items.
The Lower School consists of three main buildings: Leas Hall, McLean Hall (constructed in 1964), and the Abramson Lower School (constructed in 1999)
Leas Hall comprises the Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten classrooms, while McLean Hall contains 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade classrooms
The Abramson Lower School has two 3rd grade classrooms, science rooms, and music classrooms.
There are currently 347 students enrolled in the Lower School (as of the 2019-20 school year), and a student-to-teacher ratio of 14:1.
The Middle School as a separate department was established in 1976
It was first led by Barbara Hitschler Serrill,'68 and then run by longtime Head of Middle School, Richard House
The first Alter Middle School was donated by Dennis and Gisela Alter and constructed in 1997
In 2011, the new Alter Middle School was constructed and opened as a part of the Building on Tradition campus campaign
There are many activities for students, such as the science fair, a play and musical, sports teams, many clubs, such as a Fandom Club, an art club, and a literary magazine
There are 275 students currently enrolled in the Middle school (as of the 2019-20 school year).
Students are required at minimum, five credits per year and at least four years of English, three years of Math, Science, History, two years of Language, and one year of Art
There are 567 students enrolled in the Upper School (as of the 2019-20 school year)
The student to teacher ratio is currently 8:1 in the Upper School.
The upper school runs on a house system
Each student is placed into one of seven houses
These houses include, Alcott Day, Washington, Galloway, Osbourn, Kershaw, Truesdell, and Roberts
Each house is named after an important figure with a Germantown Academy connection
A student will stay with their house for all four years of upper school life
Each house has a house head, these teachers include, Robert Torrey, Allison Rader, Susan Merrill, Steven Moll, and Rachel Lintgen
Over the course of a year, each house will meet twice a week, and for special events, they will compete against each other
These special events include The Knowledge Bowl House Olympics and The Annual Spelling Bee
Each year a house cup is crowned to the house with the most house points which are picked up throughout the year in the challenges above and in many others.
Conduct in the upper school is governed by the Honor Code, a system where students agree to a set of rules, and where, in the case of an infraction, students are judged by an honor council consisting of teachers and peers.

The house system was established in 2007 at the insistence of Headmaster Jim Connor and Upper School faculty member Ted Haynie
The seven-house system is modeled after the ancient English public school concept of joining students from different years in a common group
Each of the seven houses is named for an influential alumnus or friend of the academy
Each house consists of roughly 80 people and competes in various competitions throughout the year
The system also provides an academic and social support system for underclassmen as they have the chance to interact with upperclassmen and a variety of faculty
Each house is run by a House Head and two student prefects (one boy, one girl)
Throughout the year, the houses compete in various competitions ranging from a Knowledge Bowl to a German Folk Song Singing Contest to Handball, etc
The highpoint of the house system calendar is the House Olympics which is held in early May where the different houses compete in athletic and academic competitions for a chance of the House Olympics Trophy (in parenthesis is the faculty house head for the 2017–18 school year)

He introduced coeducational integration for a brief period starting in 1831, before leaving the academy three years later
Virginia "Jinny" Day worked tirelessly to make the academy open to all, regardless of gender, in 1963
 Alcott house colors are blue and green and its house mascot is the alligator
