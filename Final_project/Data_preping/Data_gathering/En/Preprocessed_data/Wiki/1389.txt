the m bayonet is a bayonet used by the u s
military for the m rifle it can also be used with the mk enhanced battle rifle as well m enhanced marksman rifle
it was introduced in at the same time as the rifle itself
it is the only bayonet made for the m
like its predecessor the m bayonet for the m garand rifle the m was intended to serve additional roles as a combat knife and utility knife
the basic blade design was like the m m and later m bayonets based on the world war ii designed m trench knife
the overall length of the m is inches with a blade inches long
contractors who manufactured the m included aerial cutlery co columbus milpar and mfg
and imperial knife co the first of these contracts was fulfilled in the last in
the m bayonet which succeeded the m bayonet was introduced in for the m rifle
the most notable differences between the two are the diameter of the muzzle rings the shape of the handle and the locking mechanism
the m has a spring loaded lever near the guard which when depressed releases the bayonet and the m s release mechanism is on the pommel
both models are the same length have the same black finish and use the m a sheath
today the m is mainly used for ceremonial purposes particularly by the army and marine corps both of which still use the m rifle for exhibition drill
there are two variations of this scabbard both with an olive drab fiberglass body with steel throat
the early version m scabbard only a had a belt loop and lacked the double hook that earlier bayonet scabbards had for attaching to load carrying equipment such as the m haversack
the improved m a scabbard manufactured later in ww ii has the m bent wire hook
the scabbard throat flange is stamped us m or us m a on the flat steel part along with manufacturer initials
some m scabbards were later modified by adding the m hook
later m a scabbards were manufactured with a modified extended tab on the web hanger to provide more clearance for the m bayonet which rubbed against the wider bayonet handle
this sheath is correct for all post war us bayonets including the m m m and m
