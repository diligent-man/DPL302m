The M Bayonet is a bayonet used by the US
military for the M rifle it can also be used with the Mk Enhanced Battle Rifle as well M Enhanced Marksman Rifle
It was introduced in at the same time as the rifle itself
It is the only bayonet made for the M
Like its predecessor the M bayonet for the M Garand rifle the M was intended to serve additional roles as a combat knife and utility knife
The basic blade design was like the M M and later M bayonets based on the World War II designed M Trench Knife
The overall length of the M is inches with a blade inches long
Contractors who manufactured the M included Aerial Cutlery Co Columbus Milpar and Mfg
and Imperial Knife CoThe first of these contracts was fulfilled in the last in
The M bayonet which succeeded the M bayonet was introduced in for the M Rifle
The most notable differences between the two are the diameter of the muzzle rings the shape of the handle and the locking mechanism
The M has a spring-loaded lever near the guard which when depressed releases the bayonet and the M's release mechanism is on the pommel
Both models are the same length have the same black finish and use the MA sheath
Today the M is mainly used for ceremonial purposes particularly by the Army and Marine Corps both of which still use the M rifle for exhibition drill
There are two variations of this scabbard both with an olive drab fiberglass body with steel throat
The early version M scabbard only a had a belt loop and lacked the double hook that earlier bayonet scabbards had for attaching to load carrying equipment such as the M Haversack
The improved MA scabbard manufactured later in WW II has the M bent wire hook
The scabbard throat flange is stamped US M or US MA on the flat steel part along with manufacturer initials
Some M scabbards were later modified by adding the M hook
Later MA scabbards were manufactured with a modified extended tab on the web hanger to provide more clearance for the M bayonet which rubbed against the wider bayonet handle
This sheath is correct for all post-war US bayonets including the M M M and M
It was also used with the M fighting knife
