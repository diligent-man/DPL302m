christian democratic parties are political parties that seek to apply christian principles to public policy
the underlying christian democracy movement emerged in th century europe largely under the influence of catholic social teaching and neo calvinist theology
christian democracy continues to be influential in europe and latin america though in a number of countries its christian ethos has been diluted by secularisation
in practice christian democracy is often considered centre right on cultural social and moral issues but centre left with respect to economic and labor issues civil rights and foreign policy as well as the environment generally supporting a social market economy
christian democracy can be seen as either conservative centrist or liberal left of right of or center of the mainstream political parties depending on the social and political atmosphere of a given country and the positions held by individual christian democratic parties
in europe where their opponents have traditionally been secularist socialists christian democratic parties are moderately conservative overall whereas in the very different cultural and political environment of latin america they tend to lean to the left
it is the dominant centre right political movement in europe but by contrast christian democratic parties in latin america tend to be left leaning
christian democracy includes elements common to several other political ideologies including conservatism liberalism and social democracy
in the united states christian democratic parties of europe and latin america deemed conservative and liberal respectively in their geopolitical regions are both generally regarded as farther left wing of the mainstream
