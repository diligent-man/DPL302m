The Irish Football Association IFA is the governing body for association football in Northern Ireland It organised the Ireland national football team from to which after became the Northern Ireland national football team
The IFA was formed on November by seven football clubs mostly in the Belfast area as the organising body for the sport across all of Ireland A meeting was called by Cliftonville of other football clubs that followed the rules set out by the Scottish Football Association SFA At that meeting on November of that year seven clubs formed the IFA making it the fourth oldest national football association in the world after those of England Scotland and Wales The founding members were Alexander Avoniel Cliftonville Distillery Knock Moyola Park and Oldpark The IFA's first decision was to form an annual challenge cup competition similar to the FA Cup and Scottish Cup competitions called the Irish Cup Two years later Ireland played its first international against England losing which remains a record for both teams a record win for England and a record loss for Northern Ireland
Shortly after the partition of Ireland in the Football Association of Ireland FAI was established as a rival association to regulate the game in what was to become the Irish Free State The immediate cause of the split lay in a bitter dispute over the venue for the replay of an Irish Cup match in involving Glentoran of Belfast and Shelbourne of Dublin When the first cup match was drawn in Belfast because of the Irish war of independence the IFA reneged on a promise to play the replay in Dublin and scheduled the rematch again for Belfast Shelbourne refused to comply and forfeited the Cup Such was the anger over the issue that the Leinster Football Association broke away from the IFA and formed its own national association Those behind the FAI believed that football should be regulated by a federation based in the Irish Free State's capital Dublin they also accused the IFA of neglecting the development of the game in the South The IFA's supporters argued that the federation should be based where the game was mainly played namely Ulster and its principal city Belfast
Both associations claimed to represent the whole of the island each competing internationally under the name Ireland and selecting players from both the rival national leagues which also split at this time Interventions by FIFA gave the FAI de jure organising rights over the counties of the Republic with the IFA restricted to Northern Ireland From the s onwards the IFA no longer claimed it was the association for the whole of Ireland In the association moved to Windsor Avenue in south Belfast in a building once occupied by Thomas Andrews The IFA moved again in to its current location at the National Football Stadium at Windsor Park Belfast The IFA continued to regulate the game in Northern Ireland and all results obtained by the Irish national side and records in the Irish Football League and the cup competition stand as Northern Irish records
