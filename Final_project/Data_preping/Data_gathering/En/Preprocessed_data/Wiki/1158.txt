the irish football association ifa is the governing body for association football in northern ireland
it organised the ireland national football team from to which after became the northern ireland national football team
the ifa was formed on november by seven football clubs mostly in the belfast area as the organising body for the sport across all of ireland
a meeting was called by cliftonville of other football clubs that followed the rules set out by the scottish football association sfa
at that meeting on november of that year seven clubs formed the ifa making it the fourth oldest national football association in the world after those of england scotland and wales
the founding members were alexander avoniel cliftonville distillery knock moyola park and oldpark
the ifa s first decision was to form an annual challenge cup competition similar to the fa cup and scottish cup competitions called the irish cup
two years later ireland played its first international against england losing which remains a record for both teams a record win for england and a record loss for northern ireland
shortly after the partition of ireland in the football association of ireland fai was established as a rival association to regulate the game in what was to become the irish free state
the immediate cause of the split lay in a bitter dispute over the venue for the replay of an irish cup match in involving glentoran of belfast and shelbourne of dublin
when the first cup match was drawn in belfast because of the irish war of independence the ifa reneged on a promise to play the replay in dublin and scheduled the rematch again for belfast
shelbourne refused to comply and forfeited the cup
such was the anger over the issue that the leinster football association broke away from the ifa and formed its own national association
those behind the fai believed that football should be regulated by a federation based in the irish free state s capital dublin they also accused the ifa of neglecting the development of the game in the south
the ifa s supporters argued that the federation should be based where the game was mainly played namely ulster and its principal city belfast
both associations claimed to represent the whole of the island each competing internationally under the name ireland and selecting players from both the rival national leagues which also split at this time
interventions by fifa gave the fai de jure organising rights over the counties of the republic with the ifa restricted to northern ireland
from the s onwards the ifa no longer claimed it was the association for the whole of ireland
in the association moved to windsor avenue in south belfast in a building once occupied by thomas andrews
the ifa moved again in to its current location at the national football stadium at windsor park belfast
the ifa continued to regulate the game in northern ireland and all results obtained by the irish national side and records in the irish football league and the cup competition stand as northern irish records
ifa founded in belfast representing all of ireland ireland
fai founded in dublin representing southern ireland irish free state
fai begins also selecting northern players ireland ire
fai stops selecting northern players republic of ireland as of
ifa stops selecting southern players northern ireland as of therefore
ifa today northern ireland represented all of ireland between
fai today republic of ireland represented all of ireland between along with the other home nations associations the english fa the scottish football association and the football association of wales the ifa sits on the international football association board which is responsible for the laws of the game
the ifa continues to have responsibility for the running of the northern irish national team
