the positions of majority leader and minority leader are held by two united states senators and members of the party leadership of the united states senate
they serve as the chief spokespersons for their respective political parties holding the majority and the minority in the united states senate
they are each elected as majority leader and minority leader by the senators of their party caucuses the senate democratic caucus and the senate republican conference
by senate precedent the presiding officer gives the majority leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on the floor of the senate
the majority leader serves as the chief representative of their party in the senate and is considered the most powerful member of the senate
they also serve as the chief representative of their party in the entire congress if the house of representatives and thus the office of the speaker of the house is controlled by the opposition party
the senate s executive and legislative business is also managed and scheduled by the majority leader
the assistant majority leader and assistant minority leader of the united states senate commonly called whips are the second ranking members of each party s leadership
the main function of the majority and minority whips is to gather votes of their respective parties on major issues
as the second ranking members of senate leadership if there is no floor leader present the whip may become acting floor leader
the senate is currently composed of republicans democrats and independents both of whom caucus with the democrats
the current leaders are senators chuck schumer d of new york and mitch mcconnell r of kentucky
the current assistant leaders or whips are senators dick durbin d of illinois and john thune r of south dakota
by at least the senate and house republican conferences and the senate and house democratic caucuses began naming chairs and while conference and caucus chairs carried very little authority the senate party floor leader positions arose from the position of conference chair
senate democrats began the practice of electing their floor leaders in while they were in the minority
john w
kern was a democratic senator from indiana
while the title was not official the senate website identifies kern as the first senate party leader serving in that capacity from through and in turn the first senate democratic leader while serving concurrently as chairman of the senate democratic caucus
in the republicans who were in the majority at the time also adopted this language when charles curtis became the first official majority leader although his immediate predecessor henry cabot lodge is considered the first unofficial senate majority leader
the united states constitution designates the vice president of the united states as president of the senate
the constitution also calls for a president pro tempore to serve as the presiding officer when the president of the senate the vice president is absent
in practice neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore customarily the most senior longest serving senator in the majority party actually presides over the senate on a daily basis that task is given to junior senators of the majority party
since the vice president may be of a different party from the majority and is not a senate member subject to discipline the rules of procedure of the senate give the vice president no power beyond the presiding role
for these reasons it is the majority leader who in practice manages the senate
this is in contrast to the house of representatives where the elected speaker of the house has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on legislative bills
