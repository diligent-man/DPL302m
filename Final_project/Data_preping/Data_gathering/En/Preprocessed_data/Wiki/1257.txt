The Defense Intelligence Agency DIA is an intelligence agency and combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense specializing in defense and military intelligence
A component of the Department of Defense DoD and the Intelligence Community IC DIA informs national civilian and defense policymakers about the military intentions and capabilities of foreign governments and non state actors It also provides intelligence assistance integration and coordination across uniformed military service intelligence components which remain structurally separate from DIA The agency's role encompasses the collection and analysis of military related foreign political economic industrial geographic and medical and health intelligence DIA produces approximately one quarter of all intelligence content that goes into the President's Daily Brief
DIA's intelligence operations extend beyond the zones of combat and approximately half of its employees serve overseas at hundreds of locations and in US embassies in countries The agency specializes in the collection and analysis of human source intelligence HUMINT both overt and clandestine while also handling US military diplomatic relations abroad DIA concurrently serves as the national manager for the highly technical measurement and signature intelligence MASINT and as the Defense Department manager for counterintelligence programs The agency has no law enforcement authority contrary to occasional portrayals in American popular culture
DIA is a national level intelligence organization that does not belong to a single military element or within the traditional chain of command instead answering to the Secretary of Defense directly through the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Three quarters of the agency's employees are career civilians who are experts in various fields of defense and military interest or application and although no military background is required of agency employees have some past military service DIA has a tradition of marking unclassified deaths of its employees on the organization's Memorial Wall
Established in under President John F Kennedy by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara DIA was involved in US intelligence efforts throughout the Cold War and rapidly expanded both in size and scope after the September attacks Because of the sensitive nature of its work the spy organization has been embroiled in numerous controversies including those related to its intelligence gathering activities to its role in torture as well as to attempts to expand its activities on US soil
The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency is an intelligence officer who upon nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate serves as the nation's highest ranking military intelligence officer He or she is the primary intelligence adviser to the Secretary of Defense and also answers to the Director of National Intelligence The Director is also the Commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance a subordinate command of United States Strategic Command which is headquartered in Omaha Nebraska Additionally he or she chairs the Military Intelligence Board which coordinates activities of the entire defense intelligence community
DIA is headquartered in Washington DC on Joint Base Anacostia Bolling with major operational activities at the Pentagon and at each Unified Combatant Command as well as in more than a hundred US embassies around the world where it deploys alongside other government partners eg the CIA and also operates the US Defense Attache Offices Additionally the agency has staff deployed at the Col James N Rowe Building at Rivanna Station in Charlottesville Virginia National Center for Medical Intelligence NCMI in Fort Detrick Maryland Missile and Space Intelligence Center MSIC in Huntsville Alabama Russell Knox Building on Marine Corps Base Quantico National Center for Credibility Assessment at Fort Jackson South Carolina and Defense Intelligence Support Center DISC in Reston Virginia DIA also recently completed the renovation of Intelligence Community Campus Bethesda in Maryland which serves as the new location of the National Intelligence University as well as a facility for DIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
DIA and the Central Intelligence Agency CIA are distinct organizations with different functions DIA focuses on national level defense military topics while CIA is concentrated on broader more general intelligence needs of the President and Cabinet Additionally due to DIA's designation as a combat support agency it has special responsibilities in meeting intelligence requirements specifically for the Secretary of Defense the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combatant Commanders both in peace and at war Although there are misconceptions in the media and public about the DIA CIA rivalry the two agencies have a mutually beneficial relationship and division of labor According to a former senior US official who worked with both agencies the CIA doesn't want to be looking for surface to air missiles in Libya while it is also tasked with evaluating the Syrian opposition CIA and DIA Operations Officers all go through the same type of clandestine training at an interagency Defense installation under CIA administration best known in popular culture by its CIA nickname The Farm
DIA is not a collective of all US military intelligence units and the work it performs is not in lieu of that falling under intelligence components of individual services Unlike the Russian GRU which encompasses equivalents of nearly all joint US military intelligence operations DIA assists and coordinates the activities of individual service level intelligence units ie AF INSCOM etc but they nevertheless remain separate entities As a general rule DIA handles national level long term and strategic intelligence needs whereas service level intelligence components handle tactical short term goals pertinent to their respective services DIA does however lead coordination efforts with the military intelligence units and with the national DOD intelligence services NSA NGA NRO in its role as chair of the Military Intelligence Board and through the co located Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance
DIA is organized into four directorates and five regional centers
Defense Clandestine Service DCS DCS conducts clandestine espionage activities around the world and is the executive agent for human intelligence operations throughout the Department of Defense Staffed by civilian and military personnel the DCS is a consolidation of the former Defense Human Intelligence Service and works in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Operations among other national HUMINT entities It globally deploys teams of case officers interrogation experts field analysts linguists technical specialists and special operations forces
Defense Attache System DAS DAS represents the United States in defense and military diplomatic relations with foreign governments worldwide It also manages and conducts overt human intelligence collection activities Defense Attaches serve from Defense Attache Offices DAO co located at more than a hundred United States Embassies in foreign nations represent the Secretary of Defense in diplomatic relations with foreign governments and militaries and coordinate military activities with partner nations
Defense Cover Office DCO DCO is a DIA component responsible for executing cover programs for agency's intelligence officers as well as those for the entire Department of DefenseDirectorate for Analysis The Directorate of Analysis manages the all source analysis elements of DIA Analysts analyze and disseminate finalized intelligence products focusing on national strategic and operational level military issues that may arise from worldwide political economic medical natural or other related processes Analysts contribute to the President's Daily Brief and the National Intelligence Estimates Analysts serve DIA in all of the agency's facilities and DIA has the most forward deployed analysts in the Intelligence Community
Directorate for Science and Technology The Directorate for Science and Technology manages DIA's technical assets and personnel These assets gather and analyze Measurement and Signature Intelligence which is a technical intelligence discipline that serves to detect track identify or describe the signatures distinctive characteristics of fixed or dynamic target sources This often includes radar intelligence acoustic intelligence nuclear intelligence and chemical and biological intelligence DIA is designated the national manager for MASINT collection within the United States Intelligence Community coordinating all MASINT gathering across agencies DIA is also the national manager of the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System JWICS the central Top SecretSensitive Compartmented Information TSSCI processing network for the United States and Stone Ghost a network for US and partner nations
Directorate for Mission Services The Directorate for Mission Services provides administrative technical and programmatic support to the agency's domestic and global operations and analytic efforts This includes providing counterintelligence to the agency as well as serving as the counterintelligence executive agent for the Department of Defense
Centers DIA is divided into four regional centers and one functional center which manage the agency's efforts in these areas of responsibility These centers are the Americas Center the AsiaPacific Center the EuropeEurasia Center the Middle EastAfrica Center and the Defense Combating Terrorism Center DIA also manages Community wide centers such as the National Center for Medical Intelligence the Missile and Space Intelligence Center the National Media Exploitation Center and the Underground Facilities Analysis Center UFAC
Further DIA is responsible for administering the JIOCEUR and various Joint Intelligence Centers which serve and are co located with each of the Unified Combatant Commands Additionally DIA manages the Directorate for Intelligence Joint Staff J which advises and supports the Joint Chiefs of Staff with foreign military intelligence for defense policy and war planning
DIA also manages the National Intelligence University NIU on behalf of the Intelligence Community NIU and the John T Hughes Library is housed at the Intelligence Community campus in Bethesda Maryland and has several branch campuses at RAF Molesworth MacDill Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Quantico as well as academic programs at the NSA and NGA
The DIA has its own police force established in made up of federal officers who protect DIA people and property DIA Police provide law enforcement and police services emergency response and physical security at DIA campuses
DIA Police have sworn uniformed officers that protect and police the six DIA sitesHeadquarters Reston Charlottesville DIA Logistics Operation Center National Center for Medical Intelligence and Missile and Space Intelligence Center
DIA Police has Special Agents that carry out security investigations
DIA Police Officers are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center for three months before being certified
DIA Police operate under the US Marshal's Office Special Deputation and jurisdictional and functional authority within the District of Columbia under a cooperative agreement with the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia
DIA Police have the following rank structure
CaptainDIA Police have K HAZMAT SRT and also support DIA field operations
Due to the sensitive nature of DIA's work all of its personnel including interns and contractors are subject to the same security standards and must obtain a Top Secret clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information TSSCI access Collateral Top Secret clearances granted by the DoD are not sufficient to grant access to DIA's SCI information Additionally the SCI access granted by other intelligence agencies such as CIA or NSA do not transfer to DIA and vice versa
In addition to the rigorous background investigations psychological and drug screening as well as security interviews DIA requires that its applicants pass the agency polygraph In fact DIA exercises operational control over the National Center for Credibility Assessment NCCA which establishes polygraphing standards and trains polygraphers for placement across the entire intelligence community In the agency started expanding its polygraph program in an attempt to screen prospective and current employees every year This was a several fold increase from when according to information provided to Congress DIA conducted polygraphs According to the unclassified DIA document cited in the news report since the mid s the agency started hiring contract polygraphers in addition to the permanent DIA polygraphers and added polygraphing studios to those the spy organization already operated This expanded polygraph screening at DIA continued notwithstanding documented technical problems discovered in the Lafayette computerized polygraph system used by the agency the organization allegedly refused to change the flawed Lafayette polygraph but declined to comment as to the reasoning
Unlike the CIA and NSA polygraphs DIA polygraphs are only of Counterintelligence Scope CI rather than Full Scope FS also known as Expanded Scope Screening or ESS which is ostensibly more intrusive as far as one's personal life is concerned DIA administered only a handful of FS polygraphs and only for those personnel who were to be detailed to the CIA Additionally DIA conducted a handful of FS polygraphs on its personnel remaining overseas in excess of years although this practice appeared to be outside the scope of DIA's authorization at the time
Like with other intelligence agencies failing to pass the DIA polygraph is a virtual guarantee that an applicant will be judged unsuitable for agency employment In fact according to a report published by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense of Intelligence while the usually more stringent NSA is willing to give its applicants several shots at passing the polygraph DIA tends to give one or at most two opportunities to clear the test after which the employment offer is rescinded The same report recommended that DIA seek permanent authority to conduct more intrusive Expanded Scope Screenings due to their supposed usefulness in eliciting admissions from applicants
Also like in other intelligence agencies employees are required to take periodic polygraph examinations throughout their careers No unfavorable administrative actions shall be taken against them however based entirely on their results
DIA's budget and exact personnel numbers are classified Classified Information is not willingly revealed to the public or with anyone that has does not have a need to know verified The agency does reveal that currently it has approximately employees two thirds of whom are civilians and approximately of whom work at more than overseas locations In it was revealed that DIA requested approximately billion in funding for the period of billion inflation adjusted averaging million per year billion inflation adjusted The agency however has nearly doubled in size since then and also assumed additional responsibilities from various intelligence elements from across the Department of Defense CIA and wider intelligence community In at the height of Donald Rumsfeld's push to further expand the scope of military intelligence beyond tactical considerations DIA was estimated to receive up to billion annually
According to classified documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published by The Washington Post in the National Intelligence Program NIP component of the overall US intelligence budget contained approximately billionyear for the General Defense Intelligence Program GDIP which is managed by DIA even as it is not exclusively for the agency's use The numbers exclude the Military Intelligence Component MIP of the overall US intelligence budget which by itself has averaged more than billion per year in the past decade
DIA is one of a few US federal organizations such as the CIA and FBI that rely on human espionage to collect information For this reason the agency has been involved in numerous espionage events over the course of decades
Victor Kaliadin Russian Виктор Калядин a CEO of a Russian company Elers Electron who in was sentenced to years in prison for selling a ring run by a DIA agent technical information on Arena the Russian active protection system for tanks He died of his fourth heart attack in Igor Sutyagin Russian arms control and nuclear weapons specialist convicted in of spying for DIA Released in in exchange for Russian spies arrested in the US during the break up of the Illegals Program Denies any involvement in spying
Edmond Pope A retired intelligence officer turned businessman sentenced by a Russian court in to years for buying up and smuggling classified military equipment out of the country as scrap metal He was soon pardoned by newly elected Vladimir Putin but continues to assert that the Russian authorities used him as a scapegoat for their broken system In the same interview with Larry King however he spoke of a plot by unspecified people in the US as part of which Pope was being slowly poisoned in the Lefortovo Prison with the hopes that he would eventually have to be transferred to a hospital abducted on his way and smuggled out of the country he claims that his representatives stopped the plot
Jerzy Strawa a Polish engineer and an employee of the Ministry of Foreign Trade executed in at Mokotów Prison for passing industrial and defense information to DIA agents while on official trips in Austria and West Germany
Natan Sharansky a former high ranking Israeli politician and Soviet dissident who during his life in Russia was sentenced to years of prison with hard labor for spying for DIA The prosecution alleged that he gave a DIA agent in journalist's disguise—Robert Toth—a list of people who had access to military and other secrets Sharansky was released in following a spy exchange that took place on the Glienicke Bridge between the USSR and the Western allies In he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
Charles Dennis McKee a DIA officer who along with CIA's Matthew Gannon died as a result of the Pan Am Flight bombing The incident produced numerous conspiracy theories that the flight was bombed because the officers were aware of illicit US intelligence drug activities or that the case was related to them trying to secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon He is notably absent from DIA's memorial wall belowAna Belén Montes a senior DIA analyst arrested in for spying for the G of Cuba and sentenced to years in prison Prosecutors alleged that she started spying in the mid s around the same time when CIA's Aldrich Ames started his interaction with the KGB
Ronald Montaperto a senior DIA intelligence analyst who pled guilty in for giving classified information to China's MSS Montaperto claimed that he was tricked and served only three months in jail due to letters of support from other pro China intelligence analysts pejoratively known as the Red Team who harshly criticize anyone who raises questions about the threat posed by Beijing's communist regime One of such supporters Lonnie Henley was initially reprimanded by the ODNI for his support of Montaperto but was later promoted to acting national intelligence officer for East Asia
Waldo H Dubberstein a senior DIA intelligence officer for the Middle East and an associate of CIA arms smuggler Edwin P Wilson who was indicted in for selling DIA secrets to Libya The day after being charged he was found dead in what was ruled a suicideIn the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's Working Group on interrogations requested that DIA come up with prisoner interrogation techniques for the group's consideration According to the US Senate Armed Services Committee report on the treatment of detainees in US custody DIA began drawing up the list of techniques with the help of its civilian employee a former Guantanamo Interrogation Control Element ICE Chief David Becker Becker claimed that the Working Group members were particularly interested in aggressive methods and that he was encouraged to talk about techniques that
It is unknown to what extent the agency's recommendations were used or for how long but according to the same Senate report the list drawn up by DIA included the use of drugs such as sodium pentothal and Demerol humiliation via female interrogators and sleep deprivation Becker claimed that he recommended the use of drugs due to rumors that another intelligence agency the name of which was redacted in the Senate report had successfully used them in the past According to the analysis of the Office of Defense Inspector General DIA's cited justification for the use of drugs was to relax detainee to cooperative state and that mind altering substances were not used
Some of the more lurid revelations of DIA's alleged harsh interrogations came from FBI officers who conducted their own screenings of detainees in Guantanamo along with other agencies According to one account the interrogators of what was then DIA's Defense Humint Service referenced in FBI correspondence as DHS forced subjects to watch gay porn draped them with the Israeli flag and interrogated them in rooms lit by strobe lights for hours all the while telling prisoners that they were from FBI
The real FBI operatives were concerned that DIA's harsh methods and impersonation of FBI agents would complicate the FBI's ability to do its job properly saying The next time a real Agent tries to talk to that guy you can imagine the result A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI's allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhumane without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers—usually a felony offense
Similar activities transpired at the hands of DIA operatives in Bagram where as recently as the organization ran the so called Black Jail According to a report published by The Atlantic the jail was manned by DIA's DCHC staff who were accused of beating and sexually humiliating high value targets held at the site The detention center outlived the black sites run by the Central Intelligence Agency with DIA allegedly continuing to use restricted interrogation methods in the facility under a secret authorization It is unclear what happened to the secret facility after the transfer of the base to Afghan authorities following several postponements
DIA's harsh interrogation methods at times paled in comparison to those of some US special operations forces In interrogations by Joint Special Operations Command's high value targets special operations task forces including Task Force were so heavy handed and physical with the detainees that two DIA officials complained as a result of which they were threatened and put under surveillance by abusive military interrogators The two DIA officials managed to share their accounts of abuse with the agency leadership prompting DIA Director Lowell Jacoby to write a memo on this topic to the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence
In Canadian electronic music group Skinny Puppy sent the Defense Intelligence Agency a symbolic bill of after finding out that the agency had used their music in Guantanamo during enhanced interrogation deemed torture by some sessions Their music was originally heard at GTMO by a guard who happened to be a fan of Skinny Puppy and could not understand how his favorite music was being used in such a manner Skinny Puppy's songs are characterized by lyrics that call out corporate wrongdoing The songs I heard at GTMO were heavily distorted almost to the point of inaudibility Even so I would never have imagined that Skinny Puppy's music would or could be used for enhanced interrogation The officer conducting interrogation sessions allegedly stating that the Canadian group's songs—which are characterized by relentless drumbeats panicked convulsive riffs synth samples—were very effective for enhanced interrogation
Since mid s DIA has come under scrutiny for requesting new powers to covertly approach and cultivate 'US persons' and even recruit them as informants without disclosing they are doing so on behalf of the US government George Peirce DIA's general counsel told The Washington Post that his agency is not asking for the moon and that DIA officers only want to assess their individual US citizens' suitability as a source person to person while protecting the ID and security of the agency operatives The provision allowing DIA to covertly approach US citizens was reportedly removed from the bill at the request of Senator Ron Wyden It is unclear if the agency has received any additional powers since but it is known that until at least and possibly later DIA's personnel stationed in major US cities have been monitoring the movements and activities—through high tech equipment—of individuals and vehicles this occurred parallel to the NSA's warrantless surveillance that was of similarly dubious legality
In with the consolidation of the new Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center DCHC DIA secured an additional authority to conduct offensive counterintelligence which entails conducting clandestine operations domestically and abroad to thwart what the opposition is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they're trying to get from us While the agency remained vague about the exact meaning of offensive counterintelligence experts opined that it could include planting a mole in a foreign intelligence service passing disinformation to mislead the other side or even disrupting enemy information systems suggesting strong overlap between CI and traditional HUMINT operations
According to the agency Americans spying for a foreign intelligence service would not be covered under this mechanism and that DIA would coordinate in such cases with the FBI which unlike any DIA components at the time is designated a law enforcement agency The media showed particular interest in the domestic aspect of DIA's counterintelligence efforts due to the fact that agency's newly created DCHC had absorbed the former Counterintelligence Field Activity which had become infamous for storing data on American peace activists in the controversial TALON database that was eventually shut down
Anthony Shaffer a former DIA officer has claimed that DIA was aware of and failed to adequately act against one of the organizers of the September attacks prior to the event in what became known as the Able Danger controversy Shaffer's claims were rejected and later his security clearance was revoked with the Pentagon denying any wrongdoing Later Shaffer published his book Operation Dark Heart but upon complaints from DIA and NSA that it included national security information the Defense Department went as far as to buy and destroy the initial copies of the book causing the Streisand effect
In the German government uncovered a far right terrorist group named National Socialist Underground which had been linked to a series of murders including the murder of a police officer A report by Stern claimed German BfV and DIA officers had witnessed the murder of a policewoman during their surveillance of the Sauerland group—an Islamist organization that planned attacks on US military installations in Germany—but that neither of the agencies reported it thus enabling subsequent violent acts by the same criminal entities The magazine cited an unverified DIA report that confirmed the agency's officers were at the site of the incident The authenticity of the alleged DIA observation protocol on which Stern based its report was swiftly denied by the BfV while DIA refused to comment An unnamed US insider expert for intelligence matters told Der Spiegel he deemed it unlikely that DIA could be involved in that type of operation
From World War II until the creation of DIA in the three Military Departments collected produced and distributed their intelligence for individual use This turned out to be duplicative costly and ineffective as each department provided their own often conflicting estimates to the Secretary of Defense and other Federal agencies While the Defense Reorganization Act of aimed to correct these deficiencies the intelligence responsibilities remained unclear the coordination was poor and the results fell short of national reliability and focus As a result of this poor organization President Dwight D Eisenhower appointed the Joint Study Group in to find better ways for organizing the nation's military intelligence activities
Acting on the recommendations of the Joint Study Group Defense Secretary Robert S McNamara advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff JCS of his decision to establish the DIA in February He ordered them to develop a plan that would integrate all the military intelligence of the DoD a move that met strong resistance from the service intelligence units whose commanders viewed DIA as undesirable encroachment on their turf Despite this resistance during the spring and summer of as Cold War tensions flared over the Berlin Wall Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Carroll took the lead in planning and organizing this new agency The JCS published Directive Defense Intelligence Agency on August and DIA began operations with a handful of employees in borrowed office space on October
DIA originally reported to the Secretary through the JCS The new agency's mission was the continuous task of collecting processing evaluating analyzing integrating producing and disseminating military intelligence for DoD and related national stakeholders Other objectives included more efficiently allocating scarce intelligence resources more effectively managing all DoD intelligence activities and eliminating redundancies in facilities organizations and tasks
Following DIA's establishment the Services reluctantly transferred intelligence functions and resources to it on a time phased basis to avoid rapidly degrading the overall effectiveness of defense intelligence A year after its formation in October the agency faced its first major intelligence test during the superpower Cuban Missile Crisis confrontation that developed after Soviet missiles were discovered at bases in Cuba by Air Force spy planes
In late DIA established the Defense Intelligence School now the National Intelligence University and on January it activated a new Production Center Several Service elements were merged to form this production facility which occupied the A and B Buildings at Arlington Hall Station Virginia
The agency also added an Automated Data Processing ADP Center on February a Dissemination Center on March and a Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate on April DIA assumed the staff support functions of the J Joint Staff on July Two years later on July DIA accepted responsibility for the Defense Attaché System—the last function the Services transferred to DIA
During the s DIA analysts focused on China's detonation of an atomic bomb and the launching of its Cultural Revolution increasing unrest among African and South Asian nations fighting in Cyprus and Kashmir and the missile gap between the US and the Soviet Union In the late s crises that tested intelligence responsiveness included the Tet Offensive in Vietnam the Six Day War between Egypt and Israel continuing troubles in Africa particularly Nigeria North Korea's seizure of the USS Pueblo and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
The early s were transitional years as the agency shifted its focus from consolidating its functions to establishing itself as a credible producer of national level intelligence This proved difficult at first since sweeping manpower decrements between and had reduced agency manpower by percent and precipitated mission reductions and a broad organizational restructuring Challenges facing DIA at this time included the rise of Ostpolitik in Germany the emergence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the Middle East and the US incursion into Cambodia from South Vietnam
The agency's reputation grew considerably by the mid s as decision makers increasingly recognized the value of its products Agency analysts in concentrated on Lebanon President Richard Nixon's visit to China the Chilean coup d'état the formation of Sri Lanka and the prisoners of war being held in Southeast Asia Subsequent challenges involved détente the development of arms control agreements the Paris peace talks Vietnam the Yom Kippur War and global energy concerns
Intense Congressional review during created turbulence within the Intelligence Community The Murphy and Rockefeller Commission investigations of charges of intelligence abuse ultimately led to an Executive Order that modified many Intelligence Community functions At the same time with US involvement in Vietnam ending defense intelligence faced a significant decline in resources During this period DIA conducted numerous studies on ways of improving its intelligence products Despite these and other Community wide efforts to improve intelligence support the loss of resources during the s limited the Community's ability to collect and produce timely intelligence and ultimately contributed to intelligence shortcomings in Iran Afghanistan and other strategic areas
Special DIA task forces were set up to monitor crises such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the overthrow of Iranian monarchy and the taking of American hostages from the US embassy in Tehran in Also of serious concern were the Vietnamese takeover in Phnom Penh the China Vietnam border war the overthrow of Idi Amin in Uganda the north south Yemen dispute troubles in Pakistan border clashes between Libya and Egypt the Sandinista takeover in Nicaragua and the Soviet movement of combat troops to Cuba during the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II
Following the promulgation in of Executive Order which restructured the Intelligence Community and better outlined DIA's national and departmental responsibilities the agency was reorganized around five major directorates production operations resources external affairs and J support
By the s DIA had transformed into a fully integrated national level intelligence agency Its flagship publication Soviet Military Power the most comprehensive overview of Soviet military strength and capabilities at the time was met with wide acclaim SMP continued to be produced by DIA as a serialized publication roughly over the next decade In in order to research the flow of technology to the Soviet Union the Reagan Administration created Project Socrates within the agency Over the following years Project Socrates's scope broadened to include monitoring of foreign advanced technology as a whole Project Socrates ended in with Michael Sekora the project's director leaving in protest when the Bush Administration reduced funding
In the Clandestine Services organization designated STAR WATCHER was created under DIA with the mission of conducting intelligence collection on perceived areas of conflict and against potential adversaries in developing countries A critical objective was to create a Joint Services career path for case officers since individual Services were inconsistent in their support of clandestine operations and case officers were routinely sacrificed during reductions in force Ultimately the organization was created to balance CIA's espionage operations which primarily targeted Soviet KGBGRU officers but ignored and were dismissive of Third World targets in areas of potential military conflict
Although there were previous attempts to establish such a DoD level espionage organization there was no authorization document by which it could be established This changed when Gregory Davis a military intelligence officer defined and established a clandestine services program under the US Southern Command's Plan Green The program was then authorized by JCS Chairman John Vessey and sanctioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence SSCI with the sponsorship of Senator Jesse Helms R NC and Senator Barry Goldwater R AZ The Goldwater Nichols DoD Reorganization Act was crafted partly to force military officers to serve in a Joint Services assignment in order to qualify for flag rank—ensuring the future of case officers from each Service The clandestine organization within DIA grew and flourished and was cited by the SSCI for its intelligence achievements Personnel selection and training were rigorous and the case officers were notable for their advanced educations area knowledge and multilingual capabilities The program was partially gutted under President Bill Clinton as he foresaw no conflict which would justify its existence but it was resurrected under President George W Bush
Designated a combat support agency under the Goldwater Nichols Act DIA moved to increase cooperation with the Unified Specified Commands and to begin developing a body of joint intelligence doctrine Intelligence support to US allies in the Middle East intensified as the Iran Iraq War spilled into the Persian Gulf DIA provided significant intelligence support to Operation Earnest Will while closely monitoring incidents such as the Iraqi rocket attack on the USS Stark the destruction of Iranian oil platforms and Iranian attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers The Toyota War between Libya and Chad and the turmoil in Haiti added to DIA's heavy production workload as did unrest in other parts of Latin America Somalia Ethiopia Burma Pakistan and the Philippines
With the end of the Cold War defense intelligence began a period of reevaluation following the fall of the Soviet system in many Eastern European countries the reunification of Germany and ongoing economic reforms in the region In response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August DIA set up an extensive hour crisis management cell designed to tailor national level intelligence support to the coalition forces assembled to expel Iraq from Kuwait By the time Operation Desert Storm began some agency personnel were involved in the intelligence support effort Most of them associated in some way with the national level Joint Intelligence Center JIC which DIA established at The Pentagon to integrate the intelligence being produced throughout the Community DIA sent more than employees into the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations to provide intelligence support
The Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center AFMIC and the Missile and Space Intelligence Center MSIC associated with the Army for over and years respectively became part of DIA in January This was part of the continuing effort to consolidate intelligence production and make it more efficient
On September seven DIA employees lost their lives along with other victims at the Pentagon in a terrorist attack when American Airlines Flight piloted by five Al Qaeda hijackers plowed into the western side of the building as part of the September attacks The death of seven employees at once was the largest combined loss in DIA's history On September DIA dedicated a memorial to the seven employees lost in the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon The memorial is located in the garden at the Defense Intelligence Agency Analysis Center in Washington DC
Since the September attacks DIA has been active in nuclear proliferation intelligence collection and analysis with particular interests in North Korea and Iran as well as counter terrorism DIA was also involved with the intelligence build up to the invasion of Iraq in and was a subject in the Senate Report of Pre war Intelligence on Iraq After the invasion DIA led the Iraq Survey Group to find the alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction The agency has conflicted with the CIA in collection and analysis on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and has often represented the Pentagon in the CIA DoD intelligence rivalry due to DIA's own Clandestine HUMINT collection
In DIA announced an expansion of clandestine collection efforts The newly consolidated Defense Clandestine Service DCS would absorb the Defense HUMINT Service and expand DIA's overseas espionage apparatus to complement the work of corresponding elements at CIA DCS would focus on military intelligence concerns—issues that the CIA has been unable to manage due to lack of personnel expertise or time—and would initially deal with Islamist militia groups in Africa weapons transfers between North Korea and Iran and Chinese military modernization The DCS works in conjunction with CIA's Directorate of Operations and the Joint Special Operations Command in overseas operations
In October the Pentagon said that DIA appointed a British Royal Air Force officer as its first deputy director in charge of improving integration between US intelligence units and spy agencies of other English speaking countries in the Five Eyes alliance This was the first time that a foreign national was appointed to a senior position at a US intelligence agency
Today corporations carry out a large amount of DIA's workload In fiscal year alone such activity included work in DIA's Science Technology Directorate National Media Exploitation Center and Missile Space Intelligence Center Corporations also worked on technology transfer analysis and assessments at DIA's Charlottesville branch planned and analyzed DIA's workforce carried out technical support and conducted polygraph examinations and background investigations
A memorial wall at the DIA headquarters is dedicated to those agency employees who lost their lives in the line of their intelligence work and whose deaths are not classified The wall was first dedicated on December by Director Leonard Perroots It commemorates the profound individual sacrifices made on behalf of the United States by DIA members and acts as a reminder of the selflessness dedication and courage required to confront national challenges
DIA also maintains a memorial in the headquarters courtyard dedicated to personnel lost in the attacks of on the Pentagon Additionally the agency maintains the Torch Bearers Wall at its Headquarters The Torch Bearers award is the highest honor bestowed to former DIA employees and recognizes their exceptional contributions to the agency's mission
Less known than its civilian equivalent or its cryptologic counterpart DIA and its personnel have at times been portrayed in works of American popular culture As with other US foreign intelligence organizations the agency's role has occasionally been confused with those of law enforcement agencies DIA's parent organization the Department of Defense features in fiction and media much more prominently due to the public's greater awareness of its existence and the general association of military organizations with warfare rather than spycraft
The flaming torch and its gold color represent knowledge ie intelligence and the dark background represents the unknown—the area of the truth still sought by the worldwide mission of the agency The two red atomic ellipses symbolize the scientific and technical aspects of intelligence today and of the future The stars and the wreath are adopted from the Department of Defense seal and mean glory and peace respectively which the DoD secures as part of its work
