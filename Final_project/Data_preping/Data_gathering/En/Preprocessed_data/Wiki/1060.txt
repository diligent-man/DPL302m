in economics the long run is a theoretical concept in which all markets are in equilibrium and all prices and quantities have fully adjusted and are in equilibrium
the long run contrasts with the short run in which there are some constraints and markets are not fully in equilibrium
more specifically in microeconomics there are no fixed factors of production in the long run and there is enough time for adjustment so that there are no constraints preventing changing the output level by changing the capital stock or by entering or leaving an industry
this contrasts with the short run where some factors are variable dependent on the quantity produced and others are fixed paid once constraining entry or exit from an industry
in macroeconomics the long run is the period when the general price level contractual wage rates and expectations adjust fully to the state of the economy in contrast to the short run when these variables may not fully adjust
the differentiation between long run and short run economic models did not come into practice until with alfred marshall s publication of his work principles of economics
however there is no hard and fast definition as to what is classified as long or short and mostly relies on the economic perspective being taken
marshall s original introduction of long run and short run economics reflected the long period method that was a common analysis used by classical political economists
however early in the s dissatisfaction with a variety of the conclusions of marshall s original theory led to methods of analysis and introduction of equilibrium notions
classical political economists neoclassical economists keynesian economists all have slightly different interpretations and explanations as to how short run and long run equilibriums are defined reached and what factors influence them
maybe provide some examples of some specific influences
economic theory has employed the long period technique of analysis to examine how production distribution and accumulation take place within a market economy ever since its first appearance in the writings of the th century
according to classical political economists like adam smith the natural or average rates of salaries profits and rent tend to become more uniform as a result of competition
consequently market prices or observed prices tend to gravitate toward their natural levels
in this case according to the classical political economists the divergence between a commodity s provide example of a commodity market and natural price is established by a disparity between the amount provided by producers and the effective demand for it
this gap between the market and natural price indicates that the commodity will likely experience windfall profits or losses
when the supply and the effective demand are in sync the market price would end up corresponding to the natural price
the profit rate earned in that sector is the same as the profit rate earned across the whole economy and it is stated that the conditions of equilibrium will prevail
therefore according to this specific approach supply and demand changes only explain are indicative of the deviation that occur of market from natural prices
the long period technique was once again implemented by the economists who later on developed the neoclassical theory
unlike the classical political economics theory the neoclassical economics theory set distribution pricing and output all at the same time
all of these variables natural or equilibrium values relied heavily on technological conditions of production and were consequently linked to the attainment of a uniform rate of profits in the economy
since its origin the long period method has been used to determine how production distribution and accumulation take place within the economy
in the long run firms change production levels in response to expected economic profits or losses and the land labour capital goods and entrepreneurship vary to reach the minimum level of long run average cost
a generic firm can make the following changes in the long run
enter an industry in response to expected profits
leave an industry in response to losses
increase its plant in response to profits
decrease its plant in response to losses
add or reduce employees in response to profits losses and firm requirementsthe long run is associated with the long run average cost lrac curve in microeconomic models along which a firm would minimize its average cost cost per unit for each respective long run quantity of output
long run marginal cost lrmc is the added cost of providing an additional unit of service or product from changing capacity level to reach the lowest cost associated with that extra output
lrmc equalling price is efficient as to resource allocation in the long run
the concept of long run cost is also used in determining whether the firm will remain in the industry or shut down production there
in long run equilibrium of an industry in which perfect competition prevails the lrmc lrac at the minimum lrac and associated output
the shape of the long run marginal and average costs curves is influenced by the type of returns to scale possibly provide a diagram link that illustrates these critical concepts
the long run is a planning and implementation stage
here a firm may decide that it needs to produce on a larger scale by building a new plant or adding a production line
the firm may decide that new technology should be incorporated into its production process
the firm thus considers all its long run production options and selects the optimal combination of inputs and technology for its long run purposes
the optimal combination of inputs is the least cost combination of inputs for desired level of output when all inputs are variable
once the decisions are made and implemented and production begins the firm is operating in the short run with fixed and variable inputs
another part of the development of planning what a firm may decide if it needs to produce more on a larger scale or not is keynes theory that the level of employment labor oscillates over an average or intermediate period the equilibrium
this level of fixed capital is determined by the effective demand of a good
changes in the economy based on capital variable and fixed cost can be studied by comparing the long run equilibrium to before and after changes in the economy
in the long run consumers are better equipped to forecast their consumption preferences
they have ample time to make decisions and therefore will act with a system style of thinking which is more thought out planned and rational
when consumers act this way their utility and satisfaction improves
all production in real time occurs in the short run
the decisions made by businesses tend to be focused on operational aspects which is defined as specific decisions made to manage the day to day activities in the company
businesses are limited by many things including staff facilities skill sets and technology
hence decisions reflect ways to achieve maximum output given these restrictions
in the short run increases and decreases in variable factors are the only things that can affect the output produced by firms
they could change things such as labour and raw materials
they are not able to change fixed factors such as buildings rent and know how since they are in the early stages of production
firms make decisions with respect to costs
in the short run the variation in output given the current level of personnel and equipment determines the costs along with fixed factors that are unavoidable in the early stages of the firm
therefore costs are both fixed and variable
a standard way of viewing these costs is per unit or the average
economists tend to analyse three costs in the short run average fixed costs average variable costs and average total costs with respect to marginal costs
the average fixed cost curve is a decreasing function because the level of fixed costs remains constant as the output produced increases
both the average variable cost and average total cost curves initially decrease then start to increase
the more variable costs used to increase production and hence more total costs since tc fc vc the more output generated
marginal costs are the cost of producing one more unit of output
it is an increasing function due to the law of diminishing returns which explains that is it more costly in terms of labour and equipment to produce more output
in the short run a profit maximizing firm will
increase production if marginal cost is less than marginal revenue added revenue per additional unit of output
decrease production if marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue
continue producing if average variable cost is less than price per unit even if average total cost is greater than price
shut down if average variable cost is greater than price at each level of outputsthe decisions of the firm impacts consumer decisions
since there are constraints in the short run consumers must make decisions in quick time with respect to their current level of wealth and level of knowledge
this is similar to daniel kahneman s system style of thinking where decisions made are fast intuitively and impulsively
in this time frame consumers may act irrationally and use biases to make decisions
a common bias is the use short cuts known as heuristics
due to differences in various situations and environments heuristics that may be useful in one area may not be useful in other areas and lead to sub optimal decision making and errors
thus it becomes difficult for businesses who are tasked to forecast the demand curves of consumers to make their own ideal decisions
the transition from the short run to the long run may be done by considering some short run equilibrium that is also a long run equilibrium as to supply and demand then comparing that state against a new short run and long run equilibrium state from a change that disturbs equilibrium say in the sales tax rate tracing out the short run adjustment first then the long run adjustment
each is an example of comparative statics
alfred marshall pioneered in comparative static period analysis
he distinguished between the temporary or market period with output fixed the short period and the long period
classic contemporary graphical and formal treatments include those of jacob viner john hicks and paul samuelson
the law is related to a positive slope of the short run marginal cost curve
the usage of long run and short run in macroeconomics differs somewhat from the above microeconomic usage
john maynard keynes in emphasized fundamental factors of a market economy that might result in prolonged periods away from full employment
in later macroeconomic usage the long run is the period in which the price level for the overall economy is completely flexible as to shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply
in addition there is full mobility of labor and capital between sectors of the economy and full capital mobility between nations
in the short run none of these conditions need fully hold
the price level is sticky or fixed in response to changes in aggregate demand or supply capital is not fully mobile between sectors and capital is not fully mobile across countries due to interest rate differences among countries and fixed exchange rates
a famous critique of neglecting short run analysis was by keynes who wrote that in the long run we are all dead referring to the long run proposition of the quantity theory of money for example a doubling of the money supply doubling the price level
the short period equilibria has been sometimes applied to post walrasian equilibria
on other occasions keynes s notion of equilibrium was mostly treated as temporary equilibrium
there were great differences between the post walrath model marshall model and keynes model
the post walrath model gives all capital goods including mobile capital goods whereas in marshall s short term analysis only the fixed factories of a single industry are a figure in keynes s work only the fixed capital goods of the entire economy are given
the term long period equilibrium was often used to refer to post walrasian intertemporal equilibria with futures markets sequences of temporary equilibria and steady growth equilibria
all these show huge ambiguity in the notion of equilibrium
