economics long-run theoretical concept market equilibrium price quantity fully adjusted equilibrium
specifically microeconomics fixed factor production long-run enough time adjustment constraint preventing changing output level changing capital stock entering leaving industry
contrast short-run factor variable dependent quantity produced others fixed paid constraining entry exit industry
macroeconomics long-run period general price level contractual wage rate expectation adjust fully state economy contrast short-run variable may fully adjust
differentiation long-run short-run economic model come practice alfred marshall's publication work principle economics
however hard fast definition classified long short mostly relies economic perspective taken
marshall's original introduction long-run short-run economics reflected long-period method wa common analysis used classical political economists
however early dissatisfaction variety conclusion marshall's original theory led method analysis introduction equilibrium notions
classical political economist neoclassical economist keynesian economist slightly different interpretation explanation short-run long-run equilibrium defined reached factor influence them
economic theory ha employed long-period technique analysis examine production distribution accumulation take place within market economy ever since first appearance writing -century
according classical political economist like adam smith natural average rate salary profit rent tend become uniform result competition
consequently market price observed price tend gravitate toward natural levels
case according classical political economist divergence commodity's provide example commodity market natural price established disparity amount provided producer effective demand it
gap market natural price indicates commodity likely experience windfall profit losses
supply effective demand sync market price would end corresponding natural price
profit rate earned sector profit rate earned across whole economy stated condition equilibrium prevail
therefore according specific approach supply demand change explain indicative deviation occur market natural prices
long-period technique wa implemented economist later developed neoclassical theory
unlike classical political economics theory neoclassical economics theory set distribution pricing output time
variables' natural equilibrium value relied heavily technological condition production consequently linked attainment uniform rate profit economy
since origin long period method ha used determine production distribution accumulation take place within economy
long-run firm change production level response expected economic profit loss land labour capital good entrepreneurship vary reach minimum level long-run average cost
add reduce employee response profitslosses firm requirementsthe long-run associated long-run average cost lrac curve microeconomic model along firm would minimize average cost cost per unit respective long-run quantity output
long-run marginal cost lrmc added cost providing additional unit service product changing capacity level reach lowest cost associated extra output
concept long-run cost also used determining whether firm remain industry shut production there
long-run equilibrium industry perfect competition prevails lrmc lrac minimum lrac associated output
shape long-run marginal average cost curve influenced type return scale''''possibly provide diagram link illustrates critical concepts''''
firm may decide need produce larger scale building new plant adding production line
firm may decide new technology incorporated production process
firm thus considers long-run production option selects optimal combination input technology long-run purposes
optimal combination input least-cost combination input desired level output input variable
decision made implemented production begin firm operating short-run fixed variable inputs
another part development planning firm may decide need produce larger scale keynes theory level employmentlabor oscillates average intermediate period equilibrium
change economy based capital variable fixed cost studied comparing long-run equilibrium change economy
ample time make decision therefore act system style thinking thought-out planned rational
decision made business tend focused operational aspect defined specific decision made manage day day activity company
business limited many thing including staff facility skill-sets technology
hence decision reflect way achieve maximum output given restrictions
short-run increase decrease variable factor thing affect output produced firms
able change fixed factor building rent know-how since early stage production
short-run variation output given current level personnel equipment determines cost along fixed factor unavoidable early stage firm
economist tend analyse three cost short-run average fixed cost average variable cost average total cost respect marginal costs
average fixed cost curve decreasing function level fixed cost remains constant output produced increases
average variable cost average total cost curve initially decrease start increase
variable cost used increase production hence total cost since tcfcvc output generated
increasing function due law diminishing return explains costly term labour equipment produce output
increase production marginal cost le marginal revenue added revenue per additional unit output
continue producing average variable cost le price per unit even average total cost greater price
shut average variable cost greater price level outputsthe decision firm impact consumer decisions
since constraint short-run consumer must make decision quick time respect current level wealth level knowledge
similar daniel kahnemans system style thinking decision made fast intuitively impulsively
time frame consumer may act irrationally use bias make decisions
due difference various situation environment heuristic may useful one area may useful area lead sub-optimal decision making errors
thus becomes difficult business tasked forecast demand curve consumer make ideal decisions
transition short-run long-run may done considering short-run equilibrium also long-run equilibrium supply demand comparing state new short-run long-run equilibrium state change disturbs equilibrium say sales-tax rate tracing short-run adjustment first long-run adjustment
distinguished temporary market period output fixed short period long period
classic contemporary graphical formal treatment include jacob viner john hick paul samuelson
usage long-run short-run macroeconomics differs somewhat microeconomic usage
john maynard keynes emphasized fundamental factor market economy might result prolonged period away full-employment
later macroeconomic usage long-run period price level overall economy completely flexible shift aggregate demand aggregate supply
addition full mobility labor capital sector economy full capital mobility nations
price level sticky fixed response change aggregate demand supply capital fully mobile sector capital fully mobile across country due interest rate difference among country fixed exchange rates
famous critique neglecting short-run analysis wa keynes wrote long run dead referring long-run proposition quantity theory money example doubling money supply doubling price level
occasion keynes notion equilibrium wa mostly treated temporary equilibrium
great difference post-walrath model marshall model keynes model
post-walrath model give capital good including mobile capital good whereas marshall's short-term analysis fixed factory single industry figure keynes's work fixed capital good entire economy given
term long-period equilibrium wa often used refer post-walrasian intertemporal equilibrium future market sequence temporary equilibrium steady-growth equilibria
