he hesitatingly agrees and in the course of her settling in joseph reveals that his heavy set wife has been dead for years due to complications from her diabetes
he also tells hannah that he regrets using the nickname tyrannosaur for his wife
he used it because it reminded joseph of the scene in the film jurassic park where the tyrannosaurus rex could be heard stomping after the children in the film much like how his wife sounded when she was walking up the stairs of their house
at the time he d thought it was funny but he expresses guilt for the way he treated her
after a few days joseph tells her that she is not safe with him and suggests she leave

later that day after attending the wake of an old friend joseph decides to confront james
he takes hannah s keys and goes to her house where he finds james s corpse propped up against the closet door
shocked he returns home and confronts hannah saying that he knows she killed her husband
at first she is confused but then breaks down and reveals that james had been brutally abusing her for a long time
a year later it is revealed that hannah is in prison
joseph tells her in a letter that samuel was mauled by his mother s boyfriend s dog
in retaliation joseph beheaded the dog with a machete
