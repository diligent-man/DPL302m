cochrane review comparing behaviour therapy psychological therapy found equally effective although time evidence base evaluates benefit harm behaviour therapy wa weak
precursor certain fundamental aspect behaviour therapy identified various ancient philosophical tradition particularly stoicism
first use term behaviour modification appears edward thorndike in
article provisional law acquired behavior learning make frequent use term modifying behavior
early research term wa used joseph wolpe's research group
experimental tradition clinical psychology used refer psycho-therapeutic technique derived empirical research
ha since come refer mainly technique increasing adaptive behaviour reinforcement decreasing maladaptive behaviour extinction punishment emphasis former
two related term behaviour therapy applied behaviour analysis
since technique derived behavioural psychology tend effective altering behaviour practitioner consider behaviour modification along behaviour therapy applied behaviour analysis founded behaviourism

possibly first occurrence term behavior therapy wa research project bf
paper talked operant conditioning could used help improve functioning people diagnosed chronic schizophrenia
early pioneer behaviour therapy include joseph wolpe han eysenck
general behaviour therapy seen three distinct point origin south africa wolpe's group united state skinner united kingdom rachman eysenck
eysenck particular viewed behaviour problem interplay personality characteristic environment behaviour
skinner's group united state took operant conditioning focus
operant focus created functional approach assessment intervention focused contingency management token economy behavioural activation

area cognitive component additive effect example evidence suggests cognitive intervention improve result social phobia treatment area enhance treatment led pursuit third generation behaviour therapies
third generation behaviour therapy us basic principle operant respondent psychology couple functional analysis clinical formulationcase conceptualisation verbal behaviour inline view behaviour analysts
research support therapy effective case cognitive therapy overall question still need answers
behavioural approach therapy assumes behaviour associated psychological problem develops process learning affect development behaviours
therefore behaviourist see personality problem way personality wa developed
look behaviour disorder something person ha consider reflects learning ha influenced certain people behave certain way certain situations
behaviour therapy based upon principle classical conditioning developed ivan pavlov operant conditioning developed bf
classical conditioning happens neutral stimulus come right another stimulus trigger reflexive response
idea neutral stimulus whatever stimulus trigger response paired together often enough neutral stimulus produce reflexive response
operant conditioning ha reward punishment either increase decrease certain behaviours
contingency management program direct product research operant conditioning
behavioural therapy based operant respondent principle ha considerable evidence base support usage
approach remains vital area clinical psychology often termed clinical behavior analysis
behavioral psychotherapy ha become increasingly contextual recent years
behavioral psychotherapy ha developed greater interest recent year personality disorder well greater focus acceptance complex case conceptualizations
one current form behavioural psychotherapy functional analytic psychotherapy
functional analytic therapy focus in-session use reinforcement primarily relationally-based therapy
behavioural psychotherapy functional analytic psychotherapy contextual origin nature
functional analytic psychotherapy hold process model research make unique compared traditional behaviour therapy cognitive behavioural therapy
recent functional analytic psychotherapy research effort focusing management aggressive inpatients
behaviour therapist complete functional analysis functional assessment look four important area stimulus organism response consequences
organism involves internal response person like physiological response emotion cognition
behaviour therapist use objective assessment method like structured interview objective psychological test different behavioural rating forms
type assessment used behaviour therapist determine exactly client's problem may establish baseline maladaptive response client may have
baseline therapy continues measure used check client's progress help determine therapy working
behaviour therapist typically ask question tend focused questions
test rorschach inkblot test personality test like mmpi minnesota multiphasic personality inventory commonly used behavioural assessment based personality trait theory assuming person's answer method predict behaviour
behaviour assessment focused observation person behaviour natural environment
behavioural assessment specifically attempt find environmental self-imposed variable are
variable thing allowing person maintain maladaptive feeling thought behaviours
person variable come person's social learning history affect way environment affect person's behaviour
behavioural competence look whether person ha appropriate skill behaviour necessary performing specific response certain situation stimuli
making behavioural assessment behaviour therapist want answer two question different factor environmental psychological maintaining maladaptive behaviour type behaviour therapy technique help individual improve effectively
first question involves looking aspect person summed acronym basic id
acronym stand behaviour affective response sensory reaction imagery cognitive process interpersonal relationship drug use
many problem behaviour therapy functionally analyzed include intimacy couple relationship forgiveness couple chronic pain stress-related behaviour problem adult child person alcohol use disorder anorexia chronic distress substance abuse depression anxiety insomnia obesity
functional analysis ha even applied problem therapist commonly encounter like client resistance partially engaged client involuntary clients
application problem left clinician considerable tool enhancing therapeutic effectiveness
one way enhance therapeutic effectiveness use positive reinforcement operant conditioning
although behaviour therapy based general learning model applied lot different treatment package specifically developed deal problematic behaviours
well known type treatment relaxation training systematic desensitization virtual reality exposure exposure response prevention technique social skill training modelling behavioural rehearsal homework aversion therapy punishment
relaxation training involves client learning lower arousal reduce stress tensing releasing certain muscle group throughout body
systematic desensitization treatment client slowly substitute new learned response maladaptive response moving hierarchy situation involving fear
counter conditioning learning new way change one response another case desensitization substituting maladaptive behaviour relaxing behaviour
exposure response prevention technique also known flooding response prevention general technique therapist expose individual anxiety-provoking stimulus keeping avoidance responses
virtual reality therapy provides realistic computer-based simulation troublesome situations
modelling process involves person subjected watching individual demonstrate behaviour considered adaptive adopted client
exposure involves cue model person well situation certain behaviour way relationship seen appropriateness certain behaviour situation behaviour occurs demonstrated
behavioural rehearsal homework treatment client get desired behaviour therapy session practice record behaviour sessions
aversion therapy punishment technique aversive painful unpleasant stimulus used decrease unwanted behaviour occurring
concerned two procedure procedure used decrease likelihood frequency certain behaviour procedure reduce attractiveness certain behaviour stimulus elicit them
punishment side aversion therapy aversive stimulus presented time negative stimulus stopped time positive stimulus response presented
example type negative stimulus punishment used shock therapy treatment aversive drug treatment well response cost contingent punishment involves taking away reward
applied behaviour analysis using behavioural method modify certain behaviour seen important socially personally
first behaviour analysis focused mainly overt behaviour applied setting
treatment developed way alter relationship overt behaviour consequences
another characteristic applied behaviour analysis behaviour analysis go evaluating treatment effects
individual subject focus study investigation centred one individual treated
third characteristic focus environment doe cause significant behaviour changes
finally last characteristic applied behaviour analysis use technique stem operant classical conditioning providing reinforcement punishment stimulus control learning principle may apply
social skill training teach client skill access reinforcer lessen life punishment
operant conditioning procedure meta-analysis largest effect size training social skill followed modelling coaching social cognitive technique order
social skill training ha empirical support particularly schizophrenia
technique used behaviour therapy contingency contracting response cost token economy biofeedback using shaping grading task assignments
shaping graded task assignment used behaviour need learned complex
complex behaviour need learned broken simpler step person achieve small thing gradually building complex behaviour
step approximates eventual goal help person expand activity gradual way
behaviour used person feel something life changed life's task appear overwhelming
another technique behaviour therapy involves holding client patient accountable behaviour effort change them
called contingency contract formal written contract two people defines specific expected behaviour wish change reward punishment go along behaviour
first must state person get successfully complete desired behaviour
third desired behaviour performed way wa agreed upon contract punishment defined contract must done
fourth person involved complying contract must receive bonuses
last element involves documenting compliance noncompliance using treatment order give person involved consistent feedback target behaviour provision reinforcers
token economy behaviour therapy technique client reinforced token considered type currency used purchase desired reward like able watch television getting snack want perform designated behaviours
order token economy effective must consistency administering program entire staff
instead looking way punish patient deny reward staff ha reinforce positive behaviour client increase occurrence desired behaviour
time token need replaced le tangible reward compliment client prepared leave institution expect get something every time perform desired behaviour
closely related token economy technique called response costs
response cost punishment side token economy loss reward privilege someone performs undesirable behaviour
like token economy technique used mainly institutional therapeutic settings
considerable policy implication inspired behavioural view various form psychopathology
one form behaviour therapy habit reversal training ha found highly effective treating tics
currently greater call behavioural psychologist involved rehabilitation efforts
two large study done faculty health science simon fraser university
indicates behaviour therapy cognitive-behavioural therapy cbt equally effective ocd
cbt ha shown perform slightly better treating co-occurring depression
considerable policy implication inspired behavioural view various form psychopathology
one form behaviour therapy habit reversal training ha found highly effective treating tics
ha development towards combining technique treat psychiatric disorders
cognitive intervention used enhance effect established behavioural intervention based operant classical conditioning
increased effort ha also placed address interpersonal context behaviour
behaviour therapy applied number mental disorder many case effective specific disorder compared others
behaviour therapy technique used deal phobia person may have
desensitization ha also applied issue dealing anger person ha trouble sleeping certain speech disorders
hierarchy go situation make person le anxious nervous thing considered extreme patient
modelling ha used treatment fear snake well fear water
aversive therapy technique used treat sexual deviation well alcohol use disorder
exposure prevention procedure technique used treat people anxiety problem well fear phobias
procedure also used help people dealing anger issue well pathological griever people distressing thought deceased person
virtual reality therapy deal fear height fear flying variety anxiety disorders
vrt ha also applied help people substance abuse problem reduce responsiveness certain cue trigger need use drugs
shaping graded task assignment ha used dealing suicide depressed inhibited individuals
hopelessness involves person reacts responds someone else certain situation perceived powerlessness change situation add hopelessness
person may perceive everything big step smaller start easier person master step
technique ha also applied people dealing agoraphobia fear public place something embarrassing
contingency contracting ha used deal behaviour problem delinquent dealing task behaviour students
token economy used controlled environment found mostly psychiatric hospitals
used help patient different mental illness focus treatment mental illness instead behavioural aspect patient
response cost technique ha used address variety behaviour smoking overeating stuttering psychotic talk
systematic desensitization ha shown successfully treat phobia height driving insect well anxiety person may have
anxiety include social anxiety anxiety public speaking well test anxiety
ha shown use systematic desensitization effective technique applied number problem person may have
using modelling procedure technique often compared another behavioural therapy technique
compared desensitization modelling technique doe appear le effective
however clear greater interaction patient subject modelling greater effectiveness treatment
undergoing exposure therapy person typically need five session ass treatment's effectiveness
five session exposure treatment ha shown provide benefit patient
however still recommended treatment continue beyond initial five sessions
virtual reality therapy vrt ha shown effective fear heights
ha also shown help treatment variety anxiety disorders
due cost associated vrt therapist still awaiting result controlled trial investigating vrt ass application demonstrate best results
suicidal ideation treatment depends severe person's depression sense hopelessness is
thing severe person's response completing small step importance consider success accomplishment
generally without severe depression fear technique ha successful completion simpler activity build confidence allows progress complex situations
contingency contract seen effective changing undesired behaviour individuals
ha seen effective treating behaviour problem delinquent regardless specific characteristic contract
token economy shown effective treating patient psychiatric ward chronic schizophrenia
response cost ha shown work suppressing variety behaviour smoking overeating stuttering diverse group clinical population ranging sociopath school children
behaviour suppressed using technique often recover punishment contingency withdrawn
also undesirable side effect usually seen punishment typically found using response cost technique
