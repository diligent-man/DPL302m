Vedic atharvan is cognate with Avestan āθrauuan aθaurun priest but the etymology of the term is not yet conclusively established It was once thought to be etymologically related to the Avestan ātar but that is now considered unlikely Boyce It has been suggested by scholars that the Vedic and Avestan terms are not of Indo European origin and are derived from the BMAC substrate
