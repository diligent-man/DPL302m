Atharvan (अथर्वन्, atharvan-; an n-stem with nominative singular  अथर्वा atharvā) was a legendary Vedic sage (rishi) of Hinduism who along with Angiras is supposed to have authored ("heard") the Atharvaveda
He is also said to have first instituted the fire-sacrifice or yagna
Sometimes he is also reckoned among the seven seers or Saptarishi
His clan is known as the Atharvanas
Atharvan married Shanti, daughter of Kardama rishi, and had a great sage Dadhichi as a son.
He was referred to as a member of the Bhrigu clan.
According to mundaka upanishad and other texts, he was eldest son and (Manasputra) born from mind  of the Brahma.
Vedic atharvan is cognate with Avestan āθrauuan / aθaurun, "priest", but the etymology of the term is not yet conclusively established
It was once thought to be etymologically related to the Avestan ātar, but that is now considered unlikely (Boyce, 2002:16)
It has been suggested by scholars that the Vedic and Avestan terms are not of Indo-European origin, and are derived from the BMAC substrate.
