atharvan atharvan an n stem with nominative singular atharv was a legendary vedic sage rishi of hinduism who along with angiras is supposed to have authored heard the atharvaveda

he was referred to as a member of the bhrigu clan
according to mundaka upanishad and other texts he was eldest son and manasputra born from mind of the brahma
vedic atharvan is cognate with avestan rauuan a aurun priest but the etymology of the term is not yet conclusively established
it was once thought to be etymologically related to the avestan tar but that is now considered unlikely boyce
it has been suggested by scholars that the vedic and avestan terms are not of indo european origin and are derived from the bmac substrate
