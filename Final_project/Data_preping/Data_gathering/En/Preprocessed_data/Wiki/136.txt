thomas wolsey c march november was an english statesman and catholic bishop
when henry viii became king of england in wolsey became the king s almoner
wolsey s affairs prospered and by he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state
he also held important ecclesiastical appointments
these included the archbishopric of york the second most important role in the english church and that of papal legate
his appointment as a cardinal by pope leo x in gave him precedence over all other english clergy
the highest political position wolsey attained was lord chancellor the king s chief adviser formally as his successor and disciple thomas cromwell was not
in that position he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an alter rex other king
after failing to negotiate an annulment of henry s marriage to catherine of aragon wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles
he retreated to york to fulfil his ecclesiastical duties as archbishop a position he nominally held but had neglected during his years in government
he was recalled to london to answer to charges of treason charges henry commonly used against ministers who fell out of his favour but died on the way from natural causes
thomas wolsey was born about the son of robert wolsey of ipswich and his wife joan daundy
widespread traditions identify his father as a butcher his modest origin became a topic of criticism later when he amassed wealth and power that critics thought more befitting a member of the high nobility
wolsey attended ipswich school and magdalen college school before studying theology at magdalen college oxford
on march he was ordained as a priest in marlborough wiltshire and remained in oxford first as the master of magdalen college school and soon the dean of divinity
from to wolsey held a living as rector of st mary s church limington in somerset
in he became a chaplain to henry deane archbishop of canterbury who died the following year
he was then taken into the household of sir richard nanfan who made wolsey executor of his estate
after nanfan s death in wolsey entered the service of king henry vii
wolsey benefited from henry vii s introduction of measures to curb the power of the nobility the king was willing to favour those from more humble backgrounds
henry vii appointed wolsey royal chaplain
in this position wolsey served as secretary to richard foxe who recognised wolsey s ability dedication industry and willingness to take on tedious tasks
wolsey s remarkable rise to power from humble origins attests to his intelligence administrative ability industriousness ambition and rapport with the king
in april wolsey was sent to scotland to discuss with king james iv rumours of the renewal of the auld alliance
wolsey s rise coincided with the accession in april of henry viii whose character policies and attitude to diplomacy differed significantly from his father s
in henry appointed wolsey to the post of almoner a position that gave him a seat on the privy council and an opportunity to attain greater prominence and establish personal rapport with the king
a factor in wolsey s rise was the young henry viii s relative lack of interest in the details of government during his early years
the primary counsellors henry viii inherited from his father were richard foxe c
bishop of winchester and william warham c
archbishop of canterbury
they were cautious and conservative advising the king to act as a careful administrator like his father
henry soon appointed to his privy council men more sympathetic to his own views and inclinations
until wolsey was adamantly antiwar but when the king expressed his enthusiasm for an invasion of france wolsey adapted his views to the king s and gave persuasive speeches to the privy council in favour of war
warham and foxe who did not share the king s enthusiasm for the french war fell from power and wolsey took over as the king s most trusted advisor and administrator
when warham resigned as lord chancellor in probably under pressure from wolsey henry appointed wolsey in his place
wolsey made careful moves to destroy or neutralise other courtiers influence
he helped cause the fall of edward stafford rd duke of buckingham in and in he prosecuted henry s close friend william compton and henry s ex mistress anne stafford countess of huntingdon for adultery
in the case of charles brandon st duke of suffolk wolsey adopted a different strategy attempting to win suffolk s favour by his actions after the duke secretly married henry s sister mary tudor dowager queen of france much to the king s displeasure
wolsey advised the king not to execute the newlyweds but to embrace them whether this was out of care for the couple or because of the threat they posed to his own safety remains unclear
the bride both as sister to henry and as dowager queen of france had high royal status that could have threatened wolsey had she so chosen
wolsey s rise to a position of great secular power paralleled his increasing status in the church
he became a canon of windsor in
in he was made bishop of lincoln and then archbishop of york in the same year
pope leo x made him a cardinal in with the titular church of st cecilia in trastevere
following the success of the english campaign in france and the peace negotiations that followed wolsey s ecclesiastical career advanced further in he became bishop of durham a post with wide political powers and thus became known as prince bishop of durham
the anglo french war gave wolsey a significant opportunity to demonstrate his talents in foreign policy
a convenient justification for going to war came in in the form of a plea for help from pope julius ii who was beginning to feel threatened by france
england formed an alliance with julius king ferdinand v of spain and maximilian i holy roman emperor against king louis xii of france
the first english campaign against france proved unsuccessful partly due to the unreliability of the alliance with ferdinand
henry learned from the mistakes of the campaign and in still with papal support launched a joint attack on france with maximilian successfully capturing two french cities and causing the french to retreat
wolsey s ability to keep a large number of troops supplied and equipped for the duration of the war proved a major factor in the english success
he also had a key role in negotiating the anglo french treaty of august which secured a temporary peace between the two nations
under this treaty louis xii would marry henry s young sister mary
in addition england was able to keep the captured city of tournai and secure an increase in the annual pension france paid
meanwhile a turnover of rulers in europe threatened to diminish england s influence
with henry s sister mary married to louis xii on october an alliance was formed but louis was not in good health
less than three months later he died and was succeeded by the young and ambitious francis i
queen mary had allegedly secured a promise from henry that if louis died she could marry whomever she pleased
following louis s death she secretly married suffolk with francis i s assistance which prevented another marriage alliance
as mary was the only princess henry could use to secure marriage alliances this was a bitter blow
wolsey then proposed an alliance with spain and the holy roman empire against france
the death of ferdinand ii of aragon henry viii s father in law and england s closest ally was a further blow
ferdinand was succeeded by charles v who immediately proposed peace with france
after maximilian i s death in charles was elected in his stead thus charles ruled a substantial portion of europe and english influence became limited on the continent
but wolsey managed to assert english influence by other means
in pope leo x sought peace in europe to form a crusade against the ottoman empire
in wolsey was made papal legate in england enabling him to realise leo s desire for peace by organising the treaty of london
the treaty showed wolsey as the arbiter of europe organising a massive peace summit involving nations
this put england at the forefront of european diplomacy and drew her out of isolation making her a desirable ally
this is well illustrated by the anglo french treaty signed two days afterwards
it was partly this peace treaty that caused conflict between france and spain
in when charles v ascended to the throne of the holy roman emperor king francis i of france was infuriated
he had invested enormous sums in bribing the electorate to elect him emperor and thus used the treaty of london as a justification for the habsburg valois conflict
wolsey appeared to act as mediator between the two powers both of which were vying for england s support
another of wolsey s diplomatic triumphs was the field of the cloth of gold in
wolsey organised much of this grandiose meeting between francis i and henry viii accompanied by followers and involving court activities more than military discussion
though it seemed to open the door to peaceful negotiations with france if the king wished it was also a chance for a lavish display of english wealth and power before the rest of europe through flamboyant celebrations and events such as jousting with the two kings competing though not against each other
with france and spain vying for england s allegiance wolsey could choose the ally that better suited his policies
wolsey chose charles mainly because england s economy would suffer from the loss of the lucrative cloth trade industry between england and the netherlands had france been chosen instead
under wolsey s guidance europe s chief nations sought to outlaw war among christian nations
garrett mattingly who has studied the causes of wars in that era found that treaties of non aggression such as this one could never be stronger than their sponsors armies
when those forces were about equal the treaties typically widened the conflict
that is diplomacy could sometimes postpone war but could not prevent wars based on irreconcilable interests and ambitions
what was lacking mattingly concludes was a neutral power whose judgements were generally accepted either by impartial justice or by overwhelming force
the treaty of london is often regarded as wolsey s finest moment but it was abandoned within a year
wolsey developed links with charles in at the field of the cloth of gold
at the calais conference wolsey signed the secret treaty of bruges with charles v stating that england would join spain in a war against france if france refused to sign the peace treaty and ignored the anglo french treaty of
wolsey s relationship with rome was also ambivalent
despite his links to the papacy wolsey was strictly henry s servant
though the treaty of london was an elaboration on pope leo s ambitions for european peace it was seen in rome as a vain attempt by england to assert her influence over europe and steal some papal thunder
furthermore wolsey s peace initiatives prevented a crusade to the holy land which was the catalyst for the pope s desire for european peace
cardinal lorenzo campeggio who represented the pope at the treaty of london was kept waiting for many months in calais before being allowed to cross the channel and join the festivities in london in what may have been a display by wolsey of his independence of rome
an alternative hypothesis is that campeggio was kept waiting until wolsey received his legacy thus asserting wolsey s attachment to rome
though the english gain from the wars of was minimal their contribution certainly aided charles v in his defeat of the french particularly in at the battle of pavia where charles s army captured francis i
henry then felt there was a realistic opportunity for him to seize the french crown to which the kings of england had long laid claim
parliament however refused to raise taxes
this led wolsey to devise the amicable grant which was met with even more hostility and ultimately led to his downfall
in after charles v had abandoned england as an ally wolsey began to negotiate with france and the treaty of the more was signed during francis i s captivity with the regent of france his mother louise of savoy
the closeness between england and rome can be seen in the formulation of the league of cognac in
though england was not part of it the league was organised in part by wolsey with papal support
wolsey s plan was that the league of cognac an alliance between france and some italian states would challenge charles s league of cambrai
this was both a gesture of allegiance to rome and an answer to growing concerns about charles s dominance over europe
the final blow to this policy came in when the french made peace with charles
meanwhile the french also continued to honour the auld alliance with scotland stirring up hostility on england s border
with peace between france and the emperor there was no one to free the pope from charles who had effectively held pope clement vii captive since the sack of rome
there was thus little hope of securing henry viii an annulment from his marriage to charles s aunt catherine of aragon
since wolsey s desire to secure an annulment for his master had dictated his foreign policy and by none of his endeavours had succeeded
henry s marriage to catherine of aragon had produced no sons who survived infancy the wars of the roses were still within living memory leading to the fear of a power struggle after henry s death
henry felt the people would accept only a male sovereign not his daughter mary
he believed god had cursed him for the sin of marrying the widow of his elder brother and that the papal dispensation for that marriage was invalid because it was based upon the claim that catherine was still a virgin after her first husband s death
henry argued that catherine s claim was not credible and thus the dispensation must be withdrawn and the marriage annulled
his motivation has been attributed to his determination to have a son and heir and to his desire for anne boleyn one of his wife s maids of honour
catherine had no further pregnancies after henry began annulment proceedings in
catherine however maintained that she had been a virgin when she married henry
because she opposed annulment and a return to her previous status as dowager princess of wales the annulment request became a matter of international diplomacy with catherine s nephew charles v pressuring clement not to annul the marriage
clement faced a dilemma he would anger either charles or henry
he delayed his decision as long as possible infuriating henry and anne boleyn who began to doubt wolsey s loyalty to the crown over the church
wolsey appealed to clement for an annulment on three fronts
first he tried to convince the pope that the dispensation was void as the marriage clearly disobeyed instructions in the book of leviticus
second wolsey objected to the dispensation on technical grounds claiming it was incorrectly worded
shortly afterwards a correctly worded version was found in spain third wolsey wanted clement to let the final decision be made in england which as papal legate he would supervise
in clement decided to allow two papal legates to decide the outcome in england wolsey and campeggio
wolsey was confident of the decision but campeggio took a long time to arrive and when he finally did he delayed proceedings so much that the case had to be suspended in july effectively sealing wolsey s fate
during his years as chancellor wolsey had more power than any other crown servant in english history
this led to his being hated by much of the nobility who thought they should have the power
the king protected him from being attacked
sara nair james a professor at mary baldwin college says that in wolsey would be the most powerful man in england except possibly for the king
as long as he was in the king s favour wolsey had great freedom in domestic matters and had his hand in nearly every aspect of them
for much of the time henry viii had complete confidence in him and as henry s interests inclined more towards foreign policy he was willing to give wolsey free rein in reforming the management of domestic affairs for which wolsey had grand plans
historian john guy explains wolsey s methods
operating with the king s firm support and with special powers over the church given by the pope as legate wolsey dominated civic affairs administration the law the church and foreign policy
he was amazingly energetic and far reaching
he built a great fortune for himself and was a major benefactor of arts humanities and education
he projected numerous reforms with some success in areas such as finance taxation educational provision and justice
from the king s perspective his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when henry wanted a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne
historians agree that wolsey was a man dogged by other men s failures and his own ambition
in the end abandoned by the king wolsey was charged with treason but died of natural causes before he could be beheaded
wolsey made changes to the taxation system devising with treasurer of the chamber john heron the subsidy
this form of tax was based upon accurate valuations of the taxpayer s wealth where one shilling was taken per pound from the income
the old fixed tax of ths and ths meant that those who earned very little had to pay almost as much as the wealthy
with the new income tax the poorer members of society paid much less
this more progressive form of taxation enabled wolsey to raise enough money for the king s foreign expeditions bringing in over
he also raised considerable capital through other means such as benevolences and enforced loans from the nobility which yielded in
ultimately wolsey s fiscal policy became increasingly disliked his forced loans and benevolences culminated in the amicable grant
this was met with hostility as the amicable grant provoked full scale revolt in suffolk
the most serious rebellion since cornish rebellion
as a legal administrator wolsey reinvented the equity court where the verdict was decided by the judge on the principle of fairness
as an alternative to the common law courts wolsey re established the position of the prerogative courts of the star chamber and the court of chancery
the system in both courts concentrated on simple inexpensive cases and promised impartial justice
he also established the court of requests although this court was only given this name later on for the poor where no fees were required
wolsey s legal reforms were popular and overflow courts were required to attend to all the cases
many powerful men who had felt invincible under the law found themselves convicted for example in the earl of northumberland was sent to fleet prison and in lord abergavenny was accused of illegal retaining
wolsey also used his courts to tackle national controversies such as the pressing issue of enclosures
the countryside had been thrown into discord by the entrepreneurial actions of landlords enclosing areas of land and converting from arable farming to pastoral farming requiring fewer workers
the tudors valued stability and the resulting mass urban migration represented a serious crisis
wolsey conducted national enquiries into enclosures in and
in the course of his administration he used the court of chancery to prosecute landowners including peers bishops knights religious heads and oxford colleges
enclosures were seen as directly linked to rural unemployment and depopulation vagrancy food shortages and accordingly inflation
this pattern repeated in many of wolsey s other initiatives particularly his quest to abolish enclosure
despite spending significant time and effort investigating the state of the countryside and prosecuting numerous offenders wolsey freely surrendered his policy during the parliament of to ensure that parliament passed his proposed taxes for henry s war in france
enclosures remained a problem for many years
wolsey used the star chamber to enforce his policy of just price which attempted to regulate the price of meat in london and other major cities
those found to be charging too much were prosecuted by the chamber
after the bad harvest of wolsey bought up surplus grain and sold it off cheaply to the needy
this greatly eased disorder and became common practice after a disappointing harvest
in and wolsey used his powers as papal legate to dissolve decayed monasteries where monastic life had virtually ceased in practice some in ipswich and oxford
he used the income to found a grammar school in ipswich the king s school ipswich and cardinal college in oxford in after wolsey s fall the king renamed it king henry viii s college it is now known as christ church
in he began to limit the benefit of clergy
he also attempted as legate to force reform on monastic orders like the augustinian canons
wolsey died five years before henry s dissolution of the monasteries began
wolsey s power depended on maintaining good relations with henry
he grew increasingly suspicious of the minions young influential members of the privy chamber particularly after infiltrating one of his own men into the group
he attempted many times to disperse them from court giving them jobs that took them to the continent and far from henry
after the amicable grant failed the minions began to undermine him again
consequently wolsey devised a grand plan of administrative reforms incorporating the notorious eltham ordinances of
this reduced the members of the privy council from to six removing henry s friends such as sir william compton and nicholas carew
one of wolsey s greatest impediments was his lack of popularity amongst the nobles at court and in parliament
their dislikes and mistrusts partly stemmed from what they saw as wolsey s excessive demands for money in the form of the subsidy or benevolences
they also resented the act of resumption of by which henry vii had resumed possession of all lands granted by the crown since
these lands had passed onto his heir henry viii
many nobles resented the rise to power of a low born man whilst others simply disliked that he monopolised the court and concealed information from the privy council
when mass riots broke out in east anglia which should have been under the control of the dukes of norfolk and suffolk henry was quick to denounce the amicable grant and began to lose faith in wolsey
during the relatively peaceful period in england after the war of the roses its population increased
with more demand for food and no additional supply prices increased
landowners were forced to enclose land and convert to pastoral farming which brought in more profit
wolsey s quest against enclosure was fruitless in terms of restoring economic stability
the same can be said for wolsey s legal reforms
after he made justice accessible to all and encouraged more people to bring cases to court the system was abused
the courts became overloaded with incoherent tenuous cases which would have been far too expensive to have rambled on in the common law courts
wolsey eventually ordered all minor cases out of the star chamber in
the result of this venture was further resentment by the nobility and the gentry
from when he became cardinal until his death wolsey used art and architecture to underpin his positions
he initiated a building campaign on a scale not only unprecedented for an english churchman and lord chancellor but also exceeded by few english kings
in so doing he brought italian renaissance ideas classical embellishments and architectural models into english architecture
scholars generally cite somerset house in london as the first classical building in england built for edward seymour the first duke of somerset and lord protector to king edward vi
but wolsey embraced italian inspired classicism nearly half a century before seymour though more theoretically than visually
wolsey s subsequent disgrace over his failure to garner papal approval of an annulment of henry viii s marriage to catherine of aragon has clouded the fact that he was not only the first high profile patron in england to seek out and promote italian classicism in art architecture and magnificence but also that his contributions endured
among wolsey s projects were lavish classically inspired additions to york palace in london the archbishop of york s residence
he supervised the grandiose temporary buildings at the field of cloth of gold and renovated hampton court which he later relinquished to the king
wolsey s use of architecture as a symbol of power along with his introduction of italian classical ornamentation set a trend continued by henry viii and others
wolsey oversaw tombs for henry s viii s parents at westminster abbey and negotiated contracts for henry viii s tomb as well as one for himself
if these works had been completed as planned they would be among europe s largest most elaborate and grandest tombs
the college originally founded and planned by wolsey and refounded by henry viii christ church remains the largest and grandest of all oxford colleges
as well as his state duties wolsey simultaneously attempted to exert his influence over the church in england
as cardinal and from lifetime papal legate wolsey continually vied for control over others in the church
his principal rival was william warham the archbishop of canterbury who made it more difficult for wolsey to follow through with his plans for reform
despite making promises to reform the bishoprics of england and ireland and in encouraging monasteries to embark on a programme of reform he did nothing to bring about these changes
in spite of having many enemies wolsey retained henry viii s confidence until henry decided to seek an annulment of his marriage to catherine of aragon so that he could marry anne boleyn
wolsey s failure to secure the annulment directly caused his downfall and arrest
it was rumoured that anne boleyn and her faction convinced henry that wolsey was deliberately slowing proceedings as a result he was arrested in and the pope decided that the official decision should be made in rome not england
in wolsey was stripped of his government office and property including his magnificently expanded residence of hampton court which henry took to replace the palace of westminster as his own main london residence
wolsey was permitted to remain archbishop of york
he travelled to yorkshire for the first time in his career but at cawood in north yorkshire he was accused of treason and ordered to london by henry percy th earl of northumberland
in great distress he set out for the capital with his personal chaplain edmund bonner
he fell ill on the journey and died at leicester on november around the age of
just before his death he reputedly spoke these words
in keeping with his practice of erecting magnificent buildings at hampton court westminster and oxford wolsey had planned a magnificent tomb at windsor by benedetto da rovezzano and giovanni da maiano but he was buried in leicester abbey now abbey park without a monument
henry viii contemplated using the impressive black sarcophagus for himself but lord nelson now lies in it in the crypt of st
paul s cathedral
henry often receives credit for artistic patronage that properly belongs to wolsey
wolsey lived in a non canonical marriage for around a decade with a woman called joan larke of yarmouth norfolk
the edict that priests regardless of their functions or the character of their work should remain celibate had not been wholeheartedly accepted in england
wolsey subsequently had two children both before he was made bishop a son thomas wynter born circa and a daughter dorothy born circa both of whom lived to adulthood
the son was sent to live with a family in willesden and tutored in his early years by maurice birchinshaw
he later married and had children of his own
dorothy was adopted by john clansey and was in due course placed in the convent at shaftesbury abbey
following the dissolution of the monasteries under thomas cromwell she was awarded a pension
following his rapid promotion larke became a source of embarrassment to wolsey who arranged for her marriage to george legh of adlington in cheshire circa
he provided the dowry
henry viii had a mansion built for legh at cheshunt great house
wolsey plays a major role in the early stages of the autobiography of henry viii by margaret george
wolsey is the primary antagonist of william shakespeare s henry viii which depicts him as an arrogant power grabber
henry irving walter hampden and john gielgud were well known for their stage performances of the role and timothy west played him in the bbc television shakespeare production of that play
henry irving s reading of wolsey s farewell survives on a rare wax cylinder recording
wolsey is a minor but important character in robert bolt s play a man for all seasons he was played in the two film versions of the play by orson welles and john gielgud respectively
wolsey was portrayed somewhat more sympathetically in the film anne of the thousand days a performance that earned anthony quayle an academy award nomination
wolsey was played by john baskcomb in the six wives of henry viii and by john bryans when the series was made into the film henry viii and his six wives
david suchet plays wolsey in the two part television serial henry viii with ray winstone
terry scott portrayed a comical wolsey in carry on henry
william griffis played wolsey in the broadway musical rex which starred nicol williamson as henry
in the showtime series the tudors sam neill plays wolsey
this production interprets his death as suicide by cutthroat covered up by the king and cromwell out of residual affection for him
wolsey is one of the main characters in hilary mantel s novel wolf hall played by paul jesson in the rsc production and by jonathan pryce in the television serial
he is portrayed through cromwell s eyes as a mentor and a ruthlessly loyal statesman
a desire to avenge wolsey s downfall and ignominious death fuels many of cromwell s actions through the latter half of wolf hall and its sequel bring up the bodies which was incorporated into the stage and television adaptations
in the tve series carlos rey emperador he is portrayed by blai llopis
wolsey appears in the white princess starz season episode played by mark edel hunt
philip cumbus portrays wolsey in the spanish princess a sequel to the white princess before wolsey was removed from power he planned to make his home town of ipswich a seat of learning
he built a substantial college which for two years was parent of the queen elizabeth school or ipswich school which today flourishes on another site
all that remains of wolsey s structure is the former waterside gate figured by
francis grose in his antiquities which can still be seen on college street
in wolsey was commemorated in ipswich with a substantial pageant play he is far from forgotten in the town of ipswich an appeal having been launched in october to erect a statue there as a permanent commemoration
arising from this project a more than life sized bronze statue to cardinal wolsey shown seated facing south towards st peter s church the former mediaeval augustinian priory church of st peter and st paul which wolsey annexed as the chapel of his college of ipswich teaching from a book with a familiar cat at his side was unveiled from beneath a covering flag on june near the site of the wolsey home on st nicholas street ipswich
after a civic procession from the tower church the image created by sculptor david annand was dedicated by blessing in the name of the holy trinity by the bishop of st edmundsbury and ipswich and launched in the civic capacity by the mayor of ipswich in the presence of a crowd of onlookers
a statue of wolsey stands in leicester s abbey park close to the site of his burial
it was donated by the wolsey hosiery company a major employer in the city and also named after the cardinal
the wolsey place shopping centre and woking f c s nickname the cardinals commemorate the fact wolsey was visiting henry viii at woking palace when the news arrived that he had been made a cardinal
