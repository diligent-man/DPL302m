naum gabo kbe born naum neemia pevsner august o s
july august hebrew was an influential sculptor theorist and key figure in russia s post revolution avant garde and the subsequent development of twentieth century sculpture
his work combined geometric abstraction with a dynamic organization of form in small reliefs and constructions monumental public sculpture and pioneering kinetic works that assimilated new materials such as nylon wire lucite and semi transparent materials glass and metal
responding to the scientific and political revolutions of his age gabo led an eventful and peripatetic life moving to berlin paris oslo moscow london and finally the united states and within the circles of the major avant garde movements of the day including cubism futurism constructivism the bauhaus de stijl and the abstraction cr ation group
two preoccupations unique to gabo were his interest in representing negative space released from any closed volume or mass and time
he famously explored the former idea in his linear construction works used nylon filament to create voids or interior spaces as concrete as the elements of solid mass and the latter in his pioneering work kinetic sculpture standing waves often considered the first kinetic work of art
gabo elaborated many of his ideas in the constructivist realistic manifesto which he issued with his brother sculptor antoine pevsner as a handbill accompanying their open air exhibition in moscow
in it he sought to move past cubism and futurism renouncing what he saw as the static decorative use of color line volume and solid mass in favor of a new element he called the kinetic rhythms the basic forms of our perception of real time gabo held a utopian belief in the power of sculpture specifically abstract constructivist sculpture to express human experience and spirituality in tune with modernity social progress and advances in science and technology
after working on a smaller scale in england during the war years gabo moved to the united states where he received several public sculpture commissions only some of which he completed
these include constructie a metre ft commemorative monument in front of the bijenkorf department store unveiled in in rotterdam and revolving torsion a large fountain outside st thomas hospital in london
the tate gallery london held a major retrospective of gabo s work in and holds many key works in its collection as do the museum of modern art and guggenheim museum in new york
work by gabo is also included at rockefeller center in new york city and the governor nelson a
rockefeller empire state plaza art collection in albany new york us
gabo grew up in a jewish family of six children in the provincial russian town of bryansk where his father boris berko pevsner worked as an engineer
his older brother was fellow constructivist artist antoine pevsner gabo changed his name to avoid confusion with him
gabo was a fluent speaker and writer in german french and english in addition to his native russian
his command of several languages contributed greatly to his mobility during his career
as in thought so in feeling a vague communication is no communication at all gabo once remarked
after school in kursk gabo entered munich university in first studying medicine then the natural sciences and attended art history lectures by heinrich w lfflin
in gabo transferred to an engineering school in munich where he discovered abstract art and met wassily kandinsky and in joined his brother antoine who by then was an established painter in paris
gabo s engineering training was key to the development of his sculptural work that often used machined elements
during this time he won acclamations by many critics and awards like the mr and mrs frank g
logan art institute prize at the annual chicago and vicinity exhibition of
after the outbreak of war gabo moved first to copenhagen then oslo with his older brother alexei making his first constructions under the name naum gabo in
these earliest constructions originally in cardboard or wood were figurative such as the head no in the tate collection
he moved back to russia in to become involved in politics and art spending five years in moscow with his brother antoine
gabo contributed to the agit prop open air exhibitions and taught at vkhutemas the higher art and technical workshop with tatlin kandinsky and rodchenko
during this period the reliefs and construction became more geometric and gabo began to experiment with kinetic sculpture though the majority of the work was lost or destroyed
gabo s designs had become increasingly monumental but there was little opportunity to apply them as he commented it was the height of civil war hunger and disorder in russia
to find any part of machinery was next to impossible
gabo wrote and issued jointly with antoine pevsner in august a realistic manifesto proclaiming the tenets of pure constructivism the first time that the term was used
in the manifesto gabo criticized cubism and futurism as not becoming fully abstract arts and stated that the spiritual experience was the root of artistic production
gabo and pevsner promoted the manifesto by staging an exhibition on a bandstand on tverskoy boulevard in moscow and posted the manifesto on hoardings around the city
in germany gabo came into contact with the artists of the de stijl and taught at the bauhaus in
during this period he realised a design for a fountain in dresden since destroyed
gabo and antoine pevsner had a joint exhibition at the galerie percier paris in and the pair designed the set and costumes for diaghilev s ballet la chatte that toured in paris and london
to escape the rise of the nazis in germany the pair stayed in paris in as members of the abstraction creation group with piet mondrian
gabo visited london in and settled in where he found a spirit of optimism and sympathy for his position as an abstract artist
at the outbreak of world war ii he followed his friends barbara hepworth and ben nicholson to st ives in cornwall where he stayed initially with the art critic adrian stokes and his wife margaret mellis
while in cornwall he continued to work albeit on a smaller scale
his influence was important to the development of modernism within st ives and it can be seen most conspicuously in the paintings and constructions of john wells and peter lanyon both of whom developed a softer more pastoral form of constructivism
in gabo and his wife and daughter emigrated to the united states where they resided first in woodbury and later in middlebury connecticut
gabo died in waterbury connecticut in
the essence of gabo s art was the exploration of space which he believed could be done without having to depict mass
his earliest constructions such as head no were formal experiments in depicting the volume of a figure without carrying its mass
gabo s other concern as described in the realistic manifesto was that art needed to exist actively in four dimensions including time
gabo s formative years were in munich where he was inspired by and actively participated in the artistic scientific and philosophical debates of the early years of the th century
because of his involvement in these intellectual debates gabo became a leading figure in moscow s avant garde in post revolution russia
it was in munich that gabo attended the lectures of art historian heinrich w lfflin and gained knowledge of the ideas of einstein and his fellow innovators of scientific theory as well as the philosopher henri bergson
as a student of medicine natural science and engineering his understanding of the order present in the natural world mystically links all creation in the universe
just before the onset of the first world war in gabo discovered contemporary art by reading kandinsky s concerning the spiritual in art which asserted the principles of abstract art
gabo s vision is imaginative and passionate
over the years his exhibitions have generated immense enthusiasm because of the emotional power present in his sculpture
gabo described himself as making images to communicate my feelings of the world in his work gabo used time and space as construction elements and in them solid matter unfolds and becomes beautifully surreal and otherworldly
his sculptures initiate a connection between what is tangible and intangible between what is simplistic in its reality and the unlimited possibilities of intuitive imagination
imaginative as gabo was his practicality lent itself to the conception and production of his works
he devised systems of construction which were not only used for his elegantly elaborate sculptures but were viable for architecture as well
he was also innovative in his works using a wide variety of materials including the earliest plastics fishing line bronze sheets of perspex and boulders
he sometimes even used motors to move the sculpture
caroline collier an authority on gabo s work said the real stuff of gabo s art is not his physical materials but his perception of space time and movement
in the calmness at the still centre of even his smallest works we sense the vastness of space the enormity of his conception time as continuous growth in fact the element of movement in gabo s sculpture is connected to a strong rhythm more implicit and deeper than the chaotic patterns of life itself
the exactness of form leads the viewer to imagine journeying into through over and around his sculptures
gabo wrote his realistic manifesto in which he ascribed his philosophy for his constructive art and his joy at the opportunities opened up by the russian revolution
gabo saw the revolution as the beginning of a renewal of human values
five thousand copies of the manifesto tract were displayed in moscow streets in
gabo had lived through a revolution and two world wars he was also jewish and had fled nazi germany
gabo s acute awareness of turmoil sought out solace in the peacefulness that was so fully realized in his ideal art forms
it was in his sculpture that he evaded all the chaos violence and despair he had survived
gabo chose to look past all that was dark in his life creating sculptures that though fragile are balanced so as to give us a sense of the constructions delicately holding turmoil at bay
gabo began printmaking in when he was persuaded to try out the medium by william ivins a former curator of prints at the metropolitan museum of modern art new york
his first print was a wood engraving in a section of wood taken from a piece of furniture and printed onto a piece of toilet paper
he went on to produce a significant and varied body of graphic work including much more elaborate and lyrical compositions until his death in
rejecting the traditional notion that prints should be made in editions of identical impressions gabo instead preferred to use the monoprint format as a vehicle for artistic experimentation
gabo pioneered the use of plastics such as cellulose acetate in his sculptures
the tate gallery in london which has the world s largest collection of his early works is battling their chemical degradation
they have commissioned replicas of some sculptures to preserve a visual record of their appearances
