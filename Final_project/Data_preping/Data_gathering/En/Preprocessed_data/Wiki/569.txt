the mausoleum of khawaja ahmed yasawi kazakh qoja ahmet i assaui kesenes russian mavzoley khodzhi akhmeda yasavi is a mausoleum in the city of turkestan in southern kazakhstan
the structure was commissioned in by timur who ruled the area as part of the expansive timurid empire to replace a smaller th century mausoleum of the famous turkic poet and sufi mystic khoja ahmed yasawi
however construction was halted with the death of timur in
despite its incomplete state the mausoleum has survived as one of the best preserved of all timurid constructions
its creation marked the beginning of the timurid architectural style
the experimental spatial arrangements innovative architectural solutions for vault and dome constructions and ornamentations using glazed tiles made the structure the prototype for this distinctive art which spread across the empire and beyond
the religious structure continues to draw pilgrims from across central asia and has come to epitomize the kazakh national identity
it has been protected as a national monument while unesco recognized it as the country s first site of patrimony declaring it a world heritage site in
the mausoleum of khawaja ahmed yasawi is situated in the north eastern part of the modern day town of turkestan formerly known as hazrat e turkestan an ancient centre of caravan trade known earlier as khazret and later as yasi in the southern part of kazakhstan
the structure is within the vicinity of a historic citadel which is now an archaeological site
remains of medieval structures such as other mausoleums mosques and bath houses characterize the archaeological area
to the north of the mausoleum of khawaja ahmed yasawi a reconstructed section of the citadel wall from the s separates the historical area from the developments of the modern town
khoja ahmed yasawi khawaja or khwaja persian pronounced kh je corresponds to master whence arabic khaw jah also spelled as khawajah akhmet yassawi was the th century head of a regional school of sufism a mystic movement in islam which began in the th century
he was born in ispidjab modern sayram in and spent most of his life in yasi dying there in
he is widely revered in central asia and the turkic speaking world for popularizing sufism which sustained the diffusion of islam in the area despite the contemporary onslaught of the mongol invasion
the theological school he created turned yasi into the most important medieval enlightening center of the area
he was also an outstanding poet philosopher and statesman
yasawi was interred in a small mausoleum which became a pilgrimage site for muslims
the town of yasi was largely spared during the mongol invasion of khwarezmia in the th century
overtime the descendants of the mongols settled in the area and converted to islam
the town then came under the control of the timurid dynasty in the s
timur tamerlane the founder of the dynasty expanded the empire s realm to include mesopotamia iran and all of transoxiana with its capital located in samarkand
to gain the support of local citizens timur adopted the policy of constructing monumental public and cult buildings
in yasi he put his attention to the construction of a larger mausoleum to house yasawi s remains with the intention of glorifying islam promoting its further dissemination and improving the governance of the immediate areas
the new mausoleum was begun in
timur imported builders from cities which he laid waste during his campaigns including mosaic workers from shiraz and stonemasons and stucco workers from isfahan
the master builders were led by khwaja hosein shirazi from iran
it was reported that timur himself participated in the design of the structure where he introduced experimental spatial arrangements types of vaults and domes
these innovations were later implemented in the religious edifices of other cities
however the mausoleum was left unfinished when timur died in
when the timurid empire disintegrated control of the immediate territory passed on to the kazakh khanate which made yasi then renamed turkestan its capital in the th century
the khans turkic for ruler sought to strengthen the political and religious importance of turkestan to unify the nomadic tribes within the young state
hence as the khanate s political center ceremonies for the elevation of the khans to the throne and missions from neighboring states were received in turkestan
the kazakh nobility also held their most important meetings to decide state related matters in the capital
the town situated on the border of the nomadic and settled cultures flourished as the khanate s largest trade and craft center
fortifications were erected to safeguard this commercial role including the th century construction of defensive walls around the unfinished mausoleum which became an important landmark and pilgrimage center of the town
in the succeeding centuries turkestan and its historic monuments became connected with the idea of the kazakh state system
political struggles and the shift in overland trade in favor of maritime routes soon led to the town s decline before it finally passed on to the russian empire in
the town was eventually deserted a new town center was developed west of the area built around a new railway station
the territory came under soviet rule by the th century
the new administration carried out preservation and restoration work on site although they considered it more as an architectural rather than a spiritual structure
hence the mausoleum was closed to the devotees who came to pay homage to yasawi
nevertheless the local khoja based at the mausoleum allowed pilgrims to secretly enter the structure at night
beginning in several commissions took part in the technical investigation of the building
regular maintenance has been in place beginning in while a series of restoration campaigns were started in with the last one being held from to
among the latest conservation steps implemented were the replacement of the structure s clay foundation with reinforced concrete the consolidation of walls the waterproofing of the roofs and the layering of new tiles based on historic designs and patterns on the domes
the continuous conservation works have been in place when kazakhstan gained its independence
the building is protected as a national monument and is included on the list of national properties of kazakhstan
the site is under the administration of the azret sultan state historical and cultural reserve museum in charge with the safeguarding research conservation monitoring and maintenance of the mausoleum
the unfinished state of the mausoleum of khawaja ahmed yasawi especially at the entrance portal and sections of the interior allow for the better architectural scrutiny of how the monument was designed and constructed
the structure is rectangular in plan measuring m ft and is m ft high
it is oriented from the south east to the north west
the primary material used for the building is ganch fired brick mixed with mortar gypsum and clay which was made in a plant located in sauran
layers of clay reaching a depth of m ft to prevent the water penetration were used for the original foundation
these were replaced with reinforced concrete in modern restoration works
the main entrance to the mausoleum is from the south east through which visitors are ushered into the m ft main hall known as kazandyk the copper room
the section is covered by the largest existing brick dome in central asia also measuring m ft in diameter
at the center of the kazandyk is a bronze cauldron used for religious purposes
the tomb of yasawi is situated on the central axis at the end of the building in the northwest with the sarcophagus located exactly at the center of the section which has a double dome ribbed roof the inner dome being m ft high and the outer dome being m ft high
the dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green glazed tiles with gold patterns
the interior is adorned with alabaster stalactites known as muqarnas
additional rooms in the structure totaling more than include meeting rooms a refectory a library and a mosque which had light blue geometric and floral ornaments on its walls
the mausoleum s exterior walls are covered in glazed tiles constituting geometric patterns with kufic and suls epigraphic ornaments derived from the qur an
initial plans also called for the addition of two minarets but this was not realized when construction was halted in
the construction of the mausoleum provided important advances in building technology displaying unsurpassed records of all kinds in terms of its vaulted constructions and artistic innovations
the achievements derived from the mausoleum s erection together with the timurids patronage of music calligraphy persian miniature painting literature and various scientific pursuits gave birth to a distinct islamic artistic style to be known as timurid
the spacious structure employed a radially symmetrical plan for spatial arrangement
the visual balance created by the precise construction became a characteristic aesthetic feature of timurid buildings one which would famously be adopted by the mughal architecture of india especially in the gardens and structures of humayun s tomb and taj mahal both commissioned by descendants of timur
the double dome technique executed in the mausoleum made possible the huge domes of the timurid era
the dome is created by employing a squinch or corner bracketing that allows for the transition from a square octagonal or sided base to a dome top
indeed the mausoleum s main dome remains the largest existing brick dome in central asia
the use of glazed tiles mosaics patterned brickwork and islamic calligraphy was also influential
advances in pottery techniques allowed for the mass production of glazed tiles used for various decorative functions
among the techniques devised for tile decoration are
banna i technique the builder s technique consists of revetment of glazed bricks set within unglazed ones to form geometric patterns
haftrangi a technique that permits the creation of multi colored patterns on the same tile before firing without letting the colors mix
faience a patterned arrangement of closely fitted small pieces of tiles which have surface glaze of different colorsthe employment of tiles and muqarnas bear strong influence from iran where many of timur s architects were from
the covered surfaces create visual effects based on how the observer would view the building and read the calligraphic messages
the tile work was also used to obscure the structural joints of the building
the use of turquoise and azure blue as the prominent color of choice for many structures were meant to contrast with the bright sunlight of the central asian desert
the mausoleum s construction at a time when many other central asian settlements had been experiencing building sprees under timur s political ideology allowed for the exchange of ideas and techniques across the empire
master builders and laborers from the conquered cities congregated to build projects
the employment of persian architects in leading the major construction activities resulted in the introduction of persian elements in the timurid style
this and the timurids general patronage of the arts have made them the greatest patrons of iranian culture
the landmark architectural and artistic solutions realized in the erection of the mausoleum of khoja ahmed yasawi were immediately utilized in other building endeavors such as contemporary works in samarkand herat meshed khargird tayabad baku and tabriz
it is thought that the peak of timurid architecture could be found in the buildings of samarkand
timur filled his capital with both secular and religious monuments as well as a plethora of gardens which featured stone walls and floors with elaborate patterns and palaces outfitted with gold silk and carpets
among these are
bibi khanum mosque the world s largest mosque when it was completed in it displays timur s concern for monumental effect and theatrical arrangement
gur i amir mausoleum the burial place of timur it contains a double shell dome for the achievement of a vertical effect
shah i zinda complex a funerary complex presenting the pinnacle of every tile technique known to the timurids
registan considered the pinnacle of timurid architecture a broad plaza fronted by the towering edifices of three madrassas islamic schools even if none of them were commissioned by timur himself and were built in a later period by ulug beg and governor yalangtush the mausoleum is thus seen as a prototype marking the beginning of a new architectural style which culminated in the monuments of samarkand but was also continuously developed as in the case of india s mughal architecture
indeed the timurids outstanding achievement in architecture is encapsulated in an arab proverb from one of timur s buildings if you want to know about us observe our buildings it is also for this reason that unesco has recognized the mausoleum as a world heritage site in following the same international recognition for the sites of samarkand humayun s tomb and taj mahal
the larger mausoleum which timurid ordered further enhanced the shrine s religious importance
during the kazakh khanate prominent personalities chose to be buried within the immediate vicinity of the monument
among these are abulkhair rabi i sultan begim zholbarys khan esim khan ondan sultan the son of shygai khan ablai khan kaz dauysty kazbek bi
the mausoleum s holy reputation also reached foreign lands
in the early th century ubaydullah khan the successor to muhammad shaybani kahn of the neighboring uzbek khanate stopped at the mausoleum before his battle against babur who would later become the founder of the mughal empire
he swore that if he were to emerge victorious his rule would fully follow the sharia law
despite the public closure of the monument during the soviet era the mausoleum has continued to draw pilgrims once the order was lifted
up to contemporary times the mausoleum of khoja ahmed yasawi has remained an object of pilgrimage for kazakh muslims
hence the town of turkestan became the second mecca for the muslims of central asia
indeed the mausoleum s importance to the town is attested by turkestan s former name hazrat e turkestan which literally means saint of turkestan a direct reference to yasawi
as the capital of the preceding kazakh khanate which saw the emergence of the distinct kazakh nationality turkestan remains the cultural heart of modern kazakhstan
being the burial site for the sufi theologian and the khanate s kazakh nobility the mausoleum has further enhanced the town s prestige
the continuance of the kazakh nation and central asian islamic faith in modern times are testaments to the historical and cultural importance of turkestan with the mausoleum of khoja ahmed yasawi at its center
perceived as one of the greatest mausoleums of the islamic world it has survived and remains a significant monument both to faith and architectural achievement in the region
