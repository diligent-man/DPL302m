Tumor necrosis factor TNF cachexin or cachectin often called tumor necrosis factor alpha or TNF α is an adipokine and a cytokine TNF is a member of the TNF superfamily which consists of various transmembrane proteins with a homologous TNF domain
As an adipokine TNF promotes insulin resistance and is associated with obesity induced type diabetes As a cytokine TNF is used by the immune system for cell signaling If macrophages certain white blood cells detect an infection they release TNF to alert other immune system cells as part of an inflammatory response
TNF signaling occurs through two receptors TNFR and TNFR TNFR is constituitively expressed on most cell types whereas TNFR is restricted primarily to endothelial epithelial and subsets of immune cells TNFR signaling tends to be pro inflammatory and apoptotic whereas TNFR signaling is anti inflammatory and promotes cell proliferation Suppression of TNFR signaling has been important for treatment of autoimmune disease whereas TNFR signaling promotes wound healing
TNF α exists as a transmembrane form mTNF α and as a soluble form sTNF α sTNF α results from enzymatic cleavage of mTNF α by a process called substrate presentation mTNF α is mainly found on monocytesmacrophages where it interacts with tissue receptors by cell to cell contact sTNF α selectively binds to TNFR whereas mTNF α binds to both TNFR and TNFR TNF α binding to TNFR is irreversible whereas binding to TNFR is reversible
The primary role of TNF is in the regulation of immune cells TNF as an endogenous pyrogen is able to induce fever apoptotic cell death cachexia and inflammation inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication and respond to sepsis via IL and IL producing cells Dysregulation of TNF production has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including Alzheimer's disease cancer major depression psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease IBD Though controversial some studies have linked depression and IBD to increased levels of TNF
Under the name tasonermin TNF is used as an immunostimulant drug in the treatment of certain cancers Drugs that counter the action of TNF are used in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases for instance rheumatoid arthritis
Certain cancers can cause overproduction of TNF TNF parallels parathyroid hormone both in causing secondary hypercalcemia and in the cancers with which excessive production is associated
The theory of an anti tumoral response of the immune system in vivo was recognized by the physician William B Coley In Gale A Granger from the University of California Irvine reported a cytotoxic factor produced by lymphocytes and named it lymphotoxin LT Credit for this discovery is shared by Nancy H Ruddle from Yale University who reported the same activity in a series of back to back articles published in the same month Subsequently in Lloyd J Old from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York reported another cytotoxic factor produced by macrophages and named it tumor necrosis factor TNF Both factors were described based on their ability to kill mouse fibrosarcoma L cells These concepts were extended to systemic disease in when Ian A Clark from the Australian National University in collaboration with Elizabeth Carswell in Old's group working with pre sequencing era data reasoned that excessive production of TNF causes malaria disease and endotoxin poisoning
The cDNAs encoding LT and TNF were cloned in and were revealed to be similar The binding of TNF to its receptor and its displacement by LT confirmed the functional homology between the two factors The sequential and functional homology of TNF and LT led to the renaming of TNF as TNFα and LT as TNFβ In Bruce A Beutler and Anthony Cerami discovered that cachectin a hormone which induces cachexia was actually TNF They then identified TNF as a mediator of lethal endotoxin poisoning Kevin J Tracey and Cerami discovered the key mediator role of TNF in lethal septic shock and identified the therapeutic effects of monoclonal anti TNF antibodies
Research in the Laboratory of Mark Mattson has shown that TNF can prevent the deathapoptosis of neurons by a mechanism involving activation of the transcription factor NF κB which induces the expression of antioxidant enzymes and Bcl
The human TNF gene was cloned in It maps to chromosome p spans about kilobases and contains exons The last exon shares similarity with lymphotoxin alpha LTA once named as TNF β The three prime untranslated region ' UTR of TNF contains an AU rich element ARE
TNF is primarily produced as a amino acid long type II transmembrane protein arranged in stable homotrimers From this membrane integrated form the soluble homotrimeric cytokine sTNF is released via proteolytic cleavage by the metalloprotease TNF alpha converting enzyme TACE also called ADAM The soluble kDa trimeric sTNF tends to dissociate at concentrations below the nanomolar range thereby losing its bioactivity The secreted form of human TNF takes on a triangular pyramid shape and weighs around kDa Both the secreted and the membrane bound forms are biologically active although the specific functions of each is controversial But both forms do have overlapping and distinct biological activities
The common house mouse TNF and human TNF are structurally different The kilodalton kDa TNF protomers amino acid long are composed of two antiparallel β pleated sheets with antiparallel β strands forming a 'jelly roll' β structure typical for the TNF family but also found in viral capsid proteins
TNF can bind two receptors TNFR TNF receptor type CDa p and TNFR TNF receptor type CDb p TNFR is kDa and TNFR is kDa TNFR is expressed in most tissues and can be fully activated by both the membrane bound and soluble trimeric forms of TNF whereas TNFR is found typically in cells of the immune system and responds to the membrane bound form of the TNF homotrimer As most information regarding TNF signaling is derived from TNFR the role of TNFR is likely underestimated At least partly because TNFR has no intracellular death domain it shows neuroprotective properties
Upon contact with their ligand TNF receptors also form trimers their tips fitting into the grooves formed between TNF monomers This binding causes a conformational change to occur in the receptor leading to the dissociation of the inhibitory protein SODD from the intracellular death domain This dissociation enables the adaptor protein TRADD to bind to the death domain serving as a platform for subsequent protein binding Following TRADD binding three pathways can be initiated
Activation of NF κB TRADD recruits TRAF and RIP TRAF in turn recruits the multicomponent protein kinase IKK enabling the serine threonine kinase RIP to activate it An inhibitory protein IκBα that normally binds to NF κB and inhibits its translocation is phosphorylated by IKK and subsequently degraded releasing NF κB NF κB is a heterodimeric transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus and mediates the transcription of a vast array of proteins involved in cell survival and proliferation inflammatory response and anti apoptotic factors
Activation of the MAPK pathways Of the three major MAPK cascades TNF induces a strong activation of the stress related JNK group evokes moderate response of the p MAPK and is responsible for minimal activation of the classical ERKs TRAFRac activates the JNK inducing upstream kinases of MLKMLK TAK MEKK and ASK either directly or through GCKs and Trx respectively SRC Vav Rac axis activates MLKMLK and these kinases phosphorylate MKK which then activates JNK JNK translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription factors such as c Jun and ATF The JNK pathway is involved in cell differentiation proliferation and is generally pro apoptotic
Induction of death signaling Like all death domain containing members of the TNFR superfamily TNFR is involved in death signaling However TNF induced cell death plays only a minor role compared to its overwhelming functions in the inflammatory process Its death inducing capability is weak compared to other family members such as Fas and often masked by the anti apoptotic effects of NF κB Nevertheless TRADD binds FADD which then recruits the cysteine protease caspase A high concentration of caspase induces its autoproteolytic activation and subsequent cleaving of effector caspases leading to cell apoptosisThe myriad and often conflicting effects mediated by the above pathways indicate the existence of extensive cross talk For instance NF κB enhances the transcription of C FLIP Bcl and cIAP cIAP inhibitory proteins that interfere with death signaling On the other hand activated caspases cleave several components of the NF κB pathway including RIP IKK and the subunits of NF κB itself Other factors such as cell type concurrent stimulation of other cytokines or the amount of reactive oxygen species ROS can shift the balance in favor of one pathway or another Such complicated signaling ensures that whenever TNF is released various cells with vastly diverse functions and conditions can all respond appropriately to inflammation Both protein molecules tumor necrosis factor alpha and keratin appear to
be related in case of oral submucous fibrosis
In animal models TNF selectively kills autoreactive T cells
There is also evidence that TNF α signaling triggers downstream epigenetic modifications that result in lasting enhancement of pro inflammatory responses in cells
This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation
TNF was thought to be produced primarily by macrophages but it is produced also by a broad variety of cell types including lymphoid cells mast cells endothelial cells cardiac myocytes adipose tissue fibroblasts and neurons Large amounts of TNF are released in response to lipopolysaccharide other bacterial products and interleukin IL In the skin mast cells appear to be the predominant source of pre formed TNF which can be released upon inflammatory stimulus eg LPS
It has a number of actions on various organ systems generally together with IL and interleukin IL
Stimulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis by stimulating the release of corticotropin releasing hormone CRH
On the liver stimulating the acute phase response leading to an increase in C reactive protein and a number of other mediators It also induces insulin resistance by promoting serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate IRS which impairs insulin signaling
It is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and promotes the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells helping neutrophils migrate
On macrophages stimulates phagocytosis and production of IL oxidants and the inflammatory lipid prostaglandin E PGE
On other tissues increasing insulin resistance TNF phosphorylates insulin receptor serine residues blocking signal transduction
On metabolism and food intake regulates bitter taste perceptionA local increase in concentration of TNF will cause the cardinal signs of Inflammation to occur heat swelling redness pain and loss of function
Whereas high concentrations of TNF induce shock like symptoms the prolonged exposure to low concentrations of TNF can result in cachexia a wasting syndrome This can be found for example in cancer patients
Said et al showed that TNF causes an IL dependent inhibition of CD T cell expansion and function by up regulating PD levels on monocytes which leads to IL production by monocytes after binding of PD by PD L
The research of Pedersen et al indicates that TNF increase in response to sepsis is inhibited by the exercise induced production of myokines To study whether acute exercise induces a true anti inflammatory response a model of 'low grade inflammation' was established in which a low dose of E coli endotoxin was administered to healthy volunteers who had been randomised to either rest or exercise prior to endotoxin administration In resting subjects endotoxin induced a to fold increase in circulating levels of TNF In contrast when the subjects performed hours of ergometer cycling and received the endotoxin bolus at h the TNF response was totally blunted This study provides some evidence that acute exercise may inhibit TNF production
In the brain TNF can protect against excitotoxicity TNF strengthens synapses TNF in neurons promotes their survival whereas TNF in macrophages and microglia results in neurotoxins that induce apoptosis
TNF α and IL concentrations are elevated in obesity Monoclonal antibody against TNF α is associated with increases rather than decreases in obesity indicating that inflammation is the result rather than the cause of obesity TNF and IL are the most prominent cytokines predicting COVID severity and death
TNF promotes the inflammatory response which in turn causes many of the clinical problems associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis inflammatory bowel disease psoriasis hidradenitis suppurativa and refractory asthma These disorders are sometimes treated by using a TNF inhibitor This inhibition can be achieved with a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab Remicade binding directly to TNF adalimumab Humira certolizumab pegol Cimzia or with a decoy circulating receptor fusion protein such as etanercept Enbrel which binds to TNF with greater affinity than the TNFR
On the other hand some patients treated with TNF inhibitors develop an aggravation of their disease or new onset of autoimmunity TNF seems to have an immunosuppressive facet as well One explanation for a possible mechanism is this observation that TNF has a positive effect on regulatory T cells Tregs due to its binding to the tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR
Anti TNF therapy has shown only modest effects in cancer therapy Treatment of renal cell carcinoma with infliximab resulted in prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients Etanercept was tested for treating patients with breast cancer and ovarian cancer showing prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients via downregulation of IL and CCL On the other hand adding infliximab or etanercept to gemcitabine for treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer was not associated with differences in efficacy when compared with placebo
TNF has been shown to interact with TNFRSFA
Because LTα is no longer referred to as TNFβ TNFα as the previous gene symbol is now simply called TNF as shown in HGNC HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee database
