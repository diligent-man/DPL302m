sickle cell trait describes condition person ha one abnormal allele hemoglobin beta gene heterozygous doe display severe symptom sickle cell disease occur person ha two copy allele homozygous
heterozygous sickle cell allele produce normal abnormal hemoglobin two allele codominant respect actual concentration hemoglobin circulating cells
sickle cell disease blood disorder wherein single amino acid substitution hemoglobin protein red blood cell cause cell assume sickle shape especially low oxygen tension
sickling sickle cell disease also confer resistance malaria parasitization red blood cell individual sickle-cell trait heterozygote selective advantage environment malaria present
sickle cell trait hemoglobin genotype generally regarded benign condition
however individual sickle cell trait may rare complications
taubenberger national institute health discovered earliest proof sickle-cell disease looking virus flu autopsy african-american soldier
taubenberger's autopsy result showed soldier suffered sickle-cell crisis contributed death even though one copy gene
call reclassify sickle cell trait disease state based malignant clinical presentations
sickle cell trait provides survival advantage malaria fatality people normal hemoglobin region malaria endemic
trait known cause significantly fewer death due malaria especially plasmodium falciparum causative organism
prime example natural selection evidenced fact geographical distribution gene hemoglobin distribution malaria africa virtually overlap
unique survival advantage people trait become increasingly numerous number malaria-infected people increases
conversely people normal hemoglobin tend succumb complication malaria
way sickle cell protects malaria attributed several different things
one common explanation sickle hemoglobin inhibits plasmodium parasite infecting red blood cell reduces number malaria parasite infect host
another factor production heme oxygenase- ho- enzyme highly present sickle hemoglobin
enzyme produce carbon monoxide ha proven protect cerebral malaria
renal medullary carcinoma cancer affecting kidney rare complication seen patient sickle cell trait
sudden death physical exertion african-american u army recruit athletes
urinary tract infectionprobable complicated hyphema venous thromboembolic event fetal loss neonatal death preeclampsia
possible acute chest syndrome asymptomatic bacteriuria anemia pregnancy
insufficient evidence retinopathy cholelithiasis priapism leg ulcer liver necrosis avascular necrosis femoral head stroke
association complicated migraine ha suggestedthere report pulmonary venous thromboembolism pregnant woman sickle cell trait men prolonged airflight mild stroke abnormality pet scan child trait
sickle cell trait appears worsen complication seen diabetes mellitus type retinopathy nephropathy proteinuria provoke hyperosmolar diabetic coma nephropathy especially male patients
normally person inherits two copy gene produce beta-globin protein needed produce normal hemoglobin hemoglobin genotype aa
person sickle cell trait inherits one normal allele one abnormal allele encoding hemoglobin hemoglobin genotype as
sickle cell trait used demonstrate concept co-dominance incomplete dominance
individual sickle cell trait show incomplete dominance shape red blood cell considered
regard actual concentration hemoglobin circulating cell allele demonstrate co-dominance 'normal' mutant form co-exist bloodstream
unlike sickle-cell trait sickle-cell disease passed recessive manner
disease also affect american caribbean central america part south america turkey greece italy middle east east india
sickle-cell disease associated trait prevalent africa central america attributed natural selection sickle-cell trait confers survival advantage area high occurrence malaria ha high death rate among individual without trait
significance sickle-cell trait doe show symptom doe cause major difference blood cell count
trait confers protection malaria occurrence appears risen tremendously africa india middle east
finding also show reduction sickle-cell trait retain much fetal hemoglobin usual adulthood
elevated fetal hemoglobin level observed population sickle-cell disease prevalent
whole genome sequence analysis ha identified single origin sickle trait one haplotype ancestral sickle-cell variants
haplotype thought originated sahara holocene wet phase around year ago
sickle cell variant descended ancestral haplotype comprise five haplotype named toponym ethnolinguistic group arabianindian benin cameroon central african republicbantu senegal variant another designation earmarked atypical sickle-cell haplotypes
clinical importance associated higher hbf level eg senegal saudi-asian variant tend milder disease
case athlete sickle cell trait achieve level performance elite athlete normal hemoglobin aa
athlete sickle cell trait instructor must aware danger condition anaerobic exertion especially hot dehydrated conditions
rare case exercise-induced dehydration exhaustion may cause healthy red blood cell turn sickle-shaped cause death sporting activities
research necessary topic correlation found individual sickle cell trait increased risk sudden death appears related microcirculatory disorder exercise
recent year ncaa ha partnered acsm issued joint statement warning athlete prevalence potential risk factor sickle cell trait
ncaa ha also recently encouraged athlete become aware sickle cell trait status trait doe typically result symptom normal condition become dangerous extreme physical activity similar daily training athlete undergo
normal hemoglobin hemoglobin presence oxygen contains deformability characteristic allows erythrocyte essentially squeeze way smaller vessel including involved microcirculation capillary within muscle tissue well blood supply embedded within organ tissues
hemoglobin deprived oxygen polymerize proposed cause sickled cells
sickled erythrocyte present decreased deformability compared normal erythrocyte leading distress circulation smaller vessel involved microcirculation particularly case capillary embedded muscle tissue
resulting microvasculatory distress capillary specific muscle tissue cause acute rhabdomyolysis necrosis within muscle cells
inflammation leakage intracellular material resulting muscle cell necrosis release particular protein myoglobin blood stream
necessary muscle tissue bind iron oxygen myoglobin circulating bloodstream break smaller compound damage kidney cell leading various complication seen sickle cell trait athlete high level physical exertion
link deformability sickled cell deformability used evaluate amount sickled cell blood
deformability erythrocyte cause microcirculatory distress demonstrated various hemorheological characteristics
order determine deformability erythrocyte multiple factor including blood plasma viscosity hematocrit calculation percent red blood cell present blood measured
alpha-thalassemia like sickle cell trait typically inherited area increased exposure malaria
manifest decreased expression alpha-globin chain causing imbalance excess beta-globin chain occasionally result anemic symptoms
abnormal hemoglobin cause body destroy red blood cell essentially causing anemia
endurance-trained individual sickle cell trait presence alpha-thalassemia ha shown act protectively microvasculatory distress exercise
microcirculatory distress telltale sign symptom potential sickling collapse cramping
specifically sickle cell trait cramping occurs lower extremity back athlete undergoing intense physical activity exertion
comparison heat cramp sickling cramp le intense term pain weakness fatigue associated opposed tightly contracted muscle lock heat cramps
sickling collapse come slowly following cramp weakness general body ache fatigue
individual known positive sickle cell trait status experiencing significant muscle weakness fatigue exercise take extra time recover hydrate returning activity order prevent symptoms
collapse prevented taking step ensure sufficient oxygen level blood
among preventative measure proper hydration gradual acclimation condition heat humidity decreased air pressure due higher altitude
gradual progression exertion level also help athletes' body adjust compensate gaining fitness slowly course several weeks
