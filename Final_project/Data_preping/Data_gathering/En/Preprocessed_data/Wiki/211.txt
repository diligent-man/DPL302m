structuralism psychology also structural psychology theory consciousness developed wilhelm wundt student edward bradford titchener
debated deserves credit finding field psychology widely accepted wundt created foundation titchener expanded
structuralism school psychology seek analyze adult mind total sum experience birth present term simplest definable component find component fit together form complex experience well correlate physical events
psychologist employ introspection self-reports sensation view feeling emotions
wa student wilhelm wundt university leipzig titchener's idea mind worked heavily influenced wundt's theory voluntarism idea association apperception passive active combination element consciousness respectively
titchener attempted classify structure mind like chemist classify element nature nature
titchener said observable event constituted science speculation concerning unobservable event ha place society view wa similar one expressed ernst mach
believed could understand reasoning structure mind could define categorize basic component mind rule component interacted
main tool titchener used try determine different component consciousness wa introspection
become object immediate knowledge way introspection self-awarenessand book outline psychology
within sphere psychology introspection final court appeal psychological evidence cannot introspective evidencetitchener strict guideline reporting introspective analysis
subject would report characteristic pencil color length etc
subject would instructed report name object pencil describe raw data subject wa experiencing
translation wundt's work titchener illustrates wundt supporter introspection method observe consciousness
however introspection fit wundt's theory term taken refer psychophysical methods
introspection literally mean 'looking within' try describe person's memory perception cognitive process andor motivations
concluded research three type mental element constituting conscious experience sensation element perception image element idea affection element emotions
element could broken respective property determined quality intensity duration clearness extensity
sensation image contained quality however affection lacking clearness extensity
therefore following train thinking thought image constructed elementary sensation meant complex reasoning thought could eventually broken sensation could get introspection
second issue titchener's theory structuralism wa question mental element combined interacted form conscious experience
particular titchener focus law contiguity idea thought something tend cause thought thing usually experienced along it
titchener rejected wundt's notion apperception creative synthesis voluntary action basis wundt's voluntarism
titchener argued attention wa simply manifestation clearness property within sensation
titchener identified element mind interaction theory asked question element interact way do
particular titchener wa interested relationship conscious experience physical processes
titchener believed physiological process provide continuous substratum give psychological process continuity otherwise would have
therefore nervous system doe cause conscious experience used explain characteristic mental events
wilhelm wundt instructed titchener founder structuralism university leipzig
simply mean complex perception raised basic sensory information
wundt often associated past literature structuralism use similar introspective methods
wundt make clear distinction pure introspection relatively unstructured self-observation used earlier philosopher experimental introspection
wundt belief type introspection acceptable since us laboratory instrument vary condition make result internal perception precise
titchener brought theory america also brought wundt's work
titchener translated work american audience misinterpreted wundt's meaning
fact wundt's main theory wa psychological voluntarism psychologische voluntarismus doctrine power organizes mind's content higher-level thought processes
drew parallel contemporary studying physic chemistry breaking substance chemical element atom attempting human psychology wundt proposed complex human perceptual experience could decomposed elementary sensations
proposed introspection self-examination guide source information going perception experience break sensory components
wundt's later titchener's idea centered viewing consciousness structure composed building block elementary sensation could broken approach wa labeled structuralism
edward titchener brought developed wundt's idea united states
titchener spoke structural standpoint defining structuralism neutral observational approach based introspection also adopting elementaristic approach building whole basic elements
structuralism ha faced large amount criticism particularly school psychology functionalism later evolved psychology pragmatism reconvening introspection acceptable practice observation
main critique structuralism wa focus introspection method gain understanding conscious experience
critic argue self-analysis wa feasible since introspective student cannot appreciate process mechanism mental processes
introspection therefore yielded different result depending wa using seeking
critic also pointed introspective technique actually resulted retrospection memory sensation rather sensation itself
behaviorist specifically methodological behaviorist fully rejected even idea conscious experience worthy topic psychology since believed subject matter scientific psychology strictly operationalized objective measurable way
notion mind could objectively measured wa worth inquiry
however radical behaviorism includes thinking feeling private event theory analysis psychology
structuralism also belief mind could dissected individual part formed conscious experience
also received criticism gestalt school psychology argues mind cannot broken individual elements
besides theoretical attack structuralism wa criticized excluding ignoring important development happening outside structuralism
titchener wa criticized using psychology help answer practical problems
instead titchener wa interested seeking pure knowledge wa important commonplace issues
one alternative theory structuralism titchener took offense wa functionalism functional psychology
stressed importance empirical rational thought experimental trial-and-error philosophy
james theory included introspection ie psychologist's study state mind also included thing like analysis ie logical criticism precursor contemporary view mind experiment eg hypnosis neurology comparison ie use statistical mean distinguish norm anomaly gave somewhat edge
functionalism also differed focused useful certain process brain environment process detail like structuralism
researcher still working offer objective experimental approach measuring conscious experience particular within field cognitive psychology way carrying torch titchener's ideas
today introspective methodology done highly controlled situation understood subjective retrospective
proponent argue psychology still gain useful information using introspection case
