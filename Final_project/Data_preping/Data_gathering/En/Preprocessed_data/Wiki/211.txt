structuralism in psychology also structural psychology is a theory of consciousness developed by wilhelm wundt and his student edward bradford titchener
this theory was challenged in the th century
it is debated who deserves the credit for finding this field of psychology but it is widely accepted that wundt created the foundation on which titchener expanded
structuralism as a school of psychology seeks to analyze the adult mind the total sum of experience from birth to the present in terms of the simplest definable components and then to find how these components fit together to form more complex experiences as well as how they correlate to physical events
to do this psychologists employ introspection self reports of sensations views feelings and emotions
edward b
titchener along with wilhelm wundt is credited for the theory of structuralism
it is considered to be the first school of psychology
because he was a student of wilhelm wundt at the university of leipzig titchener s ideas on how the mind worked were heavily influenced by wundt s theory of voluntarism and his ideas of association and apperception the passive and active combinations of elements of consciousness respectively
titchener attempted to classify the structures of the mind like chemists classify the elements of nature into the nature
titchener said that only observable events constituted that science and that any speculation concerning unobservable events has no place in society this view was similar to the one expressed by ernst mach
in his book systematic psychology titchener wrote
titchener believed the mind was the accumulated experience of a lifetime
he believed that he could understand reasoning and the structure of the mind if he could define and categorize the basic components of mind and the rules by which the components interacted
the main tool titchener used to try to determine the different components of consciousness was introspection
titchener writes in his systematic psychology
the state of consciousness which is to be the matter of psychology
can become an object of immediate knowledge only by way of introspection or self awareness and in his book an outline of psychology
within the sphere of psychology introspection is the final and only court of appeal that psychological evidence cannot be other than introspective evidence titchener had very strict guidelines for the reporting of an introspective analysis
the subject would be presented with an object such as a pencil
the subject would then report the characteristics of that pencil color length etc
the subject would be instructed not to report the name of the object pencil because that did not describe the raw data of what the subject was experiencing
titchener referred to this as stimulus error
in his translation of wundt s work titchener illustrates wundt as a supporter of introspection as a method through which to observe consciousness
however introspection only fits wundt s theories if the term is taken to refer to psychophysical methods
introspection literally means looking within to try to describe a person s memory perceptions cognitive processes and or motivations
titchener s theory began with the question of what each element of the mind is
he concluded from his research that there were three types of mental elements constituting conscious experience sensations elements of perceptions images elements of ideas and affections elements of emotions
these elements could be broken down into their respective properties which he determined were quality intensity duration clearness and extensity
both sensations and images contained all of these qualities however affections were lacking in both clearness and extensity
and images and affections could be broken down further into just clusters of sensations
therefore by following this train of thinking all thoughts were images which being constructed from elementary sensations meant that all complex reasoning and thought could eventually be broken down into just the sensations which he could get at through introspection
the second issue in titchener s theory of structuralism was the question of how the mental elements combined and interacted with each other to form conscious experience
his conclusions were largely based on ideas of associationism
in particular titchener focuses on the law of contiguity which is the idea that the thought of something will tend to cause thoughts of things that are usually experienced along with it
titchener rejected wundt s notions of apperception and creative synthesis voluntary action which were the basis of wundt s voluntarism
titchener argued that attention was simply a manifestation of the clearness property within sensation
once titchener identified the elements of mind and their interaction his theory then asked the question of why the elements interact in the way they do
in particular titchener was interested in the relationship between the conscious experience and the physical processes
titchener believed that physiological processes provide a continuous substratum that give psychological processes a continuity they otherwise would not have
therefore the nervous system does not cause conscious experience but can be used to explain some characteristics of mental events
wilhelm wundt instructed titchener the founder of structuralism at the university of leipzig
the science of immediate experience was stated by him
this simply means that the complex perceptions can be raised through basic sensory information
wundt is often associated in past literature with structuralism and the use of similar introspective methods
wundt makes a clear distinction between pure introspection which is the relatively unstructured self observation used by earlier philosophers and experimental introspection
wundt believes this type of introspection to be acceptable since it uses laboratory instruments to vary conditions and make results of internal perceptions more precise
the reason for this confusion lies in the translation of wundt s writings
when titchener brought his theory to america he also brought with him wundt s work
titchener translated these works for the american audience and in so doing misinterpreted wundt s meaning
he then used this translation to show that wundt supported titchener s own theories
in fact wundt s main theory was that of psychological voluntarism psychologische voluntarismus the doctrine that the power of the will organizes the mind s content into higher level thought processes
wundt proposed a theory of human psychological perception and consciousness
he drew a parallel from what his contemporaries studying physics and chemistry were doing that is breaking down substances into chemical elements atoms attempting to do the same for human psychology wundt proposed that a complex human perceptual experience could be decomposed into elementary sensations
he proposed introspection self examination as the guide to source the information on what is going on in a perception experience and to break it down into sensory components
because wundt s and later titchener s ideas centered on viewing consciousness as a structure composed by the building blocks of the elementary sensations into which it could be broken down into their approach was labeled structuralism
edward titchener brought and developed wundt s ideas into the united states
titchener spoke in of structural standpoint defining structuralism as a neutral observational approach based on introspection and also adopting the elementaristic approach of building up a whole from its basic elements
structuralism has faced a large amount of criticism particularly from the school of psychology functionalism which later evolved into the psychology of pragmatism reconvening introspection into acceptable practices of observation
the main critique of structuralism was its focus on introspection as the method by which to gain an understanding of conscious experience
critics argue that self analysis was not feasible since introspective students cannot appreciate the processes or mechanisms of their own mental processes
introspection therefore yielded different results depending on who was using it and what they were seeking
some critics also pointed out that introspective techniques actually resulted in retrospection the memory of a sensation rather than the sensation itself
behaviorists specifically methodological behaviorists fully rejected even the idea of the conscious experience as a worthy topic in psychology since they believed that the subject matter of scientific psychology should be strictly operationalized in an objective and measurable way
because the notion of a mind could not be objectively measured it was not worth further inquiry
however radical behaviorism includes thinking feeling and private events in its theory and analysis of psychology
structuralism also believes that the mind could be dissected into its individual parts which then formed conscious experience
this also received criticism from the gestalt school of psychology which argues that the mind cannot be broken down into individual elements
besides theoretical attacks structuralism was criticized for excluding and ignoring important developments happening outside of structuralism
for instance structuralism did not concern itself with the study of animal behavior and personality
titchener himself was criticized for not using his psychology to help answer practical problems
instead titchener was interested in seeking pure knowledge that to him was more important than commonplace issues
one alternative theory to structuralism to which titchener took offense was functionalism functional psychology
functionalism was developed by william james in contrast to structuralism
it stressed the importance of empirical rational thought over an experimental trial and error philosophy
james in his theory included introspection i e the psychologist s study of his own states of mind but also included things like analysis i e the logical criticism of precursor and contemporary views of the mind experiment e g in hypnosis or neurology and comparison i e the use of statistical means to distinguish norms from anomalies which gave it somewhat of an edge
functionalism also differed in that it focused on the how useful certain processes were in the brain to the environment you were in and not the processes and other detail like in structuralism
researchers are still working to offer objective experimental approaches to measuring conscious experience in particular within the field of cognitive psychology and is in some ways carrying on the torch of titchener s ideas
it is working on the same type of issues such as sensations and perceptions
today any introspective methodologies are done under highly controlled situations and are understood to be subjective and retrospective
proponents argue that psychology can still gain useful information from using introspection in this case
