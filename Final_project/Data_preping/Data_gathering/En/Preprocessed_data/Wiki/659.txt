smrti is a sanskrit word from the root smara which means remembrance reminiscence thinking of or upon calling to mind or simply memory
the word is found in ancient vedic literature such as in section of the chandogya upanishad
in later and modern scholarly usage the term refers to tradition memory as well as a vast post vedic canon of tradition that is remembered
david brick states that the original meaning of smriti was simply tradition and not texts
smriti is also a symbolic synonym for number from the scholars who are credited in indian tradition for writing dharma related smriti texts most have been lost

par ara whose name appears in this list enumerates also twenty authors but instead of samvartta b haspati and vy sa he gives the names of ka yapa bh gu and prachetas
in linguistic traditions smrti is the name of a type of verse meter
in hindu mythology smriti is the name of the daughter of dharma and medha
in scholarly literature smriti is also spelled as sm ti
smrtis represent the remembered written tradition in hinduism
the smrti literature is a vast corpus of derivative work
all smriti texts are regarded to ultimately be rooted in or inspired by shruti
the smrti corpus includes but is not limited to
the six ved ngas grammar meter phonetics etymology astronomy and rituals
the itihasa literally means so indeed it was epics the mah bh rata and r m yana
the texts on the four proper goals or aims of human life
dharma these texts discuss dharma from various religious social duties morals and personal ethics perspective
each of six major schools of hinduism has its own literature on dharma
examples include dharma sutras particularly by gautama apastamba baudhayana and v si ha and dharma sastras particularly manusm ti y j avalkya sm ti n radasm ti and vi usm ti
at the personal dharma level this includes many chapters of yogasutras
artha artha related texts discuss artha from individual social and as a compendium of economic policies politics and laws

the numerous nibandhas digests covering politics medicine caraka samhita ethics nitisastras culture arts and society the smrti texts structurally branched over time from so called the limbs of the vedas or auxiliary sciences for perfecting grammar and pronunciation part of ved ngas
for example the attempt to perfect the art of rituals led to the science of kalpa which branched into three kalpa s tras srauta s tras grhya s tras and dharma s tras estimated to have been composed between bce
the srauta sutras became texts describing the perfect performance of public ceremonies solemn community yajnas the grhya sutras described perfect performance of home ceremonies and domestic rites of passage and dharma sutras described jurisprudence rights and duties of individuals in four ashrama stages of life and social ethics
the dharma s tras themselves became the foundations for a large canon of texts and branched off as numerous dharma sastra texts
jan gonda states that the initial stages of smriti texts structurally developed in the form of a new prose genre named s tras that is aphorism highly compact precise expression that captured the essence of a fact principle instruction or idea
this brevity in expression states gonda was likely necessitated by the fact that writing technology had not developed yet or was not in vogue in order to store a growing mass of knowledge and all sorts of knowledge was transferred from one generation to the next through the process of memorization verbal recitation and listening in the st millennium bce
compressed content allowed more essential densely structured knowledge to be memorized and verbally transferred to the next generation in ancient india
smrtis contribute to exposition of the hindu dharma but are considered less authoritative than rutis the vedic corpus that includes early upanishads
the root texts of ancient hindu jurisprudence and law are the dharma s tras
these express that shruti smriti and acara are sources of jurisprudence and law
the precedence of these sources is declared in the opening verses of each of the known surviving dharma s tras
for example
the smritis such as manusmriti naradasmriti yajnavalkya smrti and parashara smriti expanded this definition as follows
the yajnavalkya smriti includes four vedas six vedangas purana nyaya mimamsa and other sastras in addition to the ethical conduct of the wise as sources of knowledge and through which sacred law can be known
it explains the scope of the dharma as follows
levinson states that the role of shruti and smriti in hindu law is as a source of guidance and its tradition cultivates the principle that the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad
the later hindu texts include fourfold sources of dharma states levinson which include atmanastushti satisfaction of one s conscience sadacara local norms of virtuous individuals smriti and sruti
medhatithi s philosophical analysis of and commentary on criminal civil and family law in dharmasastras particularly of manusmriti using nyaya and mimamsa theories is the oldest and the most widely studied tertiary smriti
