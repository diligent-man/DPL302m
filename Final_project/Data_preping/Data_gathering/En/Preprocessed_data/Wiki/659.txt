Smrti is a Sanskrit word from the root Smara स्मर which means remembrance reminiscence thinking of or upon calling to mind or simply memory The word is found in ancient Vedic literature such as in section of the Chandogya Upanishad In later and modern scholarly usage the term refers to tradition memory as well as a vast post Vedic canon of tradition that is remembered David Brick states that the original meaning of smriti was simply tradition and not texts

VaśiṣṭhaYājñavalkya gives the list of total by adding two more Smritis namely Yājñavalkyasmriti and Manusmriti Parāśara whose name appears in this list enumerates also twenty authors but instead of Samvartta Bṛhaspati and Vyāsa he gives the names of Kaśyapa Bhṛgu and Prachetas

In scholarly literature Smriti is also spelled as Smṛti

The numerous Nibandhas digests covering politics medicine Caraka Samhita ethics Nitisastras culture arts and societyThe Smrti texts structurally branched over time from so called the limbs of the Vedas or auxiliary sciences for perfecting grammar and pronunciation part of Vedāngas For example the attempt to perfect the art of rituals led to the science of Kalpa which branched into three Kalpa sūtras Srauta sūtras Grhya sūtras and Dharma sūtras estimated to have been composed between BCE The Srauta sutras became texts describing the perfect performance of public ceremonies solemn community yajnas the Grhya sutras described perfect performance of home ceremonies and domestic rites of passage and Dharma sutras described jurisprudence rights and duties of individuals in four Ashrama stages of life and social ethics The Dharma sūtras themselves became the foundations for a large canon of texts and branched off as numerous Dharma sastra texts
Jan Gonda states that the initial stages of Smriti texts structurally developed in the form of a new prose genre named Sūtras that is aphorism highly compact precise expression that captured the essence of a fact principle instruction or idea This brevity in expression states Gonda was likely necessitated by the fact that writing technology had not developed yet or was not in vogue in order to store a growing mass of knowledge and all sorts of knowledge was transferred from one generation to the next through the process of memorization verbal recitation and listening in the st millennium BCE Compressed content allowed more essential densely structured knowledge to be memorized and verbally transferred to the next generation in ancient India
Smrtis contribute to exposition of the Hindu Dharma but are considered less authoritative than Śrutis the Vedic corpus that includes early Upanishads
The root texts of ancient Hindu jurisprudence and law are the Dharma sūtras These express that Shruti Smriti and Acara are sources of jurisprudence and law The precedence of these sources is declared in the opening verses of each of the known surviving Dharma sūtras For example
The Smritis such as Manusmriti Naradasmriti Yajnavalkya Smrti and Parashara Smriti expanded this definition as follows
The Yajnavalkya Smriti includes four Vedas six Vedangas Purana Nyaya Mimamsa and other sastras in addition to the ethical conduct of the wise as sources of knowledge and through which sacred law can be known It explains the scope of the Dharma as follows
Levinson states that the role of Shruti and Smriti in Hindu law is as a source of guidance and its tradition cultivates the principle that the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of Dharma states Levinson which include Atmanastushti satisfaction of one's conscience Sadacara local norms of virtuous individuals Smriti and Sruti
Medhatithi's philosophical analysis of and commentary on criminal civil and family law in Dharmasastras particularly of Manusmriti using Nyaya and Mimamsa theories is the oldest and the most widely studied tertiary Smriti
