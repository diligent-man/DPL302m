algorithmic bias describes systematic repeatable error computer system create unfair outcome privileging one category another way different intended function algorithm
bias emerge many factor including limited design algorithm unintended unanticipated use decision relating way data coded collected selected used train algorithm
example algorithmic bias ha observed search engine result social medium platforms
bias impact ranging inadvertent privacy violation reinforcing social bias race gender sexuality ethnicity
study algorithmic bias concerned algorithm reflect systematic unfair discrimination
bias ha recently addressed legal framework european union's general data protection regulation proposed artificial intelligence act
algorithm expand ability organize society politics institution behavior sociologist become concerned way unanticipated output manipulation data impact physical world
algorithm often considered neutral unbiased inaccurately project greater authority human expertise part due psychological phenomenon automation bias case reliance algorithm displace human responsibility outcomes
bias enter algorithmic system result pre-existing cultural social institutional expectation technical limitation design used unanticipated context audience considered software's initial design
algorithmic bias ha cited case ranging election outcome spread online hate speech
ha also arisen criminal justice healthcare hiring compounding existing racial socioeconomic gender biases
relative inability facial recognition technology accurately identify darker-skinned face ha linked multiple wrongful arrest black men issue stemming imbalanced datasets
problem understanding researching discovering algorithmic bias persist due proprietary nature algorithm typically treated trade secrets
even full transparency provided complexity certain algorithm pose barrier understanding functioning
furthermore algorithm may change respond input output way cannot anticipated easily reproduced analysis
many case even within single website application single algorithm examine network many interrelated program data input even user service
algorithm difficult define may generally understood list instruction determine program read collect process analyze data generate output
advance computer hardware led increased ability process store transmit data
ha turn boosted design adoption technology machine learning artificial intelligence
analyzing processing data algorithm backbone search engine social medium website recommendation engine online retail online advertising more
contemporary social scientist concerned algorithmic process embedded hardware software application political social impact question underlying assumption algorithm's neutrality
term algorithmic bias describes systematic repeatable error create unfair outcome privileging one arbitrary group user others
example credit score algorithm may deny loan without unfair consistently weighing relevant financial criteria
algorithm recommends loan one group user denies loan another set nearly identical user based unrelated criterion behavior repeated across multiple occurrence algorithm described biased
bias may intentional unintentional example come biased data obtained worker previously job algorithm going on
assemblage dataset data may collected digitized adapted entered database according human-designed cataloging criteria
next programmer assign priority hierarchy program ass sort data
requires human decision data categorized data included discarded
algorithm collect data based human-selected criterion also reflect bias human designers
algorithm may reinforce stereotype preference process display relevant data human user example selecting information based previous choice similar user group users
beyond assembling processing data bias emerge result design
example algorithm determine allocation resource scrutiny determining school placement may inadvertently discriminate category determining risk based similar user credit scores
meanwhile recommendation engine work associating user similar user make use inferred marketing trait might rely inaccurate association reflect broad ethnic gender socio-economic racial stereotypes
another example come determining criterion included excluded results
criterion could present unanticipated outcome search result flight-recommendation software omits flight follow sponsoring airline's flight paths
algorithm may also display uncertainty bias offering confident assessment larger data set available
skew algorithmic process toward result closely correspond larger sample may disregard data underrepresented populations
earliest computer program designed mimic human reasoning deduction deemed functioning successfully consistently reproduced human logic
book computer power human reason artificial intelligence pioneer joseph weizenbaum suggested bias could arise data used program also way program coded
weizenbaum wrote program sequence rule created human computer follow
following rule consistently program embody law enforce specific way solve problems
rule computer follows based assumption computer programmer problem might solved
mean code could incorporate programmer's imagination world work including bias expectations
computer program incorporate bias way weizenbaum also noted data fed machine additionally reflects human decisionmaking process data selected
finally noted machine might also transfer good information unintended consequence user unclear interpret results
weizenbaum warned trusting decision made computer program user understand comparing faith tourist find way hotel room exclusively turning left right coin toss
crucially tourist ha basis understanding arrived destination successful arrival doe mean process accurate reliable
early example algorithmic bias resulted many woman ethnic minority denied entry st
george's hospital medical school per year based implementation new computer-guidance assessment system denied entry woman men foreign-sounding name based historical trend admissions
many school time employed similar bias selection process st
george wa notable automating said bias use algorithm thus gaining attention people much wider scale
recent year algorithm started use machine learning method real world data algorithmic bias found often due bias existing data
though well-designed algorithm frequently determine outcome equally equitable decision human case bias still occur difficult predict analyze
complexity analyzing algorithmic bias ha grown alongside complexity program design
decision made one designer team designer may obscured among many piece code created single program time decision collective impact program's output may forgotten
theory bias may create new pattern behavior script relationship specific technology code interacts element society
bias may also impact society shape around data point algorithm require
example data show high number arrest particular area algorithm may assign police patrol area could lead arrests
decision algorithmic program seen authoritative decision human meant assist process described author clay shirky algorithmic authority
shirky us term describe decision regard authoritative unmanaged process extracting value diverse untrustworthy source search results
neutrality also misrepresented language used expert medium result presented public
example list news item selected presented trending popular may created based significantly wider criterion popularity
convenience authority algorithm theorized mean delegating responsibility away humans
sociologist scott lash ha critiqued algorithm new form generative power virtual mean generating actual ends
previously human behavior generated data collected studied powerful algorithm increasingly could shape define human behaviors
concern impact algorithm society led creation working group organization google microsoft co-created working group named fairness accountability
idea google included community group patrol outcome algorithm vote control restrict output deem negative consequences
transparency fat algorithm ha emerged interdisciplinary research area annual conference called facct
critic suggested fat initiative cannot serve effectively independent watchdog many funded corporation building system studied
pre-existing bias algorithm consequence underlying social institutional ideologies
idea may influence create personal bias within individual designer programmers
poorly selected input data simply data biased source influence outcome created machines
encoding pre-existing bias software preserve social institutional bias without correction could replicated future us algorithm
example form bias british nationality act program designed automate evaluation new british citizen british nationality act
program accurately reflected tenet law stated man father legitimate child whereas woman mother child legitimate attempt transfer particular logic algorithmic process bnap inscribed logic british nationality act algorithm would perpetuate even act wa eventually repealed
technical bias emerges limitation program computational power design constraint system
bias also restraint design example search engine show three result per screen understood privilege top three result slightly next three airline price display
another case software relies randomness fair distribution results
random number generation mechanism truly random introduce bias example skewing selection toward item end beginning list
decontextualized algorithm us unrelated information sort result example flight-pricing algorithm sort result alphabetical order would biased favor american airline united airlines
opposite may also apply result evaluated context different collected
data may collected without crucial external context example facial recognition software used surveillance camera evaluated remote staff another country region evaluated non-human algorithm awareness take place beyond camera's field vision
could create incomplete understanding crime scene example potentially mistaking bystander commit crime
lastly technical bias created attempting formalize decision concrete step assumption human behavior work way
example software weighs data point determine whether defendant accept plea bargain ignoring impact emotion jury
another unintended result form bias wa found plagiarism-detection software turnitin compare student-written text information found online return probability score student's work copied
software compare long string text likely identify non-native speaker english native speaker latter group might better able change individual word break string plagiarized text obscure copied passage synonyms
easier native speaker evade detection result technical constraint software creates scenario turnitin identifies foreign-speakers english plagiarism allowing native-speakers evade detection
emergent bias result use reliance algorithm across new unanticipated contexts
algorithm may adjusted consider new form knowledge new drug medical breakthrough new law business model shifting cultural norms
may exclude group technology without providing clear outline understand responsible exclusion
similarly problem may emerge training data sample fed machine model certain conclusion align context algorithm encounter real world
example emergent bias wa identified software used place u medical student residency national residency match program nrmp
algorithm wa designed time married couple would seek residency together
woman entered medical school student likely request residency alongside partners
process called applicant provide list preference placement across u wa sorted assigned hospital applicant agreed match
case married couple sought residency algorithm weighed location choice higher-rated partner first
result wa frequent assignment highly preferred school first partner lower-preferred school second partner rather sorting compromise placement preference
unpredictable correlation emerge large data set compared other
example data collected web-browsing pattern may align signal marking sensitive data race sexual orientation
selecting according certain behavior browsing pattern end effect would almost identical discrimination use direct race sexual orientation data
case algorithm draw conclusion correlation without able understand correlations
example one triage program gave lower priority asthmatic pneumonia asthmatic pneumonia
program algorithm simply compared survival rate asthmatic pneumonia highest risk
historically reason hospital typically give asthmatic best immediate careemergent bias occur algorithm used unanticipated audiences
example machine may require user read write understand number relate interface using metaphor understand
exclusion become compounded biased exclusionary technology deeply integrated society
apart exclusion unanticipated us may emerge end user relying software rather knowledge
one example unanticipated user group led algorithmic bias uk british national act program wa created proof-of-concept computer scientist immigration lawyer evaluate suitability british citizenship
designer access legal expertise beyond end user immigration office whose understanding software immigration law would likely unsophisticated
agent administering question relied entirely software excluded alternative pathway citizenship used software even new case law legal interpretation led algorithm become outdated
result designing algorithm user assumed legally savvy immigration law software's algorithm indirectly led bias favor applicant fit narrow set legal criterion set algorithm rather broader criterion british immigration law
emergent bias may also create feedback loop recursion data collected algorithm result real-world response fed back algorithm
example simulation predictive policing software predpol deployed oakland california suggested increased police presence black neighborhood based crime data reported public
simulation showed public reported crime based sight police car regardless police doing
simulation interpreted police car sighting modeling prediction crime would turn assign even larger increase police presence within neighborhoods
human right data analysis group conducted simulation warned place racial discrimination factor arrest feedback loop could reinforce perpetuate racial discrimination policing
another well known example algorithm exhibiting behavior compas software determines individual's likelihood becoming criminal offender
software often criticized labeling black individual criminal much likely others feed data back event individual become registered criminal enforcing bias created dataset algorithm acting on
recommender system used recommend online video news article create feedback loops
user click content suggested algorithm influence next set suggestions
time may lead user entering filter bubble unaware important useful content

legal scholar jonathan zittrain ha warned could create digital gerrymandering effect election selective presentation information intermediary meet agenda rather serve user intentionally manipulated
professional networking site linkedin wa discovered recommend male variation women's name response search queries
example andrea would bring prompt asking user meant andrew query andrew ask user meant find andrea
company said wa result analysis users' interaction site
department store franchise target wa cited gathering data point infer woman customer pregnant even announced sharing information marketing partners
data predicted rather directly observed reported company legal obligation protect privacy customers
google's result may prioritize pornographic content search term related sexuality example lesbian
bias extends search engine showing popular sexualized content neutral searches
example top sexiest woman athlete article displayed first-page result search woman athletes
google adjusted result along others surfaced hate group racist view child abuse pornography upsetting offensive content
example include display higher-paying job male applicant job search websites
researcher also identified machine translation exhibit strong tendency towards male defaults
particular observed field linked unbalanced gender distribution including stem occupations
fact current machine translation system fail reproduce real world distribution female workers
amazoncom turned ai system developed screen job application realized wa biased women
recruitment tool excluded applicant attended all-women's college resume included word women's
similar problem emerged music streaming servicesin wa discovered recommender system algorithm used spotify wa biased woman artists
spotify's song recommendation suggested male artist woman artists
certain race ethnic group treated past data often contain hidden biases
example black people likely receive longer sentence white people committed crime
could potentially mean system amplifies original bias data
google apologized black user complained image-identification algorithm photo application identified gorillas
nikon camera criticized image-recognition algorithm consistently asked asian user blinking
biometric data drawn aspect body including racial feature either observed inferred transferred data points
speech recognition technology different accuracy depending user's accent
biometric data race may also inferred rather observed
example study showed name commonly associated black likely yield search result implying arrest record regardless whether police record individual's name
study also found black asian people assumed lesser functioning lung due racial occupational exposure data incorporated prediction algorithm's model lung function

one example use risk assessment criminal sentencing united state parole hearing judge presented algorithmically generated score intended reflect risk prisoner repeat crime
time period starting ending nationality criminal's father wa consideration risk assessment scores
today score shared judge arizona colorado delaware kentucky louisiana oklahoma virginia washington wisconsin
independent investigation propublica found score inaccurate time disproportionately skewed suggest black risk relapse often whites
one study set examine risk race recidivism predictive bias disparate impact alleges two-fold percent vs
caucasian defendant misclassified imposing higher risk despite objectively remained without documented recidivism two-year period observation
facebook algorithm designed remove online hate speech wa found advantage white men black child assessing objectionable content according internal facebook documents
algorithm combination computer program human content reviewer wa created protect broad category rather specific subset categories
example post denouncing muslim would blocked post denouncing radical muslim would allowed
unanticipated outcome algorithm allow hate speech black child denounce child subset black rather black whereas white men would trigger block white male considered subsets
facebook wa also found allow ad purchaser target jew hater category user company said wa inadvertent outcome algorithm used assessing categorizing data
company's design also allowed ad buyer block african-american seeing housing ads
algorithm used track block hate speech found time likely flag information posted black user time likely flag information hate speech written african american english
without context slur epithet even used community re-appropriated flagged
surveillance camera software may considered inherently political requires algorithm distinguish normal abnormal behavior determine belongs certain location certain times
ability algorithm recognize face across racial spectrum ha shown limited racial diversity image training database majority photo belong one race gender software better recognizing member race gender
however even audit image-recognition system ethically fraught scholar suggested technology's context always disproportionate impact community whose action over-surveilled
example analysis software used identify individual cctv image found several example bias run criminal databases
software wa assessed identifying men frequently woman older people frequently young identified asian african-american race often whites
