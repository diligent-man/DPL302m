algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes such as privileging one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm
bias can emerge from many factors including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded collected selected or used to train the algorithm
for example algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms
this bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race gender sexuality and ethnicity
the study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect systematic and unfair discrimination
this bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks such as the european union s general data protection regulation and the proposed artificial intelligence act
as algorithms expand their ability to organize society politics institutions and behavior sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world
because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias and in some cases reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes
bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre existing cultural social or institutional expectations because of technical limitations of their design or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software s initial design
algorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech
it has also arisen in criminal justice healthcare and hiring compounding existing racial socioeconomic and gender biases
the relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets
problems in understanding researching and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms which are typically treated as trade secrets
even when full transparency is provided the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning
furthermore algorithms may change or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis
in many cases even within a single website or application there is no single algorithm to examine but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs even between users of the same service
algorithms are difficult to define but may be generally understood as lists of instructions that determine how programs read collect process and analyze data to generate output
for a rigorous technical introduction see algorithms
advances in computer hardware have led to an increased ability to process store and transmit data
this has in turn boosted the design and adoption of technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence
by analyzing and processing data algorithms are the backbone of search engines social media websites recommendation engines online retail online advertising and more
contemporary social scientists are concerned with algorithmic processes embedded into hardware and software applications because of their political and social impact and question the underlying assumptions of an algorithm s neutrality
the term algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors that create unfair outcomes such as privileging one arbitrary group of users over others
for example a credit score algorithm may deny a loan without being unfair if it is consistently weighing relevant financial criteria
if the algorithm recommends loans to one group of users but denies loans to another set of nearly identical users based on unrelated criteria and if this behavior can be repeated across multiple occurrences an algorithm can be described as biased
this bias may be intentional or unintentional for example it can come from biased data obtained from a worker that previously did the job the algorithm is going to do from now on
bias can be introduced to an algorithm in several ways
during the assemblage of a dataset data may be collected digitized adapted and entered into a database according to human designed cataloging criteria
next programmers assign priorities or hierarchies for how a program assesses and sorts that data
this requires human decisions about how data is categorized and which data is included or discarded
some algorithms collect their own data based on human selected criteria which can also reflect the bias of human designers
other algorithms may reinforce stereotypes and preferences as they process and display relevant data for human users for example by selecting information based on previous choices of a similar user or group of users
beyond assembling and processing data bias can emerge as a result of design
for example algorithms that determine the allocation of resources or scrutiny such as determining school placements may inadvertently discriminate against a category when determining risk based on similar users as in credit scores
meanwhile recommendation engines that work by associating users with similar users or that make use of inferred marketing traits might rely on inaccurate associations that reflect broad ethnic gender socio economic or racial stereotypes
another example comes from determining criteria for what is included and excluded from results
this criteria could present unanticipated outcomes for search results such as with flight recommendation software that omits flights that do not follow the sponsoring airline s flight paths
algorithms may also display an uncertainty bias offering more confident assessments when larger data sets are available
this can skew algorithmic processes toward results that more closely correspond with larger samples which may disregard data from underrepresented populations
the earliest computer programs were designed to mimic human reasoning and deductions and were deemed to be functioning when they successfully and consistently reproduced that human logic
in his book computer power and human reason artificial intelligence pioneer joseph weizenbaum suggested that bias could arise both from the data used in a program but also from the way a program is coded
weizenbaum wrote that programs are a sequence of rules created by humans for a computer to follow
by following those rules consistently such programs embody law that is enforce a specific way to solve problems
the rules a computer follows are based on the assumptions of a computer programmer for how these problems might be solved
that means the code could incorporate the programmer s imagination of how the world works including their biases and expectations
while a computer program can incorporate bias in this way weizenbaum also noted that any data fed to a machine additionally reflects human decisionmaking processes as data is being selected
finally he noted that machines might also transfer good information with unintended consequences if users are unclear about how to interpret the results
weizenbaum warned against trusting decisions made by computer programs that a user doesn t understand comparing such faith to a tourist who can find his way to a hotel room exclusively by turning left or right on a coin toss
crucially the tourist has no basis of understanding how or why he arrived at his destination and a successful arrival does not mean the process is accurate or reliable
an early example of algorithmic bias resulted in as many as women and ethnic minorities denied entry to st
george s hospital medical school per year from to based on implementation of a new computer guidance assessment system that denied entry to women and men with foreign sounding names based on historical trends in admissions
while many schools at the time employed similar biases in their selection process st
george was most notable for automating said bias through the use of an algorithm thus gaining the attention of people on a much wider scale
in recent years when more algorithms started to use machine learning methods on real world data algorithmic bias can be found more often due to the bias existing in the data
though well designed algorithms frequently determine outcomes that are equally or more equitable than the decisions of human beings cases of bias still occur and are difficult to predict and analyze
the complexity of analyzing algorithmic bias has grown alongside the complexity of programs and their design
decisions made by one designer or team of designers may be obscured among the many pieces of code created for a single program over time these decisions and their collective impact on the program s output may be forgotten
in theory these biases may create new patterns of behavior or scripts in relationship to specific technologies as the code interacts with other elements of society
biases may also impact how society shapes itself around the data points that algorithms require
for example if data shows a high number of arrests in a particular area an algorithm may assign more police patrols to that area which could lead to more arrests
the decisions of algorithmic programs can be seen as more authoritative than the decisions of the human beings they are meant to assist a process described by author clay shirky as algorithmic authority
shirky uses the term to describe the decision to regard as authoritative an unmanaged process of extracting value from diverse untrustworthy sources such as search results
this neutrality can also be misrepresented by the language used by experts and the media when results are presented to the public
for example a list of news items selected and presented as trending or popular may be created based on significantly wider criteria than just their popularity
because of their convenience and authority algorithms are theorized as a means of delegating responsibility away from humans
this can have the effect of reducing alternative options compromises or flexibility
sociologist scott lash has critiqued algorithms as a new form of generative power in that they are a virtual means of generating actual ends
where previously human behavior generated data to be collected and studied powerful algorithms increasingly could shape and define human behaviors
concerns over the impact of algorithms on society have led to the creation of working groups in organizations such as google and microsoft which have co created a working group named fairness accountability
and transparency in machine learning
ideas from google have included community groups that patrol the outcomes of algorithms and vote to control or restrict outputs they deem to have negative consequences
in recent years the study of the fairness accountability
and transparency fat of algorithms has emerged as its own interdisciplinary research area with an annual conference called facct
critics have suggested that fat initiatives cannot serve effectively as independent watchdogs when many are funded by corporations building the systems being studied
pre existing bias in an algorithm is a consequence of underlying social and institutional ideologies
such ideas may influence or create personal biases within individual designers or programmers
such prejudices can be explicit and conscious or implicit and unconscious
poorly selected input data or simply data from a biased source will influence the outcomes created by machines
encoding pre existing bias into software can preserve social and institutional bias and without correction could be replicated in all future uses of that algorithm
an example of this form of bias is the british nationality act program designed to automate the evaluation of new british citizens after the british nationality act
the program accurately reflected the tenets of the law which stated that a man is the father of only his legitimate children whereas a woman is the mother of all her children legitimate or not in its attempt to transfer a particular logic into an algorithmic process the bnap inscribed the logic of the british nationality act into its algorithm which would perpetuate it even if the act was eventually repealed
technical bias emerges through limitations of a program computational power its design or other constraint on the system
such bias can also be a restraint of design for example a search engine that shows three results per screen can be understood to privilege the top three results slightly more than the next three as in an airline price display
another case is software that relies on randomness for fair distributions of results
if the random number generation mechanism is not truly random it can introduce bias for example by skewing selections toward items at the end or beginning of a list
a decontextualized algorithm uses unrelated information to sort results for example a flight pricing algorithm that sorts results by alphabetical order would be biased in favor of american airlines over united airlines
the opposite may also apply in which results are evaluated in contexts different from which they are collected
data may be collected without crucial external context for example when facial recognition software is used by surveillance cameras but evaluated by remote staff in another country or region or evaluated by non human algorithms with no awareness of what takes place beyond the camera s field of vision
this could create an incomplete understanding of a crime scene for example potentially mistaking bystanders for those who commit the crime
lastly technical bias can be created by attempting to formalize decisions into concrete steps on the assumption that human behavior works in the same way
for example software weighs data points to determine whether a defendant should accept a plea bargain while ignoring the impact of emotion on a jury
another unintended result of this form of bias was found in the plagiarism detection software turnitin which compares student written texts to information found online and returns a probability score that the student s work is copied
because the software compares long strings of text it is more likely to identify non native speakers of english than native speakers as the latter group might be better able to change individual words break up strings of plagiarized text or obscure copied passages through synonyms
because it is easier for native speakers to evade detection as a result of the technical constraints of the software this creates a scenario where turnitin identifies foreign speakers of english for plagiarism while allowing more native speakers to evade detection
emergent bias is the result of the use and reliance on algorithms across new or unanticipated contexts
algorithms may not have been adjusted to consider new forms of knowledge such as new drugs or medical breakthroughs new laws business models or shifting cultural norms
this may exclude groups through technology without providing clear outlines to understand who is responsible for their exclusion
similarly problems may emerge when training data the samples fed to a machine by which it models certain conclusions do not align with contexts that an algorithm encounters in the real world
in an example of emergent bias was identified in the software used to place us medical students into residencies the national residency match program nrmp
the algorithm was designed at a time when few married couples would seek residencies together
as more women entered medical schools more students were likely to request a residency alongside their partners
the process called for each applicant to provide a list of preferences for placement across the us which was then sorted and assigned when a hospital and an applicant both agreed to a match
in the case of married couples where both sought residencies the algorithm weighed the location choices of the higher rated partner first
the result was a frequent assignment of highly preferred schools to the first partner and lower preferred schools to the second partner rather than sorting for compromises in placement preference
additional emergent biases include
unpredictable correlations can emerge when large data sets are compared to each other
for example data collected about web browsing patterns may align with signals marking sensitive data such as race or sexual orientation
by selecting according to certain behavior or browsing patterns the end effect would be almost identical to discrimination through the use of direct race or sexual orientation data
in other cases the algorithm draws conclusions from correlations without being able to understand those correlations
for example one triage program gave lower priority to asthmatics who had pneumonia than asthmatics who did not have pneumonia
the program algorithm did this because it simply compared survival rates asthmatics with pneumonia are at the highest risk
historically for this same reason hospitals typically give such asthmatics the best and most immediate care emergent bias can occur when an algorithm is used by unanticipated audiences
for example machines may require that users can read write or understand numbers or relate to an interface using metaphors that they do not understand
these exclusions can become compounded as biased or exclusionary technology is more deeply integrated into society
apart from exclusion unanticipated uses may emerge from the end user relying on the software rather than their own knowledge
in one example an unanticipated user group led to algorithmic bias in the uk when the british national act program was created as a proof of concept by computer scientists and immigration lawyers to evaluate suitability for british citizenship
the designers had access to legal expertise beyond the end users in immigration offices whose understanding of both software and immigration law would likely have been unsophisticated
the agents administering the questions relied entirely on the software which excluded alternative pathways to citizenship and used the software even after new case laws and legal interpretations led the algorithm to become outdated
as a result of designing an algorithm for users assumed to be legally savvy on immigration law the software s algorithm indirectly led to bias in favor of applicants who fit a very narrow set of legal criteria set by the algorithm rather than by the more broader criteria of british immigration law
emergent bias may also create a feedback loop or recursion if data collected for an algorithm results in real world responses which are fed back into the algorithm
for example simulations of the predictive policing software predpol deployed in oakland california suggested an increased police presence in black neighborhoods based on crime data reported by the public
the simulation showed that the public reported crime based on the sight of police cars regardless of what police were doing
the simulation interpreted police car sightings in modeling its predictions of crime and would in turn assign an even larger increase of police presence within those neighborhoods
the human rights data analysis group which conducted the simulation warned that in places where racial discrimination is a factor in arrests such feedback loops could reinforce and perpetuate racial discrimination in policing
another well known example of such an algorithm exhibiting such behavior is compas a software that determines an individual s likelihood of becoming a criminal offender
the software is often criticized for labeling black individuals as criminals much more likely than others and then feeds the data back into itself in the event individuals become registered criminals further enforcing the bias created by the dataset the algorithm is acting on
recommender systems such as those used to recommend online videos or news articles can create feedback loops
when users click on content that is suggested by algorithms it influences the next set of suggestions
over time this may lead to users entering a filter bubble and being unaware of important or useful content
corporate algorithms could be skewed to invisibly favor financial arrangements or agreements between companies without the knowledge of a user who may mistake the algorithm as being impartial
for example american airlines created a flight finding algorithm in the s
the software presented a range of flights from various airlines to customers but weighed factors that boosted its own flights regardless of price or convenience
in testimony to the united states congress the president of the airline stated outright that the system was created with the intention of gaining competitive advantage through preferential treatment
in a paper describing google the founders of the company had adopted a policy of transparency in search results regarding paid placement arguing that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers this bias would be an invisible manipulation of the user
a series of studies about undecided voters in the us and in india found that search engine results were able to shift voting outcomes by about
the researchers concluded that candidates have no means of competing if an algorithm with or without intent boosted page listings for a rival candidate
facebook users who saw messages related to voting were more likely to vote
a randomized trial of facebook users showed a increase votes among users who saw messages encouraging voting as well as images of their friends who had voted
legal scholar jonathan zittrain has warned that this could create a digital gerrymandering effect in elections the selective presentation of information by an intermediary to meet its agenda rather than to serve its users if intentionally manipulated
in the professional networking site linkedin was discovered to recommend male variations of women s names in response to search queries
the site did not make similar recommendations in searches for male names
for example andrea would bring up a prompt asking if users meant andrew but queries for andrew did not ask if users meant to find andrea
the company said this was the result of an analysis of users interactions with the site
in the department store franchise target was cited for gathering data points to infer when women customers were pregnant even if they had not announced it and then sharing that information with marketing partners
because the data had been predicted rather than directly observed or reported the company had no legal obligation to protect the privacy of those customers
web search algorithms have also been accused of bias
google s results may prioritize pornographic content in search terms related to sexuality for example lesbian
this bias extends to the search engine showing popular but sexualized content in neutral searches
for example top sexiest women athletes articles displayed as first page results in searches for women athletes
in google adjusted these results along with others that surfaced hate groups racist views child abuse and pornography and other upsetting and offensive content
other examples include the display of higher paying jobs to male applicants on job search websites
researchers have also identified that machine translation exhibits a strong tendency towards male defaults
in particular this is observed in fields linked to unbalanced gender distribution including stem occupations
in fact current machine translation systems fail to reproduce the real world distribution of female workers
in amazon com turned off an ai system it developed to screen job applications when they realized it was biased against women
the recruitment tool excluded applicants who attended all women s colleges and resumes that included the word women s
a similar problem emerged with music streaming services in it was discovered that the recommender system algorithm used by spotify was biased against women artists
spotify s song recommendations suggested more male artists over women artists
algorithms have been criticized as a method for obscuring racial prejudices in decision making
because of how certain races and ethnic groups were treated in the past data can often contain hidden biases
for example black people are likely to receive longer sentences than white people who committed the same crime
this could potentially mean that a system amplifies the original biases in the data
in google apologized when black users complained that an image identification algorithm in its photos application identified them as gorillas
in nikon cameras were criticized when image recognition algorithms consistently asked asian users if they were blinking
such examples are the product of bias in biometric data sets
biometric data is drawn from aspects of the body including racial features either observed or inferred which can then be transferred into data points
speech recognition technology can have different accuracies depending on the user s accent
this may be caused by the a lack of training data for speakers of that accent
biometric data about race may also be inferred rather than observed
for example a study showed that names commonly associated with blacks were more likely to yield search results implying arrest records regardless of whether there is any police record of that individual s name
a study also found that black and asian people are assumed to have lesser functioning lungs due to racial and occupational exposure data not being incorporated into the prediction algorithm s model of lung function
in a research study revealed that a healthcare algorithm sold by optum favored white patients over sicker black patients
the algorithm predicts how much patients would cost the health care system in the future
however cost is not race neutral as black patients incurred about less in medical costs per year than white patients with the same number of chronic conditions which led to the algorithm scoring white patients as equally at risk of future health problems as black patients who suffered from significantly more diseases
a study conducted by researchers at uc berkeley in november revealed that mortgage algorithms have been discriminatory towards latino and african americans which discriminated against minorities based on creditworthiness which is rooted in the u s
fair lending law which allows lenders to use measures of identification to determine if an individual is worthy of receiving loans
these particular algorithms were present in fintech companies and were shown to discriminate against minorities
algorithms already have numerous applications in legal systems
an example of this is compas a commercial program widely used by u s
courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist
propublica claims that the average compas assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than the average compas assigned risk level of white defendants and that black defendants are twice as likely to be erroneously assigned the label high risk as white defendants
one example is the use of risk assessments in criminal sentencing in the united states and parole hearings judges were presented with an algorithmically generated score intended to reflect the risk that a prisoner will repeat a crime
for the time period starting in and ending in the nationality of a criminal s father was a consideration in those risk assessment scores
today these scores are shared with judges in arizona colorado delaware kentucky louisiana oklahoma virginia washington and wisconsin
an independent investigation by propublica found that the scores were inaccurate of the time and disproportionately skewed to suggest blacks to be at risk of relapse more often than whites
one study that set out to examine risk race recidivism predictive bias and disparate impact alleges a two fold percent vs
percent adverse likelihood for black vs
caucasian defendants to be misclassified as imposing a higher risk despite having objectively remained without any documented recidivism over a two year period of observation
in a facebook algorithm designed to remove online hate speech was found to advantage white men over black children when assessing objectionable content according to internal facebook documents
the algorithm which is a combination of computer programs and human content reviewers was created to protect broad categories rather than specific subsets of categories
for example posts denouncing muslims would be blocked while posts denouncing radical muslims would be allowed
an unanticipated outcome of the algorithm is to allow hate speech against black children because they denounce the children subset of blacks rather than all blacks whereas all white men would trigger a block because whites and males are not considered subsets
facebook was also found to allow ad purchasers to target jew haters as a category of users which the company said was an inadvertent outcome of algorithms used in assessing and categorizing data
the company s design also allowed ad buyers to block african americans from seeing housing ads
while algorithms are used to track and block hate speech some were found to be times more likely to flag information posted by black users and times likely to flag information as hate speech if written in african american english
without context for slurs and epithets even when used by communities which have re appropriated them were flagged
surveillance camera software may be considered inherently political because it requires algorithms to distinguish normal from abnormal behaviors and to determine who belongs in certain locations at certain times
the ability of such algorithms to recognize faces across a racial spectrum has been shown to be limited by the racial diversity of images in its training database if the majority of photos belong to one race or gender the software is better at recognizing other members of that race or gender
however even audits of these image recognition systems are ethically fraught and some scholars have suggested the technology s context will always have a disproportionate impact on communities whose actions are over surveilled
for example a analysis of software used to identify individuals in cctv images found several examples of bias when run against criminal databases
the software was assessed as identifying men more frequently than women older people more frequently than the young and identified asians african americans and other races more often than whites
additional studies of facial recognition software have found the opposite to be true when trained on non criminal databases with the software being the least accurate in identifying darker skinned females
in users of the gay hookup application grindr reported that the android store s recommendation algorithm was linking grindr to applications designed to find sex offenders which critics said inaccurately related homosexuality with pedophilia
writer mike ananny criticized this association in the atlantic arguing that such associations further stigmatized gay men
in online retailer amazon de listed books after an algorithmic change expanded its adult content blacklist to include any book addressing sexuality or gay themes such as the critically acclaimed novel brokeback mountain
in it was found that on facebook searches for photos of my female friends yielded suggestions such as in bikinis or at the beach
in contrast searches for photos of my male friends yielded no results
facial recognition technology has been seen to cause problems for transgender individuals
in there were reports of uber drivers who were transgender or transitioning experiencing difficulty with the facial recognition software that uber implements as a built in security measure
as a result of this some of the accounts of trans uber drivers were suspended which cost them fares and potentially cost them a job all due to the facial recognition software experiencing difficulties with recognizing the face of a trans driver who was transitioning
although the solution to this issue would appear to be including trans individuals in training sets for machine learning models an instance of trans youtube videos that were collected to be used in training data did not receive consent from the trans individuals that were included in the videos which created an issue of violation of privacy
there has also been a study that was conducted at stanford university in that tested algorithms in a machine learning system that was said to be able to detect an individuals sexual orientation based on their facial images
the model in the study predicted a correct distinction between gay and straight men of the time and a correct distinction between gay and straight women of the time
this study resulted in a backlash from the lgbtqia community who were fearful of the possible negative repercussions that this ai system could have on individuals of the lgbtqia community by putting individuals at risk of being outed against their will
while users generate results that are completed automatically google has failed to remove sexist and racist autocompletion text
for example algorithms of oppression how search engines reinforce racism safiya noble notes an example of the search for black girls which was reported to result in pornographic images
google claimed it was unable to erase those pages unless they were considered unlawful
several problems impede the study of large scale algorithmic bias hindering the application of academically rigorous studies and public understanding
literature on algorithmic bias has focused on the remedy of fairness but definitions of fairness are often incompatible with each other and the realities of machine learning optimization
for example defining fairness as an equality of outcomes may simply refer to a system producing the same result for all people while fairness defined as equality of treatment might explicitly consider differences between individuals
as a result fairness is sometimes described as being in conflict with the accuracy of a model suggesting innate tensions between the priorities of social welfare and the priorities of the vendors designing these systems
in response to this tension researchers have suggested more care to the design and use of systems that draw on potentially biased algorithms with fairness defined for specific applications and contexts
algorithmic processes are complex often exceeding the understanding of the people who use them
large scale operations may not be understood even by those involved in creating them
the methods and processes of contemporary programs are often obscured by the inability to know every permutation of a code s input or output
social scientist bruno latour has identified this process as blackboxing a process in which scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success
when a machine runs efficiently when a matter of fact is settled one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity
thus paradoxically the more science and technology succeed the more opaque and obscure they become others have critiqued the black box metaphor suggesting that current algorithms are not one black box but a network of interconnected ones
an example of this complexity can be found in the range of inputs into customizing feedback
the social media site facebook factored in at least data points to determine the layout of a user s social media feed in
furthermore large teams of programmers may operate in relative isolation from one another and be unaware of the cumulative effects of small decisions within connected elaborate algorithms
not all code is original and may be borrowed from other libraries creating a complicated set of relationships between data processing and data input systems
additional complexity occurs through machine learning and the personalization of algorithms based on user interactions such as clicks time spent on site and other metrics
these personal adjustments can confuse general attempts to understand algorithms
one unidentified streaming radio service reported that it used five unique music selection algorithms it selected for its users based on their behavior
this creates different experiences of the same streaming services between different users making it harder to understand what these algorithms do
companies also run frequent a b tests to fine tune algorithms based on user response
for example the search engine bing can run up to ten million subtle variations of its service per day creating different experiences of the service between each use and or user
commercial algorithms are proprietary and may be treated as trade secrets
treating algorithms as trade secrets protects companies such as search engines where a transparent algorithm might reveal tactics to manipulate search rankings
this makes it difficult for researchers to conduct interviews or analysis to discover how algorithms function
critics suggest that such secrecy can also obscure possible unethical methods used in producing or processing algorithmic output
other critics such as lawyer and activist katarzyna szymielewicz have suggested that the lack of transparency is often disguised as a result of algorithmic complexity shielding companies from disclosing or investigating its own algorithmic processes
a significant barrier to understanding the tackling of bias in practice is that categories such as demographics of individuals protected by anti discrimination law are often not explicitly considered when collecting and processing data
in some cases there is little opportunity to collect this data explicitly such as in device fingerprinting ubiquitous computing and the internet of things
in other cases the data controller may not wish to collect such data for reputational reasons or because it represents a heightened liability and security risk
it may also be the case that at least in relation to the european union s general data protection regulation such data falls under the special category provisions article and therefore comes with more restrictions on potential collection and processing
some practitioners have tried to estimate and impute these missing sensitive categorisations in order to allow bias mitigation for example building systems to infer ethnicity from names however this can introduce other forms of bias if not undertaken with care
machine learning researchers have drawn upon cryptographic privacy enhancing technologies such as secure multi party computation to propose methods whereby algorithmic bias can be assessed or mitigated without these data ever being available to modellers in cleartext
algorithmic bias does not only include protected categories but can also concerns characteristics less easily observable or codifiable such as political viewpoints
in these cases there is rarely an easily accessible or non controversial ground truth and removing the bias from such a system is more difficult
furthermore false and accidental correlations can emerge from a lack of understanding of protected categories for example insurance rates based on historical data of car accidents which may overlap strictly by coincidence with residential clusters of ethnic minorities
a study of policy guidelines on ethical ai found that fairness and mitigation of unwanted bias was a common point of concern and were addressed through a blend of technical solutions transparency and monitoring right to remedy and increased oversight and diversity and inclusion efforts
there have been several attempts to create methods and tools that can detect and observe biases within an algorithm
these emergent fields focus on tools which are typically applied to the training data used by the program rather than the algorithm s internal processes
these methods may also analyze a program s output and its usefulness and therefore may involve the analysis of its confusion matrix or table of confusion
explainable ai to detect algorithm bias is a suggested way to detect the existence of bias in an algorithm or learning model
using machine learning to detect bias is called conducting an ai audit where the auditor is an algorithm that goes through the ai model and the training data to identify biases
ensuring that an ai tool such as a classifier is free from bias is more difficult than just removing the sensitive information
from its input signals because this is typically implicit in other signals
for example the hobbies sports and schools attended
by a job candidate might reveal their gender to the software even when this is removed from the analysis
solutions to this
problem involve ensuring that the intelligent agent does not have any information that could be used to reconstruct the protected
and sensitive information about the subject as first demonstrated in where a deep learning network was simultaneously trained to learn a task while at the same time being completely agnostic about the protected feature
a simpler method was proposed in the context of word embeddings and involves removing information that is correlated with the protected characteristic
currently a new ieee standard is being drafted that aims to specify methodologies which help creators of algorithms eliminate issues of bias and articulate transparency i e
to authorities or end users about the function and possible effects of their algorithms
the project was approved february and is sponsored by the software systems engineering standards committee a committee chartered by the ieee computer society
a draft of the standard is expected to be submitted for balloting in june
ethics guidelines on ai point to the need for accountability recommending that steps be taken to improve the interpretability of results
such solutions include the consideration of the right to understanding in machine learning algorithms and to resist deployment of machine learning in situations where the decisions could not be explained or reviewed
toward this end a movement for explainable ai is already underway within organizations such as darpa for reasons that go beyond the remedy of bias
price waterhouse coopers for example also suggests that monitoring output means designing systems in such a way as to ensure that solitary components of the system can be isolated and shut down if they skew results
an initial approach towards transparency included the open sourcing of algorithms
software code can be looked into and improvements can be proposed through source code hosting facilities
however this approach doesn t necessarily produce the intended effects
companies and organizations can share all possible documentation and code but this does not establish transparency if the audience doesn t understand the information given
therefore the role of an interested critical audience is worth exploring in relation to transparency
algorithms cannot be held accountable without a critical audience
from a regulatory perspective the toronto declaration calls for applying a human rights framework to harms caused by algorithmic bias
this includes legislating expectations of due diligence on behalf of designers of these algorithms and creating accountability when private actors fail to protect the public interest noting that such rights may be obscured by the complexity of determining responsibility within a web of complex intertwining processes
others propose the need for clear liability insurance mechanisms
amid concerns that the design of ai systems is primarily the domain of white male engineers a number of scholars have suggested that algorithmic bias may be minimized by expanding inclusion in the ranks of those designing ai systems
for example just of machine learning engineers are women with black ai leaders pointing to a diversity crisis in the field
groups like black in ai and queer in ai are attempting to create more inclusive spaces in the ai community and work against the often harmful desires of corporations that control the trajectory of ai research
critiques of simple inclusivity efforts suggest that diversity programs can not address overlapping forms of inequality and have called for applying a more deliberate lens of intersectionality to the design of algorithms
researchers at the university of cambridge have argued that addressing racial diversity is hampered by the whiteness of the culture of ai
the general data protection regulation gdpr the european union s revised data protection regime that was implemented in addresses automated individual decision making including profiling in article
these rules prohibit solely automated decisions which have a significant or legal effect on an individual unless they are explicitly authorised by consent contract or member state law
where they are permitted there must be safeguards in place such as a right to a human in the loop and a non binding right to an explanation of decisions reached
while these regulations are commonly considered to be new nearly identical provisions have existed across europe since in article of the data protection directive
the original automated decision rules and safeguards found in french law since the late s
the gdpr addresses algorithmic bias in profiling systems as well as the statistical approaches possible to clean it directly in recital noting thatthe controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling implement technical and organisational measures appropriate
that prevents inter alia discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin political opinion religion or beliefs trade union membership genetic or health status or sexual orientation or that result in measures having such an effect like the non binding right to an explanation in recital the problem is the non binding nature of recitals
while it has been treated as a requirement by the article working party that advised on the implementation of data protection law its practical dimensions are unclear
it has been argued that the data protection impact assessments for high risk data profiling alongside other pre emptive measures within data protection may be a better way to tackle issues of algorithmic discrimination as it restricts the actions of those deploying algorithms rather than requiring consumers to file complaints or request changes
the united states has no general legislation controlling algorithmic bias approaching the problem through various state and federal laws that might vary by industry sector and by how an algorithm is used
many policies are self enforced or controlled by the federal trade commission
in the obama administration released the national artificial intelligence research and development strategic plan which was intended to guide policymakers toward a critical assessment of algorithms
it recommended researchers to design these systems so that their actions and decision making are transparent and easily interpretable by humans and thus can be examined for any bias they may contain rather than just learning and repeating these biases
intended only as guidance the report did not create any legal precedent
in new york city passed the first algorithmic accountability bill in the united states
the bill which went into effect on january required the creation of a task force that provides recommendations on how information on agency automated decision systems may be shared with the public and how agencies may address instances where people are harmed by agency automated decision systems the task force is required to present findings and recommendations for further regulatory action in
on july a draft of the personal data bill was presented
the draft proposes standards for the storage processing and transmission of data
while it does not use the term algorithm it makes for provisions for harm resulting from any processing or any kind of processing undertaken by the fiduciary
it defines any denial or withdrawal of a service benefit or good resulting from an evaluative decision about the data principal or any discriminatory treatment as a source of harm that could arise from improper use of data
it also makes special provisions for people of intersex status
