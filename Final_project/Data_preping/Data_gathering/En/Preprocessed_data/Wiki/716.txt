The Giving Pledge is a campaign to encourage extremely wealthy people to contribute a majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes
As of JuneÂ 2022, the pledge has 236 signatories from 28 countries
Most of the signatories of the pledge are billionaires, and as of 2016, their pledges are estimated to total US$600 billion.
The organization's stated goal is to inspire the wealthy people of the world to give at least half of their net worth to philanthropy, either during their lifetime or upon their death
The pledge is a public gesture of an intention to give, not a legal contract
On The Giving Pledge's website, each individual or couple writes a letter explaining why they chose to give.
In June 2010, the Giving Pledge campaign was formally announced and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett began recruiting members
As of August 2010, the aggregate wealth of the first 40 pledgers was $125 billion
As of April 2011, 69 billionaires had joined the campaign and given a pledge, and by the following year, The Huffington Post reported that a total of 81 billionaires had pledged
By May 2017, 158 individuals and/or couples were listed as pledgers
Not all pledgers are billionaires.
