Lucky was a fashion and lifestyle magazine founded by Kim France and first published in under the Cond Nast subsidiary
Since its launch in December Lucky was one of Cond Nast's biggest publications with circulation rising from to over million
Kim France founded Lucky and was its first editor-in-chief a position she held for almost ten years
Brandon Holley replaced France as editor-in-chief in
In June Eva Chen replaced Holley as EIC of Lucky after a source revealed that while Holley was digitally savvy she lacked vision and fashion experience and thus the publication lost its style credentials
Chen's approach of featuring unknown fashion bloggers while recruiting expensive upscale stylists like Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele and legendary photographers like Patrick Demarchelier caused Luckyâ€™s newsstand sales to fall even further by in the first half of to due to its high price point
Chen later resigned from the post in April
In Lucky announced that it would hold its first FABB The Fashion and Beauty Blog conference
It was the first event of its kind bringing together group of digital fashion beauty technology and celebrity leaders and influential advertisers to the blogger community
Some of the participants included Cat Deeley Alli Webb Jessica Alba and Paige Adams-Geller
In April BeachMint a Los Angelesbased e-commerce company began a joint venture with Cond Nast
The Cond Nast press release revealed that the venture would be called the Lucky Group
Eva Chen served as the chief creative officer for the Lucky Group and BeachMint's Josh Bearman as its CEO
This effectively meant that Lucky Magazine was sold to Beachmint
In May the frequency of Lucky was switched to quarterly
One month later in June the magazine folded
Katia Kuethe was the magazine's final Creative Director
From the magazine industryWhen Lucky was first released it received criticism for its content that bordered between editorial and advertising
The American Society of Magazine Editors was skeptical of Lucky's business practices in featuring products
Lucky's reputation grew to a more positive one as time progressed
Simon Dumenco a columnist at New York Magazine initially gave a negative assessment but later praised the magazine for focusing on the merits of a product rather than advertising it through celebrity endorsements like other women's magazines
Peters said in an article published in The New York Times It was in retrospect ahead of its time a print rendering of a shopping portal on the Web
It was well received by both the news media and advertisers in part because it was a well executed magazine that did not take itself too seriously
From the advertising industryLucky was Advertising Age's Magazine of the Year in highlighting its success with marketers and consumers
