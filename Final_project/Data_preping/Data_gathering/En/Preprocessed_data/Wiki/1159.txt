rape and revenge films are a subgenre of exploitation film that was particularly popular in the s but attracted controversy as a target of extreme cinema
rape and revenge films generally follow the same three act structure
act i the character is violently raped and maybe further abused tortured or left for dead
act ii the character survives and may rehabilitate themselves
act iii the character exacts revenge and or kills their rapist s in gaspar no s film irr versible the structure was reversed with the first act depicting the revenge before tracing back the events which led to that point
roger ebert argues that by using this structure as well as a false revenge irr versible cannot be classified as an exploitation film as no exploitation of the subject matter takes place
the genre has attracted critical attention
much of this critical attention comes from feminist critics examining the complex politics involved in the genre and its impact on cinema more generally
more recently a broad analysis of the rape revenge genre and concept was published in rape revenge films a critical study by alexandra heller nicholas
the book argues against a simplistic notion of the term rape revenge and suggests a film specific approach in order to avoid generalizing films which may diverge not over the treatment of sexual assault as much as they do in regard to the morality of the revenge act in addition to american and french films rape revenge films have been made in japan e g takashi ishii s freeze me finland russia the voroshilov sharpshooter argentina e g i ll never die alone original title no morir sola and norway e g the whore original title hora in japanese anime manga series redo of healer is a dark fantasy light novel almost similar to the structure about a young man who wishes to being a healing magician before is exploited and sexually abused repeatedly by corrupted heroes and guards and later decided to redo everything and takes revenge against corruption who abused him
though the plot was both controversial for its first act of the light novel and popularized with the genre due to containing of graphic violence gratuitous amounts of sexual content and assault and other contents such as treatment of female characters cannibalism slavery and torture all elements are often being used as a plot device captivity narrative
