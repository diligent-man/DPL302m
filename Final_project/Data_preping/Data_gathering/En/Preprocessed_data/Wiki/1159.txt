Rape and revenge films are a subgenre of exploitation film that was particularly popular in the 1970s, but attracted controversy as a target of extreme cinema.
Rape and revenge films generally follow the same three-act structure:
Act I: The character is (violently) raped and maybe further abused, tortured or left for dead.
Act II: The character survives and may rehabilitate themselves.
Act III: The character exacts revenge and/or kills their rapist(s).In Gaspar Noé's 2002 film Irréversible, the structure was reversed, with the first act depicting the revenge before tracing back the events which led to that point
Roger Ebert argues that, by using this structure as well as a false revenge, Irréversible cannot be classified as an exploitation film, as no exploitation of the subject matter takes place.
The genre has attracted critical attention
Much of this critical attention comes from feminist critics examining the complex politics involved in the genre and its impact on cinema more generally
More recently, a broad analysis of the rape-revenge genre and concept was published in Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study, by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas
The book argues against a simplistic notion of the term "rape-revenge" and suggests a film-specific approach in order to avoid generalizing films which may "diverge not over the treatment of sexual assault as much as they do in regard to the morality of the revenge act."In addition to American and French films, rape/revenge films have been made in Japan (e.g., Takashi Ishii's Freeze Me), Finland, Russia (The Voroshilov Sharpshooter), Argentina (e.g., I'll Never Die Alone; [2008]; original title: No Moriré Sola), and Norway (e.g., The Whore [2009]; original title: Hora).In Japanese anime/manga series, Redo of Healer is a dark fantasy light novel, almost similar to the structure, about a young man who wishes to being a healing magician before is exploited and sexually abused repeatedly by corrupted heroes and guards, and later decided to redo everything and takes revenge against corruption who abused him
Though the plot was both controversial for its first act of the light novel and popularized with the genre due to containing of graphic violence, gratuitous amounts of sexual content and assault, and other contents such as treatment of female characters, cannibalism, slavery and torture, all elements are often being used as a plot device.Captivity narrative
