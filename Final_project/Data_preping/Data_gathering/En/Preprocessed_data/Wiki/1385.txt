Cloo stylized as cloo was an American pay television channel owned and operated by NBCUniversal which aired programming originally dedicated to the crime and mystery genres though it often fell out of this format in its later years with a more generic selection of series and films and was used as an example of channel drift and superfluous channel bundling presenting series easily found through other venues
As of February approximately American households of households with television received Cloo though this declined with later removals by several cable services as carriage agreements expired
Cloo launched on January as Sleuth replacing Trio The channel ceased all operations on February
Cloo focused on mystery entertainment with the majority of the channel's programming sourced from fellow Comcast networks such as NBC and USA Network As of the fall of the network's schedule was made up mostly of repeats of current USA Network series and marathons of acquired series from the Law and Order NCIS and CSI franchises along with the original MacGyver and House Films from the NBCUniversal library or acquired as part of USA Network's film rights purchases were also part of the schedule meaning films having nothing to do with crimes or mysteries such as Enchanted The Year Old Virgin and Bee Movie aired on the network
On August Cloo was rebranded from its former name of Sleuth in order for NBCU to be able to trademark and own the name as the word clue itself is too common a name to be trademark able and the commonness of both sleuth and clue would not work for search engine optimization In addition the different spelling averted any confusion with Hasbro's board game Clue
On August Cloo was dropped by Dish Network which cited that most of the network's rerun centric programming was duplicative of that available on other networks and streaming services A year later on August it was removed from Verizon FIOS for the same reason
Charter Communications Spectrum Bright House Networks and Time Warner Cable effectively ended the network's life in January as with Esquire Network another Comcast NBCU network which was discontinued on June when it refused to continue their carriage of Cloo within their new carriage agreements with NBCUniversal removing around rds of the network's homes bringing it down to million households and NBCU already had been looking to remove extraneous networks without original programming since the summer of criteria which Cloo Chiller and Esquire fell into In the end however industry media had little to no notice of the closure and only cable providers learned of its demise in advance on January as of a m ET from Comcast due to the small amount of time which passed between Charter's settlement of their new NBCUniversal carriage agreement and the network's closure Because the network was effectively automated with little to no promotions to maintain no employees were affected by the network's closure
The same morning its social media presences were removed the network's Facebook had not been updated since September and the website redirected to the USA Network site without any notice The network's last programming day consisted of a full series marathon of Syfy's Continuum a final sign of its later channel drift Following the end credits a slide was shown with the Cloo logo and the words GOOD NIGHT underneath along with Thank you for watching Cloo the NBCUniversal logo and the name of the satellite that provided Cloo's broadcast AMC Transponder in between two NBC logos along with the common NBC off air audio test using the network's trademark chimes after which the channel space created by Trio in folded and ceased to exist The end of Cloo was coincidental with another Comcast announcement that the female focused Oxygen would be switched to a true crime focus the same day within the coming months
