cloo stylized as cloo was an american pay television channel owned and operated by nbcuniversal which aired programming originally dedicated to the crime and mystery genres though it often fell out of this format in its later years with a more generic selection of series and films and was used as an example of channel drift and superfluous channel bundling presenting series easily found through other venues
