reservoir rockis true chalk-a fine-grained limestone composed skeletal remains pelagic unicellular golden-brown algae coccolithophores
structure wa discovered using seismic reflection data although initial interpretation distorted due zone high gas saturation overlying cenozoic rock causing low seismic velocities
however high porosity reservoir rock doe cause increase seismic amplitude used isopach map determine net pay
mid-s ekofisk field whole platform particular found suffering unexpected degree subsidence
detailed geological investigation showed wa result delayed compactional diagenesis chalk formation reservoir rocks
hydrocarbon produced pore pressure declined effective stress increased leading subsidence
water injection wa initiated repressurize reservoir due lower compaction strength water-saturated chalk compared oil-saturated chalk seafloor continued subsiding displacement several metre recorded
wa calculated total subsidence would almost ft end concession phillips petroleum much keep platform secure
norwegian government pressed phillips take action french company technip wa ordered find solution
solution wa steel tubular leg platform would extended
subsequently large flange welded leg flange welded leg cut five platform would lifted simultaneously one operation extension pipe would mounted flanges
position tolerance cylinder mm ft extension per platform mm platform wa kept hours
welding flange leg hydraulic cylinder took entire load
couple day great jack-up hotel platform wa lifted wa interconnected others
total lifting capacity cylinder wa approximately tonne long ton short ton wa published guinness world record largest jack-up
april oil well blowout occurred ekofisk bravo platform due incorrectly installed downhole safety valve
