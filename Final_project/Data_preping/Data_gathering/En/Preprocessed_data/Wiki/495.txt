ekofisk is an oil field in block of the norwegian sector of the north sea about km mi southwest of stavanger
discovered in by phillips petroleum company it remains one of the most important oil fields in the north sea
this was the first discovery of oil after the drilling of over exploration wells in the north sea triggered by the groningen gas field discovery
in phillips started producing directly to tankers from four subsea wells
oil production is planned to continue until at least
the greater ekofisk area consists of cod ekofisk west ekofisk tor albuskjell eldfisk edda and embla oil fields
the ekofisk center is a vast complex of platforms and structures creating a transportation hub also for surrounding fields such as valhall hod gyda ula statfjord heimdal tommeliten and gullfaks
the whole complex consists of platforms
produced oil is transported by the norpipe oil pipeline to the teesside refinery in england
natural gas is transported by the norpipe gas pipeline to emden in germany
the ekofisk field is a north south trending anticline with a central graben forming a structure that is km sq mi in area with m ft of vertical closure and a hydrocarbon column m ft long formed by permian zechstein salt movement in the form of salt pillows
the production zones at a depth of about km include the paleocene ekofisk formation and the upper cretaceous tor formation both chalk group rocks containing porosities of
the reservoir rock is a true chalk a fine grained limestone composed of the skeletal remains of pelagic unicellular golden brown algae or coccolithophores
the source rocks are the upper jurassic kimmeridgian shales
the structure was discovered using seismic reflection data in the s although the initial interpretations were distorted due to zones of high gas saturation in the overlying cenozoic rocks causing low seismic velocities
however the high porosity of the reservoir rock does cause an increase in seismic amplitude which can be used with an isopach map to determine net pay
in the mid s the ekofisk field as a whole and the platforms in particular were found to be suffering from an unexpected degree of subsidence
detailed geological investigation showed that it was the result of delayed compactional diagenesis of the chalk formation reservoir rocks
as hydrocarbons were produced the pore pressure declined and the effective stress increased leading to subsidence
water injection was initiated to repressurize the reservoir but due to the lower compaction strength of water saturated chalk compared with oil saturated chalk the seafloor continued subsiding and displacements of several metres were recorded
it was calculated that the total subsidence would almost be m ft at the end of the concession of phillips petroleum too much to keep the platforms secure
the norwegian government pressed phillips to take action and the french company technip was ordered to find a solution
as of platforms were interconnected they had to be jacked up by about m ft at the same time
the solution was that the steel tubular legs of the platforms would be extended
subsequently large flanges were welded to these legs and when all flanges were welded and the legs cut five platforms would be lifted simultaneously in one operation then extension pipes would be mounted in between the flanges
after bolting all flanges the platforms would be safe again
the four days lifting was completed on august at p m
thanks to hydraulic cylinders synchronised with a network of num fcncs
the position tolerance of the cylinders with each other mm in for a m ft extension per platform and mm in between platforms was to be kept for hours
during the welding of the flanges to the legs these hydraulic cylinders took over the entire load
a couple of days before this great jack up the hotel platform was lifted as it was not interconnected with the others
the total lifting capacity of all these cylinders was approximately tonnes long tons short tons and was published in the guinness world records as being the largest jack up
in april an oil well blowout occurred at the ekofisk bravo platform due to an incorrectly installed downhole safety valve
at an estimated barrels m total it was the largest blowout in the north sea
red adair and his crew assisted with capping the blowout
