Ekofisk is an oil field in block 2/4 of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea about 320 km (200 mi) southwest of Stavanger
 Discovered in 1969 by Phillips Petroleum Company, it remains one of the most important oil fields in the North Sea
This was the first discovery of oil after the drilling of over 200 exploration wells in the North Sea "triggered" by the Groningen gas field discovery
In 1971, Phillips started producing directly to tankers from four subsea wells
Oil production is planned to continue until at least 2050.
The Greater Ekofisk Area consists of Cod, Ekofisk, West Ekofisk, Tor, Albuskjell, Eldfisk, Edda and Embla oil fields
 The Ekofisk Center is a vast complex of platforms and structures creating a transportation hub also for surrounding fields such as Valhall, Hod, Gyda, Ula, Statfjord, Heimdal, Tommeliten and Gullfaks
 The whole complex consists of 29 platforms
Produced oil is transported by the Norpipe oil pipeline to the Teesside Refinery in England
Natural gas is transported by the Norpipe gas pipeline to Emden in Germany.
The Ekofisk field is a north–south trending anticline, with a central graben, forming a structure that is 49 km (19 sq mi) in area, with 244 m (801 ft) of vertical closure and a hydrocarbon column 305 m (1,001 ft) long, formed by Permian Zechstein salt movement in the form of salt pillows
The production zones at a depth of about 3 km, include the Paleocene Ekofisk Formation and the Upper Cretaceous Tor Formation, both Chalk Group rocks containing porosities of 30-40%
 "The reservoir rock...is a true chalk-a fine-grained limestone composed of the skeletal remains of pelagic unicellular golden-brown algae or coccolithophores"
The source rocks are the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridgian shales.
The structure was discovered using seismic reflection data in the 1960s, although the initial interpretations were distorted due to zones of high gas saturation in the overlying Cenozoic rocks causing low seismic velocities
However, the high porosity of the reservoir rock does cause an increase in seismic amplitude which can be used with an isopach map to determine net pay.
In the mid-1980s the Ekofisk field as a whole and the platforms in particular were found to be suffering from an unexpected degree of subsidence
Detailed geological investigation showed that it was the result of delayed compactional diagenesis of the Chalk Formation reservoir rocks
As hydrocarbons were produced the pore pressure declined and the effective stress increased leading to subsidence
Water injection was initiated to repressurize the reservoir, but due to the lower compaction strength of water-saturated chalk compared with oil-saturated chalk the seafloor continued subsiding and displacements of several metres were recorded
It was calculated that the total subsidence would almost be 6 m (20 ft) at the end of the concession of Phillips Petroleum, too much to keep the platforms secure.
The Norwegian government pressed Phillips to take action and the French company Technip was ordered to find a solution
As 5 of 7 platforms were interconnected, they had to be jacked-up by about 6 m (20 ft) at the same time
The solution was that the steel tubular legs of the platforms would be extended
Subsequently, large flanges were welded to these legs and when all flanges were welded and the legs cut, five platforms would be lifted simultaneously in one operation then extension pipes would be mounted in between the flanges
After bolting all flanges the platforms would be safe again.
The four days lifting was completed on 17 August 1987, at 11:30 p.m
thanks to 108 hydraulic cylinders synchronised with a network of 14 NUM 760FCNCs
The position tolerance of the cylinders with each other (+/- 3 mm (0.12 in) for a 6 m (20 ft) extension per platform and +/- 100 mm (3.9 in) between platforms) was to be kept for 38 hours
During the welding of the flanges to the legs, these hydraulic cylinders took over the entire load
A couple of days before this great jack-up, the hotel platform was lifted, as it was not interconnected with the others
The total lifting capacity of all these cylinders was approximately 40,000 tonnes (39,000 long tons; 44,000 short tons) and was published in the Guinness World Records as being the largest jack-up.
In April 1977, an oil well blowout occurred at the Ekofisk Bravo platform, due to an incorrectly installed downhole safety valve
At an estimated 80,000–126,000 barrels (12,700–20,000 m) total, it was the largest blowout in the North Sea
 Red Adair and his crew assisted with capping the blowout.
