The Ferrari GTO is a GT car produced by Ferrari from to for homologation into the FIA's Group Grand Touring Car category
It was powered by Ferrari's Tipo Colombo V engine
The in its name denotes the displacement in cubic centimeters of each of its cylinders GTO stands for Gran Turismo Omologato Italian for Grand Touring Homologated
Just of the GTOs were manufactured between and
This includes cars with - bodywork Series I and three with Series II bodywork similar to the Ferrari LM
Four of the older - Series I cars were updated in with Series II bodies
When new the GTO cost in the United States with buyers personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and his dealer for North America Luigi Chinetti
This model has since become highly desired by automobile collectors and sales have repeatedly set price records
The current record for world's most expensive Ferrari was set in June when a GTO chassis GT was sold in a private sale for million
In Sports Car International placed the GTO eighth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the s and nominated it the top sports car of all time
Similarly Motor Trend Classic placed the GTO first on a list of the Greatest Ferraris of All Time Popular Mechanics named it the Hottest Car of All Time
The GTO was designed to compete in Group GT racing where its rivals would include the Shelby Cobra Jaguar E-Type and Aston Martin DP
The development of the GTO was headed by chief engineer Giotto Bizzarrini
Although Bizzarrini is usually credited as the designer of the GTO he and most other Ferrari engineers were fired in due to a dispute with Enzo Ferrari
Further development of the GTO was overseen by new engineer Mauro Forghieri who worked with Scaglietti to continue development of the body
The design of the car was a collaborative effort and cannot be ascribed to a single person
The mechanical aspects of GTO were relatively conservative at the time of its introduction using engine and chassis components that were proven in earlier competition cars
The chassis of the car was based on that of the GT SWB with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight stiffen and lower the chassis
The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame incorporating A-arm front suspension rear live-axle with Watt's linkage disc brakes and Borrani wire wheels
The engine was the race-proven Tipo Comp
L cc V as used in the Testa Rossa Le Mans winner
An all-alloy design utilizing a dry sump and six DCN Weber carburetors it produced approximately PS bhp kW at rpm and N⋅m lbf⋅ft kg⋅m at rpm of torque
The gearbox was a new -speed unit with Porsche-type synchromesh
Bizzarrini focused his design effort on the car's aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability
The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at Pisa University as well as road and track testing with several prototypes
The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long low nose small radiator inlet and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers
Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear spoiler
The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover
The aerodynamic design of the GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as Lotus
The bodies were constructed by Scaglietti with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by Pininfarina in the case of sn GT
Cars were produced in many colours with the most famous being the bright red Rosso Cina
The minimalist interior of a GTO reflects the car's racing intentions
There is no speedometer seats are cloth-upholstered and neither carpeting nor a headliner was installed
Cockpit ventilation is via exterior air inlets
The exposed metal gate defining the shift pattern became a Ferrari tradition maintained in production models until replaced by steering column-mounted paddle shifters in the s
As the GTO was heavily derived from the earlier GT Berlinetta SWB Ferrari engineers constructed two GTO prototypes in by converting existing chassis of this type
The first prototype designated in official photos as the Ferrari GT Le Mans Berlinetta Sperimentale was constructed from chassis GT originally a GT SWB
It was built to competition specification which included a reinforced chassis a competition gearbox and a Tipo L engine tuned to bhp equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber DCN carburetors
Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminum alloy body for this prototype which resembled that of the Super America coupe
GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the hours of Le Mans driven by Fernand Tavano and Giancarlo Baghetti
Although they were running as high as th overall they were forced to retire at am on Sunday morning due to engine failure
During the course of the race Ferrari engineers gathered information about the performance of the car which was used to modify and improve it including the addition of a rear spoiler
During the Le Mans race GT suffered from high-speed instability possibly due to the front end design
Following Le Mans GT returned to the factory where it was used for more testing
The prototype raced again at the Daytona Continental hours where it placed th overall and st in the GT class driven by Stirling Moss
The second prototype was also constructed from a donor car although sources disagree on the chassis number and type
Several older sources mention the donor as a GT SWB chassis GT
Alternatively other sources have claimed that a GT Boano GT or a GT SWB GT was used as the donor car
This prototype was created entirely by the Ferrari factory's racing department under the oversight of Giotto Bizzarrini including the bodywork
The original chassis was extensively modified including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame
A competition-specification engine was fitted including six Weber DCN carburetors
The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough unfinished aluminum
The body's ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it Il Mostro the Monster and the press to call it The Anteater Hammer marks weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in
Although the body was crudely formed it displayed features that would be seen in the production GTO including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear triple front air intakes engine bay cooling slots in the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights
The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production GTO with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminum dashboard
The second prototype was tested at Monza in September by Stirling Moss
Results were promising as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a GT SWB
However the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained
Shortly after this test construction of the first production GTOs began in late with chassis GT and GT
As the prototype was no longer needed for testing the experimental body was scrapped
Regardless of the identity of the chassis sources are in agreement that the second GTO prototype was either partially or entirely scrapped and is no longer extant in its form
If GT was indeed the chassis it was then given a GT SWB style body and sold to Jacques Swaters
GT crashed during the Nrburgring km and was then rebodied by Carrozzeria Sports Cars
Subsequently GT was totally destroyed in an accident at the Spa km
Handbuild production updates and repairs throughout each car's competition history result in differences both visible and invisible between individual GTOs
Variance in air intakevent configuration is common among cars
Modifications to the original bodywork were performed by the factory Scaglietti or other body shops usually after crashes or according to a racing team's wishes
In Ferrari tasked Mauro Forghieri and Mike Parkes with redesigning the GTO's bodywork resulting in what became known as the GTO ' or Series II
Three new cars were produced to the specification and four earlier GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory
This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO's competitiveness for one more year as the FIA decided to not approve the LM for GT-class racing during the season
The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the LM's aerodynamic features into the GTO
This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models even though the GTO does not share the LM's mid engine rear wheel drive layout
The factory also made minor modifications to the engine gearbox chassis suspension and interior
Despite these changes the overall performance improvement was slight
The GTO ' still saw some racing success with factory and privateer teams including an overall win at Daytona in by Phil Hill and Pedro Rodriguez driving for NART
Three GTO specials were made using the GTO chassis and body fitted with Superamerica -liter motors
Distinguished by a larger bonnet bulge these cars were used briefly for racing and testing by Scuderia Ferrari before being sold to private customers
Some sources include these cars in the total number of GTOs produced increasing that number from to
The LMB is sometimes considered a GTO variant
These cars used a -liter motor and a modified GT Lusso chassisbody
Despite their origins as competition versions of the GTB they are sometimes considered developments of the GTO due to similarity of configuration and bodywork
The Ferrari GT SWB Breadvan was a one-off racing car designed for Scuderia Serenissima by Bizzarrini after his departure from Ferrari
It was developed specifically to compete against the then-new GTO
Although based on the earlier GT SWB the Breadvan provided an opportunity for Bizzarrini to develop the ideas he had first explored with the GTO such as lower and more aerodynamic bodywork incorporation of a dry sump and radical lightening of the entire car
The GTO's racing debut was at the Hours of Sebring driven by American Phil Hill the Formula One World Driving Champion at the time and Belgian Olivier Gendebien
Although originally annoyed that they were driving a GT-class car instead of one of the full-race Testa Rossas competing in the prototype class the experienced pair impressed themselves and everyone else by finishing second overall behind the Testa Rossa of Bonnier and Scarfiotti
Ferrari would go on to win the over cc class of the FIA's International Championship for GT Manufacturers in and the GTO being raced in each of those years
GTOs also won the and Tour de France Automobile marking Ferrari's nine year dominance of that race
During the - racing seasons only a few other GT-class models were consistently competitive with the GTO
These were the Jaguar E-type Aston Martin DB GT Zagato DP DP and DP and the AC Cobras
In addition to official Scuderia Ferrari entries many GTOs were also raced by independent racing teams and private drivers
During this time it was therefore common for GTO drivers to compete against other GTOs
The GTO was one of the last front-engined cars to remain competitive at the top level of sports car racing
The GTO gradually passed into obsolescence following the season
Scuderia Ferrari withdrew the GTO from its racing activity by leaving only a few independent teams and private owners to campaign it in endurance races rallies and hillclimbs
By the GTO was almost entirely absent from international racing with only a few rally and hillclimb results during that year
Prior to the development of the GTO collector market and associated vintage racing and show events some of the surviving GTOs were used in regional races while others were used as road cars
FIA regulations in required at least one hundred examples of a car to be built in order for it to be homologated for Group Grand Touring Car racing
Ferrari built only GTOs of the -design Series I cars and three -design Series II cars with revised bodywork
The additional three GTO cars with the four-litre engine —recognizable by the large hump on the bonnet— are sometimes included in the overall production number bringing the total to
It became a popular myth that when FIA inspectors showed up to confirm that examples had been built Enzo Ferrari shuffled the same cars between different locations thus giving the impression that the full complement of cars was present
In reality no deception was required as the production of the GTO was covered by the homologation of the earlier GT Berlinetta SWB model
These homologation papers were issued in but extensions were applied for and accepted multiple times between to allowing Ferrari to add modifications not covered under the original specification including changes to the engine transmission and suspension
Additionally since more than bodies had been built according to the earlier GT SWB specification FIA regulations allowed a new body to be designed leading to the development of the new GTO body style
This method of homologation was not unique to Ferrari as similar methods were used to homologate the Aston Martin DB GT Zagato and the Jaguar E-Type Lightweight
While the GTO is now arguably the most valuable collector car in the world it was merely a no-frills used race car in the late s and very early s
Many of the vehicles were offered at or acquired for four-figure USD sums
In contrast restored Duesenberg Model J's often sold for about around
From the late s to the late s classic car values rose rapidly and the GTO became the most valuable Ferrari model touted as the Ferrari that most completely embodies the characteristics of the manufacturer
Prices fell substantially during the car market crash of the early s resulting in lows of in September and in May
Prices began to climb again in the late s and have continued to rise through the present day
GTOs have repeatedly broken records for most expensive car ever sold at auction or private sale
The current record for world's most expensive Ferrari was set in June when a GTO chassis GT was sold to David MacNeil in a private sale for million
On August RM Sotheby's sold Greg Whitten's GTO GT at their Monterey auction
The final price inclusive of buyer's fee was representing a new record for most expensive car ever sold at auction
The previous record was also held by a GTO GT which was sold at the Bonhams Quail Lodge auction in
Scarcity and high prices led to the creation of several replica GTOs on more common Ferrari chassis
Misrepresentations of the original cars offered for sale at full market value have been reported
