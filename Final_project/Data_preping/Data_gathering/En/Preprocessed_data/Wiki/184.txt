alternatively source claimed gt boano gt gt swb gt wa used donor car
prototype wa created entirely ferrari factory's racing department oversight giotto bizzarrini including bodywork
original chassis wa extensively modified including relocation engine mount lower back frame
competition-specification engine wa fitted including six weber dcn carburetors
bodywork seen second prototype period photo wa rough unfinished aluminum
body's ungainly appearance lead ferrari team nickname il mostro monster press call anteater hammer mark weld bead bolted riveted panel could seen throughout evidence continual modification performed factory testing in

ferrari tasked mauro forghieri mike parkes redesigning gto's bodywork resulting became known gto ' series ii

ferrari engineer incorporated many lm's aerodynamic feature gto
resulted visual similarity two model even though gto doe share lm's mid engine rear wheel drive layout
factory also made minor modification engine gearbox chassis suspension interior

reality deception wa required production gto wa covered homologation earlier gt berlinetta swb model
homologation paper issued extension applied accepted multiple time allowing ferrari add modification covered original specification including change engine transmission suspension
additionally since body built according earlier gt swb specification fia regulation allowed new body designed leading development new gto body style
