resilient packet ring rpr defined ieee standard protocol designed transport data traffic optical fiber ring networks
standard began development november ha undergone several amendment since initial standard wa completed june
designed provide resilience found sonet synchronous digital hierarchy network protection instead setting circuit oriented connection provides packet based transmission order increase efficiency ethernet ip services
rpr work concept dual counter rotating ring called ringlets
ringlet set creating rpr station node traffic supposed drop per flow flow ingres egress data traffic
rpr us medium access control protocol mac message direct traffic use either ringlet ring
node also negotiate bandwidth among using fairness algorithm avoiding congestion failed spans
avoidance failed span accomplished using one two technique known steering wrapping
steering node span broken node notified topology change reroute traffic
wrapping traffic looped back last node prior break routed destination station
traffic ring assigned class service co standard specifies three classes
class high traffic pure committed information rate cir designed support application requiring low latency jitter voice video
class b medium traffic mix cir excess information rate eir subject fairness queuing
class c low best effort traffic utilizing whatever bandwidth available
rpr strip signal reach destination unlike sonet upsrsdh sncp ring bandwidth consumed around entire ring reuse freed space carry additional traffic
rpr standard also support use learning bridge ieee enhance efficiency point multipoint application vlan tagging ieee q
one drawback first version rpr wa provide spatial reuse frame transmission tofrom mac address present ring topology
wa addressed ieee b defines optional spatially aware sublayer sas
allows spatial reuse frame transmission tofrom mac address present ring topology
