resilient packet ring rpr as defined by ieee standard is a protocol designed for the transport of data traffic over optical fiber ring networks
the standard began development in november and has undergone several amendments since its initial standard was completed in june
the amended standards are a through d the last of which was adopted in may
it is designed to provide the resilience found in sonet and synchronous digital hierarchy networks ms protection but instead of setting up circuit oriented connections provides a packet based transmission in order to increase the efficiency of ethernet and ip services
rpr works on a concept of dual counter rotating rings called ringlets
these ringlets are set up by creating rpr stations at nodes where traffic is supposed to drop per flow a flow is the ingress and egress of data traffic
rpr uses media access control protocol mac messages to direct the traffic which can use either ringlet of the ring
the nodes also negotiate for bandwidth among themselves using fairness algorithms avoiding congestion and failed spans
the avoidance of failed spans is accomplished by using one of two techniques known as steering and wrapping
under steering if a node or span is broken all nodes are notified of a topology change and they reroute their traffic
in wrapping the traffic is looped back at the last node prior to the break and routed to the destination station
all traffic on the ring is assigned a class of service cos and the standard specifies three classes
class a or high traffic is a pure committed information rate cir and is designed to support applications requiring low latency and jitter such as voice and video
class b or medium traffic is a mix of both a cir and an excess information rate eir which is subject to fairness queuing
class c or low is best effort traffic utilizing whatever bandwidth is available
this is primarily used to support internet access traffic
another concept within rpr is what is known as spatial reuse
because rpr strips the signal once it reaches the destination unlike a sonet upsr sdh sncp ring in which the bandwidth is consumed around the entire ring it can reuse the freed space to carry additional traffic
the rpr standard also supports the use of learning bridges ieee d to further enhance efficiency in point to multipoint applications and vlan tagging ieee q
one drawback of the first version of rpr was that it did not provide spatial reuse for frame transmission to from mac addresses not present in the ring topology
this was addressed by ieee b which defines an optional spatially aware sublayer sas
this allows spatial reuse for frame transmission to from mac address not present in the ring topology
