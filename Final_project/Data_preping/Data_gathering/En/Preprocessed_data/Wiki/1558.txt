the save the children fund commonly known as save the children was established in the united kingdom in to improve the lives of children through better education health care and economic opportunities as well as providing emergency aid in natural disasters war and other conflicts
after passing a century which it celebrated in it is now a global movement made up of national member organizations which work in countries
headquartered in london the organisation promotes policy changes to gain more rights for young people especially by enforcing the un declaration of the rights of the child
saving the children through co ordinate emergency relief efforts helping to protect children from the post effects of war and violence
save the children has a general consultative status in the united nations economic and social council
the save the children fund was founded in london england on april by eglantyne jebb and her sister dorothy buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in germany and austria hungary during the allied blockade of germany of world war i which continued after the armistice
at the end of world war i images of malnourished and sick children ran throughout europe
the fight the famine council was initially started earlier in to put political pressure on the british government to end the blockade the first meeting having been held at the home of catherine courtney at cheyne walk
however on april the sisters succeeded in separating the effort from the politics of the council and creating a separate save the children fund
in may the fund was publicly established at a meeting in london s royal albert hall to provide relief to children suffering the effects of war and raise money for emergency aid to children suffering from the wartime shortages of food and supplies
jebb and her sister worked to gain public sympathy to elicit support aid
in december pope benedict xv publicly announced his support for save the children and declared december innocents day to collect donations
the first branch was opened in fife scotland in
a counterpart r dda barnen which means save the children was founded later that year on november in sweden with anna kleman on the board
along with a number of other organisations they founded the international save the children union in geneva on january
jebb built up excellent relationships with other geneva based organisations including the red cross who supported save s international foundation
jebb used many ground breaking fund raising techniques for example making save the children the first charity in the united kingdom to use page length advertisements in newspapers
jebb contracted doctors lawyers and other professionals to devise mass advertisement campaigns
in save the children started individual child sponsorship as a way to engage more donors
by the end of the year save the children raised the equivalent to about in today s money
by august the uk save the children had raised over and conditions for children in central europe were improving due to their efforts
however the russian famine of made jebb realise that save the children must be a permanent organisation and that children s rights constantly need to be protected
their mission was thus changed to an international effort to preserve child life wherever it is menaced by conditions of economic hardship and distress
from to save the children created press campaigns propaganda movies and feeding centres in russia and in turkey to feed and educate thousands of refugees
they began to work with several other organisations such as the russian famine relief fund and nansen which resulted in recognition by the league of nations
although russia was largely closed off to international relief and aid save the children persuaded soviet authorities to let them have a ground presence
at home the daily express criticised the fund s work denying the severity of the situation and arguing they should be helping their own people before helping russia
the charity responded with increased publicity about the famine showing images of starving children and mass graves
the campaign gained national appeal eventually allowing the organisation to charter the ss torcello to russia with tons of relief supplies
over million rations were given out saving nearly children
improved conditions meant save the children s russian feeding program was able to be closed in the summer of after having won international acclaim
save the children staff were among the first into the liberated areas after world war ii working with refugee children and displaced persons in former occupied europe including survivors of nazi concentration camps
at the same time work in the united kingdom focused on improving conditions for children growing up in cities devastated by bombing and facing huge disruptions in family life
the s saw a continuation of this type of crisis driven work with additional demands for help following the korean war and the hungarian revolution but also the opening of new work in africa asia and the middle east in response to the decline of the british empire
like other aid agencies save the children was active in the major disasters of the era especially the vietnam war and the biafra secession in nigeria
the latter brought shocking images of child starvation onto the television screens of the west for the first time in a major way
the sort of mass marketing campaigns first used by save the children in the s was repeated with great success in fundraising
disasters in ethiopia sudan and many other world hotspots led to appeals which brought public donations on a huge scale and a consequent expansion of the organisation s work
however the children s rights based approach to development originated by jebb continues to be an important factor
it was used in a major campaign in the late s against the use of child soldiers in africa
during the ebola outbreak in sierra leone new cases outnumbered the available hospital beds in the country
save the children worked with the uk government s department for international development and ministry of defence to build and run a bed treatment centre in sierra leone as well as support an interim care center in kailahun for children who had lost their families to ebola
in save the children founder jebb voiced her support for an international declaration that establishes universal rights for children by remarking that i believe we should claim certain rights for the children and labour for their universal recognition so that everybody not merely the small number of people who are in a position to contribute to relief funds but everybody who in any way comes into contact with children that is to say the vast majority of mankind may be in a position to help forward the movement
jebb created an initial draft for what would become the un declaration of the rights of the child in
it contained the following five criteria
the child must be given the means requisite for its normal development both materially and spiritually
the child that is hungry must be fed the child that is sick must be nursed the child that is backward must be helped the delinquent child must be reclaimed and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succored
the child must be the first to receive relief in times of distress
the child must not be put in a position to earn a livelihood and must be protected against every form of exploitation
the child must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men these five points were adopted by the league of nations in and were thus known as the declaration of geneva
this was the first important assertion of the rights of children as separate from adults and began the process that would lead to the un convention on the rights of the child adopted by the united nations in
following the atrocities of world war ii the united nations adopted the universal declaration of human rights in
however many felt the rights of children needed to be addressed in further detail with a separate document
the convention consists of articles that address the basic human rights that all children are entitled to the right to survival development to the fullest protection from harmful influences abuse and exploitation and full participation in family cultural and social life
the four core principles of the convention are non discrimination devotion to the best interests of the child the right to life survival and development and respect for the views of the child
today the convention serves as the basis for all of save the children s work
it has been ratified in every country around the world with the exception of the united states

polioin july a fake vaccination program by the cia was uncovered
it then emerged that dr
shakil afridi the person organising the cia s vaccinations had claimed that he was a save the children employee
in may save the children s country director for pakistan david wright revealed that the organisation s work had been badly disrupted ever since afridi had made his claim with medicines held up for long periods at airports staff unable to get visas and so forth
wright also charged that the cia had breached international humanitarian law and risked the safety of aid groups worldwide
it was a setback no doubt said dr
elias durry the world health organization s polio coordinator for pakistan a few months later
later that year in september it was reported that the pakistani government had requested save the children s foreign staff to leave the country in january the deans of twelve top us schools of public health sent a letter to president obama protesting against the entanglement of intelligence operations in public health campaigns
the letter describes the negative and lasting impacts of the central intelligence agency s cia use of a fake vaccination campaign in pakistan during the hunt for osama bin laden in which exacerbated the already persistent public mistrust of vaccines in the country
the cia s vaccination program sparked a series of deadly attacks in pakistan against dozens of aid and health workers associated with various aid and health campaigns with the un backed polio vaccination drive repeatedly halted as a result
up to eight polio vaccination workers were assassinated in the country during this backlash
in may the obama administration announced that they would no longer use vaccination programs as a cover for cia activities
pakistani investigators said in a july report that shakil afridi met times with foreign secret agents received instructions and provided sensitive information to them according to an early draft of a pakistan government report which has not been publicly released afridi told investigators that the charity save the children helped facilitate his meeting with us intelligence agents although the charity denies the charge
the report alleges that save the children s pakistan director at the time of the incident introduced afridi to a western woman in islamabad and that afridi and the woman met regularly afterwards
the claim that the save the children country director had introduced afridi to the woman is not credible as the country director concerned had left pakistan permanently well before the alleged meeting took place
the allegation does not appear in subsequent drafts of the report although the document has still not been publicly released
on june pakistani authorities ordered all save the children workers to leave pakistan within days and the organisation s office in islamabad was closed and padlocked
