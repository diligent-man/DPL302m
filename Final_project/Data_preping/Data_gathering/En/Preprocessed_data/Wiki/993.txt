a bastion or bulwark is a structure projecting outward from the curtain wall of a fortification most commonly angular in shape and positioned at the corners of the fort
the fully developed bastion consists of two faces and two flanks with fire from the flanks being able to protect the curtain wall and the adjacent bastions
compared with the medieval fortified towers they replaced bastion fortifications offered a greater degree of passive resistance and more scope for ranged defence in the age of gunpowder artillery
as military architecture the bastion is one element in the style of fortification dominant from the mid th to mid th centuries
by the middle of the th century artillery pieces had become powerful enough to make the traditional medieval round tower and curtain wall obsolete
this was exemplified by the campaigns of charles vii of france who reduced the towns and castles held by the english during the latter stages of the hundred years war and by the fall of constantinople in to the large cannon of the turkish army
during the eighty years war dutch military engineers developed the concepts further by lengthening the faces and shortening the curtain walls of the bastions
the resulting construction was called a bolwerk
to augment this change they placed v shaped outworks known as ravelins in front of the bastions and curtain walls to protect them from direct artillery fire
these ideas were further developed and incorporated into the trace italienne forts by s bastien le prestre de vauban that remained in use during the napoleonic wars
bastions differ from medieval towers in a number of respects
bastions are lower than towers and are normally of similar height to the adjacent curtain wall
the height of towers although making them difficult to scale also made them easy for artillery to destroy
a bastion would normally have a ditch in front the opposite side of which would be built up above the natural level then slope away gradually
this glacis shielded most of the bastion from the attacker s cannon while the distance from the base of the ditch to the top of the bastion meant it was still difficult to scale
in contrast to typical late medieval towers bastions apart from early examples were flat sided rather than curved
this eliminated dead ground making it possible for the defenders to fire upon any point directly in front of the bastion
bastions also cover a larger area than most towers
this allows more cannons to be mounted and provided enough space for the crews to operate them
surviving examples of bastions are usually faced with masonry
unlike the wall of a tower this was just a retaining wall cannonballs were expected to pass through this and be absorbed by a greater thickness of hard packed earth or rubble behind
the top of the bastion was exposed to enemy fire and normally would not be faced with masonry as cannonballs hitting the surface would scatter lethal stone shards among the defenders
if a bastion was successfully stormed it could provide the attackers with a stronghold from which to launch further attacks
some bastion designs attempted to minimise this problem
this could be achieved by the use of retrenchments in which a trench was dug across the rear gorge of the bastion isolating it from the main rampart
various kinds of bastions have been used throughout history
solid bastions are those that are filled up entirely and have the ground even with the height of the rampart without any empty space towards the centre
void or hollow bastions are those that have a rampart or parapet only around their flanks and faces so that a void space is left towards the centre
the ground is so low that if the rampart is taken no retrenchment can be made in the centre but what will lie under the fire of the besieged
a flat bastion is one built in the middle of a curtain or enclosed court when the court is too large to be defended by the bastions at its extremes
a cut bastion is that which has a re entering angle at the point
it was sometimes also called bastion with a tenaille
such bastions were used when without such a structure the angle would be too acute
the term cut bastion is also used for one that is cut off from the place by some ditch
a composed bastion is when the two sides of the interior polygon are very unequal which also makes the gorges unequal
a regular bastion is that which has proportionate faces flanks and gorges
a deformed or irregular bastion is one which lacks one of its demi gorges one side of the interior polygon being too short
a demi bastion has only one face and flank
to fortify the angle of a place that is too acute they cut the point and place two demi bastions which make a tenaille or re entry angle
their chief use is before a hornwork or crownwork bastille
