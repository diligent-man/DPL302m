The Evening Standard, formerly The Standard (1827–1904), also known as the London Evening Standard, is a local free daily newspaper in London, England, published Monday to Friday in tabloid format.
In October 2009, after being purchased by Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev, the paper ended a 180-year history of paid circulation and became a free newspaper, doubling its circulation as part of a change in its business plan
Emily Sheffield became editor in July 2020 but resigned in October 2021.
The newspaper was founded by barrister Stanley Lees Giffard on 21 May 1827 as The Standard
The early owner of the paper was Charles Baldwin
Under the ownership of James Johnstone, The Standard became a morning paper from 29 June 1857
The Evening Standard was published from 11 June 1859
The Standard gained eminence for its detailed foreign news, notably its reporting of events of the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, all contributing to a rise in circulation
By the end of the 19th century, the evening edition eclipsed its morning counterpart.
Both The Standard and the Evening Standard were acquired by C
Arthur Pearson in 1904
In May 1915, Edward Hulton purchased the Evening Standard from Davison Dalziel
Dalziel had purchased both papers in 1910, and closed The Standard, the morning paper, in 1916
Hulton introduced the gossip column Londoner's Diary, originally billed as "a column written by gentlemen for gentlemen".
In 1923, Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the Daily Express, bought Hulton's newspapers, although he sold them shortly thereafter to the Daily Mail's owner Lord Rothermere, with the exception of the Standard
It became a staunchly Conservative paper, harshly attacking Labour in 1945 in a high-profile campaign that backfired
In the 1960s, the paper was upstaged by The Evening News, which sold over 1 million copies nightly
During the decade, the paper also began to publish the comic strip Modesty Blaise, which bolstered its sales throughout the 1970s
The Evening Standard ceased publishing on Saturdays on 30 November 1974, when it still produced six editions daily.
In 1980, Express Newspapers merged the Standard with Associated Newspapers' Evening News in a Joint Operating Agreement
The new paper was known as the New Standard until 1985, when Associated Newspapers bought out the remaining stake, turning it into The Standard
In 1987 the Evening News was briefly revived to compete with Robert Maxwell's London Daily News, but was reabsorbed into The Standard later that year, after the collapse of Maxwell's paper
In 1988 the Evening Standard included the by-line "Incorporating the 'Evening News'", which remained until the paper's sale in 2009.
On 21 January 2009, the Russian businessman and former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev, owners of The Independent, agreed to acquire control of the Evening Standard for £1 for 64 percent ownership
A few years earlier, 12 percent of the paper had been sold to Justin Shaw and Geordie Greig
Associated Newspapers retained the remaining 24 percent.
In November 2009, it was announced that the London Evening Standard would drop its midday "News Extra" edition from 4 January 2010
From then on, the first edition was the West End Final, available from 2 pm
One edition of 600,000 copies would be printed starting at 12:30 pm, ending 3 am starts for journalists and the previous deadline of 9 am for the first edition
Twenty people were expected to lose their jobs as a result.
Previously there were three editions each weekday, excluding Bank holidays
The first, "News Extra", went to print at 10:00 am and was available around 11 am in central London, slightly later in more outlying areas
A second edition, "West End Final", went to print at 3 pm, and the "Late Night Final" went to print at 5 pm and was available in central London from about 6 pm
There were often considerable changes between editions, particularly with the front-page lead and following few pages, including the Londoner's Diary, though features and reviews stayed the same
In January 2010, circulation was increased to 900,000.
In May 2009, the newspaper launched a series of poster ads, each of which prominently featured the word "Sorry" in the paper's then-masthead font
These ads offered various apologies for past editorial approaches, such as "Sorry for losing touch"
None of the posters mentioned the Evening Standard by name, although they featured the paper's Eros logo
Ex-editor Veronica Wadley criticised the "Pravda-style" campaign saying it humiliated the paper's staff and insulted its readers
The campaign was designed by McCann Erickson
Also in May 2009 the paper relaunched as the London Evening Standard with a new layout and masthead, marking the occasion by giving away 650,000 free copies on the day, and refreshed its sports coverage.
After a long history of paid circulation, on 12 October 2009 the Standard became a free newspaper, with free circulation of 700,000, limited to central London
In February 2010, a paid-for circulation version became available in suburban areas of London for 20p (although many places sell it for 50p)
The newspaper won the Media Brand of the Year and the Grand Prix Gold awards at the Media Week awards in October 2010
The judges said, "[the Standard has] quite simply ..
stunned the market
Not just for the act of going free, but because editorial quality has been maintained, circulation has almost trebled and advertisers have responded favourably
Here is a media brand restored to health." The Standard also won the daily newspaper of the year award at the London Press Club Press Awards in May 2011.
The Evening Standard launched a mobile app with US app developer Handmark in May 2010
The range of apps was updated in 2015.
In March 2018, editor George Osborne initiated a redesign of the paper, which featured a dropping of the 'London' from the paper's title in a signal of the paper's ambition to have greater national and international influence
The paper also introduced more colourful "sign-posting" for different sections such as news, comment, and business, as it was noted by Osborne that it had not been "easy" to find them inside the paper previously
The masthead was also redesigned with a new font, and emojis were added to the paper's five-day weather forecast.
In May 2018, James Cusick of openDemocracy alleged the newspaper had been providing favourable news coverage to companies including Uber and Google in exchange for financial sponsorship.
In June 2019, the Evening Standard announced job cuts
By the end of 2019, the company reported a pre-tax loss of £13.6 million
In August 2020, the paper announced a further 115 job cuts in order to save the company.
From July 2020 to October 2021, the newspaper's editor was Emily Sheffield, sister of Samantha Cameron, who took over from the former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who has now taken over the role of editor-in-chief
As editor he had replaced Sarah Sands who, in turn, had replaced Geordie Greig following his departure to The Mail on Sunday in March 2012
Veronica Wadley was the newspaper's editor between 2002 and 2009
Max Hastings was editor from 1996 until he retired in 2002.
The London Evening Standard, although a regional newspaper, does cover national and international news, though with an emphasis on London-centred news (especially in its features pages), covering building developments, property prices, traffic schemes, politics, the congestion charge and, in the Londoner's Diary page, gossip on the social scene
It also occasionally runs campaigns on local issues that national newspapers do not cover in detail.
It has a tradition of providing arts coverage
Its best known former art critic, Brian Sewell, was known for his acerbic view of conceptual art, Britart and the Turner Prize and his views attracted controversy and criticism in the art world
He has been described as "Britain's most famous and controversial art critic".
During the 2008 London mayoral election the newspaper – and particularly the correspondent Andrew Gilligan – published articles in support of the Conservative candidate, Boris Johnson, including frequent front-page headlines condemning Ken Livingstone
This included the headline "Suicide bomb backer runs Ken's campaign".
On 5 May 2010, the newspaper stated in an editorial that, having supported Labour under Tony Blair, the newspaper would be supporting David Cameron and the Conservatives in the General Election, saying that "the Conservatives are ready for power: they look like a government in waiting." On 5 May 2015, an editorial stated that the newspaper would again be supporting David Cameron and the Conservatives in the 2015 General Election, saying that the Conservatives have "shown themselves to be good for London." The newspaper did however also claim "there may be good tactical reasons to vote Liberal Democrat."
The Media Reform Coalition (MRC) and Goldsmiths University of London argued that in the 2016 elections, the Evening Standard favoured the Conservative Party, according to MRC chair Justin Schlosberg
There were almost twice as many positive headlines about the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, as for his Labour rival, Sadiq Khan, with stories exhibiting the strongest bias against Khan also being the most prominent.
During the 2019 Conservative leadership election, the Evening Standard endorsed Boris Johnson
During the 2020 Labour leadership election, the Evening Standard endorsed Keir Starmer to become Labour leader and consequently Leader of the Opposition.
On 14 December 2004, Associated Newspapers launched a Monday–Friday freesheet edition of the Evening Standard called Standard Lite to help boost circulation
This had 48 pages, compared with about 80 in the main paper, which also had a supplement on most days.
In August 2006, the freesheet was relaunched as London Lite
It was designed to be especially attractive to younger female readers and featured a wide range of lifestyle articles, but less news and business news than the main paper
It was initially only available between 11.30 a.m
and 2.30 p.m
at Evening Standard vendors and in the central area, but later became available in the evening from its street distributors
With the sale of the Evening Standard, but not the London Lite, to Alexander Lebedev on 21 January 2009, the ownership links between the Standard and the Lite were broken.
On Fridays, the newspaper includes a free glossy lifestyle magazine, ES (launched as the Evening Standard Magazine in 2009), and the circulation was increased to 350,000 in September 2014
This has moved from more general articles to concentrate on glamour, with features on the rich, powerful and famous
On Wednesdays, selected areas offer a free copy of the Homes & Property supplement, edited by Janice Morley, which includes London property listings as well as articles from lifestyle journalists including Barbara Chandler, Katie Law, and Alison Cork.
An entertainment guide supplement Metro Life (previously called Hot Tickets) was launched in September 2002
This was a what's-on guide with listings of cinemas and theatres in and around London and was given away on Thursdays
It was discontinued on 1 September 2005.
The paper also supplies occasional CDs and DVDs for promotions
It also gives Londoners a chance to win exclusive tickets to film premieres and sports tournament tickets, such as the Wimbledon Ladies Singles Final.
The newspaper's This Is London website carries some of the stories from the Evening Standard and promotions, reviews and competitions
It also includes a number of blogs by Evening Standard writers, such as restaurant critic Charles Campion, theatre critic Kieron Quirke and music critic David Smyth
A separate website contains images of each page of the print edition (two versions) and supplements.
