writing in national review tobias hoonhout said that the newspaper had applied its anonymity policy inconsistently
the new statesman s jasper jackson wrote that it was difficult to see how scott alexander s full name is so integral to the nyt s story that it justifies the damage it might do to him but cautioned that such criticism was based solely on alexander s own statements and that before we make that call it might be a good idea to have more than his word to go on as reported by the daily beast the criticism by alexander and his supporters caused considerable internal debate among times staff
