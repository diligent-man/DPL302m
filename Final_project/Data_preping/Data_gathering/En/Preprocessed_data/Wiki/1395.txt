social disruption is a term used in sociology to describe the alteration dysfunction or breakdown of social life often in a community setting
social disruption implies a radical transformation in which the old certainties of modern society are falling away and something quite new is emerging
social disruption might be caused through natural disasters massive human displacements rapid economic technological and demographic change but also due to controversial policy making
social disruptions are for example rising sea levels that are creating new landscapes drawing new world maps whose key lines are not traditional boundaries between nation states but elevations above sea level
on the local level an example would be the closing of a community grocery store which might cause social disruption in a community by removing a meeting ground for community members to develop interpersonal relationships and community solidarity
we are wandering aimlessly and dispassionately arguing for and against but the one statement on which we are beyond all differences and over many continents to be able to agree on is i can no longer understand the world
social disruptions often lead to five social symptoms frustration democratic disconnection fragmentation polarization and escalation
studies from the last decade show that our societies have become more fragmented and less coherent e g

especially people on the more right and left political spectrum are more likely to say it is important to them to live in a place where most people share their political views and have similar interests pew
hence citizens become alienated from democratic consensus foa and munk levitsky and ziblatt and tend to assume that their opponents believe more extreme things than they really do iyengar et al
moreover fear of being identified as unqualified denied value and dignity and for that reason marginalized excluded or outcast is giving rise to a widespread disenchantment with the idea that the future will improve the human condition and a mistrust in the ability of nation states to make this happen pew bauman
at the same time accelerations in liberal progression globalization and migration flows have led to increasing polarized contestations about national identities a volatile and critical social state prone to conflict escalation e g

it is unclear how to achieve policy changes of any kind in a polarized society that has few shared facts and whose civic muscles are atrophying
international but also local challenges force our societies to find solutions and make decisions on controversial issues in an accelerated manner
the complexity of such decisions is not only mirrored in the aim to tackle a multi causality of root causes it also faces a high degree of uncertainty as regard to its impact
hence due to the growing separation between the world of public opinion on the one hand and the world of problem solving on the other mair it is very likely that political decisions further polarize our societies
the explanation is that citizens evaluate disruptive developments and related policy changes on a two way level on the personal interests and comfort as well on its perceived impact on their social identity and community ryan and deci haidt
if a policy change reflects the substantive representation of the median voter is something that just does not matter to citizens in regard to their acceptance of decisions esaiasson et al
this can produce multi facet conflicts over interests facts and norms between supporters and opponents itten
simultaneously the capacity of political parties and actors of civil society to bridge that divide is declining mair
in such a situations social psychology tells us that citizens who feel uncomfortable will hold tighter to the assumptions that make them feel secure podziba
especially in public policy disputes parties are hardly giving up their assumptions voluntarily and citizens begin to masquerade their true individual conflict of interest e g
devaluation of property insecurity with more normative conflict of interest e g
protection of nature protection of culture
such distorted behaviour remarkably increases at times citizens or communities feel that a policy change is threatening their way of living
in the light of the increasing social divisions and democratic disconnection putnam and feldstein foresaw the importance of creating bridging social capital e g
ties that link groups across a greater social distance
as the authors elaborate the creation of robust social capital takes time and effort
it develops largely through extensive and time consuming face to face conversation between two individuals or small groups of people
only then there is the chance to build the trust and mutual understanding that characterizes the foundation of social capital
in no way putnam and feldstein write it is possible to create social capital instantaneous anonymous or en masse
furthermore building social capital among people who already share a reservoir of similar cultural referents ethnicity personal experience or moral identity etc
is qualitatively different
homogeneity makes connective strategies easier however a society with only homogeneous social capital risks looking like bosnia or belfast
hence bridging social capital is especially important for reconciling democracy and diversity
yet bridging social capital among diverse social group is intrinsically less likely to develop automatically
