young-earth creationism yec involves religiously-based belief god created earth within last year literally described genesis within approximate timeframe biblical genealogy detailed example ussher chronology
young-earth creationists often believe universe ha similar age earth
creationist cosmology result attempt creationists assign universe age consistent ussher chronology young-earth timeframes based genealogies
belief generally ha basis biblical literalism completely reject scientific methodology evolutionary biology
creation science agreed scientific community pseudoscience attempt prove young earth creationism consistent science
old-earth creationism hold god created physical universe one take creation event genesis within day strictly literally

old-earth creationists interpret genesis creation-narrative number way differing six consecutive hour day creation young-earth creationist view
neo-creationists intentionally distance form creationism preferring known wholly separate creationism philosophy

response perceived crisis modern science creationists claim alternative typically based faith creation science intelligent design
scientific community ha responded pointing conversation frequently misrepresented eg
quote mining order create impression deeper controversy crisis creationists' alternative generally pseudoscientific
dispute relating evolutionary biology central controversy creationists scientific community
aspect evolutionary biology disputed include common descent particularly human evolution common ancestor member great ape macroevolution existence transitional fossils
theory universal common descent based evolutionary principle wa proposed charles darwin generally accepted biologists
recent common ancestor living organism believed appeared billion year ago
michael behe vast majority creationists rejected theory favor belief common design suggests common designer god
many creationists beginning st century also held modern specie perpetually fixed creation
however large amount creationists allow evolution specie face undeniable evidence speciation
contend however wa specific kind baramin created initially present-day specie arose
thus bear specie may developed common ancestor wa separately created establish bear-like baramin type creationism
type creationism often acknowledges existence evolutionary process denies demonstrate common ancestry evolutionary process would produced diversity contemporary life
evidence common descent includes evidence genetics fossil record comparative anatomy geographical distribution specie comparative physiology comparative biochemistry
human evolution study biological evolution human distinct specie common ancestor animals
analysis fossil evidence genetic distance two mean scientist understand evolutionary history
fossil evidence suggests humans' earliest hominid ancestor may split primate early late oligocene circa early miocene adaptive radiation many different hominoid form wa well underway
evidence molecular dating genetic difference indicates gibbon lineage family hylobatidae diverged orangutan lineage subfamily ponginae diverged ma
fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting early ancestry gibbon fossil proto-orangutans may represented sivapithecus india griphopithecus turkey dated around ma
molecular evidence suggests first gorilla chimpanzee genus pan split line leading humans
fossil record divergence distinctively hominid fossil found dating see lucy possibly even earlier see touma
comparison dna show percent coding region identical chimpanzee human overall taken strong evidence recent common ancestry
today one distinct human specie survives many earlier specie found fossil record including homo erectus homo habilis homo neanderthalensis
creationists dispute evidence shared ancestry fossil evidence argue either misassigned ape fossil eg
java man wa gibbon similar modern human designate distinct transitional forms
creation myth book genesis frequently posit first man adam case genesis ha advocated creationists underlying alternative viewpoint scientific account
creationists also dispute scientific community's interpretation genetic evidence study human evolution
argue dubious assumption genetic similarity various animal imply common ancestral relationship scientist coming interpretation preconceived notion shared relationship exist
creationists also argue genetic mutation strong evidence evolutionary theory assert mutation required major change occur would almost certainly detrimental
however mutation neutral minority mutation beneficial harmful often situational mutation harmful one environment may helpful another
biology macroevolution refers evolution specie level including fossil history much systematics
microevolution refers process evolution within population including adaptive neutral evolution
however fundamental distinction process small change compound time eventually lead speciation
creationists argue finite number discrete kind created described book genesis kind determine limit variation
early creationists equated kind specie accept speciation occur evidence overwhelming speciation million specie existence could fit noah's ark depicted genesis
created kind identified creationists generally level family example canidae genus homo separate kind
creationist systematics called baraminology build idea created kind calling baramin
evolutionary systematics used explore relationship organism descent baraminology attempt find discontinuity group organisms
employ many tool evolutionary systematics biblical criterion taxonomy take precedence criteria
undermines claim objectivity accept evidence common ancestry cat dog analogous evidence common ancestry ape humans
recent argument macroevolution creationist sense include intelligent design id argument irreducible complexity specified complexity
neither argument ha accepted publication peer-reviewed scientific journal argument rejected scientific community pseudoscience
taken court attempt introduce id classroom judge wrote overwhelming evidence trial established id religious view mere re-labeling creationism scientific theory
common creationist argument fossil found partially functional features
plausible complex feature one function adapt different function evolution
precursor example wing might originally used gliding trapping flying prey mating display
today wing still function also used active flight
another example alan hayward stated creation evolution darwinists rarely mention whale present one insoluble problems
believe somehow whale must evolved ordinary land-dwelling animal took sea lost legs
land mammal wa process becoming whale would fall two stoolsit would fitted life land sea would hope survival evolution whale ha documented considerable detail ambulocetus described looking like three-metre long mammalian crocodile one transitional fossils
although transitional fossil elucidate evolutionary transition one life-form another exemplify snapshot process
due special circumstance required preservation living small percentage life-forms ever existed expected discovered
thus transition illustrated corroborated transitional fossil never known detail
progressing research discovery managed fill several gap continues so
critic evolution often cite argument convenient way explain lack 'snapshot' fossil show crucial step species
theory punctuated equilibrium developed stephen jay gould nile eldredge often mistakenly drawn discussion transitional fossils
theory pertains well-documented transition within taxon closely related taxon geologically short period
transition usually traceable geological outcrop often show small jump morphology period morphological stability
explain jump gould eldredge envisaged comparatively long period genetic stability separated period rapid evolution
example change creature size mouse one size elephant could accomplished year rate change small noticed human lifetime
expert evolutionary theory pointed even possible enough fossil survive show close transitional change critic never satisfied discovery one missing link creates two so-called missing link either side discovery
