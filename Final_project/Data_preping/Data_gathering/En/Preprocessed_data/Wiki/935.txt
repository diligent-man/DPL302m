recurring cultural political and theological rejection of evolution by religious groups sometimes termed the creation evolution controversy the creation vs
evolution debate or the origins debate exists regarding the origins of the earth of humanity and of other life
in accordance with creationism species were once widely believed to be fixed products of divine creation but since the mid th century evolution by natural selection has been established by the scientific community as an empirical scientific fact
any such debate is universally considered religious not scientific by professional scientific organizations worldwide in the scientific community evolution is accepted as fact and efforts to sustain the traditional view are universally regarded as pseudoscience
while the controversy has a long history today it has retreated to be mainly over what constitutes good science education with the politics of creationism primarily focusing on the teaching of creationism in public education
among majority christian countries the debate is most prominent in the united states where it may be portrayed as part of a culture war
parallel controversies also exist in some other religious communities such as the more fundamentalist branches of judaism and islam
in europe and elsewhere creationism is less widespread notably the catholic church and anglican communion both accept evolution and there is much less pressure to teach it as fact
christian fundamentalists repudiate the evidence of common descent of humans and other animals as demonstrated in modern paleontology genetics histology and cladistics and those other sub disciplines which are based upon the conclusions of modern evolutionary biology geology cosmology and other related fields
they argue for the abrahamic accounts of creation and in order to attempt to gain a place alongside evolutionary biology in the science classroom have developed a rhetorical framework of creation science
in the landmark kitzmiller v
dover the purported basis of scientific creationism was judged to be a wholly religious construct without scientific merit
the catholic church holds no official position on creation or evolution see evolution and the catholic church
however pope francis has stated god is not a demiurge or a magician but the creator who brought everything to life evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve the rules of genetic inheritance were discovered by a catholic priest the augustinian monk gregor mendel who is known today as the founder of modern genetics
the creation evolution controversy began in europe and north america in the late th century when new interpretations of geological evidence led to various theories of an ancient earth and findings of extinctions demonstrated in the fossil geological sequence prompted early ideas of evolution notably lamarckism
in england these ideas of continuing change were at first seen as a threat to the existing fixed social order and both church and state sought to repress them
conditions gradually eased and in robert chambers s controversial vestiges of the natural history of creation popularized the idea of gradual transmutation of species
the scientific establishment at first dismissed it scornfully and the church of england reacted with fury but many unitarians quakers and baptists groups opposed to the privileges of the established church favoured its ideas of god acting through such natural laws
the publication of darwin s on the origin of species in brought scientific credibility to evolution and made it a respectable field of study
despite the intense interest in the religious implications of darwin s book theological controversy over higher criticism set out in essays and reviews largely diverted the church of england s attention
some of the liberal christian authors of that work expressed support for darwin as did many nonconformists
the reverend charles kingsley for instance openly supported the idea of god working through evolution
other christians opposed the idea and even some of darwin s close friends and supporters including charles lyell and asa gray initially expressed reservations about some of his ideas
gray later became a staunch supporter of darwin in america and collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book darwiniana
these essays argued for a conciliation between darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism at a time when many on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive
gray said that investigation of physical causes was not opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and nature and thought it most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in nature would be realized through natural agencies thomas huxley who strongly promoted darwin s ideas while campaigning to end the dominance of science by the clergy coined the term agnostic to describe his position that god s existence is unknowable
darwin also took this position but prominent atheists including edward aveling and ludwig b chner also took up evolution and it was criticized in the words of one reviewer as tantamount to atheism following the lead of figures such as st
george jackson mivart and john augustine zahm roman catholics in the united states became accepting of evolution itself while ambivalent towards natural selection and stressing humanity s divinely imbued soul
the catholic church never condemned evolution and initially the more conservative leaning catholic leadership in rome held back but gradually adopted a similar position
during the late th century evolutionary ideas were most strongly disputed by the premillennialists who held to a prophecy of the imminent return of christ based on a form of biblical literalism and were convinced that the bible would be invalidated if any error in the scriptures was conceded
however hardly any of the critics of evolution at that time were as concerned about geology freely granting scientists any time they needed before the edenic creation to account for scientific observations such as fossils and geological findings
in the immediate post darwinian era few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth or the progressive nature of the fossil record
likewise few attached geological significance to the biblical flood unlike subsequent creationists
evolutionary skeptics creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of the book of genesis or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily hour days
science professors at liberal northeastern universities almost immediately embraced the theory of evolution and introduced it to their students
however some people in parts of the south and west of the united states which had been influenced by the preachings of christian fundamentalist evangelicals rejected the theory as immoral
in the united kingdom evangelical creationists were in a tiny minority
the victoria institute was formed in in response to essays and reviews and darwin s on the origin of species
it was not officially opposed to evolution theory but its main founder james reddie objected to darwin s work as inharmonious and utterly incredible and philip henry gosse author of omphalos was a vice president
the institute s membership increased to then declined sharply
in the s george mccready price attended and made several presentations of his creationist views which found little support among the members
in john ambrose fleming was made president while he insisted on creation of the soul his acceptance of divinely guided development and of pre adamite humanity meant he was thought of as a theistic evolutionist
at the beginning of the th century debate had started to develop over applying historical methods to biblical criticism suggesting a less literal account of the bible
simultaneously the developing science of geology indicated the earth was ancient and religious thinkers sought to accommodate this by day age creationism or gap creationism
neptunianist catastrophism which had in the th and th centuries proposed that a universal flood could explain all geological features gave way to ideas of geological gradualism introduced in by james hutton based upon the erosion and depositional cycle over millions of years which gave a better explanation of the sedimentary column
biology and the discovery of extinction first described in the s and put on a firm footing by georges cuvier in challenged ideas of a fixed immutable aristotelian great chain of being natural theology had earlier expected that scientific findings based on empirical evidence would help religious understanding
emerging differences led some to increasingly regard science and theology as concerned with different non competitive domains
when most scientists came to accept evolution by around european theologians generally came to accept evolution as an instrument of god
for instance pope leo xiii in office referred to longstanding christian thought that scriptural interpretations could be reevaluated in the light of new knowledge and roman catholics came around to acceptance of human evolution subject to direct creation of the soul
in the united states the development of the racist social darwinian eugenics movement by certain circles led a number of catholics to reject evolution
in this enterprise they received little aid from conservative christians in great britain and europe
in britain this has been attributed to their minority status leading to a more tolerant less militant theological tradition
this continues to the present
in his speech at the pontifical academy of sciences in pope francis declared that he accepted the big bang theory and the theory of evolution and that god was not a magician with a magic wand
at first in the u s evangelical christians paid little attention to the developments in geology and biology being more concerned with the rise of european higher biblical criticism which questioned the belief in the bible as literal truth
those criticizing these approaches took the name fundamentalist originally coined by its supporters to describe a specific package of theological beliefs that developed into a movement within the protestant community of the united states in the early part of the th century and which had its roots in the fundamentalist modernist controversy of the s and s
the term in a religious context generally indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs
up until the early mid th century mainline christian denominations within the united states showed little official resistance to evolution
around the start of the th century some evangelical scholars had ideas accommodating evolution such as b
warfield who saw it as a natural law expressing god s will
by then most u s
high school and college biology classes taught scientific evolution but several factors including the rise of christian fundamentalism and social factors of changes and insecurity in more traditionalist bible belt communities led to a backlash
the numbers of children receiving secondary education increased rapidly and parents who had fundamentalist tendencies or who opposed social ideas of what was called survival of the fittest had real concerns about what their children were learning about evolution
the main british creationist movement in this period the evolution protest movement epm formed in the s out of the victoria institute or philosophical society of great britain founded in in response to the publication of darwin s on the origin of species in and of essays and reviews in
the victoria institute had the stated objective of defending the great truths revealed in holy scripture
against the opposition of science falsely so called
although it did not officially oppose evolution it attracted a number of scientists skeptical of darwinism including john william dawson and arnold guyot
it reached a high point of members in but quickly plummeted to less than one third of that figure in the first two decades of the twentieth century
although it opposed evolution at first the institute joined the theistic evolution camp by the s which led to the development of the evolution protest movement in reaction
amateur ornithologist douglas dewar the main driving force within the epm published a booklet entitled man a special creation and engaged in public speaking and debates with supporters of evolution
in the late s he resisted american creationists call for acceptance of flood geology which later led to conflict within the organization
despite trying to win the public endorsement of c
lewis the most prominent christian apologist of his day by the mid s the epm came under control of schoolmaster pastor albert g
tilney whose dogmatic and authoritarian style ran the organization as a one man band rejecting flood geology unwaveringly promoting gap creationism and reducing the membership to lethargic inactivity
it was renamed the creation science movement csm in under the chairmanship of david rosevear who holds a ph d
in organometallic chemistry from the university of bristol
by the mid s the csm had formally incorporated flood geology into its deed of trust which all officers had to sign and condemned gap creationism and day age creationism as unscriptural
in tennessee passed a statute the butler act which prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution in all schools in the state
later that year mississippi passed a similar law as did arkansas in
in the supreme court of the united states struck down these anti monkey laws as unconstitutional because they established a religious doctrine violating both the first and fourth amendments to the united states constitution
in more recent times religious fundamentalists who accept creationism have struggled to get their rejection of evolution accepted as legitimate science within education institutions in the u s
a series of important court cases has resulted
after in the aftermath of world war i the fundamentalist modernist controversy had brought a surge of opposition to the idea of evolution and following the campaigning of william jennings bryan several states introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution
by such legislation was being considered in states and had passed in some states such as tennessee
the american civil liberties union offered to defend anyone who wanted to bring a test case against one of these laws
john t
scopes accepted and confessed to teaching his tennessee class evolution in defiance of the butler act using the textbook by george william hunter a civic biology presented in problems
the trial widely publicized by h
mencken among others is commonly referred to as the scopes monkey trial
the court convicted scopes but the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution
following an appeal of the case to the tennessee supreme court the court overturned the decision on a technicality the judge had assessed the minimum fine instead of allowing the jury to assess the fine
although it overturned the conviction the court decided that the butler act was not in violation of the religious preference provisions of the tennessee constitution section of article which stated that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship
the court applying that state constitutional language held
the interpretation of the establishment clause of the united states constitution up to that time held that the government could not establish a particular religion as the state religion
the tennessee supreme court s decision held in effect that the butler act was constitutional under the state constitution s religious preference clause because the act did not establish one religion as the state religion
as a result of the holding the teaching of evolution remained illegal in tennessee and continued campaigning succeeded in removing evolution from school textbooks throughout the united states
in the united states supreme court invalidated a forty year old arkansas statute that prohibited the teaching of evolution in the public schools
a little rock arkansas high school biology teacher susan epperson filed suit charging that the law violated the federal constitutional prohibition against establishment of religion as set forth in the establishment clause
the little rock ministerial association supported epperson s challenge declaring to use the bible to support an irrational and an archaic concept of static and undeveloping creation is not only to misunderstand the meaning of the book of genesis but to do god and religion a disservice by making both enemies of scientific advancement and academic freedom
the court held that the united states constitution prohibits a state from requiring in the words of the majority opinion that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma
but the supreme court decision also suggested that creationism could be taught in addition to evolution
daniel v
waters was a legal case in which the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit struck down tennessee s law regarding the teaching of equal time of evolution and creationism in public school science classes because it violated the establishment clause
following this ruling creationism was stripped of overt biblical references and rebranded creation science and several states passed legislative acts requiring that this be given equal time with the teaching of evolution
as biologists grew more and more confident in evolution as the central defining principle of biology american membership in churches favoring increasingly literal interpretations of scripture also rose with the southern baptist convention and lutheran church missouri synod outpacing all other denominations
with growth and increased finances these churches became better equipped to promulgate a creationist message with their own colleges schools publishing houses and broadcast media
in presbyterian and reformed publishing released the first major modern creationist book john c
whitcomb and henry m
morris influential the genesis flood the biblical record and its scientific implications
the authors argued that creation was literally days long that humans lived concurrently with dinosaurs and that god created each kind of life individually
on the strength of this morris became a popular speaker spreading anti evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches colleges and conferences
morris creation science research center csrc rushed publication of biology textbooks that promoted creationism
ultimately the csrc broke up over a divide between sensationalism and a more intellectual approach and morris founded the institute for creation research which was promised to be controlled and operated by scientists
during this time morris and others who supported flood geology adopted the terms scientific creationism and creation science
the flood geology theory effectively co opted the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views
in another case in arkansas ruled that the arkansas balanced treatment for creation science and evolution science act act was unconstitutional because it violated the establishment clause
much of the transcript of the case was lost including evidence from francisco ayala
in the early s the louisiana legislature passed a law titled the balanced treatment for creation science and evolution science act
the act did not require teaching either evolution or creationism as such but did require that when evolutionary science was taught creation science had to be taught as well
creationists had lobbied aggressively for the law arguing that the act was about academic freedom for teachers an argument adopted by the state in support of the act
lower courts ruled that the state s actual purpose was to promote the religious doctrine of creation science but the state appealed to the supreme court
in the similar case of mclean v
arkansas see above the federal trial court had also decided against creationism
mclean v
arkansas was not appealed to the federal circuit court of appeals creationists instead thinking that they had better chances with edwards v
aguillard
in the united states supreme court ruled that the louisiana act was also unconstitutional because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion
at the same time it stated its opinion that teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction leaving open the door for a handful of proponents of creation science to evolve their arguments into the iteration of creationism that later came to be known as intelligent design
in response to edwards v
aguillard the neo creationist intelligent design movement was formed around the discovery institute s center for science and culture
it makes the claim that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause not an undirected process such as natural selection it has been viewed as a scientific approach to creationism by creationists but is widely rejected as pseudoscience by the science community primarily because intelligent design cannot be tested and rejected like scientific hypotheses see for example list of scientific bodies explicitly rejecting intelligent design
in the push by intelligent design advocates to introduce intelligent design in public school science classrooms the hub of the intelligent design movement the discovery institute arranged to conduct hearings to review the evidence for evolution in the light of its critical analysis of evolution lesson plans
the kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in topeka kansas may to may
the kansas state board of education eventually adopted the institute s critical analysis of evolution lesson plans over objections of the state board science hearing committee and electioneering on behalf of conservative republican party candidates for the board
on august four of the six conservative republicans who approved the critical analysis of evolution classroom standards lost their seats in a primary election
the moderate republican and democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the school science standards and adopt those recommended by a state board science hearing committee that were rejected by the previous board and on february the board voted to to reject the amended science standards enacted in
the definition of science was once again limited to the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe
following the edwards v
aguillard decision by the united states supreme court in which the court held that a louisiana law requiring that creation science be taught in public schools whenever evolution was taught was unconstitutional because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion creationists renewed their efforts to introduce creationism into public school science classes
this effort resulted in intelligent design which sought to avoid legal prohibitions by leaving the source of creation to an unnamed and undefined intelligent designer as opposed to god
this ultimately resulted in the dover trial kitzmiller v
dover area school district which went to trial on september and was decided on december in favor of the plaintiffs who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught in public school science classrooms was an unconstitutional establishment of religion
the kitzmiller v
dover decision held that intelligent design was not a subject of legitimate scientific research and that it cannot uncouple itself from its creationist and hence religious antecedents
the december ruling in the kitzmiller v
dover area school district trial supported the viewpoint of the american association for the advancement of science and other science and education professional organizations who say that proponents of teach the controversy seek to undermine the teaching of evolution while promoting intelligent design and to advance an education policy for u s
public schools that introduces creationist explanations for the origin of life to public school science curricula
on march the texas board of education by a vote of to voted that at least in texas textbooks must teach intelligent design alongside evolution and question the validity of the fossil record
don mcleroy a dentist and chair of the board said i think the new standards are wonderful
dogmatism about evolution has sapped america s scientific soul according to science magazine because texas is the second largest textbook market in the united states publishers have a strong incentive to be certified by the board as conforming to the state s standards the texas board of education hearings were chronicled in the documentary the revisionaries
the scientific consensus on the origins and evolution of life continues to be challenged by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold some form of creationism usually young earth creationism creation science old earth creationism or intelligent design as an alternative
most of these groups are literalist christians who believe the biblical account is inerrant and more than one sees the debate as part of the christian mandate to evangelize
some groups see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views that cannot be reconciled
more accommodating viewpoints held by many mainstream churches and many scientists consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought non overlapping magisteria which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it
this idea has received criticism from both the non religious like the zoologist evolutionary biologist and religion critic richard dawkins and fundamentalists who see the idea as both underestimating the ability of methodological naturalism to result in moral conclusions and ignorant or downplaying of the fact claims of religions and scriptures
studies on the religious beliefs of scientists does support the evidence of a rift between traditional literal fundamentalist religion and experimental science
three studies of scientific attitudes since have shown that over of scientists do not believe in a traditional god or the traditional belief in immortality with disbelief stronger amongst biological scientists than physical scientists
amongst those not registering such attitudes a high percentage indicated a preference for adhering to a belief concerning mystery than any dogmatic or faith based view
but only of scientists stated that they saw a fundamental clash between science and religion
this study of trends over time suggests that the culture wars between creationism and evolution are held more strongly by religious literalists than by scientists themselves and are likely to continue fostering anti scientific or pseudoscientific attitudes amongst fundamentalist believers
more recently the intelligent design movement has attempted an anti evolution position that avoids any direct appeal to religion
scientists have argued that intelligent design is pseudoscience and does not represent any research program within the mainstream scientific community and is still essentially creationism
its leading proponent the discovery institute made widely publicized claims that it was a new science although the only paper arguing for it published in a scientific journal was accepted in questionable circumstances and quickly disavowed in the sternberg peer review controversy with the biological society of washington stating that it did not meet the journal s scientific standards was a significant departure from the journal s normal subject area and was published at the former editor s sole discretion contrary to typical editorial practices on august u s
president george w
bush commented endorsing the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution i felt like both sides ought to be properly taught
so people can understand what the debate is about
in the controversy a number of divergent opinions have crystallized regarding both the acceptance of scientific theories and religious doctrine and practice
young earth creationism yec involves the religiously based belief that god created the earth within the last years literally as described in genesis within the approximate timeframe of biblical genealogies detailed for example in the ussher chronology
young earth creationists often believe that the universe has a similar age to that of the earth
creationist cosmologies result from attempts by some creationists to assign the universe an age consistent with the ussher chronology and other young earth timeframes based on the genealogies
this belief generally has a basis in biblical literalism and completely rejects the scientific methodology of evolutionary biology
creation science is agreed by the scientific community to be a pseudoscience that attempts to prove that young earth creationism is consistent with science
old earth creationism holds that god created the physical universe but that one should not take the creation event of genesis within days strictly literally
this group generally accepts the age of the universe and the age of the earth as described by astronomers and geologists but regards details of the evolutionary theory as questionable
old earth creationists interpret the genesis creation narrative in a number of ways each differing from the six consecutive hour day creation of the young earth creationist view
neo creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy
they wish to re frame the debate over the origins of life in non religious terms and without appeals to scripture and to bring the debate before the public
neo creationists may be either young earth or old earth creationists and hold a range of underlying theological viewpoints e g
on the interpretation of the bible
as of neo creationism underlies the intelligent design movement which has a big tent strategy making it inclusive of many young earth creationists such as paul nelson and percival davis and some sympathetic old earth creationists
theistic evolution takes the general view that instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution some or all classical religious teachings about god and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory including specifically evolution
it generally views evolution as a tool used by a creator god who is both the first cause and immanent sustainer upholder of the universe it is therefore well accepted by people of strong theistic as opposed to deistic convictions
theistic evolution can synthesize with the day age interpretation of the genesis creation myth most adherents consider that the first chapters of genesis should not be interpreted as a literal description but rather as a literary framework or allegory
this position generally accepts the viewpoint of methodological naturalism a long standing convention of the scientific method in science
many mainline liberal denominations have long accepted evolution and it is increasingly finding acceptance among evangelical christians who strive to keep traditional christian theology intact
theistic evolutionists have frequently been prominent in opposing creationism including intelligent design
notable examples have included biologist kenneth r
miller and theologian john f
haught who testified for the plaintiffs in kitzmiller v
dover area school district in
another example is the clergy letter project which has compiled and maintains statements signed by american christian and non christian clergy of different denominations rejecting creationism with specific reference to points raised by intelligent design proponents
theistic evolutionists have also been active in citizens alliances for science that oppose the introduction of creationism into public school science classes one example being evangelical christian geologist keith b
miller who is a prominent board member of kansas citizens for science
agnostic evolution is the position of acceptance of biological evolution combined with the belief that it is not important whether god is was or will have been involved
materialistic evolution is the acceptance of biological evolution combined with the position that if the supernatural exists it has little to no influence on the material world a position common to philosophical naturalists humanists and atheists
the new atheists champion this view they argue strongly that the creationist viewpoint is not only dangerous but is completely rejected by science
critiques such as those based on the distinction between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines
principles such as uniformitarianism occam s razor or parsimony and the copernican principle are claimed to be the result of a bias within science toward philosophical naturalism which is equated by many creationists with atheism
in countering this claim philosophers of science use the term methodological naturalism to refer to the long standing convention in science of the scientific method
the methodological assumption is that observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes without assuming the existence or non existence of the supernatural and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are outside the realm of science
creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close minded
because modern science tries to rely on the minimization of a priori assumptions error and subjectivity as well as on avoidance of baconian idols it remains neutral on subjects such as religion or morality
mainstream proponents accuse the creationists of conflating the two in a form of pseudoscience
the argument that evolution is a theory not a fact has often been made against the exclusive teaching of evolution
the argument is related to a common misconception about the technical meaning of theory that is used by scientists
in common usage theory often refers to conjectures hypotheses and unproven assumptions
in science theory usually means a well substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts laws inferences and tested hypotheses for comparison the national academy of sciences defines a fact as an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as true it notes however that truth in science
is never final and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded tomorrow
exploring this issue paleontologist stephen jay gould wrote
marston has argued that although the creationism argument that because evolution is merely a theory it therefore cannot also be a fact reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts the scientific countering of the creationist position by the simple stipulation that evolution is a fact may be counterproductive a better approach according to marston is for scientists to present evolution not as a stipulated fact but as the best explanation for the development of life on earth
this approach marston argues is less likely to end discussion of the topic and is more readily and effectively defended in part by reducing the burden of proof standards required for assertions of fact and by shifting the burden of proof to those who claim that creationism is a better explanation
philosopher of science karl r
popper set out the concept of falsifiability as a way to distinguish science and pseudoscience testable theories are scientific but those that are untestable are not
in unended quest popper declared i have come to the conclusion that darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a metaphysical research programme a possible framework for testable scientific theories while pointing out it had scientific character
in what one sociologist derisively called popper chopping opponents of evolution seized upon popper s definition to claim evolution was not a science and claimed creationism was an equally valid metaphysical research program
for example duane gish a leading creationist proponent wrote in a letter to discover magazine july stephen jay gould states that creationists claim creation is a scientific theory
this is a false accusation
creationists have repeatedly stated that neither creation nor evolution is a scientific theory and each is equally religious
popper responded to news that his conclusions were being used by anti evolutionary forces by affirming that evolutionary theories regarding the origins of life on earth were scientific because their hypotheses can in many cases be tested creationists claimed that a key evolutionary concept that all life on earth is descended from a single common ancestor was not mentioned as testable by popper and claimed it never would be
in fact popper wrote admiringly of the value of darwin s theory
only a few years later popper wrote i have in the past described the theory as almost tautological
i still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme
nevertheless i have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection and i am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation his conclusion later in the article is the theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological
in this case it is not only testable but it turns out to be not strictly universally true
debate among some scientists and philosophers of science on the applicability of falsifiability in science continues
simple falsifiability tests for common descent have been offered by some scientists for instance biologist and prominent critic of creationism richard dawkins and j
haldane both pointed out that if fossil rabbits were found in the precambrian era a time before most similarly complex lifeforms had evolved that would completely blow evolution out of the water
falsifiability has caused problems for creationists in his decision mclean v
arkansas board of education judge william r
overton used falsifiability as one basis for his ruling against the teaching of creation science in the public schools ultimately declaring it simply not science
creationists commonly argue against evolution on the grounds that evolution is a religion it is not a science in order to undermine the higher ground biologists claim in debating creationists and to reframe the debate from being between science evolution and religion creationism to being between two equally religious beliefs or even to argue that evolution is religious while intelligent design is not
those that oppose evolution frequently refer to those who accept evolution as evolutionists or darwinists
this is generally argued by analogy by arguing that evolution and religion have one or more things in common and that therefore evolution is a religion
examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith that supporters of evolution revere darwin as a prophet and dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out of hand
these claims have become more popular in recent years as the neocreationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti religious analogy
in biology no scientist s claims including darwin s are treated as sacrosanct as shown by the aspects of darwin s theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first neo darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis
a number of creationists have blurred the boundaries between their disputes over the truth of the underlying facts and explanatory theories of evolution with their purported philosophical and moral consequences
this type of argument is known as an appeal to consequences and is a logical fallacy
examples of these arguments include those of prominent creationists such as ken ham and henry m
morris
many creationists strongly oppose certain scientific theories in a number of ways including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes accusations of bias within the scientific community and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis
in response to perceived crises in modern science creationists claim to have an alternative typically based on faith creation science or intelligent design
the scientific community has responded by pointing out that their conversations are frequently misrepresented e g
by quote mining in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis and that the creationists alternatives are generally pseudoscientific
disputes relating to evolutionary biology are central to the controversy between creationists and the scientific community
the aspects of evolutionary biology disputed include common descent and particularly human evolution from common ancestors with other members of the great apes macroevolution and the existence of transitional fossils
a group of organisms is said to have common descent if they have a common ancestor
a theory of universal common descent based on evolutionary principles was proposed by charles darwin and is now generally accepted by biologists
the most recent common ancestor of all living organisms is believed to have appeared about billion years ago
with a few exceptions e g
michael behe the vast majority of creationists rejected this theory in favor of the belief that a common design suggests a common designer god
many of these same creationists through the beginning of the st century also held that modern species were perpetually fixed from creation
however now a large amount of creationists allow evolution of species in the face of undeniable evidence for speciation
they contend however that it was specific kinds or baramin that were created initially from which all present day species arose
thus all bear species may have developed from a common ancestor that was separately created to establish a bear like baramin by this type of creationism
this type of creationism often acknowledges the existence of evolutionary processes but denies that they demonstrate common ancestry or that evolutionary processes would have produced the diversity of contemporary life
evidence of common descent includes evidence from genetics fossil records comparative anatomy geographical distribution of species comparative physiology and comparative biochemistry
human evolution is the study of the biological evolution of humans as a distinct species from its common ancestors with other animals
analysis of fossil evidence and genetic distance are two of the means by which scientists understand this evolutionary history
fossil evidence suggests that humans earliest hominid ancestors may have split from other primates as early as the late oligocene circa to ma and that by the early miocene the adaptive radiation of many different hominoid forms was well underway
evidence from the molecular dating of genetic differences indicates that the gibbon lineage family hylobatidae diverged between and ma and the orangutan lineage subfamily ponginae diverged about ma
while there is no fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting the early ancestry of gibbons fossil proto orangutans may be represented by sivapithecus from india and griphopithecus from turkey dated to around ma
molecular evidence further suggests that between and ma first the gorillas and then the chimpanzee genus pan split from the line leading to the humans
we have no fossil record of this divergence but distinctively hominid fossils have been found dating to ma see lucy and possibly even earlier at or ma see touma
comparisons of dna show that percent of the coding regions are identical in chimpanzees and humans overall which is taken as strong evidence of recent common ancestry
today only one distinct human species survives but many earlier species have been found in the fossil record including homo erectus homo habilis and homo neanderthalensis
creationists dispute there is evidence of shared ancestry in the fossil evidence and argue either that these are misassigned ape fossils e g
that java man was a gibbon or too similar to modern humans to designate them as distinct or transitional forms
creationists frequently disagree where the dividing lines would be
creation myths such as the book of genesis frequently posit a first man adam in the case of genesis which has been advocated by creationists as underlying an alternative viewpoint to the scientific account
all these claims and objections are subsequently refuted
creationists also dispute the scientific community s interpretation of genetic evidence in the study of human evolution
they argue that it is a dubious assumption that genetic similarities between various animals imply a common ancestral relationship and that scientists are coming to this interpretation only because they have preconceived notions that such shared relationships exist
creationists also argue that genetic mutations are strong evidence against evolutionary theory because they assert the mutations required for major changes to occur would almost certainly be detrimental
however most mutations are neutral and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another
in biology macroevolution refers to evolution at and above the species level including most of fossil history and much of systematics
microevolution refers to the process in evolution within populations including adaptive and neutral evolution
however there is no fundamental distinction between these processes small changes compound over time and eventually lead to speciation
creationists argue that a finite number of discrete kinds were created as described in the book of genesis and these kinds determine the limits of variation
early creationists equated kinds with species but most now accept that speciation can occur not only is the evidence overwhelming for speciation but the millions of species now in existence could not have fit in noah s ark as depicted in genesis
created kinds identified by creationists are more generally on the level of the family for example canidae but the genus homo is a separate kind
a creationist systematics called baraminology builds on the idea of created kind calling it a baramin
while evolutionary systematics is used to explore relationships between organisms by descent baraminology attempts to find discontinuities between groups of organisms
it employs many of the tools of evolutionary systematics but biblical criteria for taxonomy take precedence over all other criteria
this undermines their claim to objectivity they accept evidence for the common ancestry of cats or dogs but not analogous evidence for the common ancestry of apes and humans
recent arguments against macroevolution in the creationist sense include the intelligent design id arguments of irreducible complexity and specified complexity
neither argument has been accepted for publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal and both arguments have been rejected by the scientific community as pseudoscience
when taken to court in an attempt to introduce id into the classroom the judge wrote the overwhelming evidence at trial established that id is a religious view a mere re labeling of creationism and not a scientific theory
it is commonly stated by critics of evolution that there are no known transitional fossils
this position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature
a common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features
it is plausible that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution
the precursor to for example a wing might originally have only been used for gliding trapping flying prey or mating display
today wings can still have all of these functions but they are also used in active flight
as another example alan hayward stated in creation and evolution that darwinists rarely mention the whale because it presents them with one of their most insoluble problems
they believe that somehow a whale must have evolved from an ordinary land dwelling animal which took to the sea and lost its legs
a land mammal that was in the process of becoming a whale would fall between two stools it would not be fitted for life on land or at sea and would have no hope for survival the evolution of whales has been documented in considerable detail with ambulocetus described as looking like a three metre long mammalian crocodile as one of the transitional fossils
although transitional fossils elucidate the evolutionary transition of one life form to another they only exemplify snapshots of this process
due to the special circumstances required for preservation of living beings only a very small percentage of all life forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered
thus the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils but it will never be known in detail
progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so
critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of snapshot fossils that show crucial steps between species
the theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by stephen jay gould and niles eldredge is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils
this theory pertains only to well documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period
these transitions usually traceable in the same geological outcrop often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability
to explain these jumps gould and eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution
for example the change from a creature the size of a mouse to one the size of an elephant could be accomplished over years with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime
years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record
experts in evolutionary theory have pointed out that even if it were possible for enough fossils to survive to show a close transitional change critics will never be satisfied as the discovery of one missing link itself creates two more so called missing links on either side of the discovery
richard dawkins says that the reason for this losing battle is that many of these critics are theists who simply don t want to see the truth
many believers in young earth creationism a position held by the majority of proponents of flood geology accept biblical chronogenealogies such as the ussher chronology which in turn is based on the masoretic version of the genealogies of genesis
they believe that god created the universe approximately years ago in the space of six days
much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in anthropology geology and planetary science that give ages in conflict with the young earth idea
in particular creationists dispute the reliability of radiometric dating and isochron analysis both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the earth
they usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by diffusion of the parent and daughter isotopes
a full critique of the entire parameter fitting analysis which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs and gives essentially identical or near identical readings has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique
the consensus of professional scientific organizations worldwide is that no scientific evidence contradicts the age of approximately billion years
young earth creationists reject these ages on the grounds of what they regard as being tenuous and untestable assumptions in the methodology
they have often quoted apparently inconsistent radiometric dates to cast doubt on the utility and accuracy of the method
mainstream proponents who get involved in this debate point out that dating methods only rely on the assumptions that the physical laws governing radioactive decay have not been violated since the sample was formed harking back to lyell s doctrine of uniformitarianism
they also point out that the problems that creationists publicly mentioned can be shown to either not be problems at all are issues with known contamination or simply the result of incorrectly evaluating legitimate data
while young earth creationists believe that the universe was created by the judeo christian god approximately years ago the current scientific consensus is that the universe as we know it emerged from the big bang billion years ago
the recent science of nucleocosmochronology is extending the approaches used for carbon and other radiometric dating to the dating of astronomical features
for example based upon this emerging science the galactic thin disk of the milky way galaxy is estimated to have been formed billion years ago
creationists point to experiments they have performed which they claim demonstrate that billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period from which they infer that billion fold speed ups of nuclear decay have occurred a massive violation of the principle that radioisotope decay rates are constant a core principle underlying nuclear physics generally and radiometric dating in particular
the scientific community points to numerous flaws in these experiments to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer reviewed scientific journal and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental geochronology

the discovery institute has a formal declaration titled a scientific dissent from darwinism which has many evangelicals people from fields irrelevant to biology and geology and few biologists
many of the biologists who signed have fields not directly related to evolution
in response there has been an analogous declaration humorously upholding the consensus project steve which emphasizes the large amount of scientists supporting the consensus
as a means to criticize mainstream science creationists sometimes quote scientists who ostensibly support the mainstream theories but appear to acknowledge criticisms similar to those of creationists
these have very often been shown to be quote mines that do not accurately reflect the evidence for evolution or the mainstream scientific community s opinion of it or are highly out of date
many of the same quotes used by creationists have appeared so frequently in internet discussions due to the availability of cut and paste functions that the talkorigins archive has created the quote mine project for quick reference to the original context of these quotations
creationists often quote mine darwin especially with regard to the seeming improbability of the evolution of the eye to give support to their views
the creation evolution controversy has grown in importance in recent years interfacing with other contemporary political issues primarily those in the united states that involve the christian right
creationists promoted the idea that evolution is a theory in crisis with scientists criticizing evolution and claim that fairness and equal time requires educating students about the alleged scientific controversy
opponents being the overwhelming majority of the scientific community and science education organizations

national center for science education list of statements from scientific professional organizations on the status intelligent design and other forms of creationism in the sciences
reply that there is no scientific controversy and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and politics george mason university biology department introduced a course on the creation evolution controversy and apparently as students learn more about biology they find objections to evolution less convincing suggesting that teaching the controversy rightly as a separate elective course on philosophy or history of science or politics of science and religion would undermine creationists criticisms and that the scientific community s resistance to this approach was bad public relations
creationists have claimed that preventing them from teaching creationism violates their right of freedom of speech
court cases such as webster v
new lenox school district and bishop v
aronov have upheld school districts and universities right to restrict teaching to a specified curriculum
creationists often argue that christianity and literal belief in the bible are either foundationally significant or directly responsible for scientific progress
to that end institute for creation research founder henry m
morris has enumerated scientists such as astronomer and philosopher galileo galilei mathematician and theoretical physicist james clerk maxwell mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal geneticist monk gregor mendel and isaac newton as believers in a biblical creation narrative
this argument usually involves scientists who were no longer alive when evolution was proposed or whose field of study did not include evolution
the argument is generally rejected as specious by those who oppose creationism
many of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution e g the modern evolutionary synthesis combines darwin s theory of evolution with mendel s theories of inheritance and genetics
though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late th century it was not until the mid th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis
geneticist and evolutionary biologist theodosius dobzhansky called the father of the modern synthesis argued that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs
nevertheless some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today louis pasteur for example opposed the theory of spontaneous generation with biogenesis an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on chemical evolution and abiogenesis
pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the earth was millions of years old
the relationship between religion and science was not portrayed in antagonistic terms until the late th century and even then there have been many examples of the two being reconcilable for evolutionary scientists
many historical scientists wrote books explaining how pursuit of science was seen by them as fulfillment of spiritual duty in line with their religious beliefs
even so such professions of faith were not insurance against dogmatic opposition by certain religious people
many creationists and scientists engage in frequent public debates regarding the origin of human life hosted by a variety of institutions
however some scientists disagree with this tactic arguing that by openly debating supporters of supernatural origin explanations creationism and intelligent design scientists are lending credibility and unwarranted publicity to creationists which could foster an inaccurate public perception and obscure the factual merits of the debate
for example in may michael shermer debated creationist kent hovind in front of a predominantly creationist audience
in shermer s online reflection while he was explaining that he won the debate with intellectual and scientific evidence he felt it was not an intellectual exercise but rather it was an emotional drama with scientists arguing from an impregnable fortress of evidence that converges to an unmistakable conclusion while for creationists it is a spiritual war while receiving positive responses from creationist observers shermer concluded unless there is a subject that is truly debatable evolution v
creation is not with a format that is fair in a forum that is balanced it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion see non overlapping magisteria
others like evolutionary biologist massimo pigliucci have debated hovind and have expressed surprise to hear hovind try to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks and at hovind s assertion that biologists believe humans evolved from bananas
in september educator and television personality bill nye of bill nye the science guy fame spoke with the associated press and aired his fears about acceptance of creationist theory believing that teaching children that creationism is the only true answer and without letting them understand the way science works will prevent any future innovation in the world of science
in february nye defended evolution in the classroom in a debate with creationist ken ham on the topic of whether creation is a viable model of origins in today s modern scientific era
eugenie scott of the national center for science education a nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the teaching of evolution in the public schools claimed debates are not the sort of arena to promote science to creationists
scott says that evolution is not on trial in the world of science and the topic of the discussion should not be the scientific legitimacy of evolution but rather should be on the lack of evidence in creationism
stephen jay gould adopted a similar position explaining
on both sides of the controversy a wide range of organizations are involved at a number of levels in lobbying in an attempt to influence political decisions relating to the teaching of evolution
these include the discovery institute the national center for science education the national science teachers association state citizens alliances for science and numerous national science associations and state academies of science
the controversy has been discussed in numerous newspaper articles reports op eds and letters to the editor as well as a number of radio and television programmes including the pbs series evolution and coral ridge ministries darwin s deadly legacy
this has led some commentators to express a concern at what they see as a highly inaccurate and biased understanding of evolution among the general public
edward humes states
while the controversy has been prominent in the united states it has flared up in other countries as well
europeans have often regarded the creation evolution controversy as an american matter
in recent years the conflict has become an issue in other countries including germany the united kingdom italy the netherlands poland turkey and serbia
on september the committee on culture science and education of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace issued a report on the attempt by american inspired creationists to promote creationism in european schools
it concludes if we are not careful creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the council of europe
the war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right wing political movements
some advocates of strict creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy the council of europe firmly rejected creationism
under the former queensland state government of joh bjelke petersen in the s queensland allowed the teaching of creationism in secondary schools
in the queensland state government introduced the topic of creationism into school classes within the ancient history subject where its origins and nature are discussed as a significant controversy
public lectures have been given in rented rooms at universities by visiting american speakers
one of the most acrimonious aspects of the australian debate was featured on the science television program quantum about a long running and ultimately unsuccessful court case by ian plimer professor of geology at the university of melbourne against an ordained minister allen roberts who had claimed that there were remnants of noah s ark in eastern turkey
although the court found that roberts had made false and misleading claims they were not made in the course of trade or commerce so the case failed
in recent times the controversy has become more prominent in islamic countries
in egypt evolution is currently taught in schools but saudi arabia and sudan have both banned the teaching of evolution in schools
creation science has also been heavily promoted in turkey and in immigrant communities in western europe primarily by harun yahya
in iran traditional practice of shia islam isn t preoccupied with qur anic literalism as in case of saudi wahhabism but ijtihad many influential iranian shi ite scholars including several who were closely involved in iranian revolution are not opposed to evolutionary ideas in general disagreeing that evolution necessarily conflicts with the muslim mainstream
iranian pupils since th grade of elementary school learn only about evolution thus portraying geologists and scientists in general as an authoritative voice of scientific knowledge
in south korea most opposition to teaching evolution comes from the local evangelical community
as part of these efforts the korean association for creation research kacr was established in by evangelical pastors kim y nggil and ch oe y ngsang
in south korea according to a survey about percent of the population believe in creation science while opposing the teaching of evolution
