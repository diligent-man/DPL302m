zhang shicheng simplified chinese traditional chinese pinyin zh ng sh ch ng birth name zhang jiusi was one of the leaders of the red turban rebellion in the late yuan dynasty of china
later he established the kingdom of dazhou with reigning name tianyou
zhang shicheng was born in what is today the city of dafeng taizhou prefecture jiangsu province
he came from a family of salt shippers and he himself started out in this trade in northern jiangsu transporting both legal and contraband salt as did his brothers zhang shiyi zhang shide and zhang shixin
by his generosity he earned the respect of other salt workers who made him their leader when they rebelled against the oppressive government in
since the s the mongol led yuan dynasty began to face numerous crises
the yellow river flooded constantly and other natural disasters also occurred
at the same time the yuan dynasty required considerable military expenditure to maintain its vast empire
this was solved mostly through additional taxation that fell mainly on the han chinese population which constituted the lowest two castes in the four castes of the yuan dynasty
from this chaos leaders rose up in many places throughout the empire
zhang shicheng who was a salt shipper from jiangsu province rebelled against the yuan dynasty in
zhang with his brother soon conquered taizhou xinghua and gaoyou in
in zhang declared the establishment of the great zhou state and declared himself as king with era name tianyou
soon afterward on the same year zhang controlled yangzhou an important center of salt trade on the grand canal of china just north of the yangtze
in zhang seized suzhou the main hub of transportation and commerce of jiangnan the south of the lower yangtze region and made the city his capital
the lands he now controlled not only were one of the country s main granaries but also produced over half of all salt in china
zhang s regime was mostly patterned on the yuan dynasty model but made use of some of the earlier traditional chinese terminology as well
zhang appointed his brother zhang shixin as prime minister and zhang shide as general commander
many ethnic han yuan generals submitted to zhang after he had established the great zhou
great zhou became the most prosperous kingdom compared to its rivals such as the yuan zhu yuanzhang and chen youliang
the yangtze delta literati strongly backed the zhou regime and because of this his rival the future ming emperor zhu yuanzhang was highly suspicious of them
when the highly educated southern literati came to dominate the civil service examinations the emperor would set quotas and restrictions on their appointments to curb them
around that time his main rival for domination in central china became zhu yuanzhang who had just installed himself in nanjing
it is reported that after several defeats from troops loyal to zhu in zhang offered to pay tribute to zhu in exchange for the recognition of his autonomy
zhu however refused zhang s offer and in zhang accepted a title from the yuan government and agreed to start shipping grain to the yuan capital beijing region by sea
zhang had significantly expanded his domain by when he declared himself the king of wu wu wang possibly following the example of his main rival the nanjing based zhu yuanzhang who had earlier made himself the duke of wu wu gong
not to be outdone in zhu promoted himself to a king wang of wu
as well
it is speculated by modern historians that if zhang had been more decisive and cooperated with another rival and the western neighbor of zhu chen youliang zhang and chen could have crushed zhu s incipient ming state
however indolent zhang was apparently content to merely control the lower yangtze region his two attempts to attack zhu s territories were both defeated decisively
after zhu yuanzhang s victory over chen youliang and his son chen li and taking full control of their former territories by around zhu was able to turn more of his fighting power against zhang
zhu s started with cutting off zhang from any possible aid from the yuan rulers in the north
this was accomplished by his taking gaoyou on the grand canal of china on april
in the same year zhang lost his younger brother zhang shide who was also an important general in his army feared by zhu s troops when the younger zhang fell from his horse and died
by late december zhang s capital suzhou was surrounded by zhu s army
the struggle between the two kings of wu came to the end on october when suzhou fell to zhu yuanzhang s troops after a month siege
zhang tried to hang himself
but was discovered in the act captured and taken to zhu s capital nanjing
what happened to zhang there is not known for sure according to various sources he was either beaten to death or finally managed to hang himself successfully
meanwhile zhu incorporated a quarter million of zhang s troops into his army proclaimed himself the first emperor of the new ming dynasty on the chinese new year day of january or and punished zhang s surviving supporters in suzhou by extortionate taxes
zhang shicheng s tomb in xietang suzhou is still standing today
after his death his memory still made an impression in the hearts of the peoples of suzhou
on every july zhang s birthday the locals of suzhou celebrated with straw dragon toys hanging at the doors of their houses
at the same time they set fire to straw stems the significance being and forming zhang s birth name at the same time it was a homonym for continued remembrance
according to tradition as emperor zhu yuanzhang became suspicious of these local practises and asked local officials to investigate the locals claimed that they were worshipping k itigarbha dizangwang in mandarin
this was again another word play as the locals were actually worshipping zhang as a local prince dizhangwang
this celebration continued under communist rule and lasted until the establishment of the people s republic of china
although very little reliable information exists about the life of the famous novelist luo guanzhong some scholars surmise that luo may have been a member of zhang shicheng s staff during the early days of zhang s kingdom
it is believed luo became disillusioned with zhang after he made accommodations with the mongol rulers
after the disillusionment luo turned to a literary career writing his romance of the three kingdoms
however the scant historical evidence has been interpreted in various ways with arguments in favor of luo having been on the side of other participants in the conflict
