a political organization is any organization that involves itself in the political process including political parties non governmental organizations and special interest advocacy groups
political organizations are those engaged in political activities e g lobbying community organizing campaign advertising etc aimed at achieving clearly defined political goals which typically benefit the interests of their members
while parties are one type of political organization that may engage in some or all of those activities they are distinct in that they typically focus on supporting candidates for public office winning elections and controlling government
the most well known type of political organization is the political party
political parties are directly involved in the political processes of countries with party systems of which there are several types
some of the most common types are multi party systems single party dictatorships and two party systems
in multi party systems such as india pakistan etc there is no restriction on the number of parties allowed to be in operation at any given time
under these types of systems people are free to participate in the political process both through elections and by forming their own political parties as they please
examples of multi party systems are
armenia
bangladesh
canada
france
germany
india
italy
pakistan
philippines
south africa
taiwanin single party systems one political party exercises control over the government
unlike under other systems single party systems do not necessarily extend democratic privileges to the citizens
this means that citizens have little say regarding political subjects
examples of single party systems are
china
north korea
vietnamtwo party systems are similar to multi party systems in that power is not concentrated in one party and that parties have to consider the opinion of the general public in order to retain power by winning elections
most two party systems are technically multiparty systems but all power is effectively concentrated amongst two parties or coalitions
examples of two party systems are
australia
malta
nepal
united kingdom
united statesanother type of political organization is the party coalition
a party coalition is a group of political parties operating together in parliament
oftentimes party coalitions are formed after elections have taken place and no party has clearly won a majority seat in parliament e g
the aap congress government in delhi
other coalitions are formed prior to elections and are effectively agreements between two or more parties to run jointly in elections and to pursue similar agendas e g
the national democratic alliance in india and the liberal national coalition in australia
a labor union or trade union is a political organization formed to promote the interests of workers
labour unions have various roles in modern politics including
organizing strike actions and general strikes
negotiating with employers on behalf of workers
ensuring that workers aren t fired without severance pay
assuring that workers receive reasonable salariesunlike other political organizations labor unions do not directly participate in elections although they may campaign for parties and politicians supporting their positions
labour unionization is a way for workers to maintain unity and preserve their rights
often major corporations antagonize the principle of labor unionization since it results in heavier employment regulations which restrict the powers of big business to fire workers at will effectively causing economic difficulties for such companies
