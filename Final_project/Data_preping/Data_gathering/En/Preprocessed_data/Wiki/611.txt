streatham str t m stret m is a district in south london england
centred miles km south of charing cross it lies mostly within the london borough of lambeth with some parts extending into the neighbouring london borough of wandsworth
streatham was in surrey before becoming part of the county of london in and then greater london in
the area is identified in the london plan as one of major centres in greater london
streatham means the hamlet on the street
the street in question the london to brighton way was the roman road from the capital londinium to the south coast near portslade today within brighton and hove
it is likely that the destination was a roman port now lost to coastal erosion which has been tentatively identified with novus portus mentioned in ptolemy s geographia
the road is confusingly referred to as stane street stone street in some sources and diverges from the main london chichester road at kennington
after the departure of the romans the main road through streatham remained an important trackway
from the th century it was adopted as the main coach road to croydon and east grinstead and then on to newhaven and lewes
in it then became the route of the turnpike road from london to brighton and subsequently became the basis for the modern a
this road and its traffic have shaped streatham s development
streatham s first parish church st leonard s was founded in saxon times but an early tudor tower is the only remaining structure pre dating when the body of the church was rebuilt
the mediaeval parish covered a wider area including balham and tooting bec
streatham appears in domesday book of as estreham
it was held by bec hellouin abbey in normandy from richard de tonbrige
its domesday assets were hides virgate and ploughlands of cultivated land and acres ha of meadow and herbage mixed grass and bracken
annually it was assessed to render s d to its overlords
the village remained largely unchanged until the th century when its natural springs known as streatham wells were first celebrated for their health giving properties
the reputation of the spa and improved turnpike roads attracted wealthy city of london merchants and others to build their country residences in streatham
in spite of london s expansion a limited number of developments took place in the village in the second half of the nineteenth century streatham vale sprung up to the south later still and the small parade of shops by streatham common station has become known colloquially as streatham village
wellfield road which had previously been known as leigham lane was renamed to reflect its role as the main route from the centre of streatham to one of the well locations
another mineral well was located on the south side of streatham common in an area that now forms part of the rookery where it can still be seen and visited within the formal gardens
in the s streatham park a georgian country mansion was built by the brewer ralph thrale on land he bought from the lord of the manor the fourth duke of bedford
streatham park later passed to ralph s son henry thrale who with his wife hester thrale entertained many of the leading literary and artistic characters of the day most notably the lexicographer samuel johnson
the dining room contained portraits of henry s guests painted by his friend joshua reynolds
these pictures were wittily labelled by fanny burney as the streatham worthies
streatham park was later leased to prime minister lord shelburne and was the venue for early negotiations with france that led to the peace treaty of
streatham park was demolished in
one large house that survives is park hill on the north side of streatham common rebuilt in the early th century for the leaf family
it was latterly the home of sir henry tate sugar refiner benefactor of local libraries across south london including streatham library and founder of the tate gallery at millbank
development accelerated after the opening of streatham hill railway station on the west end of london and crystal palace railway in
the other two railway stations followed within fifteen years
some estates such as telford park to the west of streatham hill were spaciously planned with facilities like tennis clubs
despite the local connections to the dukes of bedford there is no link to the contemporary bedford park in west london
another generously sized development was roupell park the area near christchurch road promoted by the roupell family
other streets adopted more conventional suburban layouts
three more parish churches were built to serve the growing area including immanuel and st andrew s st peter s and st margaret the queen s
there is now a mixture of buildings from all architectural eras of the past years
after the first world war streatham developed as a location for entertainment with the streatham hill theatre three cinemas the locarno ballroom and streatham ice rink all adding to its reputation as the west end of south london
with the advent of electric tram services it also grew as a shopping centre serving a wide area to the south
in the s large numbers of blocks of flats were constructed along the high road
these speculative developments were not initially successful
they were only filled when migr communities began to arrive in london after leaving countries under the domination of hitler s germany
in the parish church of the holy redeemer was built in streatham vale to commemorate the work of william wilberforce
in the s streatham had the longest and busiest shopping street in south london
streatham became the site of the uk s first supermarket when express dairies premier supermarkets opened its first square feet m store in waitrose subsequently opened its first supermarket in streatham in but it closed down in
however a combination of factors led to a gradual decline through the s and a more rapid decline in the s
these included long term population movements out to croydon kingston and sutton the growth of heavy traffic on the a main road from central london to gatwick airport and brighton and a lack of redevelopment sites in the town centre
this culminated in when the closure of pratts which had grown from a victorian draper s shop to a department store operated since the s by the john lewis partnership coincided with the opening of a large sainsbury s supermarket half a mile south of the town centre replacing an existing smaller sainbury s store opposite streatham hill railway station
several recent additions such as argos lidl and peacocks are located in new retail spaces on the site of pratt s but in common with other high streets retail recovery has been slow and a substantial proportion of vacant space has been taken by a growing number of restaurants bars and coffee shops
in august streatham was selected as one of the areas to benefit from round of the mayor of london s outer london fund gaining
later streatham was awarded a further million matched by another million by lambeth
the money from this fund was spent on improving streets and public spaces in streatham
this includes the smartening up of shop fronts through painting and cleaning replacing shutters and signage as well as helping to reveal facilities behind the high street such as the stables community centre
streatham library has also undergone a million refurbishment
the tudor hall behind the library was brought back into public use as the mark bennett centre providing a meeting and performance space
streatham skyline introduced new lighting to highlight some of streatham s more attractive buildings and monuments with the aim of improving safety and the overall attractiveness of the area
in september streatham high road was voted the worst street in britain in a poll organised by the bbc today programme and cabe
this largely reflected the dominance of through traffic along high road
plans for investment and regeneration had begun before the poll with local amenity group the streatham society leading a successful partnership bid for funding from central government for environmental improvements
work started in winter with the refurbishment of streatham green and repaving and relighting of the high road between st leonard s church and the odeon cinema
in streatham green won the metropolitan public gardens association london spade award for best public open space scheme in the capital
the poll was a catalyst for lambeth london borough council and transport for london s street management to co operate on a joint funding arrangement for further streetscape improvements which benefited the section of the high road between st leonard s and streatham station and the stretch north of the odeon as far as woodbourne avenue
the section between woodbourne avenue and streatham hill station was not completed until
any further improvements north of streatham hill have been halted because of tfl s budgetary shortfall
streatham festival was established in
it has grown to a festival with over events held in an array of locations from bars to churches and parks to youth centres attracting over people
after several years of delay and controversy over phasing construction started in the autumn of on the streatham hub a major redevelopment next to streatham railway station
the project was a joint development by lambeth council and tesco
the project involved the demolition of streatham ice arena streatham leisure centre and the former streatham bus garage and their replacement with a new leisure centre and a tesco store with flats above it
streatham leisure centre closed in november due to health and safety concerns when part of the pool hall ceiling collapsed
streatham ice arena closed on december having celebrated eighty years of operation in february
for two years a temporary ice rink was provided at popes road brixton
in november the new streatham ice and leisure centre opened to the public
the leisure centre houses a m x m indoor ice rink with rink side seats on the upper floors a six lane m swimming pool m teaching pool four court sports hall and a gym with stations
the jazz venue hideaway continues streatham s long entertainment tradition
it features live performances of jazz funk swing and soul music as well as stand up comedy nights
it won the jazz venue promoter of the year category in the parliamentary jazz awards
on february at around gmt sudesh mamoor faraz amman attacked and injured two people using a machete on streatham high street in what police declared a terrorist incident
alongside the machete amman was also wearing a vest with components made to look like improvised explosive devices
he was pursued by armed police and was fatally shot outside a boots pharmacy
streatham high road also was host to cat s whiskers which later became caesar s nightclub in the early s through to which closed to become the site of the newly developed block of flats with a mark s and spencer supermarket and starbuck s
we would welcome any further input on these two establishments and their history
