Streatham str t m STRET m is a district in south London England Centred miles km south of Charing Cross it lies mostly within the London Borough of Lambeth with some parts extending into the neighbouring London Borough of Wandsworth
Streatham was in Surrey before becoming part of the County of London in and then Greater London in The area is identified in the London Plan as one of major centres in Greater London
Streatham means the hamlet on the street The street in question the London to Brighton Way was the Roman road from the capital Londinium to the south coast near Portslade today within Brighton and Hove It is likely that the destination was a Roman port now lost to coastal erosion which has been tentatively identified with 'Novus Portus' mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia The road is confusingly referred to as Stane Street Stone Street in some sources and diverges from the main London Chichester road at Kennington
After the departure of the Romans the main road through Streatham remained an important trackway From the th century it was adopted as the main coach road to Croydon and East Grinstead and then on to Newhaven and Lewes In it then became the route of the turnpike road from London to Brighton and subsequently became the basis for the modern A This road and its traffic have shaped Streatham's development
Streatham's first parish church St Leonard's was founded in Saxon times but an early Tudor tower is the only remaining structure pre dating when the body of the church was rebuilt The mediaeval parish covered a wider area including Balham and Tooting Bec
Streatham appears in Domesday Book of as Estreham It was held by Bec Hellouin Abbey in Normandy from Richard de Tonbrige Its domesday assets were hides virgate and ploughlands of cultivated land and acres ha of meadow and herbage mixed grass and bracken Annually it was assessed to render s d to its overlords
The village remained largely unchanged until the th century when its natural springs known as Streatham Wells were first celebrated for their health giving properties The reputation of the spa and improved turnpike roads attracted wealthy City of London merchants and others to build their country residences in Streatham
In spite of London's expansion a limited number of developments took place in the village in the second half of the nineteenth century Streatham Vale sprung up to the South later still and the small parade of shops by Streatham Common Station has become known colloquially as Streatham Village
Wellfield Road which had previously been known as Leigham Lane was renamed to reflect its role as the main route from the centre of Streatham to one of the well locations Another mineral well was located on the south side of Streatham Common in an area that now forms part of The Rookery where it can still be seen and visited within the formal gardens
In the s Streatham Park a Georgian country mansion was built by the brewer Ralph Thrale on land he bought from the Lord of the Manor the fourth Duke of Bedford Streatham Park later passed to Ralph's son Henry Thrale who with his wife Hester Thrale entertained many of the leading literary and artistic characters of the day most notably the lexicographer Samuel Johnson The dining room contained portraits of Henry's guests painted by his friend Joshua Reynolds These pictures were wittily labelled by Fanny Burney as the Streatham Worthies
Streatham Park was later leased to Prime Minister Lord Shelburne and was the venue for early negotiations with France that led to the Peace Treaty of Streatham Park was demolished in
One large house that survives is Park Hill on the north side of Streatham Common rebuilt in the early th century for the Leaf family It was latterly the home of Sir Henry Tate sugar refiner benefactor of local libraries across south London including Streatham Library and founder of the Tate Gallery at Millbank
Development accelerated after the opening of Streatham Hill railway station on the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway in The other two railway stations followed within fifteen years
Some estates such as Telford Park to the west of Streatham Hill were spaciously planned with facilities like tennis clubs Despite the local connections to the Dukes of Bedford there is no link to the contemporary Bedford Park in west London Another generously sized development was Roupell Park the area near Christchurch Road promoted by the Roupell family Other streets adopted more conventional suburban layouts
Three more parish churches were built to serve the growing area including Immanuel and St Andrew's St Peter's and St Margaret the Queen's

After the First World War Streatham developed as a location for entertainment with the Streatham Hill Theatre three cinemas the Locarno ballroom and Streatham Ice Rink all adding to its reputation as the West End of South London With the advent of electric tram services it also grew as a shopping centre serving a wide area to the south In the s large numbers of blocks of flats were constructed along the High Road These speculative developments were not initially successful They were only filled when migr communities began to arrive in London after leaving countries under the domination of Hitler's Germany In the parish church of the Holy Redeemer was built in Streatham Vale to commemorate the work of William Wilberforce
In the s Streatham had the longest and busiest shopping street in south London Streatham became the site of the UK's first supermarket when Express Dairies Premier Supermarkets opened its first square feet m store in Waitrose subsequently opened its first supermarket in Streatham in but it closed down in
However a combination of factors led to a gradual decline through the s and a more rapid decline in the s These included long term population movements out to Croydon Kingston and Sutton the growth of heavy traffic on the A main road from central London to Gatwick Airport and Brighton and a lack of redevelopment sites in the town centre This culminated in when the closure of Pratts which had grown from a Victorian draper's shop to a department store operated since the s by the John Lewis Partnership coincided with the opening of a large Sainsbury's supermarket half a mile south of the town centre replacing an existing smaller Sainbury's store opposite Streatham Hill railway station
Several recent additions such as Argos Lidl and Peacocks are located in new retail spaces on the site of Pratt's but in common with other high streets retail recovery has been slow and a substantial proportion of vacant space has been taken by a growing number of restaurants bars and coffee shops

In September Streatham High Road was voted the Worst Street in Britain in a poll organised by the BBC Today programme and CABE This largely reflected the dominance of through traffic along High Road

The poll was a catalyst for Lambeth London Borough Council and Transport for London's Street Management to co operate on a joint funding arrangement for further streetscape improvements which benefited the section of the High Road between St Leonard's and Streatham station and the stretch north of the Odeon as far as Woodbourne Avenue The section between Woodbourne Avenue and Streatham Hill station was not completed until Any further improvements north of Streatham Hill have been halted because of TfL's budgetary shortfall
