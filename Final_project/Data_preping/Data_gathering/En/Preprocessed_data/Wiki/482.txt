In Maron's assistant asked if he would be interested in interviewing Kevin McDonald to which Maron a fan of The Kids In The Hall comedy troupe agreed
On the day of the interview Maron was greeted by a publicist who said that her client would be arriving to promote his movie
Maron was surprised but thought little of it as he rarely does much research or preparation before interviews
When the interviewee arrived it was not Kids In The Hall comedian Kevin McDonald but instead Scottish film director Kevin MacDonald who Maron had never heard of
Since MacDonald had arrived early Maron excused himself then researched MacDonald and learned that he'd directed The Last King of Scotland which he had seen and Being Mick which he had heard of
Maron used this knowledge as a starting point for the conversation but the interview was shorter than a typical episode
Later Maron bumped into Kevin McDonald while they were both performing in Los Angeles and invited him to interview so it could be a second segment of the same episode
McDonald noted that he had never met the director but they were both represented by William Morris Agency and had been mixed up before including once by the Internal Revenue Service
