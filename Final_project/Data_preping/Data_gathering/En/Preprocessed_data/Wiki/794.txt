Under the terms of Article of the French constitution and the Organic Law on the statute of autonomy of French Polynesia politics of French Polynesia takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic French overseas collectivity whereby the President of French Polynesia is the head of government and of a multi-party system
Executive power is exercised by the government
Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of French Polynesia the territorial assembly
Political life in French Polynesia was marked by great instability from the mid s to the mid s
The anti-independence right-wing president of French Polynesia Gaston Flosse who had been in power since had supported the resumption of the French nuclear weapons tests in and had obtained from his longtime friend and political ally Jacques Chirac then president of France a status of expanded autonomy for French Polynesia in failed to secure an absolute majority in the French Polynesian legislative election resulting in deadlock at the Assembly of French Polynesia
Flosse's longtime opponent the pro-independence leader Oscar Temaru whose pro-independence coalition had won one less seat than Flosse's party in the Assembly was nonetheless elected president of French Polynesia by the Assembly in June thanks to the votes of two non-aligned Assembly members
This resulted in several years of political instability as neither the pro- nor the anti-independence camps were assured of a majority depending on the votes of smaller non-aligned parties representing the interests of the distant islands of French Polynesia as opposed to Tahiti
Temaru was toppled from the presidency of French Polynesia in October succeeded by Flosse who was toppled in March succeeded by Temaru again who was toppled in December succeeded by Gaston Tong Sang a close ally of Flosse
On September the pro-independence leader Oscar Temaru was elected president of French Polynesia for the third time in three years with of votes cast in the territorial assembly
He replaced former president Gaston Tong Sang opposed to independence who lost a no-confidence vote in the Assembly of French Polynesia on August after the longtime former president of French Polynesia Gaston Flosse hitherto opposed to independence sided with his long enemy Oscar Temaru to topple the government of Gaston Tong Sang
Oscar Temaru however had no stable majority in the Assembly of French Polynesia and new territorial elections were held in February to solve the political crisis
The party of Gaston Tong Sang won the territorial elections but that did not solve the political crisis the two minority parties of Oscar Temaru and Gaston Flosse who together had one more member in the territorial assembly than the political party of Gaston Tong Sang allied to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia
Gaston Flosse was then elected president of French Polynesia by the territorial assembly on February with the support of the pro-independence party led by Oscar Temaru while Oscar Temaru was elected speaker of the territorial assembly with the support of the anti-independence party led by Gaston Flosse
Many observers doubted that the alliance between the anti-independence Gaston Flosse and the pro-independence Oscar Temaru designed to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia could last very long
At the French municipal elections held in March several prominent mayors who were member of the Flosse-Temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of French Polynesia which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way Gaston Tong Sang whose party French Polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before had been prevented from becoming president of French Polynesia by the last minute alliance between Flosse and Temaru's parties
Eventually on April the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a constructive vote of no confidence in the territorial assembly when two members of the Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party
Tong Sang's majority in the territorial assembly was very narrow and he was toppled in February succeeded by Temaru supported again by Flosse
Oscar Temaru's return to power was brief as he fell out with Gaston Flosse and was toppled in November succeeded by Gaston Tong Sang
Tong Sang remained in power for a year and a half before being toppled in a vote of no confidence in April and succeeded by Temaru
Oscar Temaru's fifth stint as president of French Polynesia lasted two years during which he campaigned for the re-inscription of French Polynesia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories
Temaru lost the French Polynesian legislative election by a wide margin only two weeks before the United Nations re-registered French Polynesia on its list of non-self governing territories
This was interpreted by political analysts as a rejection by French Polynesian voters of Temaru's push for independence as well as the consequence of the socioeconomic crisis affecting French Polynesia after years of political instability and corruption scandals
Gaston Flosse whose anti-independence party was the big winner of the election succeeded Oscar Temaru as president of French Polynesia in May but he was removed from office in September due to a corruption conviction by France's highest court
Flosse was replaced as president of French Polynesia by his second-in-command in the anti-independence camp douard Fritch who was also Flosse's former son-in-law divorced from Flosse's daughter
Fritch fell out with Flosse in as both leaders were vying for control of the anti-independence camp and Fritch was excluded from Gaston Flosse's party in September before founding his own anti-independence party Tapura Huiraatira in February
His new party managed to keep a majority in the Assembly of French Polynesia and Fritch remained president of French Polynesia
Political stability has returned in French Polynesia since the split of the anti-independence camp in
Tapura Huiraatira won of the seats in the Assembly of French Polynesia at the French Polynesian legislative election defeating both Oscar Temaru's pro-independence party and Gaston Flosse's anti-independence party and douard Fritch was re-elected president of French Polynesia by the Assembly in May
By douard Fritch was the longest-serving president of French Polynesia since Gaston Flosse in the s and early s
Between and French Polynesia had the status of an overseas territory territoire d'outre-mer or TOM
In it became an overseas collectivity collectivit d'outre-mer or COM
Its statutory law of February gives it the particular designation of overseas country inside the Republic pays d'outre-mer au sein de la Rpublique or POM but without legal modification of its status
Despite a local assembly and government French Polynesia is not in a free association with France like the Cook Islands with New Zealand
As a French overseas collectivity the local government has no competence in justice university education security and defense
Services in these areas are directly provided and administered by the Government of France including the National Gendarmerie which also polices rural and border areas in metropolitan France and French military forces
The collectivity government retains control over primary and secondary education health town planning and the environment
The highest representative of the State in the territory is the High Commissioner of the Republic in French Polynesia French Haut commissaire de la Rpublique en Polynsie franaise
French Polynesia also sends three deputies to the French National Assembly in three constituencies the st representing Papeete and its north-eastern suburbs plus the commune municipality of Mo'orea-Mai'ao the Tuāmotu-Gambier administrative division and the Marquesas Islands administrative division the nd representing much of Tahiti outside Papeete and the Austral Islands administrative subdivision and the rd representing the Leeward Islands administrative subdivision and the south-western suburbs of Papeete
French Polynesia also sends two senators to the French Senate
The defence of the collectivity is the responsibility of the French Armed Forces
Just over military personnel are deployed in the territory centred on the Rgiment d'Infanterie de Marine du Pacifique along with modest air transport and surveillance assets
Three French Navy vessels are based in the territory including the surveillance frigate Prairial the patrol and support ship Bougainville and the coast guard vessel Arago
The islands of French Polynesia make up a total land area of square kilometres sq mi scattered over more than kilometres mi of ocean

French Polynesia is divided in five administrative subdivisions subdivisions administratives
Marquesas Islands French les les Marquises or officially la subdivision administrative des les Marquises
Leeward Islands French les les Sous-le-Vent or officially la subdivision administrative des les Sous-le-Vent the two subdivisions administratives Windward Islands and Leeward Islands are part of the Society Islands
Windward Islands French les les du Vent or officially la subdivision administrative des les du Vent the two subdivisions administratives Windward Islands and Leeward Islands are part of the Society Islands
Tuāmotu-Gambier French les les Tuamotu-Gambier or officially la subdivision administrative des les Tuamotu-Gambier the Tuamotus and the Gambier Islands
Austral Islands French les les Australes or officially la subdivision administrative des les Australes including the Bass IslandsThe five administrative subdivisions are not local councils they are solely deconcentrated subdivisions of the French central State
At the head of each administrative subdivision is an administrateur d'tat State administrator generally simply known as administrateur also sometimes called chef de la subdivision administrative head of the administrative subdivision
The administrateur is a civil servant under the authority of the High Commissioner of the French Republic in French Polynesia in Papeete
Four administrative subdivisions Marquesas Islands Leeward Islands Tuamotu-Gambier and Austral Islands each also form a deconcentrated subdivision of the government of French Polynesia
The head of a circonscription is the tavana hau known as administrateur territorial in French territorial administrator but the Tahitian title tavana hau is most often used
The tavana hau is the direct representative of the president of French Polynesia's government who appoints him or her
The Windward Islands due to their proximity to Papeete do not form a deconcentrated subdivision of the government of French Polynesia
The administrative subdivisions are themselves divided in communes
Like all other communes in the French Republic these are municipalities in which local residents with either a French or another EU citizenship elect a municipal council and a mayor in charge of managing local affairs within the commune
Municipal elections occur every six years on the same date as in the rest of the French Republic the last municipal elections took place in
communes are further subdivided in associated communes which have each a delegate mayor and a registry office
These communes were subdivided in associated communes either because they have a large land territory particularly in the larger islands such as Tahiti or Nuku Hiva or because they are made up of atolls distant from each other particularly in the Tuamotu archipelago which led to the creation of associated communes for each inhabited atoll
communes out of French Polynesia's communes have banded together in three separate communities of communes
These indirectly elected intercommunal councils are still relatively new in French Polynesia and unlike in metropolitan France and its overseas regions it is not mandatory for the communes in French Polynesia to join an intercommunal council
The three intercommunal councils in existence as of all formed on a voluntary basis were
community of communes of the Marquesas Islands in French communaut de communes des les Marquises or CODIM formed in by all the communes in the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas Islands
community of communes Hava'i in French communaut de communes Hava'i or CCH formed in by all the communes in the administrative subdivision of the Leeward Islands with the exception of Bora-Bora which preferred to remain separate for financial reasons
community of communes Terehēamanu in French communaut de communes Terehēamanu formed in by exurban and rural communes on the eastern side of the island of Tahiti Hitiaa O Te Ra Taiarapu-Est Taiarapu-Ouest Teva I Uta and PaparaThese communities of communes as elsewhere in the French Republic are not full-fledged territorial collectivities but only federations of communes
From a legal standpoint the only territorial collectivities in French Polynesia are the overseas collectivity of French Polynesia and the communes
At the census of the population of French Polynesia lived on the island of Tahiti alone
The urban area of Papeete the capital city has inhabitants census
At the census of people living in French Polynesia had been born there up from in had been born in Metropolitan France down from in were born elsewhere in overseas France down from in and were from foreign countries down from in
The population of natives of Metropolitan France living in French Polynesia has declined in relative terms since the s but in absolute terms their population peaked at the census when lived in French Polynesia not counting their children born there
With the local economic crisis their population declined to at the census and at the census
At the census the last census which asked questions regarding ethnicity of people were ethnically unmixed Polynesians were ethnically Polynesians with light European andor East Asian mixing were Europeans mostly French were people of mixed European and Polynesian descent the so-called Demis literally meaning Half and were East Asians mainly Chinese
Chinese Demis and the white populace are essentially concentrated on the island of Tahiti particularly in the urban area of Papeete where their share of the population is thus much greater than in French Polynesia overall
Despite a long history of ethnic mixing ethnic tensions have been growing in recent years with politicians using a xenophobic discourse and fanning the flame of nationalism
All the indigenous languages of French Polynesia are Polynesian
French Polynesia has been linguistically diverse since ancient times with each community having its own local speech variety
These dialects can be grouped into seven languages on the basis of mutual intelligibility Tahitian Tuamotuan Rapa Austral North Marquesan South Marquesan and Mangarevan
Some of these especially Tuamotuan are really dialect continua formed by a patchwork of different dialects
The distinction between languages and dialects is notoriously difficult to establish and so some authors may view two varieties as dialects of the same language while others may view them as distinct languages
In this way North and South Marquesan are often grouped together as a single Marquesan language and Rapa is often viewed as part of the Austral language
At the same time Ra'ivavae is often viewed as distinct from the Austral language
French is the sole official language of French Polynesia
An organic law of April states that French is the official language Tahitian and other Polynesian languages can be used At the census among the population whose age was and older of people reported that the language they spoke the most at home was French up from at the census reported that the language they spoke the most at home was Tahitian down from at the census reported Marquesan and the related Mangareva language same percentages for both at the census reported any of the Austral languages down from at the census reported Tuamotuan down from at the census reported a Chinese dialect of which was Hakka down from at the census and another language more than half of which was English down from at the census
At the same census of people whose age was or older reported that they could speak read and write French up from at the census whereas only reported that they had no knowledge of French down from at the census
of people whose age was or older reported that they had some form of knowledge of at least one Polynesian language up from at the census but down from at the census whereas reported that they had no knowledge of any of the Polynesian languages down from at the census but up from at the census

Christianity is the main religion of the islands

Data from revealed that Catholics were in the majority in the Tuamotu Islands Gambier Islands and the Marquesas Islands while Protestants formed the majority in the Austral Islands and several of the Society Islands such as Tahiti
This diversity is due to the fact that Protestant missionaries from England and the United States first came to one group of islands and after French colonisation the Catholic Church spread to several more scattered islands but also to the main island of Tahiti
