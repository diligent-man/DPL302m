in mathematics the leibniz formula for named after gottfried leibniz states that
displaystyle frac frac frac frac cdots frac pi
an alternating series
it is also called the madhava leibniz series as it is a special case of a more general series expansion for the inverse tangent function first discovered by the indian mathematician madhava of sangamagrama in the th century the specific case first published by leibniz around
the series for the inverse tangent function which is also known as gregory s series can be given by
arctan
displaystyle arctan x x frac x frac x frac x cdots
the leibniz formula for can be obtained by putting x into this series
it also is the dirichlet l series of the non principal dirichlet character of modulus evaluated at s and therefore the value of the dirichlet beta function
arctan

considering only the integral in the last term we have
displaystyle leq int frac x n x dx leq int x n dx frac n rightarrow text as n rightarrow infty
therefore by the squeeze theorem as n we are left with the leibniz series
displaystyle frac pi sum k infty frac k k
arctan

displaystyle z
displaystyle sum k infty k z k
converges uniformly therefore
arctan
displaystyle f z arctan z int z frac z dz sum n infty frac n n z n z
displaystyle f z
approaches
displaystyle f
so that it is continuous and converges uniformly the proof is complete
from leibniz s test
displaystyle sum n infty frac n n
converges also
displaystyle f z
approaches
displaystyle f
from within the stolz angle so from abel s theorem this is correct
leibniz s formula converges extremely slowly it exhibits sublinear convergence
calculating to correct decimal places using direct summation of the series requires about five billion terms because k for k
however the leibniz formula can be used to calculate to high precision hundreds of digits or more using various convergence acceleration techniques
for example the shanks transformation euler transform or van wijngaarden transformation which are general methods for alternating series can be applied effectively to the partial sums of the leibniz series
further combining terms pairwise gives the non alternating series
displaystyle frac pi sum n infty left frac n frac n right sum n infty frac n n
which can be evaluated to high precision from a small number of terms using richardson extrapolation or the euler maclaurin formula
this series can also be transformed into an integral by means of the abel plana formula and evaluated using techniques for numerical integration
if the series is truncated at the right time the decimal expansion of the approximation will agree with that of for many more digits except for isolated digits or digit groups
for example taking five million terms yields
displaystyle underline underline underline underline
where the underlined digits are wrong
the errors can in fact be predicted they are generated by the euler numbers en according to the asymptotic formula
displaystyle frac pi sum k frac n frac k k sim sum m infty frac e m n m
where n is an integer divisible by
if n is chosen to be a power of ten each term in the right sum becomes a finite decimal fraction
the formula is a special case of the boole summation formula for alternating series providing yet another example of a convergence acceleration technique that can be applied to the leibniz series
in jonathan borwein and mark limber used the first thousand euler numbers to calculate to decimal places with the leibniz formula
the leibniz formula can be interpreted as a dirichlet series using the unique non principal dirichlet character modulo
as with other dirichlet series this allows the infinite sum to be converted to an infinite product with one term for each prime number
such a product is called an euler product
it is
displaystyle begin aligned frac pi left prod p equiv pmod frac p p right left prod p equiv pmod frac p p right frac cdot frac cdot frac cdot frac cdot frac cdot frac cdot frac cdot frac cdot frac cdots end aligned
in this product each term is a superparticular ratio each numerator is an odd prime number and each denominator is the nearest multiple of to the numerator
