In mathematics the Leibniz formula for named after Gottfried Leibniz states that

an alternating series It is also called the Madhava Leibniz series as it is a special case of a more general series expansion for the inverse tangent function first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in the th century the specific case first published by Leibniz around The series for the inverse tangent function which is also known as Gregory's series can be given by

The Leibniz formula for can be obtained by putting x into this series
It also is the Dirichlet L series of the non principal Dirichlet character of modulus evaluated at s and therefore the value of the Dirichlet beta function

Considering only the integral in the last term we have

Therefore by the squeeze theorem as n we are left with the Leibniz series

so that it is continuous and converges uniformly the proof is complete From Leibniz's test
displaystyle sum n infty frac n n
from within the Stolz angle so from Abel's theorem this is correct
Leibniz's formula converges extremely slowly it exhibits sublinear convergence Calculating to correct decimal places using direct summation of the series requires about five billion terms because k for k
However the Leibniz formula can be used to calculate to high precision hundreds of digits or more using various convergence acceleration techniques For example the Shanks transformation Euler transform or Van Wijngaarden transformation which are general methods for alternating series can be applied effectively to the partial sums of the Leibniz series Further combining terms pairwise gives the non alternating series

which can be evaluated to high precision from a small number of terms using Richardson extrapolation or the Euler Maclaurin formula This series can also be transformed into an integral by means of the Abel Plana formula and evaluated using techniques for numerical integration
If the series is truncated at the right time the decimal expansion of the approximation will agree with that of for many more digits except for isolated digits or digit groups For example taking five million terms yields

where the underlined digits are wrong The errors can in fact be predicted they are generated by the Euler numbers En according to the asymptotic formula

where N is an integer divisible by If N is chosen to be a power of ten each term in the right sum becomes a finite decimal fraction The formula is a special case of the Boole summation formula for alternating series providing yet another example of a convergence acceleration technique that can be applied to the Leibniz series In Jonathan Borwein and Mark Limber used the first thousand Euler numbers to calculate to decimal places with the Leibniz formula
The Leibniz formula can be interpreted as a Dirichlet series using the unique non principal Dirichlet character modulo As with other Dirichlet series this allows the infinite sum to be converted to an infinite product with one term for each prime number Such a product is called an Euler product It is

In this product each term is a superparticular ratio each numerator is an odd prime number and each denominator is the nearest multiple of to the numerator
