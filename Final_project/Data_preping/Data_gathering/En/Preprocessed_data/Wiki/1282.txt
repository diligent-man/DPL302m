the mirror of simple souls is an early th century work of christian mysticism by marguerite porete dealing with the workings of divine love
written originally in old french at a time when latin was the prescribed language for religious literature it explores in poetry and prose the seven stages of annihilation the soul goes through on its path to oneness with god through love
enormously popular when written it fell foul of the church authorities who detecting elements of the antinomian heresy of the free spirit in its vision denounced it as full of errors and heresies burnt existing copies banned its circulation and executed porete herself
in spite of this the work was translated into several different languages around europe including english albeit not with porete s name attached
in fact porete was not identified as the author until
since then it has been seen increasingly as one of the seminal works of medieval spiritual literature and porete alongside mechthild of magdeburg and hadewijch can be seen as an exemplar of the love mysticism of the beguine movement
a th century manuscript of an english translation by m
n of the mirror was found by mr
herbert among a manuscript collection purchased for the british library in and was shown to evelyn underhill
other th century copies were subsequently found in the bodleian library and the library of st
john s college cambridge together with a latin version made in the late th century by richard methley of mount grace yorkshire
a printed edition was edited by clare kirchberger from those four manuscripts and published by burns oates and washbourne ltd publishers to the holy see in complete with nihil obstat and imprimatur
the translation by m
n included a number of glosses by him and divided the text into divisions and chapters
for the edition the medi val text was used but with spellings updated and occasional words replaced accompanied by footnotes with additional glosses
