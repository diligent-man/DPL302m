the greek civil war greek e o emf lios p lemos the civil war took place between to
it was mainly fought against the established kingdom of greece supported by the united kingdom and the united states
the kingdom won in the end
the losing opposition was governed by the communist party of greece kke and its military branch the democratic army of greece dse and the people s republic of the provisional democratic government
the rebels were supported by yugoslavia and the ussr
it began as a conflict between the communist dominated left wing resistance organization eam elas and loosely allied anti communist resistance forces and later escalated into a major civil war between the greek state and the communists
fighting resulted in the defeat of the dse by the hellenic army
the civil war resulted from a highly polarized struggle between left and right ideologies that started in
from each side targeted the power vacuum resulting from the end of axis occupation during world war ii
the struggle was the first proxy war of the cold war and represents the first example of cold war postwar involvement on the part of the allies in the internal affairs of a foreign country an implementation of kennan s containment policy in his long telegram
greece in the end was funded by the us through the truman doctrine and the marshall plan and joined nato while the insurgents were demoralized by the bitter split between the soviet union s joseph stalin who wanted to end the war and yugoslavia s josip broz tito who wanted it to continue
the first signs of the civil war occurred in to during the axis occupation of greece
with the greek government in exile unable to influence the situation at home various resistance groups of differing political affiliations emerged the dominant ones being the leftist national liberation front eam and its military branch the greek people s liberation army elas which was effectively controlled by the kke
starting in autumn friction between the eam and the other resistance groups resulted in scattered clashes which continued until spring when an agreement was reached forming a national unity government that included six eam affiliated ministers
the immediate prelude to the civil war took place in athens on december less than two months after the germans had retreated from the area
after an order to disarm leftists resigned from the government and called for resistance
a riot the dekemvriana erupted greek government gendarmes opened fire on a pro eam rally killing demonstrators and injuring dozens
the rally had been organised under the pretext of demonstrating against the perceived impunity of the collaborators and the general disarmament ultimatum signed by ronald scobie the british commander in greece
the battle lasted days and resulted in the defeat of the eam
the subsequent signing of the treaty of varkiza february spelled the end of the left wing organization s ascendancy the elas was partly disarmed while the eam soon after lost its multi party character to become dominated by the kke
the war erupted in when former elas partisans who had found shelter in their hideouts and were controlled by the kke organized the dse and its high command headquarters
the kke supported the endeavor deciding that there was no alternative way to act against the internationally recognized government formed after the elections which the kke had boycotted
the communists formed a provisional government in december and made the dse the military branch of this government
the neighboring communist states of albania yugoslavia and bulgaria offered logistical support to this provisional government especially to the forces operating in the north of greece
despite some setbacks that the government forces suffered from to they eventually won largely due to increased american aid the failure of the dse to attract sufficient recruits and the side effects of the tito stalin split of
the final victory of the western allied government forces led to greece s membership in nato and helped to define the ideological balance of power in the aegean sea for the entire cold war
the civil war also left greece with a strongly anti communist security arrangement which would lead to the establishment of the greek military junta of
while axis forces approached athens in april king george ii and his government escaped to egypt where they proclaimed a government in exile recognised by the uk but not by the soviet union
british prime minister winston churchill encouraged king george ii of greece to appoint a moderate cabinet
as a result only two of his ministers were previous members of the th of august regime under ioannis metaxas who had both seized power in a coup d tat with the blessing of the king and governed the country since august
nevertheless the exiled government s inability to influence affairs inside greece rendered it irrelevant in the minds of most greek people
at the same time the germans set up a collaborationist government in athens which lacked legitimacy and support
the puppet regime was further undermined when economic mismanagement in wartime conditions created runaway inflation acute food shortages and famine among the civilian population
the power vacuum that the occupation created was filled by several resistance movements that ranged from royalist to communist ideologies
resistance was born first in eastern macedonia and thrace where bulgarian troops occupied greek territory
soon large demonstrations were organized in many cities by the defenders of northern greece yve a patriotic organization
however the largest group to emerge was the national liberation front eam founded on september by representatives of four left wing parties
proclaiming that it followed the soviet policy of creating a broad united front against fascism eam won the support of many non communist patriots
these resistance groups launched attacks against the occupying powers and set up large espionage networks
the communist leaders of eam however had planned to dominate in postwar greece so usually by force they tried to take over or destroy the other greek resistance groups such as the destruction of national and social liberation ekka and the murder of its leader dimitrios psarros by elas partisans and undertaking a campaign of red terror
when liberation came in october greece was in a state of crisis which soon led to the outbreak of civil war
although controlled by the kke the organization had democratic republican rhetoric
its military wing the greek people s liberation army elas was founded in february
aris velouchiotis a member of kke s central committee was nominated chief kapetanios of the elas high command
the military chief stefanos sarafis was a colonel in the prewar greek army who had been dismissed during the metaxas regime for his views
the political chief of eam was vasilis samariniotis nom de guerre of andreas tzimas
the organization for the protection of the people s struggle opla was founded as eam s security militia operating mainly in the occupied cities and most particularly athens
a small greek people s liberation navy elan was created operating mostly around the ionian islands and some other coastal areas
other communist aligned organizations were present including the national liberation front nof composed mostly of slavic macedonians in the florina region
they would later play a critical role in the civil war
the two other large resistance movements were the national republican greek league edes led by republican former army officer colonel napoleon zervas and the social liberal ekka led by colonel dimitrios psarros
the greek landscape was favourable to guerrilla operations and by the axis forces and their collaborators were in control only of the main towns and connecting roads leaving the mountainous countryside to the resistance
eam elas in particular controlled most of the country s mountainous interior while edes was limited to epirus and ekka to eastern central greece
by early elas could call on nearly men under arms with another working as reserves or logistical support edes had roughly men and ekka had under men
to combat the rising influence of the eam and fearful of an eventual takeover after the german defeat in ioannis rallis the prime minister of the collaborationist government authorised the creation of paramilitary forces known as the security battalions
numbering at their peak in composed mostly of local fascists convicts sympathetic prisoners of war and forcibly impressed conscripts they operated under german command in nazi security warfare operations and soon achieved a reputation for brutality
eam elas edes and ekka were mutually suspicious and tensions were exacerbated as the end of the war became nearer and the question of the country s political future arose
the role of the british military mission in these events proved decisive
eam was by far the largest and most active group but was determined to achieve its own political goal to dominate postwar greece and its actions were not always directed against the axis powers
consequently british material support was directed mostly to the more reliable zervas who by had reversed his earlier anti monarchist stance
the western allies at first provided all resistance organisations with funds and equipment
however they gave special preference to elas which they saw as the most reliable partner and a formidable fighting force that would be able to create more problems for the axis than other resistance movements
as the end of the war approached the british foreign office fearing a possible communist upsurge observed with displeasure the transformation of elas into a large scale conventional army more and more out of allied control
after the september armistice with italy elas seized control of italian garrison weapons in the country
in response the western allies began to favor rival anti communist resistance groups
they provided them with ammunition supplies and logistical support as a way of balancing elas s increasing influence
in time the flow of weapons and funds to elas stopped altogether and rival edes received the bulk of the allied support
in mid the animosity between eam elas and the other movements erupted into armed conflict
the communists and eam accused edes of being traitors and collaborators and vice versa
other smaller groups such as ekka continued the anti occupation fight with sabotage and other actions
they declined to join the ranks of elas
while some organizations accepted assistance from the nazis in their operations against eam elas the great majority of the population refused any form of cooperation with the occupation authorities
by early after a british negotiated ceasefire the plaka agreement eam elas had destroyed ekka and confined edes to a small part of epirus where it could only play a marginal role in the rest of the war
its political network eam had reached about citizens around the country
by elas had the numerical advantage in armed fighters having more than men in arms and an extra working as reserves or logistical support personnel efedrikos elas
in contrast edes had around fighters and ekka around men
after the declaration of the formation of the security battalions kke and eam implemented a pre emptive policy of terror mainly in the peloponnese countryside areas close to garrisoned german units to ensure civilian allegiance
as the communist position strengthened so did the numbers of the security battalions with both sides engaged in skirmishes
the elas units were accused of what became known as the meligalas massacre
meligalas was the headquarters of a local security battalion unit that was given control of the wider area of messenia by the nazis
after a battle there between elas and the security battalions elas forces prevailed and the remaining forces of the collaborators were taken into custody
after the civil war ended postwar governments declared that members of the collaborationist units were massacred along with civilians by the communists however that number was not matched by the actual numbers of bodies found in the mass grave an old well in the area of executed security battalion and civilian prisoners
according to left wing sources civilian bodies found there could have been victims of the security battalions
as security battalions were replacing occupation forces in territories the germans could not enter they were accused of many instances of brutality against civilians and captured partisans and of the executions of prominent eam and kke members by hanging
in addition recruiting by both sides was controversial as the case of stefanos sarafis indicates
the soon to be military leader of elas sought to join the noncommunist resistance group commanded by kostopoulos in thessaly along with other former officers
on their way they were captured by an elas group with sarafis agreeing to join elas at gunpoint when all other officers who refused were killed
sarafis never admitted this incident and in his book on elas makes special reference to the letter that he sent all officers of the former greek army to join the ranks of eam elas
again numbers favored the eam organisation nearly officers of the pre war greek army joined the ranks of elas with the position of military leader and kapetanios
in march eam established the political committee of national liberation politiki epitropi ethnikis apeleftherosis or peea in effect a third greek government to rival those in athens and cairo to intensify the struggle against the conquerors
for full national liberation for the consolidation of the independence and integrity of our country
and for the annihilation of domestic fascism and armed traitor formations peea was dominated by but not composed exclusively of communists
the moderate aims of the peea known as the mountain government aroused support even among greeks in exile
in april the egypt based free greek forces many of them well disposed towards eam demanded for a government of national unity to be established based on peea principles to replace the government in exile as it had no political or other link with the occupied home country and that any pro fascist elements in the army be removed
the movement threatened allied unity angering great britain and the united states
british and greek troops loyal to the exiled government moved to suppress the peea
approximately greek soldiers and officers were disarmed and deported to prison camps
after the mutiny allied economic aid to the national liberation front almost stopped
later on through political screening of the officers the cairo government created the iii greek mountain brigade composed of staunchly anti communist personnel under the command of brigadier thrasyvoulos tsakalotos
in may representatives from all political parties and resistance groups came together at the lebanon conference under the leadership of georgios papandreou in hopes of forming a government of national unity
despite eam s accusations of collaboration made against all other greek resistance forces and charges against eam elas members of murders banditry and thievery the conference ended with an agreement the national contract for a government of national unity consisting of ministers to be eam members
the agreement was made possible by soviet directives to kke to avoid harming allied unity but did not resolve the problem of disarmament of resistance groups
by edes and elas each saw the other to be their great enemy
they both saw that the germans were going to be defeated and were a temporary threat
for the elas the british represented their major problem even while for the majority of greeks the british were their major hope for an end to the war
by the summer of it was obvious that the germans would soon withdraw from greece as soviet forces were advancing into romania and towards yugoslavia threatening to cut off the retreating germans
in september general fyodor tolbukhin s armies advanced into bulgaria forcing the resignation of the country s pro nazi government and the establishment of a pro communist regime while bulgarian troops withdrew from greek macedonia
the government in exile now led by prominent liberal george papandreou moved to italy in preparation for its return to greece
under the caserta agreement of september all resistance forces in greece were placed under the command of a british officer general ronald scobie
the western allies arrived in greece in october by which time the germans were in full retreat and most of greece s territory had already been liberated by greek partisans
on october british troops entered athens the only area still occupied by the germans and papandreou and his ministers followed six days later
the king stayed in cairo because papandreou had promised that the future of the monarchy would be decided by referendum
there was little to prevent the elas from taking full control of the country
with the german withdrawal elas units had taken control of the countryside and most cities
however they did not take full control because the kke leadership was instructed by the soviet union not to precipitate a crisis that could jeopardize allied unity and put stalin s larger postwar objectives at risk
the kke s leadership knew so but the elas s fighters and rank and file communists did not which became a source of conflict within both eam and elas
following stalin s instructions the kke s leadership tried to avoid a confrontation with the papandreou government
the majority of the elas members saw the western allies as liberators although some kke leaders such as andreas tzimas and aris velouchiotis did not trust them
tzimas was in touch with yugoslav communist leader josip broz tito and disagreed with elas s cooperation with the western allied forces
the issue of disarming the resistance organizations was a cause of friction between the papandreou government and its eam members
advised by british ambassador reginald leeper papandreou demanded the disarmament of all armed forces apart from the sacred band and the iii mountain brigade which had been formed following the suppression of the april egypt mutiny and the constitution of a national guard under government control
the communists believing that it would leave the elas defenseless against its opponents submitted an alternative plan of total and simultaneous disarmament but papandreou rejected it causing eam ministers to resign from the government on december
on december scobie issued a proclamation calling for the dissolution of elas
command of elas was kke s greatest source of strength and kke leader siantos decided that the demand for elas s dissolution must be resisted
tito s influence may have played some role in elas s resistance to disarmament
tito was outwardly loyal to stalin but had come to power through his own means and believed that communist greeks should do the same
his influence however had not prevented the eam leadership from putting its forces under scobie s command a couple of months earlier in accordance with the caserta agreement
in the meantime following georgios grivas s instructions organization x members had set up outposts in central athens and resisted eam for several days until british troops arrived as their leader had been promised
according to the caserta agreement all greek forces tactical and guerillas were under allied command
on december the greek government of national unity under papandreou and scobie the british head of the allied forces in greece announced an ultimatum for the general disarmament of all guerrilla forces by december excluding the tactical forces the rd greek mountain brigade and the sacred squadron and also a part of edes and elas that would be used if it was necessary in allied operations in crete and dodecanese against the remaining german army
as a result on december six ministers of the eam most of whom were kke members resigned from their positions in the national unity government
the eam called for a general strike and announced the reorganization of the central committee of elas its military wing
a demonstration forbidden by the government was organised by eam on december
the demonstration involved at least people marching in athens on panepistimiou street towards the syntagma square
british tanks along with police units had been scattered around the area blocking the way of the demonstrators
the shootings began when the marchers had arrived at the tomb of the unknown soldier above the syntagma square
they originated from the building of the general police headquarters from the parliament from the hotel grande bretagne where international observers had settled from other governmental buildings and from policemen on the street
among many testimonies n
farmakis a member of the organization x participating in the shootings described that he heard the head of the police angelos evert giving the order to open fire on the crowd
although there are no accounts hinting that the crowd indeed possessed guns the british commander christopher montague woodhouse insisted that it was uncertain whether the first shots were fired by the police or the demonstrators
a total of protesters were killed by the greek police that day and hundreds were injured
this signaled the beginning of the dekemvriana greek the december events a day period of full scale fighting in athens between eam fighters and smaller parts of elas and the forces of the british army and the government
at the beginning the government had only a few policemen and gendarmes some militia units the rd greek mountain brigade distinguished at the gothic line offensive in italy which however lacked heavy weapons and the royalist group organization x also known as chites which was accused by eam of collaborating with the nazis
consequently the british intervened in support of the government freely using artillery and aircraft as the battle approached its last stages
in the early morning hours of december elas reservists began operations in the athens piraeus area attacking grivas x forces
in the evening a peaceful demonstration by eam members cum funeral procession took place
government forces took no action but the procession was attacked by chites led by colonel grivas with over dead
on december papandreou gave his resignation to scobie who rejected it
by december was in control of most of athens and piraeus
the british outnumbered flew in the th indian infantry division from italy as emergency reinforcements
although the british were openly fighting against the eam in athens there were no such battles in the rest of greece
in certain cases such as volos some raf units even surrendered equipment to elas fighters
however the units of the elas in central greece and epirus attacked napoleon zervas s units of the edes forcing them to flee to the ionian islands
conflicts continued throughout december with the forces confronting the eam slowly gaining the upper hand
elas forces in the rest of greece did not attack the british
it seems that the elas preferred to avoid an armed confrontation with the british forces initially and later tried to reduce the conflict as much as possible although poor communication between its very independent units around the country might also have played a role
that might explain the simultaneous struggle against the british the largescale elas operations against trotskyists and other political dissidents in athens and the many contradictory decisions of eam leaders
also kke s leadership was supporting a doctrine of national unity while eminent members such as leonidas stringos theodoros makridis and even georgios siantos were creating revolutionary plans
even more curiously tito was both the kke s key sponsor and a key british ally owing his physical and political survival in to british assistance
this outbreak of fighting between allied forces and an anti german european resistance movement while the war in europe was still being fought was a serious political problem for churchill s coalition government of left and right
it caused much protest in the british press and the house of commons
to prove his peacemaking intentions to the public churchill went to athens on december to preside over a conference in which soviet representatives also participated to bring about a settlement
it failed because the eam elas demands were considered excessive and so rejected
the conference took place in the hotel grande bretagne
later it became known that there was a plan by eam to blow up the building aiming to kill the participants and the conference was finally cancelled
meanwhile the soviet union remained passive about developments in greece
true to their percentages agreement with britain relating to greece the soviet delegation in greece neither encouraged nor discouraged eam s ambitions as greece belonged to the british sphere of influence
the delegation s chief gained the nickname sphinx among local communist officers for not giving any clues about soviet intentions
pravda did not mention the clashes at all
it is speculated that stalin did not interfere because the soviet union would profit no matter the outcome
if eam rose to power he would gain a country of major strategic value
if not he could use british actions in greece to justify similar actions in countries in his own sphere of influence
by early january eam forces had lost the battle
despite churchill s intervention papandreou resigned and was replaced by general nikolaos plastiras
on january scobie agreed to a ceasefire in exchange for elas s withdrawal from its positions at patras and thessaloniki and its demobilisation in the peloponnese
despite the severe defeat elas continued to exist and the kke had an opportunity to reconsider its strategy
kke s defeat in was mainly political but the exaltation of terrorism in the whole country made a political settlement even more difficult
the hunting of collaborators was extended to people who were supporting the greek government
the brutal treatment by the organization for the protection of the people s struggle opla and other minor communist groups of supposed collaborators including policemen professors and priests during the events greatly increased anticommunist sentiment
in the area of ulen refineries hundreds of supposed collaborators were executed
in the village of feneos opla turned a nearby monastery into a concentration camp and killing ground for those they deemed reactionaries
it is believed that hundreds were killed
in addition several trotskyists had to leave the country in fear for their lives cornelius castoriadis fled to france
as a result of the fighting in athens most of the prominent noncommunists of eam left the organization and kke support declined sharply
after the ceasefire elas under the leadership of siantos left athens taking thousands of captives
in february the various greek parties signed the treaty of varkiza with the support of all the allies
it provided for the complete demobilisation of the elas and all other paramilitary groups amnesty for only political offenses a referendum on the monarchy and a general election to be held as soon as possible
the kke remained legal and its leader nikolaos zachariadis who returned from germany in april said that the kke s objective was now for a people s democracy to be achieved by peaceful means
there were dissenters such as former elas leader aris velouchiotis
the kke disavowed velouchiotis when he called on the veteran guerrillas to start a second struggle shortly afterwards he committed suicide surrounded by security forces
the treaty of varkiza transformed the kke s political defeat into a military one
the elas s existence was terminated
the amnesty was not comprehensive because many actions during the german occupation and the dekemvriana were classified as criminal exempting the perpetrators from the amnesty
thus the authorities captured approximately communists or ex elas members
as a result a number of veteran partisans hid their weapons in the mountains and of them escaped to yugoslavia although they were not encouraged by the kke leadership
between and anti communist forces allegedly killed about communist civilians and tortured many others
entire villages that had helped the partisans were attacked
the anti communist forces are claimed to have admitted that they were retaliating for their suffering under elas rule
the reign of white terror led many ex elas members to form self defense troops without any kke approval
kke soon reversed its former political position as relations between the soviet union and the western allies deteriorated
with the onset of the cold war communist parties everywhere moved to more militant positions
the change of political attitude and the choice to escalate the crisis derived primarily from the conclusion that regime subversion which had not been successful in december could now be achieved
the kke leadership decided in february after weighing domestic factors and the balkan and international situation to go forward with organization of a new armed struggle against the monarcho fascist regime the kke boycotted the march elections which were won by the monarchist united alignment of nationalists inomeni parataxis ethnikofronon the main member of which was konstantinos tsaldaris s people s party
a referendum in september favored the retention of the monarchy but the kke claimed that it had been rigged
king george returned to athens
the king s return to greece reinforced british influence in the country
nigel clive then a liaison officer to the greek government and later the head of the athens station of mi stated greece was a kind of british protectorate but the british ambassador was not a colonial governor
there were to be six changes of prime ministers within just two years an indication of the instability that would then characterise the country s political life
fighting resumed in march as a group of ex elas members attacked a police station in the village of litochoro killing the policemen the night before the elections
the next day the rizospastis the kke s official newspaper announced authorities and gangs fabricate alleged communist attacks
armed bands of elas veterans were then infiltrating greece through mountainous regions near the yugoslav and albanian borders they were now organized as the democratic army of greece dimokratikos stratos elladas dse under the command of elas veteran markos vafiadis known as general markos operating from a base in yugoslavia and sent by the kke to organize already existing troops
the yugoslav and albanian communist governments supported the dse fighters but the soviet union remained ambivalent
the kke kept an open line of communication with the soviet communist party and its leader nikos zachariadis had visited moscow on more than one occasion
by late the dse was able to deploy about partisans including in the peloponnese and other areas of greece
according to the dse its fighters resisted the reign of terror that right wing gangs conducted across greece
in the peloponnese especially local party officials headed by vangelis rogakos had established a plan long before the decision to go to guerrilla war under which the numbers of partisans operating in the mainland would be inversely proportional to the number of soldiers that the enemy would concentrate in the region
according to this study the dse iii division in the peloponnese numbered between and fighters in early
rural peasants were caught in the crossfire
when dse partisans entered a village asking for supplies citizens were supportive years previously eam could count on two million members across the whole country or did not resist
when government troops arrived at the same village citizens who had supplied the partisans were immediately denounced as communist sympathizers and usually imprisoned or exiled
in rural areas the government also used a strategy advised to them by us advisers of evacuating villages under the pretext that they were under direct threat of communist attack
this would deprive the partisans of supplies and recruits while simultaneously raising antipathy towards them
the greek army now numbered about men and was gradually being put on a more professional footing
the task of re equipping and training the army had been carried out by its fellow western allies
by early however britain which had spent million in greece since could no longer afford this burden u s
president harry s
truman announced that the united states would step in to support the government of greece against communist pressure
that began a long and troubled relationship between greece and the united states
for several decades to come the us ambassador advised the king on important issues such as the appointment of the prime minister
through the scale of fighting increased the dse launched large scale attacks on towns across northern epirus thessaly peloponnese and macedonia provoking the army into massive counteroffensives which met no opposition as the dse melted back into the mountains and its safe havens across the northern borders
in the peloponnese where general georgios stanotas was appointed area commander the dse suffered heavily with no way to escape to mainland greece
in general army morale was low and it would be some time before the support of the united states became apparent
in september however the kke s leadership decided to move from guerrilla tactics to fullscale conventional war despite the opposition of vafiadis
in december the kke announced the formation of a provisional democratic government with vafiadis as prime minister that led the athens government to ban the kke
no foreign government recognized this government
the new strategy led the dse into costly attempts to seize a major town as its seat of government and in december dse fighters were killed at a set battle around konitsa
at the same time the strategy forced the government to increase the size of the army
with control of the major cities the government cracked down on kke members and sympathizers many of whom were imprisoned on the island of makronisos
despite setbacks such as the fighting at konitsa the dse reached the height of its power in extending its operations to attica within km of athens
it drew on more than fighters both men and women and a network of sympathizers and informants in every village and suburb
among analysts emphasising the kke s perceived control and guidance by foreign powers such as ussr and yugoslavia some estimate that of the dse s fighters were slavic macedonians from greek macedonia
expanding their reasoning they conclude that given their important role in the battle kke changed its policy towards them
at the fifth plenum of kke on january a resolution was passed declaring that after kke s victory the slavic macedonians would find their national restoration within a united greek state
the alliance of the democratic army with the slav macedonians caused the official greek state propaganda to call the communist guerillas eamovulgari from eam plus bulgarians while the communists were calling their opponents monarchofasistes monarch fascists
the extent of such involvement remains contentious and unclear some emphasize that the kke had in total members or according to some sources immediately prior to december and that during the civil war elas fighters mostly kke members were imprisoned and were executed
supporters emphasise instead the dse s conduct of a war effort across the country aimed at a free and liberated greece from all protectors that will have all the nationalities working under one socialist state
dse divisions conducted guerrilla warfare across greece iii division with men in controlled of the peloponnese politically and militarily battalions named after elas formations were active in northwestern greece and in the islands of lesvos limnos ikaria samos creta evoia and the bulk of the ionian islands
advisers funds and equipment were now flooding into the country from western allies and under their guidance a series of major offensives were launched into the mountains of central greece
although the offensives did not achieve all their objectives they inflicted serious defeats on the dse
the removal of children by both sides was another highly emotive and contentious issue
about children were forcefully taken by the dse from territories they controlled to eastern bloc countries
many others were moved for protection to special camps inside greece an idea of queen frederica
the issue drew the attention of international public opinion and a united nations special committee issued a report stating that some children have in fact been forcibly removed
the communist leadership claimed that children were being gathered to be evacuated from greece at the request of popular organizations and parents
according to other researchers the greek government also followed a policy of displacement by adopting children of the guerrillas and placing them in indoctrination camps
according to kenneth spencer a un committee reported at that time queen frederica has already prepared special reform camps in greek islands for greek children according to the official kke story the provisional government issued a directive for the evacuation of all minors from to years old for protection from the war and problems linked to it as was stated clearly according to the decisions of the provisional government on march
according to non kke accounts the children were abducted to be indoctrinated as communist janissaries
several united nations general assembly resolutions appealed for the repatriation of children to their homes
after years more information regarding the children gradually emerged
many returned to greece between and with varied views and attitudes toward the communist faction
during the war more than children most with parents in the dse were also placed in child towns under the immediate control of queen frederika something especially emphasised by the left
after years some of these children given up for adoption to american families were retracing their family background in greece
the insurgents were demoralised by the bitter split between stalin and tito
in june the soviet union and its satellites broke off relations with tito
in one of the meetings held in the kremlin with yugoslav representatives during the soviet yugoslav crisis stalin stated his unqualified opposition to the greek uprising
stalin explained to the yugoslav delegation that the situation in greece has always been different from the one in yugoslavia because the us and britain would never permit greece to break off their lines of communication in the mediterranean
stalin used the word svernut russian for fold up to express what the greek communists should do
yugoslavia had been the greek communists main supporter from the years of the occupation
the kke thus had to choose between its loyalty to the soviet union and its relations with its closest ally
after some internal conflict the great majority led by party secretary nikolaos zachariadis chose to follow the soviet union
in january vafiadis himself was accused of titoism and removed from his political and military positions to be replaced by zachariadis
after a year of increasing acrimony tito closed the yugoslav border to the dse in july and disbanded its camps inside yugoslavia
the dse was still able to use albanian border territories a poor alternative
within the greek communist party the split with tito also sparked a witch hunt for titoites that demoralised and disorganised the ranks of the dse and sapped support for the kke in urban areas
in summer dse division iii in the peloponnese suffered a huge defeat
lacking ammunition support from dse headquarters and having failed to capture government ammunition depots at zacharo in the western peloponnese its fighters were doomed
the majority including the commander of the division vangelis rogakos were killed in battle with nearly national army troops
the national army s strategic plan codenamed peristera the greek word for dove bird was successful
a number of other civilians were sent to prison camps for helping communists
the peloponnese was now governed by paramilitary groups fighting alongside the national army
to terrify urban areas assisting dse s iii division the forces decapitated a number of dead fighters and placed them in central squares
following defeat in southern greece the dse continued to operate in northern greece and some islands but it was a greatly weakened force facing significant obstacles both politically and militarily
at the same time the national army found a talented commander in general alexander papagos commander of the greek army during the greco italian war
in august papagos launched a major counteroffensive against dse forces in northern greece codenamed operation pyrsos torch
the campaign was a victory for the national army and resulted in heavy losses for the dse
the dse army was now no longer able to sustain resistance in pitched battles
by september the main body of dse divisions defending grammos and vitsi the two key positions in northern greece for the dse had retreated to albania
two main groups remained within the borders trying to reconnect with scattered dse fighters largely in central greece
these groups numbering fighters left greece by the end of september
the main body of the dse accompanied by its hq after discussion with the communist party of the soviet union and other communist governments was moved to tashkent in the soviet union
they were to remain there in military encampments for three years
other older combatants alongside injured fighters women and children were relocated to european socialist states
on october zachariadis announced a temporary ceasefire to prevent the complete annihilation of greece the ceasefire marked the end of the greek civil war
almost elas fighters and communist sympathizers serving in dse ranks were imprisoned exiled or executed
that deprived the dse of the principal force still able to support its fight
according to some historians the kke s major supporter and supplier had always been tito and it was the rift between tito and the kke that marked the real demise of the party s efforts to assert power
western anti communist governments allied to greece saw the end of the greek civil war as a victory in the cold war against the soviet union
communists countered that the soviets never actively supported the greek communist efforts to seize power in greece
both sides had at differing junctures nevertheless looked to an external superpower for support
the civil war left greece in ruins and in even greater economic distress than it had been following the end of german occupation
additionally it divided the greek people for ensuing decades with both sides vilifying their opponents
thousands languished in prison for many years or were sent into internal exile on the islands of gyaros and makronisos
many others sought refuge in communist countries or emigrated to australia germany the us the uk canada and elsewhere
the polarization and instability of greek politics in the mid s was a direct result of the civil war and the deep divide between the leftist and rightist sections of greek society
a major crisis as a result was the murder of the left wing politician gregoris lambrakis in the inspiration for the costa gavras political thriller z
the crisis of the apostasia followed in together with the aspida affair which involved an alleged coup plot by a left wing group of officers the group s alleged leader was andreas papandreou son of george papandreou the leader of the center union political party and the country s prime minister at the time
on april a group of rightist and anti communist army officers executed a coup d tat and seized power from the government using the political instability and tension of the time as a pretext
the leader of the coup george papadopoulos was a member of the right wing military organization idea sacred bond of greek officers and the subsequent military regime later referred to as the regime of the colonels lasted until
after the collapse of the military junta a conservative government under constantine karamanlis led to the abolition of monarchy the legalization of the kke and a new constitution which guaranteed political freedoms individual rights and free elections
in in a major turning point in greek history the centre left government of the panhellenic socialist movement pasok allowed a number of dse veterans who had taken refuge in communist countries to return to greece and reestablish their former estates which greatly helped to diminish the consequences of the civil war in greek society
the pasok administration also offered state pensions to former partisans of the anti nazi resistance markos vafiadis was honorarily elected as member of the greek parliament under pasok s flag
in the coalition government between nea dimokratia and the coalition of left and progress synaspismos in which the kke was for a period the major force suggested a law that was passed unanimously by the greek parliament formally recognizing the war as a civil war and not merely as a communist insurgency symmoritopolemos
under the terms of this law the war of was recognized as a greek civil war between the national army and the democratic army of greece for the first time in greek postwar history
under the aforementioned law the term communist bandits kommounistosymmorites wherever it had occurred in greek law was replaced by the term fighters of the dse
in a gallup poll greeks were asked whether it was better that the right wing won the civil war
responded that it was better for greece that the right wing won responded that it would have been better if the left had won responded neither and did not respond
