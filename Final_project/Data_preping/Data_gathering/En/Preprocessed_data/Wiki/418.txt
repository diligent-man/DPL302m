one investor makes an offer to the founders of banh mi ma hai we will invest vnd billion us for of your equity
within a span of eight years nhut and hai have gone from selling on the streets to pulling in big investors
their business model has shown that sidewalks are not necessarily just a place to eke out a meager living but can produce million dollar businesses that attract investors as much as trendy start up tech companies do
the sidewalk economy is the unofficial name given to all business activities that occur on the streets and are categorized into three kinds retail storefront street vendor and fixed stall
nhut and hai s stall fell under the third kind but is now considered part of the formal economy
sidewalk millionaire
a brilliant year old graduate from hcmc s university of economics with an opportunity to work for a multinational company was how nhut might have been in
but despite warnings from his family he decided to begin his career on the sidewalk
he partnered with hai a senior of his at university to create the banh mi ma hai brand
nhut had more than years experience of helping his mother sell banh mi in his hometown an giang province
all the duo had when they started were eight carts in district and students looking to earn a small income by working for three hours every morning
they invested vnd million in each cart an amount they would go on to recover within two months after selling more than loaves of banh mi every day
theirs was the epitome of a small business in the informal economy no registration no company seal no labor contract and no taxes
they faced the problem all street vendors do they were not allowed to conduct business on the sidewalk
according to the law on road traffic streets and sidewalks are for use only for traffic purposes
street vendors and sidewalk stalls face fines
inevitably the urban order management team became an adversary of the two young entrepreneurs
every month without fail we would pay a fine at the ward office to get back our carts and then continue selling nhut recalls his first days in the business as he gradually became a familiar face to the district urban order management team
as one of the first banh mi street sellers with consistent branding nhut and hai had the vision to redefine street food and the sidewalk economy
but they realized their business lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the law
the urban order team was doing its job so of course i cannot complain nhut says
not only did they have to worry about fines but also had to deal with street gangs demanding protection money
knowing they would continue to harass him for more if he paid them once nhut refused to pay them anything
some unsavory gang members also came to hover around them
their intimidating aura meant customers no longer stopped by and the duo s workers were also reluctant to continue selling
they decided to give up that location and focused on selling near schools and offices
within a year the two young entrepreneurs had added carts to their fleet
with the number of employees climbing into the hundreds nhut and hai decided to formalize their business by registering a company
from running everything on their own they decided to switch to a franchising model to increase the scope
in some places local authorities urged them to take in poor franchisees to help them earn a living
nhut and hai s sidewalk banh mi business by now had a presence in over provinces with nearly carts providing jobs to thousands of people
communal economic area
though sidewalks have been buzzing with economic activity for more than years an official legal framework for conducting business on them has never existed says dr
nguyen vandang a specialist on public management from the ho chi minh national academy of politics
in a research article written by tran nguyen chan in when hcmc was saigon gia dinh it was pointed out that mobile business activities had cropped up all over the city
wherever there was a street there was a sidewalk economy it added
the french who ruled vietnam during this period tried to control this by passing laws on rightful orderly behavior in cities including banning street vendors and allowing police to confiscate anything sold on the sidewalks
against all odds the sidewalk economy has endured for over a century since becoming one of the most important aspects of the informal economy
official statistics related to it are lacking but a study done by the general statistics office of vietnam in estimated that street vendors and small personal businesses on sidewalks contributed of the country s gdp
dr dang points out that this economic contribution is what makes it difficult for authorities to deal with street vendors
they cannot recognize economic activities on the sidewalk since they go against the ostensible purpose of streets and sidewalks but they cannot get rid of them either due to the economic benefits they provide
most street vendors are not trained or well educated and so it is difficult for them to find jobs in a traditional workplace
the city based institute for development studies estimates there are street food vendors with nearly workers in hcmc
sidewalks are a refuge for many workers who have been laid off and nhut knows this better than almost anyone
the time when their banh mi business received the most interest from potential franchisees was two years ago after the peak of the covid pandemic passed
there was great interest again this year when companies laid off or furloughed workers amid falling demand for their products
for customers the sidewalk is a place where they can shop quickly conveniently and cheaply not to mention it is conveniently accessible to motorbikes the main mode of transportation in vietnam
for foreign tourists the bustle of activity they see on the sidewalks has become a unique feature of vietnamese culture
tom divers founder of the vietnam travel resource website coracle fell in love with the dynamic flow of life on the sidewalks when he first set foot in vietnam years ago
it was something he could never see in his native london in the uk
forget all the landmarks that they say you cannot miss street food is actually the most valuable tourism asset and the number one attraction for tourists in saigon he claims
whenever he invites his friends to hcmc he delights in taking them to dinner on a sidewalk and wander around the maze of alleys off su van hanh district van kiep or phan van han binh thanh district streets
it is a way to help strangers immerse in the identity of saigon he says
instead of trying to turn this city into singapore or seoul you should improve on its inherent identity
he cannot countenance a time when all the sidewalks are wiped clean of food and drinks stalls and if that day does come it will be a sad day indeed he says
hcmc will then lose its most valuable attraction and thousands of immigrant workers will lose their livelihoods he adds
legitimizing the sidewalk economy
the love that foreigners like divers have for street food and the ambition to grow that young entrepreneurs like nhut have are not enough to provide legitimacy to the sidewalk economy
reclaim sidewalks for pedestrians and clean up the sidewalks are some of the slogans used in campaigns for urban order
once the campaigns wrap up however everything returns to what it once was
the endurance of the sidewalk economy makes all efforts to wipe it out unsuccessful dr dang says
he emphasizes that all extreme solutions that abruptly deprive some citizens of their only livelihood are doomed to fail
this can even create a rift in society and deepen social inequality he warns
the government does not earn anything from this informal economic segment but yet has to spend large sums of money to mitigate possible repercussions such as traffic and food safety hazards and urban disorderliness
tran linh huan of the hcmc based university of law says the lack of management of the sidewalk economy means vendors have to pay unofficial fees to do business
a survey done by hcmc s university of social sciences and humanities in of more than street vendors in the downtown area found of saying that at least once they had faced problems like having to pay for protection stealing and disputes with other vendors
last month the hoc mon district police investigated two members of the urban order management team for allegedly confiscating vendors carts and then demanding bribes of vnd million
vietnam is not the only country that has to tackle the sidewalk economy
research done by prof nurul amin of the asian institute of technology in thailand found that many countries went through four stages in dealing with it prohibition restriction permission and support
dr du phuoc tan of the institute for development studies says hcmc entered the third stage in by allowing vendors to pay a fee to use the sidewalks on streets
but this cannot be implemented without the fees being spelled out unambiguously
thus when the law on fees and charges was passed in with many provisions that contradicted the decisions made by the city people s committee the policy hit a dead end
but with no intention of giving up the city plans to create a fee schedule for using sidewalks for doing business and plans to make a start at the beginning of next year
this is expected to fetch its coffers around vnd billion a year
according to dr dang with the sidewalk economy remaining an essential part of the economy this is a good solution
many cities in asia have legitimized the sidewalk economy
the bangkok metropolitan administration requires street vendors to register their business pay a monthly fee and only sell outside of rush hour in crowded areas so as to not affect the traffic
singapore has opted to build a number of hawker centers to manage this type of business
the vendors have to obtain a license from the authorities comply with food safety regulations and have a union to represent them
as soon as nhut learned of hcmc s new fee policy he planned on revamping his business model and developing a new product to seize this rare opportunity
once they pay the fee he and his partners can do their business all day instead of having to close before p m
like in the past
the sidewalk where two generations of nhut s family have been selling banh mi and where he went from having a few banh mi carts to running a million dollar business is on the verge of being acknowledged by the law
