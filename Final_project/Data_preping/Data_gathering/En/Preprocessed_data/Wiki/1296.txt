priests of the vedic religion are officiants of the yajna service
yajna is an important part of hinduism especially the vedas
persons trained for the ritual and proficient in its practice were called tvij regularly sacrificing
as members of a social class they were generically known as vipra sage or kavi seer
specialization of roles attended the elaboration and development of the ritual corpus over time
eventually a full complement of sixteen tvijas became the custom for major ceremonies
the sixteen consisted of four chief priests and their assistants
the older references uniformly indicate the writtiks and purohits then
hot as the presiding priest with perhaps only the adhvaryu as his assistant in the earliest times
the phrase seven hotars is found more than once in the rigveda
hymn of rigveda states it as follows
the above hymn enumerate the priests as the hot pot ne agn dh prash st meaning the maitr varuna and adhvaryu
the hot i was the reciter of invocations and litanies
these could consist of single verses ca strophes triples called t ca or pairs called prag tha or entire hymns sukta drawn from the gveda
as each phase of the ritual required an invocation the hot i had a leading or presiding role
the adhvaryu was in charge of the physical details of the sacrifice in particular the adhvara a term for the somayajna
according to monier williams the adhvaryu had to measure the ground to build the altar to prepare the sacrificial vessels to fetch wood and water to light the fire to bring the animal and immolate it among other duties
each action was accompanied by supplicative or benedictive formulas yajus drawn from the yajurveda
over time the role of the adhvaryu grew in importance and many verses of the gveda were incorporated either intact or adapted into the texts of the yajurveda
the udg t i was a chanter of hymns set to melodies s man drawn from the s maveda
this was a specialized role in the major soma sacrifices a characteristic function of the udg t was to sing hymns in praise of the invigorating properties of soma pavam na the freshly pressed juice of the soma plant
the brahman was the reciter of hymns from the atharvaveda who was largely silent and observes the procedures and uses atharvaveda mantras to heal it when mistakes have been made the term brahman in the above hymn refers to deity agni of hymn
the rgvedic brahmanas aitareya and kausitaki specify seven hotrakas to recite shastras litanies hot br hman cchamsin maitr varuna pot ne agn dh and acch v ka
they also carry a legend to explain the origin of the offices of the subrahmanya and the gr vastut
the requirements of the fully developed ritual were rigorous enough that only professional priests could perform them adequately
thus whereas in the earliest times the true sacrificer or intended beneficiary of the rite might have been a direct participant in vedic times he was only a sponsor the yajam na with the hot or brahman taking his stead in the ritual
in this seconding lay the origins of the growing importance of the purohita literally one who is placed in front
it was not unusual for a purohita to be the hot or brahman at a sacrifice for his master besides conducting other more domestic g hya rituals for him also
in latter days with the disappearance of vedic ritual practice purohita has become a generic term for priest
in the systematic expositions of the shrauta sutras which date to the fifth or sixth century bce the assistants are classified into four groups associated with each of the four chief priests although the classifications are artificial and in some cases incorrect

the maitr varuna

the unnet who pours the soma juice into the receptacles
with the brahman

the pot purifier comparison with the sacred texts of zoroastrianism a distinct religion with the same origins shows the antiquity of terms for priests such as atharwan vedic atharvan cognate to avestan rauuan a aurun and zhautar ved
hotar av
zaotar invoker sacrificer
while zhautar is well understood the original meaning of atharwan is unknown
the word atharvan appears in the rig veda e g in rv where agni is said to have been churned by atharvan from the mind of every poet
in the younger avesta rauuan a aurun appears in a context that suggests missionary perhaps by metathesis from indo iranian arthavan possessing purpose however a recent theory indicates that proto indo iranian atharwan likely represents a substrate word from the unknown language of the bmac civilization of central asia
it can be analyzed as bmac athar plus the indo iranian possessive suffix wan in which case atharwan would be one who possesses athar
though the meaning of athar is unknown pinault speculates that it meant superior force and connects it to the tocharian word for hero
in the upanishads atharvan appears for example in atharv ngiras a compound of atharvan and angiras either two eponymous rishis or their family names
in present day indian zoroastrian parsi tradition the word athornan is used to distinguish the priesthood from the laity the behdin
these subdivisions in the historical indian context castes and the terms used to describe them are relatively recent developments specific to indian zoroastrians and although the words themselves are old the meaning that they came to have for the parsis are influenced by their centuries long coexistence with hinduism
it appears then that the indian zoroastrian priests re adopted the older rauuan a aurun in preference to the traditional and very well attested derivative sron for its similarity to hinduism s atharvan which the parsi priests then additionally assumed was derived from avestan tar fire
this folk etymology may have been prompted by what is probably a mistaken assumption of the importance of fire in the ancient indo iranian religion
the division of priestly functions among the hotar the udgatar and the adhvaryu has been compared to the celtic priesthood as reported by strabo with the druids as high priests the bards doing the chanting and the vates performing the actual sacrifice
