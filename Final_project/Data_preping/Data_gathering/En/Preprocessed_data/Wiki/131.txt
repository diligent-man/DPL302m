Sport in the United Kingdom plays an important role in British culture In the infancy of many sports the Home Nations England Scotland Wales and Ireland formed among the earliest separate governing bodies national teams and domestic league competitions After some sports formed separate bodies for Northern Ireland though some continued to be organised on an all Ireland basis
In a small number of sports these teams are supplemented by high profile events featuring a combined team representing one or more nations
Overall association football attracts the most viewers and money though the nation is notable for the diversity of its sporting interests especially at the elite level Major individual sports include athletics cycling motorsport and horse racing Tennis is the highest profile sport for the two weeks of the Wimbledon Championships but otherwise struggles to hold its own in the country of its birth Snooker and darts too enjoy period profile boosts in line with the holding of their largest events Many other sports are also played and followed to a lesser degree There is much debate over which sport has the most active participants with swimming athletics and cycling all found to have wider active participation than association football in the Sport England Active People survey
Writing about has explained the role of Puritan power the English Civil War and the Restoration of the monarchy in England The Long Parliament in banned theatres which had met with Puritan disapproval Although similar action would be taken against certain sports it is not clear if cricket was in any way prohibited except that players must not break the Sabbath In the Restoration of the monarchy in England was immediately followed by the reopening of the theatres and so any sanctions that had been imposed by the Puritans on cricket would also have been lifted He goes on to make the key point that political social and economic conditions in the aftermath of the Restoration encouraged excessive gambling so much so that a Gambling Act was deemed necessary in It is certain that cricket horse racing and boxing ie prizefighting were financed by gambling interests Leech explains that it was the habit of cricket patrons all of whom were gamblers to form strong teams through the th century to represent their interests He defines a strong team as one representative of more than one parish and he is certain that such teams were first assembled in or immediately after Prior to the English Civil War and the Commonwealth all available evidence concludes that cricket had evolved to the level of village cricket where only teams that are strictly representative of individual parishes compete The strong teams of the post Restoration mark the evolution of cricket and indeed of professional team sport for cricket is the oldest professional team sport from the parish standard to the county standard This was the point of origin for major or first class cricket The year also marks the origin of professional team sports
Cricket had become well established among the English upper class in the th century and was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools Army units around the Empire had time on their hands and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition Most of the Empire embraced cricket with the exception of Canada Cricket test matches international began by the s the first and most famous rivalry is that between Australia and England for The Ashes
A number of the public schools such as Winchester and Eton introduced variants of football and other sports for their pupils These were described at the time as innocent and lawful certainly in comparison with the rougher rural games With urbanization in the th century the rural games moved to the new urban centres and came under the influence of the middle and upper classes The rules and regulations devised at English institutions began to be applied to the wider game with governing bodies in England being set up for a number of sports by the end of the th century The rising influence of the upper class also produced an emphasis on the amateur and the spirit of fair play The industrial revolution also brought with it increasing mobility and created the opportunity for universities in Britain and elsewhere to compete with one another This sparked increasing attempts to unify and reconcile various games in England leading to the establishment of the Football Association in London the first official governing body in football
For sports to become professionalized coaching had to come first It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by In the First World War military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale building teams
British Prime Minister John Major was the political leader most closely identified with promotion of sports In he argued
We invented the majority of the world's great sports th century Britain was the cradle of a leisure revolution every bit as significant as the agricultural and industrial revolutions we launched in the century beforeThe British showed a more profound interest in sports and in greater variety than any rival This was chiefly due to the development of the railway network in the UK before other nations Allowing for national newspapers and travel around the country far earlier than in other places They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world In some sports there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing New games became popular almost overnight including lawn tennis cycling and hockey Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones The aristocracy and landed gentry with their ironclad control over land rights dominated hunting shooting fishing and horse racing Many modern Olympic sports trace their roots back to Britain
Political responsibility for sport is a devolved matter As England has no parliament of its own the United Kingdom Department of Culture Media and Sport which is headed by a cabinet minister though the Minister for Sport and Tourism is not in the cabinet deals with English sport in addition to United Kingdom wide sports
Political responsibility for sport in Scotland lies with the Scottish government Minister for Sport and Health Improvement currently Jamie Hepburn though is part of the remit of the Cabinet secretary for Health Wellbeing and Sport currently Shona Robison
Political responsibility for sport in Wales lies with the Welsh Minister for Health Wellbeing and Sport currently Vaughan Gething The minister sets out the strategic policy objectives for Sport Wales which is responsible for the development and promotion of sport and active lifestyles in Wales Sport Wales work closely with the Governing bodies of sports in Wales to whom they distribute government and National Lottery funding through grants and awards

The Sport and Recreation Alliance is the representative body for sports organisations in the United Kingdom including federations players associations managers associations and regional organisations
A large majority of the funding for elite sport in the United Kingdom is commercially generated but this is concentrated heavily on a few sports For example the English Premier League's clubs had an estimated combined turnover of £ billion in according to Deloitte and British professional football's total income was in the region of £ billion Other major sports have a turnover in low nine figures or the tens of millions of pounds For example cricket is highly dependent on its TV contract which was worth £ million a year for the seasons
Athletics and also most sports outside the top ten or so in popularity are heavily dependent on public funding The government agency which funnels this is UK Sport which has affiliates in each of the home nations for example Sport England These agencies are also responsible for distributing money raised for sport by the National Lottery In when it was announced London would host the Games UK Sport announced funding plans which were more focused than ever before on rewarding sports which have delivered Olympic success and as a corollary penalising those which have not UK Sport also provides money for the recreational side of the main team sports even football
Other sports benefit from special financial provision British tennis is subsidised by the profits of the Wimbledon Championships which are in the tens of millions of pounds each year Horse racing benefits from a levy on betting
The British media is dominated by United Kingdom wide outlets with local media playing a much smaller role Traditionally the BBC played a dominant role in televising sport providing extensive high quality advertisement free coverage and free publicity in exchange for being granted broadcast rights for low fees ITV broadcast a smaller portfolio of events In the early s this arrangement was shaken up by the arrival of pay TV BSkyB based its early marketing largely on its acquisition of top division English league football which was renamed The Premiership as part of the deal It has subsequently acquired many more top rights in other sports However Sky tends to focus on competitions which can fill its specialist sports channels on a regular basis and many events are still shown on free to air television especially annual and quadrennial events such as Wimbledon and the Olympics Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own feeds for BBC and BBC allowing the BBC to opt out of the United Kingdom wide programming to show a match in that area This is often used when all four nations have an International football match on the same evening but can also be used to show minority interest sports in the country where they are most appreciated for example BBC One Scotland may show the shinty cup final while BBC One Wales shows a rugby union match between two Welsh sides In Scotland the BBC also operates BBC Alba a Gaelic language channel which often broadcasts Scottish sports fixtures
There are also regulations which prevent certain listed events from being sold exclusively to pay television In the Irish company Setanta Sports made a major move into the British market by paying £ million for rights to certain Scottish Premier League as well as one third of live Premier League matches for the three year period from summer to summer
Radio sports coverage is also important The BBC's Radio Five Live broadcasts almost all major sports events It now has a commercial rival called TalkSport but this has not acquired anywhere near as many exclusive contracts as Sky Sports BBC Local Radio also provides extensive coverage of sport giving more exposure to second tier clubs which get limited national coverage
The United Kingdom does not have an extant tradition of sports newspapers in the mould of L'Equipe Gazetta dello Sport and Marca although publications such as Bell's Life in London The Sporting Times and The Sportsman all featuring a particular emphasis on horse racing were popular during the th century and into the early th century whilst Sporting Life and the Sports Argus continued publication until the s and s and live on as a website and a supplement to the Birmingham Mail respectively All of the national newspapers except the Financial Times devote many pages to sport every day Local newspapers cover local clubs at all levels and there are hundreds of weekly and monthly sports magazines
Four sports in the United Kingdom operate high profile professional leagues Association football is the most popular sport and is played from August to May headed by the Premier League in England and the Scottish Premiership in Scotland Rugby league is traditionally a winter sport but since the late s the elite competition Super League has been played in the summer to minimise competition for attention with football Rugby union is also a winter sport with Premiership Rugby in England and the United Rugby Championship in Scotland Wales and Ireland being two of the three dominant leagues in the Northern Hemisphere Cricket is played in the Summer from April to September in a variety of formats by professional county teams under the auspices of the England and Wales Cricket Board while in Ireland and Scotland the franchise driven Euro T Slam is the only fully professional competition
There are also a number of semi professional leagues with a national footprint Ice Hockey operate a league in the United Kingdom called the Elite Ice Hockey League with at least one team in each of the four constituent countries Both men's and women's basketball leagues the British Basketball League and Women's British Basketball League operate on a professional basis in England and Scotland as does the premier netball competition the Netball Superleague in England
In Northern Ireland as in the rest of Ireland gaelic games enjoy significant support from the nationalist community although the players are mostly amateur Despite the amateur status major games involving county teams from Northern Ireland draw attendances comparable with both rugby codes and in the later stages of the All Ireland Senior Football Championship comparable with the largest Premier League teams
The modern global game of football evolved out of traditional football games played in England in the th century and today is the highest profile sport in the United Kingdom by a very wide margin This has been the case for generations but the gap is widely perceived to have increased since the early s and football's dominance is often seen as a threat to other sports Each of the four countries in the UK organises its own football leagues for both men and women there are however a few teams who play in another country
The only major national team competition won by a Home Nation is the World Cup which England hosted and won though clubs in both the Scottish and English domestic leagues have had success in European club competitions most notably the UEFA Champions League or its predecessor the European Cup Glasgow's Celtic won the European Cup becoming the first British team to do so with a team composed entirely of players born and raised within the local area around the club's stadium while the following year Manchester United became the first English club to win the competition years after the team had been the victim of a notorious air disaster in Munich while playing in the same competition Liverpool with wins is the most successful English and British team in European football while the competition has also been won by Manchester United times in total Nottingham Forest twice and Aston Villa from Birmingham and Chelsea from London once each Arsenal which now shares ownership with the men's club of the same name has won the UEFA Women's Champions League once

The Northern Ireland football league system includes the NIFL Premiership often known colloquially as the Irish League One Northern Irish club Derry City plays its football outside of the United Kingdom in the Republic of Ireland football league system Windsor Park Linfield FC's seater stadium is also the home stadium of the national team
Each season the most successful clubs from each of the home nations qualify for the four Europe wide club competitions organised by UEFA—the UEFA Champions League formerly the European Cup the UEFA Europa League formerly the UEFA Cup and starting with the season the UEFA Europa Conference League for men as well as the UEFA Women's Champions League England has produced winners of both the men's and women's Champions Leagues and Scotland has produced a winner of the men's version Linfield of Belfast's run to the European Cup quarter final is the furthest any Northern Irish or Welsh team has reach in the premier European men's competition Historically Welsh men's clubs were able to qualify for the now defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by winning the Welsh Cup a number of Welsh teams enjoyed runs into the latter stages of the competition with Cardiff City going furthest by reaching the semi finals of the tournament in
For years until England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland competed annually in the British Home Championship but these ended for a variety of reasons saw the inaugural Nations cup in many ways a reboot of the old tournament When the idea was first proposed to bring back the competition the English FA had reservations and so it was contested by the other three home nations and the Republic of Ireland who were the first host nation and winners The tournament was intended to be played biennially to prevent fixture congestion during World Cup qualification years with the event to be held at the Millennium stadium in Cardiff the tournament was cancelled after the first year as very few fans were prepared to travel and the tournament did not create the expected revenues Scotland and Wales were drawn against each other in World Cup qualification anyway and a th anniversary friendly was organised between Scotland and England to celebrate the anniversary of the formation of the English FA
No United Kingdom national team is regularly formed for football events in the Olympics Proposals to have the United Kingdom designated by the IOC as Great Britain take part in the Summer Olympics with men's and women's teams were not supported by the Scottish Welsh and Northern Irish football associations The three bodies feared that Great Britain teams would undermine their independent status—a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter England has been the most successful of the home nations winning the World Cup on home soil in although there has historically been a close fought rivalry between England and Scotland
The early reference to the separate national identities in the United Kingdom is perhaps best illustrated by the game of cricket Cricket is claimed to have been invented in England The national sport of England is cricket but England has no team of its own instead fielding a joint team with Wales The England cricket team controlled by the England and Wales Cricket Board commonly shortened to just England and ECB respectively was the only national team in the United Kingdom with Test status until Ireland which represents both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland received Test status in June Each summer two foreign national teams visit and play seven Test matches and numerous One Day Internationals and in the British winter the team tours abroad The highest profile rival of the team is the Australian team with which it competes for The Ashes one of the most famous trophies in British sport
There are eighteen professional county clubs seventeen of them in England and one in Wales Each summer the county clubs compete in the first class County Championship which consists of two leagues of nine teams and in which matches are played over four days The same teams also play the one day National League a one day knock out competition called the Friends Provident Trophy and the short form Twenty Cup English cricket grounds include Lord's The Oval Headingley Old Trafford Edgbaston and Trent Bridge Cardiff's Sophia Gardens ground has also become increasingly popular in recent years Team members are drawn from the main county sides and include both English and Welsh players It is by no means equal to football in finance attendance or coverage but it has a high profile nonetheless It is probably the second most widely covered sport in England and third most widely covered sport in Wales and the fortunes of the England team are closely followed by many people who never attend a live game
Scotland and Ireland both have their own cricket teams but the game is neither as popular nor their teams as successful as the English and Welsh team Ireland did not receive Test status until and Scotland still does not have Test status Since Ireland did not play its first Test until Scotland still does not play Tests and both have only recently started to play in full One Day Internationals many Scots and Irish previously played in and captained the England and Wales side the current side for example includes Eoin Morgan a Dublin born cricketer who has represented Ireland against England at the Cricket World Cup and captained England against Ireland in
Like association football rugby union and rugby league both developed from traditional British football games in the th century Rugby football was codified in Dissatisfaction with the governance of the sport led in to a number of prominent clubs establishing what would become rugby league The estranged clubs based in mainly working class industrial regions of northern England had wished to be allowed to compensate their players for missing work to play matches but they had been opposed by those clubs that were predominantly middle class and often based in the south of the country Subsequently rugby league developed somewhat different rules For much of the th century there was considerable antagonism towards rugby league from rugby union One Member of Parliament described it as one of the longest and daftest grievances in history with anyone over the age of associated with rugby league being banned forever from rugby union This antagonism has abated since when rugby union's international governing body now known as World Rugby opened rugby union to professionalism
England Scotland Wales and Ireland Northern and The Republic combined all field separate teams and are collectively known as the Home Nations All four teams are among the top ten in global rugby union The Six Nations Championship played between the Home Nations Italy and France is the premier international tournament in the northern hemisphere The Triple Crown is awarded to any of the Home Nations who beats the other three in that tournament Games are also often played against the Southern Hemisphere quartet of South Africa Australia New Zealand and Argentina—as well as other rugby playing countries England won the Rugby World Cup the first victory in the competition by a British team or for that matter any Northern Hemisphere country and were runners up to Australia in and South Africa in both and the latter of which came after a convincing win against the All Blacks in England's semi final In Wales achieved a best of third place and in Scotland a best of fourth place Ireland has not progressed beyond the quarter finals England and Wales have both hosted the Rugby World Cup in conjunction with the other Home Nations In England hosted the Rugby World Cup however some games were played in Wales

Rugby union has a number of heartlands notably South Wales the Scottish Borders the English West Country London and the Midlands Rugby union is generally regarded as the national sport of Wales England organises its own national league in Premiership Rugby which launched the Premiership Rugby Cup in to replace the former Anglo Welsh Cup which had begun as an England only competition but included Welsh teams from until its demise in The other Home Nations now have a single professional league currently known as the United Rugby Championship that also includes teams from Italy and South Africa Attendances at club rugby in England have risen strongly since the sport went professional by contrast the professional era has had a traumatic effect on the traditional structure of club rugby in Wales and Scotland although the long established provincial structure in Ireland rebounded relatively successfully and attendances and successes there in domestic and European competition including the team based in Northern Ireland Ulster Rugby are comparable to the larger English clubs Following the regional model of Wales and Ireland Scotland also originally established four regional teams for North East South and West Scotland Due to the demographics of the country the Northern region was too vast for a single club to serve over twice the size of Wales but with only a quarter the population and the of the population who happened to live in the rugby loving borders were not enough to sustain the Southern franchise leaving just West and East There was some talk of the regions being redrawn with the North being divided in two and the South being absorbed into the West and East regions but two Italian sides instead took the vacated places and still later the competition added South African sides with two joining in and eventually being replaced by four different sides in

As the sport's worldwide governing body World Rugby is based in Dublin and is heavily dominated by the Home Nations there has never been a threat to the independence of each country's team and a joint team known as the British and Irish Lions will tour a Southern Hemisphere nation every four years The Lions games however do not compete in any major tournaments and will play local clubs as well as the host nation's First XV

A piece on the web outlet of US sports media giant ESPN explored why British basketball has so far failed to develop players to the degree of countries such as France Germany and Australia The first is the dominance of other sports especially football in the country's sporting culture A survey by Sport England found that basketball was the third most played sport among the age group in England just behind rugby union in numbers—but both sports combined have less than one third the participation of football Additionally a British sport journalist pointed out that football academies are really bad at letting players out of the system who aren't going to make it frequently keeping players until age or beyond an age at which they can reasonably be developed for top level basketball Another issue is politically related Basketball is not played in the elite fee paying secondary schools that produce a disproportionate share of the UK's political leaders Also several British basketball insiders have cited problems with the sport's governance within the UK with Kevin Routledge chairman of the BBL's Leicester Riders calling it shambolic and former NBA player John Amaechi saying British basketball is dominated by people who are well meaning but poorly skilled Funding is another issue The British government provided many sports including basketball with major funding in advance of the Olympics However Team GB was perceived as a failure in basketball with the women's team going winless and the men going though losing by only point to eventual silver medallists Spain As a result basketball's funding was dramatically cut The sport also currently lacks private funding with Amaechi claiming that many British BBL players are not paid living wages Finally until very recent years British players were reluctant to develop themselves in the more competitive leagues of continental Europe

Athletics does not have a very high profile in Britain on a week in week out basis but it leaps to prominence during major championships The level of attention received by successful British athletes is illustrated by the fact that athletes have won far more BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards than practitioners of any other sport The governing body of British Athletics is UK Athletics There are also semi independent athletics associations in each of the home nations
Over the last few decades British athletes have usually won between one and three gold medals at the Olympics the Games in London saw three British athletes win four golds single golds by Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford and two by Mo Farah while a further two golds were won in both by Farah who with four Olympic and six World titles is Great Britain's most successful track athlete Traditionally Britain was strongest in men's athletics especially middle distance running in which Roger Bannister Steve Ovett Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram were global stars but over the last years success has been achieved in a wide range of events and British women have closed the attainment gap on the men seeing particular success in heptathlon with major titles for Denise Lewis Katarina Johnson Thompson Louise Hazel and Kelly Sotherton However there remain serious concerns about the depth of the sport in Britain with the number of club athletes reportedly in decline In contrast recreational athletics especially running has enjoyed a boom under the Parkrun scheme
Two high profile annual athletics events organised in Great Britain are the London Marathon and the Great North Run which is a half marathon while the elite level Diamond League holds two events in the country the London Grand Prix commonly referred to as the Anniversary Games in reference to the Summer Olympics and the Birmingham Grand Prix The indoor counterpart to the Diamond League the IAAF World Indoor Tour also hold an event in the United Kingdom the Indoor Grand Prix which has alternated between Birmingham and Glasgow
The United Kingdom also has a significant recent record in hosting major athletics championships having hosted the Olympic Games the IAAF World Championships the World Indoor Championships in Athletics the European Athletics Indoor Championships and the Commonwealth Games between and Birmingham is due to host the athletic competition in the Commonwealth Games
The United Kingdom played a key role in the evolution of modern boxing with the codification of the rules of the sport known as the Queensberry Rules named after John Douglas th Marquess of Queensberry in Britain's first heavyweight world champion Bob Fitzsimmons made boxing history as the sport's first three division world champion Some of the best contemporary British boxers have included super middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe featherweight champion Naseem Hamed and heavyweight champions Lennox Lewis Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua Welshman Calzaghe's display against Jeff Lacy in prompted Lacy's trainer to state I have never seen a better performance than that in the world
British professional boxing offers some of the largest purses outside the United States to a few elite professional boxers who become nationally known British heavyweight contenders are especially popular but most British world champions have fought in the middle weight bracket The governing bodies of professional boxing are the British Boxing Board of Control and British Irish Boxing Authority It is generally felt that British professional boxing is in decline in the early years of the st century The reasons for this include the fact that football now offers a relatively large number of sportsmen the chance to make the sort of income traditionally only available to world boxing champions reducing the incentive for athletic youngsters to accept the greater risks of a boxing career the acquisition of the rights to most major fights by Sky Sports which means that fewer boxers become national figures than in the past and the knock the sport's credibility has taken from the multiplicity of title sanctioning bodies
Amateur boxing is governed by separate bodies in each home nation At Olympic World and European events home nation boxers with the exception of NIreland compete under the GB podium squad banner British amateurs have enjoyed success in international competition in recent years but unlike their counterparts boxing for the Irish Republic there's a tendency for them to turn professional early in their amateur career The amateur sport is steadily recovering from a decline that reached a peak in the late s with dramatic increases in boxer numbers driven by recent GB podium squad success most notably at the London Olympics Although Britain's top amateur boxers are household names and lauded by the general public the financial and commercial leverage that professional sports now have on televised media means amateur boxing rarely receives its fair share of TV coverage
Mixed martial arts MMA has come a huge way The sport was on the verge of being sent into oblivion in the early s but has since clawed its way back and become one of the most popular sports in the US
In Great Britain MMA failed to capitalise on this momentum and has not seen anywhere near the popularity levels MMA has received in USA It is hard to pinpoint the main reason why exactly this has happened The failure of MMA promoters to secure a substantial and locked TV deal until late last year The reluctance of broadcasting powerhouses BBC and Sky Sports to fully support the sport The stereotype of extreme violence that they have been unable to shake off All of these are valid reasons why MMA failed to capture the public's imagination
However things slowly started to change when Michael Bisping came onto the scene and won The Ultimate Fighter Bisping built UK MMA a bit quicker alongside Ross Pearson and James Wilks The winners of The Ultimate Fighter United States vs United Kingdom Michael Bisping coached Team UK opposing Dan Henderson who coached Team USA UK MMA is being pushed further with the likes of Dan Hardy Brad Pickett John Hathaway Jimi Manuwa Rosi Sexton plus many more including Northern Ireland's Norman Parke winner of The Ultimate Fighter The Smashes Lightweight tournament and Scotland's Joanne Calderwood who competed on The Ultimate Fighter A Champion Will Be Crowned
The UK host promotions such as Cage Warriors and BAMMA
It is now considered to be the fastest growing sport on the planet
UFC now have contract with BT Sport
Britain had limited success with cycle racing in the th century This has changed when the performance director of British Cycling Peter Keen formerly coach of Chris Boardman and later appointed in as performance director with UK Sport obtained lottery funding which helped cycling at both grass roots and at an elite level The first fruits of the programme were harvested in at that year's Summer Olympics Team GB took two bronzes a silver and a gold on the track backing up their success at the subsequent UCI Track Cycling World Championships on home ground in Manchester by winning five medals Progress was made in the Summer Olympics under Keen's successor Dave Brailsford where Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins won golds the first time the British team had won two golds in track cycling since whilst Great Britain won medals at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships seven of them gold and nine gold medals at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester The investment paid off in the Olympics British cyclists brought home gold medals in seven events most notably Chris Hoy who became the first British Olympian to win three golds at one Olympiad earning him a knighthood Other successes include Rebecca Romero and Victoria Pendleton
Success at road racing was also limited with the United Kingdom being the only major nation not to have a Tour de France champion until Bradley Wiggins' victory in the Tour de France This newfound British success continued with Chris Froome winning four of the next five Tours followed by Geraint Thomas taking victory in In addition to Wiggins Froome and Thomas other British riders to enjoy a level of success include Tom Simpson Barry Hoban Robert Millar Chris Boardman David Millar Mark Cavendish and Adam and Simon Yates Britain has had some success in women's cycle racing in producing road racing world champions including Beryl Burton Mandy Jones Lizzie Armistead and Nicole Cooke who won the Olympic road race title and the world championship in the same year in Emma Pooley won the world road time trial championship in
Because of the increasing interest in cycling a British UCI ProTeam Team Sky was formed for the cycling season Major names in the roster included the likes of Bradley Wiggins Edvald Boasson Hagen and the British men's Road Race champion Geraint Thomas
Cycle racing is organised by British Cycling who govern most cycling events in the United Kingdom and organise the national team Time trialling in England and Wales is organised by a separate body called Cycling Time Trials
The success of British Cycling and Team Sky has increased dramatically the popularity of the sport in the UK which has brought in more sponsors into the sport As well as Team Sky ONE Pro Cycling and NFTO are aiming to ride in the world's biggest races A lot of cyclists take part in the many sportives organized all over the country including the hugely popular Ride London event which Words such as MAMIL middle aged men in lycra have become part of popular culture
Modern competitive golf originated in Scotland In the early th century British golfers were the best in the world winning nearly all of the US Open championships before World War I American golfers later became dominant but Britain has continued to produce leading golfers with an especially strong period in the s and s There are usually more British golfers than others in the top of the Official World Golf Ranking relative to population that is to say more than a fifth as many Several British golfers have reached the world's top in the early s England's Lee Westwood ended Tiger Woods' five year reign atop the rankings in autumn In May fellow Englishman Luke Donald reached the top of the rankings and by the end of that year became the first golfer in history to top the money lists of both the PGA and European Tours in the same season Other British golfers to have appeared in the top in the st century are Paul Casey Ian Poulter and Justin Rose all from England and Rory McIlroy from Northern Ireland
Golf is the sixth most popular sport by participation in the United Kingdom The Open Championship which is played each July on a number of British golf courses on a rotating basis the majority of them in Scotland is the only men's major golf tournament which is played outside of the United States The most famous of these courses is St Andrews which is known as The Home of Golf The RA the governing body of golf outside the United States and Mexico is based in St Andrews Although The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland is the sport's home course the world's oldest golf course is actually Musselburgh Links' Old Golf Course The PGA European Tour is headquartered in England and the main European Tour plays more events in the United Kingdom than in any other country In international team competition the United Kingdom provides a large part of the European Ryder Cup team which has beaten the United States team in seven of the last eight events
Women's golf does not have as high a profile as the men's game but British players most notably Laura Davies have found success on both the Europe wide Ladies European Tour LET and the overwhelmingly dominant women's tour the LPGA Tour in the US Through the Women's British Open was the only event recognised as a major by both the LET and the US LPGA The other tournament recognised as a major by the LET The Evian Championship in France became an LPGA major in
Tennis is yet another sport which originated in the United Kingdom first originating in the city of Birmingham between and as a more open variant of the historical real tennis or Royal tennis often associated with the Tudor monarchy of Henry VIII of England However it has not flourished there in recent decades its profile is highly dependent on the Wimbledon Championships the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar After Fred Perry's Wimbledon win in no British man won the singles until Andy Murray from Scotland did so in No British woman has won at Wimbledon since Virginia Wade in In addition Perry's victory in the US National Championships predecessor to the modern US Open later in was the last for any British man in a Grand Slam singles event until Murray won the US Open in Wade remained the last British woman to win such an event until Emma Raducanu won the US Open The governing body of the sport is the Lawn Tennis Association LTA which invests the vast profits from the tournament in the game in the hope of producing British champions but a string of revamps of the coaching system have failed to raise the standard of LTA trained players The only British players of either sex to reach the world top in recent years are Greg Rusedski who learnt his tennis in Canada Tim Henman and Murray who did not pass through the LTA system either and on the women's side Anne Keothavong and the late Elena Baltacha both slipped into the world's top during their careers Outside of Wimbledon fortnight tennis's profile in Britain is low and since the retirement of Rusedski and Henman is now largely dependent on Murray the current UK number Very recently the rise of a number of other players notably doubles specialist Jamie Murray and younger top players Laura Robson Heather Watson Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund has been supplemented by the spectacular rise of British women's number one Johanna Konta from a position outside the top to the top ten in the world in just under eighteen months leading to October As a result Great Britain had a top ten ranked men's singles men's doubles and women's singles players at the same time for the first time ever More recently Raducanu's US Open win made her the first player of either sex to win a Grand Slam singles event as a qualifier in the Open era and elevated her into the world top she would finish the season in the top

Triathlon popularity continues to grow in the UK with membership to the British Triathlon Federation up since though numbers of participants are larger due to many people who swim bike or run also participating in triathlons One reason the popularity has increased domestically is due to the UK's strength at the international level with two gold and two bronze medals at the two most recent Olympic games and many wins on the international circuit Many races are held over the UK hosted by local clubs with about race entrants in The British Triathlon federation manages the GB team at both the elite and age group level with performance centre's in Bath Birmingham Cardiff Leeds London Loughborough Nottingham Stirling
Swimming is the largest participation sport in England according to Sport England It is larger than athletics cycling and football
The swimming organisations of the home countries formed an umbrella organisation called British Swimming in the year British Swimming concentrates on elite swimmers with podium potential Britain sends large teams to all the major international swimming events and enjoy some successes but it is not currently a leading swimming nation The sport's profile is highest during the Commonwealth Games when British swimmers have their best chance to win gold medals and during the Olympics The sport has a thriving club structure with competition at all levels
The provision of metre pools in the United Kingdom was very poor for a developed country with just as of early only two of which conformed to the full Olympic standard There are however far more metre short course pools and other sub Olympic size competition pools See List of Olympic size swimming pools in the United Kingdom
The number of m pools has now increased and there are full Olympic size pools including the London Aquatics Centre pool which is regarded as currently the best pool in the world
Other sports with loyal followings include snooker which is popular with television companies as it fills their schedules at a very low cost and also attracts good audiences However its popularity has waned somewhat since when nearly a third of the British population watched the conclusion of the celebrated Dennis Taylor versus Steve Davis World Championship final even though it ended after midnight All but two events on the professional snooker tour in are played in the United Kingdom and the World Championship has been played at The Crucible Theatre Sheffield since There are many amateur leagues set up across the country featuring team matches between snooker clubs

There are many other sports in which Britons compete sometimes with success but which do not receive much attention outside a small number of aficionados except during major events such as the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games or when a British athlete does something extraordinary such as breaking a world record Examples include judo gliding modern pentathlon figure skating and sailing
Thoroughbred racing which originated under Charles II of England as the sport of kings occupies a key place in British sport probably ranking in the top four or five sports in terms of media coverage There are sixty racecourses in Great Britain with annual racecourse attendance exceeding six million and roughly races being held across Britain and Ireland each year The sport in Great Britain is governed by the British Horseracing Authority The two racecourses in Northern Ireland are governed by Horse Racing Ireland which runs the sport on an All Ireland basis The town of Newmarket is considered the centre of English racing largely because of the famous Newmarket Racecourse
The two forms of horseracing in the United Kingdom are National Hunt which involves jumping over fences or hurdles and the more glamorous flat racing National Hunt is a winter sport and flat racing is a summer sport but the seasons are very long and they overlap In flat racing the three races which make up the Triple Crown are the Guineas The Derby and the St Leger Stakes Other leading flat races include the Guineas and The Oaks and these five races are collectively known as the Classics Apart from the meetings at which the aforementioned races are staged major flat racing meetings include Royal Ascot Glorious Goodwood and the Ebor Festival at York Racecourse The highlights of the National Hunt season are the Cheltenham Festival and the Aintree Grand National

After the Summer Olympics Great Britain was third in the all time Summer Olympic medal count ranked by gold medals although the majority of the medals are accounted for by some very large tallies in the first few Olympic Games British medal tallies for much of the post war period were generally considered disappointing but the Summer Olympics marked an upturn and this was sustained at the Summer Olympics when Great Britain finished tenth in the medal table and the where it finished fourth behind only China the US and Russia This was seen as a great success and there was a victory parade through the streets of London This trend continued in the Games in London Great Britain again finished fourth in the total medal table behind the US China and Russia but was third in the gold medal count behind the US and China In at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro Britain reached all time Olympic best by coming second in the medals table only being beaten by the USThe sports in which the British team has won most medals in recent Summer Olympics include rowing sailing cycling and athletics In addition to the Summer Olympics London hosted the Games in and
Winter sports only play a minor role in British sporting life because the winters are not cold enough for them to be practised out of doors very much Great Britain is not a leading nation at the Winter Olympics but has had a few successes in sports such as figure skating curling and bob skeleton A number of athletes represented Great Britain in the freestyle skiing discipline when it debuted at the Winter Olympics Snowboarder Jenny Jones made history at those Games as the first British competitor to win a medal in an event on snow when she took a bronze in the slopestyle competition Another British snowboarder Billy Morgan won a bronze medal in the big air competition in the Winter Olympics

Hampden Park Scotland football team the building is owned by Queen's Park but also contains the offices for Scotland's national team Also a football venue at the Summer Olympics
Windsor Park Northern Ireland football team and Linfield FC Owned by Linfield and rented to the Irish Football Association for national team matchesBritish football grounds are almost always football only facilities in which the spectators are close to the action Since the late s there has been a dramatic spurt of reconstruction and replacement of league grounds which is ongoing and the Premier League's facilities are among the best of any sports league As of early there are nearly all seater club grounds in England with a capacity of or more three in Scotland and two in Wales The largest is Manchester United's Old Trafford which has a capacity of over and the most recently built football stadia in the Premier League include the Emirates Stadium and the City of Manchester Stadium with the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium recently opened
English cricket grounds are smaller than the largest in some other countries especially India and Australia but the best of them have been modernised to a high standard and two new international grounds have been built in recent years The largest English cricket ground Lord's in London is internationally regarded as the home of cricket
Rugby union and rugby league clubs are generally poorer than their football counterparts Some clubs have good all seater grounds in the capacity range some have older grounds which are still partly terraced and others play in council owned joint use stadia eg the KCOM Stadium Some clubs rent stadia from football clubs In some cases union and league clubs share grounds one current example where this exists is in Salford
The United Kingdom has many world class golf courses which can accommodate crowds in the tens of thousands for tournaments The greatest concentration of these is in Scotland The Open Championship is always played over a links course the most famous venue being the Old Course at St Andrews on the east coast of Scotland The Belfry in the English Midlands has hosted the Ryder Cup more times than any other site Wentworth Club near London was once the only venue which hosted two European Tour events each season but it now hosts only one
The provision of athletics stadiums in the United Kingdom is very poor compared to most other developed countries The main reason for this is that it is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds which have not been forthcoming on a large scale The largest athletics stadium built in the United Kingdom between Second World War and the s the capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the Commonwealth Games was reconfigured for football only use after that event For many years the largest existing stadium was the seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield and London's largest athletics venue was Crystal Palace which has just permanent seats Both have since been superseded by the venue now known as London Stadium which was built as an seater for the Summer Olympics and became the new home of West Ham United FC in By the time West Ham moved in the capacity was reduced to and the track remained in place with movable seating added to allow optimal configurations for both athletics and football Since the retention of the track was a necessary condition for tenancy the Olympic Stadium won the right to host the IAAF World Championships
The Alexander Stadium in Birmingham is to be upgraded to a long term capacity of temporarily for the Commonwealth Games
There are horse racecourses in Great Britain with two more in Northern Ireland the sport is governed on an all Ireland basis The best of them are world class For example Ascot Racecourse was redeveloped in and at a cost of £ million

There are several outdoor velodromes for track cycle racing in the United Kingdom with Herne Hill in London being the only venue from the Olympics still in operation There are also five indoor velodromes one in Newport the seater Manchester Velodrome part of the National Cycling Centre that serves as the headquarters of British Cycling as well as the seater arena built as part of the Summer Olympics in London the seater venue built for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the seater Derby Velodrome which opened in
In the United Kingdom there is no indoor sport capable of attracting five figure attendances on a regular basis and this restricts the development of large indoor arenas Nonetheless a number of + seater arenas have been built in recent years and more are planned These facilities make most of their income from pop concerts but they occasionally stage boxing matches and other sporting events
The largest arena is The O Arena in London with a capacity of over surpassing the former leader the Manchester Evening News Arena in Manchester Most notably The O Arena has hosted the ATP Finals in men's tennis since and will continue to host the event through at least It also hosted the Final Four of the continent wide EuroLeague in basketball
The SSE Hydro in Glasgow with a capacity of was built for the Commonwealth Games and hosted the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships The National Ice Centre in Nottingham Odyssey Arena in Belfast and the Sheffield Arena all host ice hockey the largest being the Sheffield Arena which holds in the region of spectators
Several smaller arenas hosting ice hockey and basketball are found around the United Kingdom though these generally hold only a few thousand fans The largest arena in the basketball league is Glasgow's seater Commonwealth Arena also built for the Commonwealth Games
Apart from a couple of Oxbridge events student sport has a very low profile in the United Kingdom While universities have significant sports facilities there was no system of sports scholarships with tuition fees only being introduced in the late s However students who are elite standard competitors are eligible for funding from bodies such as UK Sport on the same basis as anyone else The university most focused on sports provision is Loughborough University Budding professionals in the traditionally working class team sports of football and rugby league rarely go to university Talented youngsters in the more middle class sports of cricket and rugby union are far more likely to attend university but their sports clubs usually play a greater role in developing their talent than their university coaches Some sports are attempting to adapt to new conditions in which a far higher proportion of British teenagers attend university than in the past notably cricket which has established several university centres of excellence
Sport is compulsory for all students up to the age of sixteen but the amount of time devoted to it is often small There are frequent complaints that state sector schools do too little to encourage sport and a healthy lifestyle In the s the government sold many schools sports fields to housing developers as such many older schools do not have outdoor facilities readily available
Sports culture is stronger in independent schools in the United Kingdom and these schools contribute disproportionate numbers of elite competitors in almost all sports with the exceptions of football rugby league boxing and possibly athletics
In addition to many of the aforementioned sports popular sports at junior level include netball and rounders both of which are played almost entirely by girls
The leading body for physical education in the United Kingdom is the Association for Physical Education
In the UK School Games was established by the Youth Sport Trust as an annual sporting competition for elite school age athletes in the United Kingdom and by was expanded to include nine sports over four days
