Tourism typically requires the tourist to feel engaged in a genuine experience of the location they are visiting According to Dean MacCannell tourism requires that the tourist can view the toured area as both authentic and different from their own lived experience By viewing the exotic tourists learn what they themselves are not that is they are un exotic or normal

The custom flourished from about until the advent of large scale rail transit in the s and generally followed a standard itinerary It was an educational opportunity and rite of passage Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent and from the second half of the th century some South American US and other overseas youth joined in The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier and Thomas Cook made the Cook's Tour a byword
The Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the th and th centuries In this period Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world Artists writers and travellers such as Goethe affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy France and Greece provide excellent examples For these reasons the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centers where upper class students could find rare examples of classic art and history

In he planned his first excursion abroad when he took a group from Leicester to Calais to coincide with the Paris Exhibition The following year he started his grand circular tours of Europe During the s he took parties to Switzerland Italy Egypt and the United States Cook established inclusive independent travel whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between and to try the excursion business for themselves

The developments in air transport infrastructure such as jumbo jets low cost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable A major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels The WHO estimated in that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time There have also been changes in lifestyle for example some retirement age people sustain year round tourism This is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor made package requested by the customer upon impulse
There have been a few setbacks in tourism such as the September attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as in Bali and several European cities Also on December a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake hit the Asian countries on the Indian Ocean including the Maldives Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists This together with the vast clean up operations stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time

This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism However increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist Increasingly organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people
Pro poor tourism which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development the issue has been addressed through small scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists Research by the Overseas Development Institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only or less far less in some cases ever reaches the poor successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain climbing in Tanzania and cultural tourism in Luang Prabang Laos There is also the possibility of pro poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world

This type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the city region This type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience Creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices An example of event tourism would be the music festival South by Southwest that is hosted in Austin Texas annually Every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform People are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which defines event tourism
Creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism since the early beginnings of tourism itself Its European roots date back to the time of the Grand Tour which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive educational experiences More recently creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education ATLAS have directed a number of projects for the European Commission including cultural and crafts tourism known as sustainable tourism They have defined creative tourism as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences
Meanwhile the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high profile organizations such as UNESCO who through the Creative Cities Network have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place UNESCO wrote in one of its documents 'Creative Tourism' involves more interaction in which the visitor has an educational emotional social and participative interaction with the place its living culture and the people who live there They feel like a citizen Saying so the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops classes and activities related to the culture of the destination
More recently creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development including the United Kingdom Austria France the Bahamas Jamaica Spain Italy New Zealand and South Korea

One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley as dark tourism This type of tourism involves visits to dark sites such as battlegrounds scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide for example concentration camps Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs
Philip Stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one's own death through the real death of others Erik H Cohen introduces the term populo sites to evidence the educational character of dark tourism Popular sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors Based on a study at Yad Vashem the Shoah Holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem a new term in populo is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in Europe but equally authentic It is argued that a dichotomy between authentic sites at the location of a tragedy and created sites elsewhere is insufficient Participants' evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject Implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed In this vein Peter Tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths which continue to impact our lives This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma
Victoria Mitchell et al suggest that dark tourism seems to be a heterogeneous discipline There is a great dispersion of definitions knowledge production and meanings revolving around the term In fact dark tourism practices vary in culture and time Qualitative speaking dark tourism experience is pretty different from leisure practices To fill the gap the existent definitions should be catalogued in sub categories to form an all encompassing model that expands the current understanding of dark tourism In consonance with this M Apleni et al argue dark tourism helps the industry not to be fragmented before the ongoing states of crises the activity often faces They cite the case of terrorism which paves the way for the construction of a new dark site Dark tourism plays a leading role not only in enhancing destination resilience but also in helping communities to deal with traumatic experiences
Social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation It includes youth hostels and low priced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations trade unions or in Communist times publicly owned enterprises In May at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria Walter Hunziker proposed the following definition Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services

Tourism security is a subdiscipline of tourist studies that explores the factors that affect the ontological security of tourists Risks are evaluated by their impact and nature Tourism security includes methodologies theories and techniques oriented to protect the organic image of tourist destinations Three academic waves are significant in tourism security risk perception theory disaster management and post disaster consumption
Andrew Spencer Peter Tarlow argue that tourism security is not an easy concept to define It includes a set of sub disciplines and global risks different in nature which cause different effects in the tourism industry The rise of tourism security and safety as a consolidated discipline coincides with the globalization and ultimate maturation of the industry worldwide Some threats include for example terrorist groups looking to destabilize governments affecting not only the local economies but killing foreign tourists to cause geopolitical tensions between delivery country and receiving tourist countries Today island destinations are more affected by terrorism and other global risks than other continent destinations
As a result of the late s recession international arrivals experienced a strong slowdown beginning in June Growth from to was only during the first eight months of This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry with negative growth in September and a growth in passenger traffic through September The hotel industry also reported a slowdown with room occupancy declining In worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by By the first quarter of real travel demand in the United States had fallen over six quarters While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the attacks the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen
However evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term Many people increasingly view vacations and travel as a necessity rather than a luxury and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some globally over with growth up to in emerging economies
In the COVID pandemic lock downs travel bans and a substantial reduction in passenger travel by air and sea contributed to a sharp decline in tourism activity
