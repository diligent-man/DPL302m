tourism is travel for pleasure or business also the theory and practice of touring the business of attracting accommodating and entertaining tourists and the business of operating tours
the world tourism organization defines tourism more generally in terms which go beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only as people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than hours business and other purposes
tourism can be domestic within the traveller s own country or international and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country s balance of payments
tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown the late s recession between the second half of and the end of and in consequence of the outbreak of the h n influenza virus but slowly recovered until the covid pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth
the united nations world tourism organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by to in leading to a potential loss of us trillion in international tourism receipts
globally international tourism receipts the travel item in balance of payments grew to us trillion billion in corresponding to an increase in real terms of from
international tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of billion tourists globally for the first time in emerging source markets such as china russia and brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade
global tourism accounts for c
of global greenhouse gas emissions
emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies
for this reason many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism in order to mitigate negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism
the united nations world tourism organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the sustainable development goals through programs like the international year for sustainable tourism for development in and programs like tourism for sdgs focusing on how sdg sdg and sdg implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy
the english language word tourist was used in and tourism in
these words derive from the word tour which comes from old english turian from old french torner from latin tornare to turn on a lathe which is itself from ancient greek tornos lathe in the league of nations defined a foreign tourist as someone traveling abroad for at least twenty four hours
its successor the united nations amended this definition in by including a maximum stay of six months
in hunziker and kraft defined tourism as the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non residents insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity in the tourism society of england s definition was tourism is the temporary short term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination
it includes movements for all purposes in the international association of scientific experts in tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home
in the united nations identified three forms of tourism in its recommendations on tourism statistics
domestic tourism involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
inbound tourism involving non residents traveling in the given country
outbound tourism involving residents traveling in another countryother groupings derived from the above grouping
national tourism a combination of domestic and outbound tourism
regional tourism a combination of domestic and inbound tourism
international tourism a combination of inbound and outbound tourismthe terms tourism and travel are sometimes used interchangeably
in this context travel has a similar definition to tourism but implies a more purposeful journey
the terms tourism and tourist are sometimes used pejoratively to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited
by contrast traveller is often used as a sign of distinction
the sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations
according to the world tourism organization a tourism product is
tourism product covers a wide variety of services including
accommodation services from low cost homestays to five star hotels
hospitality services including food and beverage serving centers
health care services like massage
all modes of transport its booking and rental
travel agencies guided tours and tourist guides
cultural services such as religious monuments museums and historical places
shoppingthe economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a country s current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around million a year
the habsburg family can be mentioned in central europe
according to estimates the habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of million euros per year for vienna alone
the tourist principle habsburg sells applies
tourism typically requires the tourist to feel engaged in a genuine experience of the location they are visiting
according to dean maccannell tourism requires that the tourist can view the toured area as both authentic and different from their own lived experience
by viewing the exotic tourists learn what they themselves are not that is they are un exotic or normal
according to maccannell all modern tourism experiences the authentic and exotic as developmentally inferior to the modern that is to the lived experience of the tourist
travel outside a person s local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes who at times travelled to distant parts of the world to see great buildings and works of art learn new languages experience new cultures enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines
as early as shulgi however kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travellers
travelling for pleasure can be seen in egypt as early on as bc
during the roman republic spas and coastal resorts such as baiae were popular among the rich
the roman upper class used to spend their free time on land or at sea and travelled to their villa urbana or villa maritima
numerous villas were located in campania around rome and in the northern part of the adriatic as in barcola near trieste
pausanias wrote his description of greece in the second century ad
in ancient china nobles sometimes made a point of visiting mount tai and on occasion all five sacred mountains
by the middle ages christianity and buddhism and islam had traditions of pilgrimage
chaucer s canterbury tales and wu cheng en s journey to the west remain classics of english and chinese literature
the th to th century song dynasty also saw secular travel writers such as su shi th century and fan chengda th century become popular in china
under the ming xu xiake continued the practice
in medieval italy francesco petrarch also wrote an allegorical account of his ascent of mount ventoux that praised the act of travelling and criticized frigida incuriositas cold lack of curiosity
the burgundian poet michault taillevent fr later composed his own horrified recollections of a trip through the jura mountains
modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the grand tour which was a traditional trip around europe especially germany and italy undertaken by mainly upper class european young men of means mainly from western and northern european countries
in the young prince of poland ladislaus sigismund vasa the eldest son of sigismund iii embarked on a journey across europe as was in custom among polish nobility
he travelled through territories of today s germany belgium the netherlands where he admired the siege of breda by spanish forces france switzerland to italy austria and the czech republic
it was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of italian opera in the polish lithuanian commonwealth
the custom flourished from about until the advent of large scale rail transit in the s and generally followed a standard itinerary
it was an educational opportunity and rite of passage
though primarily associated with the british nobility and wealthy landed gentry similar trips were made by wealthy young men of protestant northern european nations on the continent and from the second half of the th century some south american us and other overseas youth joined in
the tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier and thomas cook made the cook s tour a byword
the grand tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the th and th centuries
in this period johann joachim winckelmann s theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the european academic world
artists writers and travellers such as goethe affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which italy france and greece provide excellent examples
for these reasons the grand tour s main destinations were to those centers where upper class students could find rare examples of classic art and history
the new york times recently described the grand tour in this way
the primary value of the grand tour it was believed laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the renaissance and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the european continent
leisure travel was associated with the industrial revolution in the united kingdom the first european country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population
initially this applied to the owners of the machinery of production the economic oligarchy factory owners and traders
these comprised the new middle class
cox kings was the first official travel company to be formed in
the british origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names
in nice france one of the first and best established holiday resorts on the french riviera the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the promenade des anglais in many other historic resorts in continental europe old well established palace hotels have names like the hotel bristol hotel carlton or hotel majestic reflecting the dominance of english customers
a pioneer of the travel agency business thomas cook s idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the london road at kibworth
with the opening of the extended midland counties railway he arranged to take a group of temperance campaigners from leicester campbell street station to a rally in loughborough eleven miles km away
on july thomas cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person this included rail tickets and food for the journey
cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers as the railway tickets being legal contracts between company and passenger could not have been issued at his own price
this was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous unadvertised private excursion trains
during the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and sunday school children
in the midland counties railway company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him provided he found the passengers
this success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure taking a percentage of the railway fares
in he planned his first excursion abroad when he took a group from leicester to calais to coincide with the paris exhibition
the following year he started his grand circular tours of europe
during the s he took parties to switzerland italy egypt and the united states
cook established inclusive independent travel whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route
such was his success that the scottish railway companies withdrew their support between and to try the excursion business for themselves
the tourism industry as part of the service sector has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries
the manila declaration on world tourism of recognized its importance as an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social cultural educational and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations
tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists accounting as of for of the world s trade in services and as an invisible export for of overall exports of goods and services
it also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism
it is also claimed that travel broadens the mind
the hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services such as airlines cruise ships transits trains and taxicabs lodging including hotels hostels homestays resorts and renting out rooms and entertainment venues such as amusement parks restaurants casinos festivals shopping malls music venues and theatres
this is in addition to goods bought by tourists including souvenirs
on the flip side tourism can degrade people
and sour relationships between host and guest
the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a country s current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around million a year
the habsburg family can be mentioned in central europe
according to estimates the habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of million euros per year for vienna alone
the tourist principle habsburg sells applies
cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism
cultural tourism is one of the megatrends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales
as unesco is increasingly observing the cultural heritage is needed for tourism but also endangered by it
the icomos international cultural tourism charter from is already dealing with all of these problems
as a result of the tourist hazard for example the lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists
overtourism is an important buzzword in this area
furthermore the focus of unesco in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population
and there is intensive cooperation between unesco the united nations the united nations peacekeeping and blue shield international
there are extensive international and national considerations studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war
in particular it is also about training civilian and military personnel
but the involvement of the locals is particularly important
the founding president of blue shield international karl von habsburg summed it up with the words without the local community and without the local participants that would be completely impossible
cruising is a popular form of water tourism
leisure cruise ships were introduced by the peninsular oriental steam navigation company p o in sailing from southampton to destinations such as gibraltar malta and athens
in german businessman albert ballin sailed the ship augusta victoria from hamburg into the mediterranean sea
june saw the launching of the first purpose built cruise ship was prinzessin victoria luise built in hamburg for the hamburg america line
many leisure oriented tourists travel to seaside resorts on their nearest coast or further afield
coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter
academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre scheduled tours usually under the organization of tourism professionals
this form of tourism developed during the second half of the th century in the united kingdom and was pioneered by thomas cook
cook took advantage of europe s rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses in addition to longer holidays to continental europe india asia and the western hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers
by the s over tourists per year used thomas cook son
the relationship between tourism companies transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism
cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads
one contemporary form of mass tourism package tourism still incorporates the partnership between these three groups
travel developed during the early th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes
improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time
in continental europe early seaside resorts included heiligendamm founded in at the baltic sea being the first seaside resort ostend popularised by the people of brussels boulogne sur mer and deauville for the parisians taormina in sicily
in the united states the first seaside resorts in the european style were at atlantic city new jersey and long island new york
by the mid th century the mediterranean coast became the principal mass tourism destination
the s and s saw mass tourism play a major role in the spanish economic miracle
niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years each with its own adjective
many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics
others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage
examples of the more common niche tourism markets are
other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term destination in the descriptions such as destination weddings and terms such as location vacation
moritz switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the s hotel manager johannes badrutt invited some summer guests from england to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape thereby inaugurating a popular trend
it was however only in the s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the swiss ski resorts
even in winter up to one third of all guests depending on the location consist of non skiers
major ski resorts are located mostly in the various european countries e g
andorra austria bulgaria bosnia herzegovina croatia czech republic cyprus finland france germany greece iceland italy norway latvia lithuania poland romania serbia sweden slovakia slovenia spain switzerland turkey canada the united states e g
montana utah colorado california wyoming vermont new hampshire new york argentina new zealand japan south korea chile and lebanon
there has been an up trend in tourism over the last few decades especially in europe where international travel for short breaks is common
tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them
for example some people prefer simple beach vacations while others want more specialized holidays quieter resorts family oriented holidays or niche market targeted destination hotels
the developments in air transport infrastructure such as jumbo jets low cost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable
a major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels
the who estimated in that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time
there have also been changes in lifestyle for example some retirement age people sustain year round tourism
this is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services
some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor made package requested by the customer upon impulse
there have been a few setbacks in tourism such as the september attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as in bali and several european cities
also on december a tsunami caused by the indian ocean earthquake hit the asian countries on the indian ocean including the maldives
thousands of lives were lost including many tourists
this together with the vast clean up operations stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time
individual low price or even zero price overnight stays have become more popular in the s especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like couchsurfing and airbnb being established
there has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of gdp is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism as has occurred for instance in dubai
ecotourism also known as ecological tourism is responsible travel to fragile pristine and usually protected areas that strives to be low impact and often small scale
it helps educate the traveller provides funds for conservation directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights
take only memories and leave only footprints is a very common slogan in protected areas
tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior
volunteer tourism or voluntourism is growing as a largely western phenomenon with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities
wearing defines volunteer tourism as applying to those tourists who for various reasons volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society
vso was founded in the uk in and the us peace corps was subsequently founded in
these were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism
this form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism
however increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour and force unwilling host communities to adopt western initiatives while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist
increasingly organisations such as vso have been concerned with community centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people
pro poor tourism which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development the issue has been addressed through small scale projects in local communities and through attempts by ministries of tourism to attract large numbers of tourists
research by the overseas development institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists money to reach the poorest as only or less far less in some cases ever reaches the poor successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain climbing in tanzania and cultural tourism in luang prabang laos
there is also the possibility of pro poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world
recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis
recession tourism is defined by low cost and high value experiences taking place at once popular generic retreats
various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further
this concept is not widely used in tourism research
it is related to the short lived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation
when there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure particularly in southeast asia india sri lanka eastern europe cuba and canada where there are different regulatory regimes in relation to particular medical procedures e g
dentistry travelling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as medical tourism
educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment
brent w
ritchie publisher of managing educational tourism created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last years
in educational tourism the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture study tours or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment such as in the international practicum training program
in one impact was many exchange students traveled to america to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education
this type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the city region
this type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience
creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices
an example of event tourism would be the music festival south by southwest that is hosted in austin texas annually
every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform
people are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which defines event tourism
creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism since the early beginnings of tourism itself
its european roots date back to the time of the grand tour which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive educational experiences
more recently creative tourism has been given its own name by crispin raymond and greg richards who as members of the association for tourism and leisure education atlas have directed a number of projects for the european commission including cultural and crafts tourism known as sustainable tourism
they have defined creative tourism as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences
meanwhile the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high profile organizations such as unesco who through the creative cities network have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place
unesco wrote in one of its documents creative tourism involves more interaction in which the visitor has an educational emotional social and participative interaction with the place its living culture and the people who live there
they feel like a citizen saying so the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops classes and activities related to the culture of the destination
more recently creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit
several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development including the united kingdom austria france the bahamas jamaica spain italy new zealand and south korea
the growing interest of tourists in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism highlighting the intangible heritage craft workshops cooking classes etc and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure for example through the rent of halls and auditoriums
experiential travel or immersion travel is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry
it is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country city or particular place by connecting to its history people food and culture
the term experiential travel has been mentioned in publications since but it was not discovered as a meaningful market trend until much later
one emerging area of special interest has been identified by lennon and foley as dark tourism
this type of tourism involves visits to dark sites such as battlegrounds scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide for example concentration camps
its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs
philip stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one s own death through the real death of others
erik h cohen introduces the term populo sites to evidence the educational character of dark tourism
popular sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors
based on a study at yad vashem the shoah holocaust memorial museum in jerusalem a new term in populo is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell
learning about the shoah in jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in europe but equally authentic
it is argued that a dichotomy between authentic sites at the location of a tragedy and created sites elsewhere is insufficient
participants evaluations of seminars for european teachers at yad vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject
implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed
in this vein peter tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths which continue to impact our lives
this issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma
victoria mitchell et al
suggest that dark tourism seems to be a heterogeneous discipline
there is a great dispersion of definitions knowledge production and meanings revolving around the term
in fact dark tourism practices vary in culture and time
qualitative speaking dark tourism experience is pretty different from leisure practices
to fill the gap the existent definitions should be catalogued in sub categories to form an all encompassing model that expands the current understanding of dark tourism
in consonance with this m
apleni et al
argue dark tourism helps the industry not to be fragmented before the ongoing states of crises the activity often faces
they cite the case of terrorism which paves the way for the construction of a new dark site
dark tourism plays a leading role not only in enhancing destination resilience but also in helping communities to deal with traumatic experiences
social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation
it includes youth hostels and low priced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations trade unions or in communist times publicly owned enterprises
in may at the second congress of social tourism in austria walter hunziker proposed the following definition social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services
also known as tourism of doom or last chance tourism this emerging trend involves travelling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened such as the ice caps of mount kilimanjaro the melting glaciers of patagonia or the coral of the great barrier reef before it is too late
identified by travel trade magazine travel age west editor in chief kenneth shapiro in and later explored in the new york times this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise
some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming overpopulation or climate change
others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual s carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing
religious tourism in particular pilgrimage can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion
religious tourists may seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self identity in a positive manner
given this the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self identity or not
dna tourism also called ancestry tourism or heritage travel is tourism based on dna testing
these tourists visit their remote relatives or places where their ancestors came from or where their relatives reside based on the results of dna tests
dna testing became a growing trend in
the world tourism organization unwto forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of
with the advent of e commerce tourism products have become prominent traded items on the internet
tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries although tourism providers hotels airlines etc including small scale operators can sell their services directly
this has put pressure on intermediaries from both on line and traditional shops
it has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context
not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies
this is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future
there has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism with only the russian space agency providing transport to date
a report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion dollar market by
since the late s sports tourism has become increasingly popular
events such as rugby olympics commonwealth games and fifa world cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights hotels and excursions
tourism security is a subdiscipline of tourist studies that explores the factors that affect the ontological security of tourists
risks are evaluated by their impact and nature
tourism security includes methodologies theories and techniques oriented to protect the organic image of tourist destinations
three academic waves are significant in tourism security risk perception theory disaster management and post disaster consumption
andrew spencer peter tarlow argue that tourism security is not an easy concept to define
it includes a set of sub disciplines and global risks different in nature which cause different effects in the tourism industry
the rise of tourism security and safety as a consolidated discipline coincides with the globalization and ultimate maturation of the industry worldwide
some threats include for example terrorist groups looking to destabilize governments affecting not only the local economies but killing foreign tourists to cause geopolitical tensions between delivery country and receiving tourist countries
today island destinations are more affected by terrorism and other global risks than other continent destinations
as a result of the late s recession international arrivals experienced a strong slowdown beginning in june
growth from to was only during the first eight months of
this slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry with negative growth in september and a growth in passenger traffic through september
the hotel industry also reported a slowdown with room occupancy declining
in worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by
by the first quarter of real travel demand in the united states had fallen over six quarters
while this is considerably milder than what occurred after the attacks the decline was at twice the rate as real gdp has fallen
however evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term
many people increasingly view vacations and travel as a necessity rather than a luxury and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some globally over with growth up to in emerging economies
in the covid pandemic lock downs travel bans and a substantial reduction in passenger travel by air and sea contributed to a sharp decline in tourism activity
