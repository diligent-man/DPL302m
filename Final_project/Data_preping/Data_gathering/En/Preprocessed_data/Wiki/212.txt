australian author richard flanagan wrote a critique of literary awards saying national prizes are often a barometer of bourgeois bad taste he says juries can be influenced by vendettas paybacks and payoffs most judges are fair minded people
but hate conceit and jealousy are no less human attributes than wisdom judgment and knowledge book prizes will sometimes compete with one another and these goals don t always coincide with anointing the best winner
sometimes juries can t decide between two contentious books so they will compromise with a third inoffensive bland book
he says there are now so many awards and prizes it has diluted the prestige of being a prize winning book
flanagan clarifies he is not against literary awards but believes they should not be taken too seriously as a form of support for literary culture
