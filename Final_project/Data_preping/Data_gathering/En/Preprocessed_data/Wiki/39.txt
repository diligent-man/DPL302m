The Worshipful Company of Fletchers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London
Originally bowyers longbow makers and fletchers arrow makers comprised one organisation However in the fletchers petitioned the Lord Mayor to divide into their own Company leaving the bowyers to form the Worshipful Company of Bowyers
The trade of fletchers considering the development of more technologically advanced weapons has disappeared entirely The Company still remains however primarily as a charitable institution as do a majority of the Livery Companies
The Fletchers' Company ranks th in the order of precedence of the Livery Companies immediately below the bowyers Its motto is True and Sure
