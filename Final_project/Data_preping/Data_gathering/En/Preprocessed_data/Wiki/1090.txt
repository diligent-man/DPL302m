an intelligent virtual assistant iva or intelligent personal assistant ipa is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions
the term chatbot is sometimes used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically accessed by online chat
in some cases online chat programs are exclusively for entertainment purposes
some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices
users can ask their assistants questions control home automation devices and media playback via voice and manage other basic tasks such as email to do lists and calendars with verbal commands
a similar concept however with differences lays under the dialogue systems
as of the capabilities and usage of virtual assistants are expanding rapidly with new products entering the market and a strong emphasis on both email and voice user interfaces
apple and google have large installed bases of users on smartphones
microsoft has a large installed base of windows based personal computers smartphones and smart speakers
amazon has a large install base for smart speakers
conversica has over million engagements via its email and sms interface intelligent virtual assistants for business
now the virtual assistant does not refer only to a machine but a person whose primary job is to help his employer to do a specific online job virtually
most of time this person is residing in another part of the world
radio rex was the first voice activated toy released in
it was a wooden toy in the shape of a dog that would come out of its house when its name is called
in bell labs presented audrey the automatic digit recognition machine
it occupied a six foot high relay rack consumed substantial power had streams of cables and exhibited the myriad maintenance problems associated with complex vacuum tube circuitry
it could recognize the fundamental units of speech phonemes
it was limited to accurate recognition of digits spoken by designated talkers
it could therefore be used for voice dialing but in most cases push button dialing was cheaper and faster rather than speaking the consecutive digits
another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the ibm shoebox voice activated calculator presented to the general public during the seattle world s fair after its initial market launch in
this early computer developed almost years before the introduction of the first ibm personal computer in was able to recognize spoken words and the digits to
the first natural language processing computer program or the chatbot eliza was developed by mit professor joseph weizenbaum in the s
it was created to demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial
eliza used pattern matching and substitution methodology into scripted responses to simulate conversation which gave an illusion of understanding on the part of the program
weizenbaum s own secretary reportedly asked weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and eliza could have a real conversation
weizenbaum was surprised by this later writing i had not realized
that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people
this gave name to the eliza effect the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors that is anthropomorphisation a phenomenon present in human interactions with virtual assistants
the next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the s at the carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania with substantial support of the united states department of defense and its darpa agency funded five years of a speech understanding research program aiming to reach a minimum vocabulary of words
companies and academia including ibm carnegie mellon university cmu and stanford research institute took part in the program
the result was harpy it mastered about words the vocabulary of a three year old and it could understand sentences
it could process speech that followed pre programmed vocabulary pronunciation and grammar structures to determine which sequences of words made sense together and thus reducing speech recognition errors
in tangora was an upgrade of the shoebox it was a voice recognizing typewriter
named after the world s fastest typist at the time it had a vocabulary of words and used prediction to decide the most likely result based on what was said in the past
ibm s approach was based on a hidden markov model which adds statistics to digital signal processing techniques
the method makes it possible to predict the most likely phonemes to follow a given phoneme
still each speaker had to individually train the typewriter to recognize his or her voice and pause between each word
the s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with ibm philips and lernout hauspie fighting for customers
much later the market launch of the first smartphone ibm simon in laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today
in dragon s naturally speaking software could recognize and transcribe natural human speech without pauses between each word into a document at a rate of words per minute
a version of naturally speaking is still available for download and it is still used today for instance by many doctors in the us and the uk to document their medical records
in colloquis publicly launched smarterchild on platforms like aim and msn messenger
while entirely text based smarterchild was able to play games check the weather look up facts and converse with users to an extent
the first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was siri which was introduced as a feature of the iphone s on october
apple inc
developed siri following the acquisition of siri inc a spin off of sri international which is a research institute financed by darpa and the united states department of defense
its aim was to aid in tasks such as sending a text message making phone calls checking the weather or setting up an alarm
over time it has developed to provide restaurant recommendations search the internet and provide driving directions
in november amazon announced alexa alongside the echo
in april amazon released a service for building conversational interfaces for any type of virtual assistant or interface
virtual assistants work via
text including online chat especially in an instant messaging application or other application sms text e mail or other text based communication channel for example conversica s intelligent virtual assistants for business
voice for example with amazon alexa on the amazon echo device siri on an iphone or google assistant on google enabled android mobile devices
by taking and or uploading images as in the case of samsung bixby on the samsung galaxy s some virtual assistants are accessible via multiple methods such as google assistant via chat on the google allo and google messages app and via voice on google home smart speakers
virtual assistants use natural language processing nlp to match user text or voice input to executable commands
many continually learn using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning
some of these assistants like google assistant which contains google lens and samsung bixby also have the added ability to do image processing to recognize objects in the image to help the users get better results from the clicked images
to activate a virtual assistant using the voice a wake word might be used
this is a word or groups of words such as hey siri ok google or hey google alexa and hey microsoft
as virtual assistants become more popular there are increasing legal risks involved
virtual assistants may be integrated into many types of platforms or like amazon alexa across several of them
into devices like smart speakers such as amazon echo google home and apple homepod
in instant messaging applications on both smartphones and via the web e g
facebook s m virtual assistant on both facebook and facebook messenger apps or via the web
built into a mobile operating system os as are apple s siri on ios devices and blackberry assistant on blackberry devices or into a desktop os such as cortana on microsoft windows os
built into a smartphone independent of the os as is bixby on the samsung galaxy s and note
within instant messaging platforms assistants from specific organizations such as aeromexico s aerobot on facebook messenger or wechat secretary on wechat
within mobile apps from specific companies and other organizations such as dom from domino s pizza
in appliances cars and wearable technology
previous generations of virtual assistants often worked on websites such as alaska airlines ask jenn or on interactive voice response ivr systems such as american airlines ivr by nuance virtual assistants can provide a wide variety of services
these include
provide information such as weather facts from e g
wikipedia or imdb set an alarm make to do lists and shopping lists
play music from streaming services such as spotify and pandora play radio stations read audiobooks
play videos tv shows or movies on televisions streaming from e g
netflix
conversational commerce see below

complement and or replace customer service by humans
one report estimated that an automated online assistant produced a decrease in the work load for a human provided call centre conversational commerce is e commerce via various means of messaging including via voice assistants but also live chat on e commerce web sites live chat on messaging applications such as wechat facebook messenger and whatsapp and chatbots on messaging applications or web sites
a virtual assistant can work with customer support team of a business to provide x support to customers
it provides quick responses which enhances a customer s experience
amazon enables alexa skills and google actions essentially applications that run on the assistant platforms
virtual assistants have a variety of privacy concerns associated with them
features such as activation by voice pose a threat as such features requires the device to always be listening
modes of privacy such as the virtual security button have been proposed to create a multilayer authentication for virtual assistants
the privacy policy of google assistant is that it does not store the audio data without the user s permission but may store the conversation transcripts to personalise its experience
personalisation can be turned off in settings
if a user wants google assistant to store audio data they can go to voice audio activity vaa and turn on this feature
audio files are sent to cloud and used by google to improve the performance of google assistant but only if the vaa feature is turned on
the privacy policy of amazon s virtual assistant alexa states that it only listens to conversations when its wake word like alexa amazon echo is used
it starts recording the conversation after the call of a wake word and stops recording after seconds of silence
it sends the recorded conversation to the cloud
it is possible to delete the recording from the cloud by visiting alexa privacy in alexa
apple states that it does not record audio to improve siri
instead it uses transcripts
transcript data is only sent if it is deemed important for analysis
users can opt out anytime if they don t want siri to send the transcripts in the cloud
added value of the virtual assistants can come among others from the following
voice communication can sometimes represent the optimal man machine communication it is convenient there are some sectors where voice is the only way of possible communication and more generally it allows to free up both hands and vision potentially for doing another activity in parallel or helps also disabled people
it is faster voice is more efficient than writing on a keyboard we can speak up to words per minute opposed to in case of writing on a keyboard
it is also more natural thus requiring less effort reading a text however can reach words per minute virtual assistants save a lot of time by automation they can take appointments or read the news while the consumer does something else
it is also possible to ask the virtual assistant to schedule meetings hence helping to organize time
the designers of new digital schedulers explained the ambition they had that these calendars schedule lives to make the consumer use his time more efficiently through machine learning processes and complete organization of work time and free time
as an example when the consumer expresses the desire of scheduling a break the va will schedule it at an optimal moment for this purpose for example at a time of the week where they are less productive with the additional long term objective of being able to schedule and organize the free time of the consumer to assure them optimal work efficiency according to a recent study the two reasons for using virtual assistants for consumers are perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment
the first result of this study is that both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have an equivalent very strong influence for the consumer willingness to use a virtual assistant
the second result of this study is that provided content quality has a very strong influence on perceived usefulness and a strong influence on perceived enjoyment
visual attractiveness has a very strong influence on perceived enjoyment
automation has a strong influence on perceived usefulness virtual assistants spur the filter bubble as for social media virtual assistants algorithms are trained to show pertinent data and discard others based on previous activities of the consumer the pertinent data is the one which will interest or please the consumer
as a result they become isolated from data that disagrees with their viewpoints effectively isolating them into their own intellectual bubble and reinforcing their opinions
this phenomenon was known to reinforce fake news and echo chambers
virtual assistants are also sometimes criticized for being overrated
in particular a
casilli points out that the ai of virtual assistants are neither intelligent nor artificial for two reasons not intelligent because all they do is being the assistant of the human and only by doing tasks that a human could do easily and in a very limited specter of actions find class and present information offers or documents
also virtual assistants are neither able to make decisions on their own nor to anticipate things
and not artificial because they would be impossible without human labelization through micro working in antonio a
casilli a french sociologist criticized artificial intelligence and virtual assistants in particular in the following way
at a first level the fact that the consumer provides free data for the training and improvement of the virtual assistant often without knowing it is ethically disturbing
but at a second level it might be even more ethically disturbing to know how these ais are trained with this data
this artificial intelligence is trained via neural networks which require a huge amount of labelled data
however this data needs to be labelled through a human process which explains the rise of microwork in the last decade
that is remotely using some people worldwide doing some repetitive and very simple tasks for a few cents such as listening to virtual assistant speech data and writing down what was said
microwork has been criticized for the job insecurity it causes and for the total lack of regulation the average salary was dollar hour in and it provides neither healthcare nor retirement benefits sick pay minimum wage
hence virtual assistants and their designers are controversial for spurring job insecurity and the ais they propose are still human in the way that they would be impossible without the microwork of millions of human workers
privacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of virtual assistants in unencrypted form and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner
additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech a user s manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity personality traits body shape physical and mental health condition sex gender moods and emotions socioeconomic status and geographical origin
notable developer platforms for virtual assistants include
amazon lex was opened to developers in april
it involves natural language understanding technology combined with automatic speech recognition and had been introduced in november
google provides the actions on google and dialogflow platforms for developers to create actions for google assistant
apple provides sirikit for developers to create extensions for siri
ibm s watson while sometimes spoken of as a virtual assistant is in fact an entire artificial intelligence platform and community powering some virtual assistants chatbots
and many other types of solutions in previous generations of text chat based virtual assistants the assistant was often represented by an avatar a k a
interactive online character or automated character this was known as an embodied agent
digital experiences enabled by virtual assistants are considered to be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends
experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a status weight comparable to real experiences if not become more sought after and prized
the trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants
in mid the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around bn worldwide
in addition it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications but present across many industry sectors incl
automotive telecommunications retail healthcare and education
in response to the significant r d expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a cagr of globally over the period of to and thereby surpass a global market size of us billion by
according to an ovum study the native digital assistant installed base is projected to exceed the world s population by with billion active voice ai capable devices
according to ovum by that time google assistant will dominate the voice ai capable device market with market share followed by samsung s bixby apple s siri amazon s alexa and microsoft s cortana
taking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders north american companies e g
nuance communications ibm egain are expected to dominate the industry over the next years due to the significant impact of byod bring your own device and enterprise mobility business models
furthermore the increasing demand for smartphone assisted platforms are expected to further boost the north american intelligent virtual assistant iva industry growth
despite its smaller size in comparison to the north american market the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the asia pacific region with its main players located in india and china is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of above global average over the period
virtual assistants should not be only seen as a gadget for individuals as they could have a real economic utility for enterprises
as an example a virtual assistant can take the role of an always available assistant with an encyclopedic knowledge
and which can organize meetings check inventories verify informations
virtual assistants are all the more important that their integration in small and middle sized enterprises often consists in an easy first step through the more global adaptation and use of internet of things iot
indeed iot technologies are first perceived by small and medium sized enterprises as technologies of critical importance but too complicated risky or costly to be used
in may researchers from the university of california berkeley published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it
the researchers made small changes to audio files which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect
these were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers open websites or even transfer money
the possibility of this has been known since and affects devices from apple amazon and google
in addition to unintentional actions and voice recording another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands an attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to for example unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user s knowledge
although some ivas provide a voice training feature to prevent such impersonation it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices
thus a malicious person who is able to access an iva enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that they are the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts
