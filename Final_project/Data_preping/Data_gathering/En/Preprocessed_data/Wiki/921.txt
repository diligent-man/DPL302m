first dhy na the first dhyana can be entered when one is secluded from sensuality and unskillful qualities due to withdrawal and right effort
there is p ti rapture and non sensual sukha pleasure as the result of seclusion while vitarka vicara discursive thought continues
second dhyana there is p ti rapture and non sensual sukha pleasure as the result of concentration samadhi ji born of samadhi ekaggata unification of awareness free from vitarka vicara discursive thought sampasadana inner tranquility
third dhyana upekkh equanimous affective detachment mindful and alert and senses pleasure with the body
fourth dhyana upekkh satip risuddhi purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
