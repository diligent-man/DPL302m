According to the Yogacara school rūpa is not matter as in the metaphysical substance of materialism Instead it means both materiality and sensibility—signifying for example a tactile object both insofar as that object is made of matter and that the object can be tactically sensed In fact rūpa is more essentially defined by its amenability to being sensed than its being matter just like everything else it is defined in terms of its function what it does not what it is As matter rūpa is traditionally analysed in two ways as four primary elements Pali mahābhūta and as ten or twenty four secondary or derived elements
Existing rūpa consists in the four primary or underived no upādā elements

touchIf twenty four secondary types are enumerated then the following fifteen are added to the first nine of the above ten
foodA list of derived types can be found for instance in the Abhidhamma Pitaka's Dhammasangani eg Dhs which omits the list of derived types' heart basis
The practice of dhyana is aided by anapanasati mindfulness of breathing The Suttapitaka the Agamas describe four stages of rupa jhāna Rupa refers to the material realm in a neutral stance as different from the kama realm lust desire and the arupa realm non material realm Each jhāna is characterised by a set of qualities which are present in that jhana
First dhyāna the first dhyana can be entered when one is secluded from sensuality and unskillful qualities due to withdrawal and right effort There is pīti rapture and non sensual sukha pleasure as the result of seclusion while vitarka vicara discursive thought continues
Second dhyana there is pīti rapture and non sensual sukha pleasure as the result of concentration samadhi ji born of samadhi ekaggata unification of awareness free from vitarka vicara discursive thought sampasadana inner tranquility
Third dhyana upekkhā equanimous affective detachment mindful and alert and senses pleasure with the body
Fourth dhyana upekkhāsatipārisuddhi purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain Traditionally the fourth jhāna is seen as the beginning of attaining psychic powers abhijñāBuddhaghosa Bhadantācariya trans from Pāli by Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli The Path of Purification Visuddhimagga Seattle WA BPS Pariyatti Editions ISBN
