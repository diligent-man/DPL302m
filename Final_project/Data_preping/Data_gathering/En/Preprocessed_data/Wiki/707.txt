The Controller-General or Comptroller-General of Finances French Contrleur gnral des finances was the name of the minister in charge of finances in France from to
It replaced the former position of Superintendent of Finances Surintendant des finances which was abolished with the downfall of Nicolas Fouquet
It did not hold any real political power until when First Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert who had acted upon financial matters since Fouquet's embezzlement charge was appointed to the office
The term contrleur gnral in reference to a position of royal accounting and financial oversight had existed in various forms prior to but the direct predecessor to the th century Controller-General was created in with two position-holders whose job was to verify the accounts of the Royal Treasurer Trsorier de l'chiquier then the head of the royal financial system
The name of the charge of the controllers came from their account book or contre-rle literally counter-roll meaning scroll copy in which they kept their accounts in order to compare them with those of the Royal Treasurer
The office was thus in the beginning not a senior rank governmental position but merely an accounting audit charge
In the period following the financial administration in France continued to evolve resulting in in the creation of Intendants of Finances Intendants des Finances of which one was to become in the leading Superintendent of Finances Surintendant des Finances with cabinet rank
In the last Superintendent of Finances Nicolas Fouquet was arrested by order of King Louis XIV and charged with embezzlement so that subsequently Jean-Baptiste Colbert became head of the royal financial and tax collection administration at first with the title of intendant gnral then from with the title of Contrleur gnral des Finances
The title Superintendent of Finances was abolished
Under Colbert's competent and dynamic administration the Controller-General's responsibilities were greatly redefined
King Louis XIV suppressed the two already existing positions holding the title of Controller-General as he wanted to replace these with a sole homonym office with cabinet rank in charge of all the finances and taxes of France
Furthermore this new position was no longer transmissible as the head of state could revoke the respective commission at his pleasure at any time
In addition the new position was far better connected with the Royal Finance Counsel Conseil royal des finances than the previous charge of Superintendent
In these ways the Contrleur gnral des Finances became a true senior governmental post
The function of Controller-General would continue until with an interruption at the era of the Polysynody under the regency of Philippe d'Orlans during the childhood of King Louis XV when all ministerial offices were replaced by councils composed of members of the high aristocracy
Occasionally the de facto Minister of Finance served instead as President of the Royal Council of Finance who had a superior rank to a mere Controller-General of Finances or in the case of Jacques Necker who being a Protestant could not serve as Controller-General as Director-General of Finances and of the Treasury Directeur gnral du Trsor royal and Directeur gnral des Finances from to and again from until in ceremonial terms a position ranked below the previous two
The position was renamed Minister of Finances in which along with all other ministerial positions was abolished in but restored with the advent of the French Directory in
Nowadays the position is called with exceptions Ministre de l'conomie et des Finances Minister of the Economy and Finance
The responsibilities of the Controller-General were the most extensive of all the administrative positions of the Ancien Rgime
According to the official description of the Controller-General had the power to report in our Counsel of all affairs which are of concern to our service and of any others faire rapport en notre Conseil de toutes les affaires qui concerneront notre service et de toutes autres indiffremment
Colbert first of the Controllers-General with subsequent power was also head of two other senior government posts equivalent to present-day ministers from a total of six Secretary of State of the Navy and Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi Royal Household both from till his death in
In addition to those cabinet posts he had also several important posts as administration chief such as Surintendant des Manufactures et Btiments du Roi Superintendent of the King's Manufacturers and Buildings
the control of State revenues taxes and fees
the control of external and internal customs traites
the management of most of the civil services and public infrastructure including bridges and roads ponts et chausses ports and canals
the control of the merchant navyThe position was very well paid in addition to livres tournois French pounds by year the average income of a worker was about to livres per year the Controller-General could also gain livres as Minister of State not to forget the bribes he would receive during the renewal phase of contracts to the Ferme Gnrale General Lease meaning the selling to private companies or individuals of the time-limited right to collect all the indirect taxes plus bonus fees in a defined portion of the country an extremely lucrative business for the leaseholders
The Controller-General participated in a number of the King's Councils
He was always member of the Conseil des dpches Counsel of messages which dealt with the news from the provinces the Royal Finance Counsel Conseil royal des finances and the Royal Commerce Counsel Conseil royal de commerce
He was nearly always a Minister of State the highest ceremonial rank for a cabinet member which allowed him to attend the High Counsel also known as the State Counsel Conseil d'en haut or Conseil d'tat the paramount institution of the royal government
In the French language exists only one word for the English words Council and Counsel Conseil
Therefore one can find in the literature both English words as translations of the French Conseil names
The Controller-General was generally chosen from among the regionally based Intendants of Finances or from the Matres des requtes literally Master of Requests an earlier form of public prosecutor
Of all ministerial positions the Controller-General was the least stable especially during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI to such a point that the Controller-General's official seat was called the Residence of Removals htel des dmnagements
Unlike other government departments of the French monarchy the Contrle Gnral des Finances was organised in a highly systematic manner
It was divided into several services under the immediate authority of the Controller-General
However he named for each service a senior managing assistant who was initially called Intendant des Finances a title which was later replaced by Intendant gnral des Finances or Directeur gnral des Finances in order to avoid any confusion with the Intendants des Finances established in the different regions of France
There were between three and twelve of these senior aids in financial and fiscal matters during the Ancien Rgime six at the end of the th century shortly before the Revolution
In the same way the Controller-General was assisted by four and later five Intendants gnraux du Commerce
The Contrle Gnral had a rather large personnel staff compared to other government departments
The central services were either in Paris notably at the Palais Mazarin Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs close to the bankers and financiers that the ministry dealt with or at the Royal Palace in Versailles
However the important collaborators of the Controller-General were the Intendants established in the different regions of France
Initially the King had been represented in the provinces by the Governors Gouverneurs and since by the Intendants who at first were only in charge of the collection of direct taxes and of regional public finances
Traditionally the Governors were chosen by the King from the ranks of the highest aristocracy
Nevertheless as they had occasionally challenged the royal authority in their respective regions the Kings responded by retaining them as often as possible at the Royal Palace so that the function of Governor finally became only a ceremonial title
As a consequence the real power in the regions shifted towards the Intendant who since had the official title of Intendent of Police Justice and Finances and Commissioner sent in the Gnralits of the Realm for the Execution of the King's Orders Intendant de police justice et finances Commissaire dparti dans les gnralits du royaume pour l'excution des ordres du Roi or in short Intendant de gnralit
There were of them each one at the head of a Gnralit which at first was simply a tax collection district of France but became more and more a general administration province of the royal government
Subsequently the Intendants saw their powers and competences increased at such a level that they were nicknamed the right hand of the King in the province
