the fishmongers guild one of the earliest guilds was established in the city of london by a royal charter granted by edward i shortly after he became king in
partnership with foreigners was forbidden and the sale of fish was tightly controlled to ensure freshness and restrain profit which was limited to one penny in the shilling
nevertheless the guild grew rich and after edward s victory over the scots was able to make a great show including one thousand mounted knights
during the reign of edward ii the political power of the fishmongers waned and parliament decreed that no fishmonger could become mayor of the city
this was soon rescinded and their wealth increased further so that during the reign of edward iii the guild could provide to the war against the french this being a great sum at that time
the guild was then reformed by great charter as the mystery of the fishmongers of london
they were given a monopoly over the crying and selling of fish and they regulated the catching of fish in the thames which teemed with fish such as salmon at that time
the guild still continues today as one of the great twelve city livery companies

pliers to pull out pinbones
a fish scaler to remove scales
a filleting knife to cut away the flesh from the bones
short strong knives for opening oysters and other shellfish
protective gloves

in medieval france the ones in paris were known for their special privilege of being able to speak frankly to the king himself when he ventured into the marketplace and voice criticism without fear of punishment
