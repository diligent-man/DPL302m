a knee strike commonly referred to simply as a knee is a strike with the knee either with the kneecap or the surrounding area
kneeing is a disallowed practice in many combat sports especially to the head of a downed opponent
styles such as muay thai and several mixed martial arts organizations allow kneeing depending on the positioning of the fighters
knee strikes are native to the traditional southeast asian martial arts and traditional okinawan martial arts
the straight knee also known as a front knee is a typical knee strike and involves thrusting the front of the knee into the head or body of an opponent
the straight knee can be applied from a stand up position both when the combatants are separated or when they are clinching
a particularly effective clinching position for throwing front knee is the double collar tie where the head of the opponent is controlled
on the ground front knees can be effective from a few top positions such as the side control and north south position
typical targets for the front knee include the head hips ribs solar plexus stomach and thighs
in muay thai a double collar tie with a front knee to the face was traditionally called hak kor aiyara
the groin is widely considered the key target for knee strikes and clinch knee attacks in a street fight according to karate tae kwon do muay thai and many other martial arts
the curved knee also sometimes called a side knee or roundhouse knee is similar to the front knee except that it does not use a forward thrusting motion but is instead rotated from the outside
whereas the front knee needs some space in between the combatants to be performed the curved knee can be executed from a minimal distance such as in a close clinch
this technique is often employed when an opponent is attempting to protect from a straight knee
typical targets include floating ribs hips and the side of the abdomen
a flying knee known as hanuman thayarn in muay thai and sometimes called a jumping knee is a knee strike very similar to a front knee except that it is performed in stand up fighting by jumping and often by rushing towards the opponent
a more reckless application of the flying knee strike can be applied by rotating the body so that the side of the knee strikes the opponent used more as an offensive pushing attack rather than a concussive ko attack
generally flying knee strikes can be effectively applied when the opponent is off balanced recovering from previous strikes or as a counter to a strike by the opponent
it can also be used as a follow up maneuver after delivering a particularly incapacitating strike
