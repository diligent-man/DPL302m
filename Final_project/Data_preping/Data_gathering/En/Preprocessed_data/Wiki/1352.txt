scrap consists of recyclable materials usually metals left over from product manufacturing and consumption such as parts of vehicles building supplies and surplus materials
unlike waste scrap has monetary value especially recovered metals and non metallic materials are also recovered for recycling
once collected the materials are sorted into types typically metal scrap will be crushed shredded and sorted using mechanical process
scrap recycling is important for creating a more sustainable economy or creating a circular economy using significantly less energy and having far less environmental impact than producing metal from ore
metal recycling especially of structural steel ships used manufactured goods such as vehicles and white goods is a major industrial activity with complex networks of wrecking yards sorting facilities and recycling plants
scrap metal originates both in business and residential environments
typically a scrapper will advertise their services to conveniently remove scrap metal for people who don t need it
scrap is often taken to a wrecking yard also known as a scrapyard junkyard or breaker s yard where it is processed for later melting into new products
a wrecking yard depending on its location may allow customers to browse their lot and purchase items before they are sent to the smelters although many scrap yards that deal in large quantities of scrap usually do not often selling entire units such as engines or machinery by weight with no regard to their functional status
customers are typically required to supply all of their own tools and labor to extract parts and some scrapyards may first require waiving liability for personal injury before entering
many scrapyards also sell bulk metals stainless steel etc by weight often at prices substantially below the retail purchasing costs of similar pieces
a scrap metal shredder is often used to recycle items containing a variety of other materials in combination with steel
examples are automobiles and white goods such as refrigerators stoves clothes washers etc
these items are labor intensive to manually sort things like plastic copper aluminum and brass
by shredding into relatively small pieces the steel can easily be separated out magnetically
the non ferrous waste stream requires other techniques to sort
in contrast to wrecking yards scrapyards typically sell everything by weight instead of by item
to the scrapyard the primary value of the scrap is what the smelter will give them for it rather than the value of whatever shape the metal may be in
an auto wrecker on the other hand would price exactly the same scrap based on what the item does regardless of what it weighs
typically if a wrecker cannot sell something above the value of the metal in it they would then take it to the scrapyard and sell it by weight
equipment containing parts of various metals can often be purchased at a price below that of either of the metals due to saving the scrapyard the labor of separating the metals before shipping them to be recycled
thieves sometimes sell stolen items to scrapyards
copper pipes and wiring bronze monuments and aluminium siding have all been targets of metal theft with the number of thefts increasing as prices rise
manhole covers have also been stolen
in the s the term newsjacking was coined to describe the theft of newspapers for sale to scrap dealers
scrap prices may vary markedly over time and in different locations
prices are often negotiated among buyers and sellers directly or indirectly over the internet
prices displayed as the market prices are not the prices that recyclers will see at the scrap yards
other prices are ranges or older and not updated frequently
some scrap yards websites have updated scrap prices
in the us scrap prices are reported in a handful of publications including american metal market based on confirmed sales as well as reference sites such as scrap metal prices and auctions
non us domiciled publications such as the steel index also report on the us scrap price which has become increasingly important to global export markets
scrap yards directories are also used by recyclers to find facilities in the us and canada allowing users to get in contact with yards
with resources online for recyclers to look at for scrapping tips like web sites blogs and search engines scrapping is often referred to as a hands and labor intensive job
taking apart and separating metals is important to making more money on scrap for tips like using a magnet to determine ferrous and non ferrous materials that can help recyclers make more money on their metal recycling
when a magnet sticks to the metal it will be a ferrous material like steel or iron
this is usually a less expensive item that is recycled but usually is recycled in larger quantities of thousands of pounds
non ferrous metals like copper aluminum and brass do not stick to a magnet
some cheaper grades of stainless steel are magnetic other grades are not
these items are higher priced commodities for metal recycling and are important to separate when recycling them
the prices of non ferrous metals also tend to fluctuate more than ferrous metals so it is important for recyclers to pay attention to these sources and the overall markets
great potential exists in the scrap metal industry for accidents in which a hazardous material present in scrap causes death injury or environmental damage
a classic example is radioactivity in scrap the goi nia accident and the mayapuri radiological accident were incidents involving radioactive materials
toxic materials such as asbestos and toxic metals such as beryllium cadmium and mercury may pose dangers to personnel as well as contaminating materials intended for metal smelters
many specialized tools used in scrapyards are hazardous such as the alligator shear which cuts metal using hydraulic force compactors scrap metal shredder and vacuum
according to research conducted by the us environmental protection agency recycling scrap metals can be quite beneficial to the environment
using recycled scrap metal in place of virgin iron ore can yield
savings in energy
savings in raw materials used
reduction in air pollution
reduction in water use
reduction in water pollution
reduction in mining wastes every ton of new steel made from scrap steel saves
kg of iron ore
kg of coal
kg of limestone energy savings from other metals include
aluminium savings of energy
copper savings of energy
lead savings of energy
zinc savings of energy the metal recycling industry encompasses a wide range of metals
the more frequently recycled metals are scrap steel iron iss lead aluminium copper stainless steel and zinc
there are two main categories of metals ferrous and non ferrous
metals which contain iron in them are known as ferrous
metals without iron are non ferrous
common non ferrous metals are copper brass aluminum zinc magnesium tin nickel and lead
usable coins can be deposited in banks
damaged us coins can be redeemed for money via the mutilated coin redemption program non ferrous metals also include precious and exotic metals
precious metals are metals with a high market value in any form such as gold silver and platinum group metals
exotic metals contain rare elements such as cobalt mercury titanium tungsten arsenic beryllium bismuth cerium cadmium niobium indium gallium germanium lithium selenium tantalum tellurium vanadium and zirconium
some types of metals are radioactive
these may be naturally occurring or formed by nuclear reactions
metals that have been exposed to radioactive sources may also become radioactive in settings such as medical environments research laboratories and nuclear power plants osha guidelines should be followed when recycling any type of scrap metal to ensure safety
ferrous metals are able to be recycled with steel being one of the most recycled materials in the world
ferrous metals contain an appreciable percentage of iron and the addition of carbon and other substances creates steel
in the united states steel containers cans automobiles appliances and construction materials contribute the greatest weight of recycled materials
for example in more than of structural steel and of automobiles were recycled comparing the current steel consumption for each industry with the amount of recycled steel being produced the late s recession and the associated sharp decline in automobile production in the us explains the over calculation
a typical appliance is about steel by weight and automobiles are about steel and iron
the steel industry has been actively recycling for more than years in large part because it is economically advantageous to do so
it is cheaper to recycle steel than to mine iron ore and manipulate it through the production process to form new steel
steel does not lose any of its inherent physical properties during the recycling process and has drastically reduced energy and material requirements compared with refinement from iron ore
the energy saved by recycling reduces the annual energy consumption of the industry by about which is enough to power eighteen million homes for one year
according to the international resource panel s metal stocks in society report the per capita stock of steel in use in australia canada the european union eu norway switzerland japan new zealand and the us combined is kilograms lb about million people in
basic oxygen steelmaking bos uses recycled steel to make new steel
bos steel usually contains lower concentrations of residual elements such as copper nickel and molybdenum and is therefore more malleable than electric arc furnace eaf steel and is often used to make automotive fenders tin cans industrial drums or any product with a large degree of cold working
eaf steelmaking uses almost recycled steel
this steel contains greater concentrations of residual elements that cannot be removed through the application of oxygen and lime
it is used to make structural beams plates reinforcing bar and other products that require little cold working
downcycling of steel by hard to separate impurities such as copper or tin can only be prevented by well aimed scrap selection or dilution by pure steel
recycling one metric ton kilograms of steel saves metric tons of iron ore kilograms of coal and kilograms of limestone
heavy melting steel industrial or commercial scrap steel greater than mm thick such as plates beams columns channels may also include scrap machinery or implements or certain metal stampings
old car bodies vehicles with or without interiors and their original wheels
cast iron cast iron bathtubs machinery pipe and engine blocks
pressing steel domestic scrap metal up to approx
mm in thick
examples white goods fridges washing machines etc roofing iron water heaters water tanks and sheet metal offcuts
reinforcing bars or mesh used in the construction industry within concrete structures
turnings remains of drilling or shaping steels
also known as borings or swarf
manganese steel non magnetic hardened steel used in the mining industry cement mixers rock crushers and other high impact and abrasive environments
rails rail or tram tracksthe hulls of ships with any usable equipment salvaged and removed can be broken up to provide scrap steel
for a time countries in south asia carried out most ship breaking often using manual methods that were hazardous to workers and the environment
international regulations now dictate treatment of old ships as sources of hazardous waste so ship breaking has returned to ports in more developed countries
in about million tons of scrap steel was recovered from broken ships
some of the scrap can be reheated and rolled to make products such as concrete reinforcing bars or the scrap may be melted to make new steel
the scrap industry was valued at more than billion in up from billion in balance of trade exporting billion in scrap commodities to countries
since the industry has added more than jobs and supports workers both directly and indirectly
in addition it generates more than billion in revenue for federal state and local governments
scrap recycling also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy and natural resources
for example scrap recycling diverts million short tons long tons t of materials away from landfills
recycled scrap is a raw material feedstock for nearly of steel made in the us for almost of the copper and copper alloys produced in the us for more than of the us paper industry s needs and for of us aluminum
recycled scrap helps keep air and water cleaner by removing potentially hazardous materials and keeping them out of landfills
