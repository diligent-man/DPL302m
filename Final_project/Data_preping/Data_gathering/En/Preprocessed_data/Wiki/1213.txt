william g
bowen president of princeton university from to founded jstor in
jstor was originally conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries especially research and university libraries due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence
most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals
by digitizing many journal titles jstor allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long term
online access and full text searchability improved access dramatically
bowen initially considered using cd roms for distribution
however ira fuchs princeton university s vice president for computing and information technology convinced bowen that cd rom was becoming an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility
for example all princeton s administrative and academic buildings were networked by the student dormitory network was completed in and campus networks like the one at princeton were in turn linked to larger networks such as bitnet and the internet jstor was initiated in at seven different library sites and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals
jstor access improved based on feedback from its initial sites and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary web browser
special software was put in place to make pictures and graphs clear and readable
with the success of this limited project bowen and kevin guthrie the then president of jstor wanted to expand the number of participating journals
they met with representatives of the royal society of london and an agreement was made to digitize the philosophical transactions of the royal society dating from its beginning in
the work of adding these volumes to jstor was completed by december
in jstor started a partnership with joint information systems committee and created a mirror website at the university of manchester to make the jstor database available to over higher education institutions in england scotland wales and northern ireland

mellon foundation funded jstor initially
until january jstor operated as an independent self sustaining nonprofit organization with offices in new york city and in ann arbor michigan

each object is uniquely identified by an integer value starting at which is used to create a stable url
in addition to the main site the jstor labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of corpus analysis at its data for research service
this site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main jstor site
users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and n gram frequencies and basic metadata
they are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either xml or csv formats
the service does not offer full text although academics may request that from jstor subject to a non disclosure agreement
jstor plant science is available in addition to the main site

every year jstor blocks million attempts by non subscribers to read articles
inquiries have been made about the possibility of making jstor open access
according to harvard law professor lawrence lessig jstor had been asked how much would it cost to make this available to the whole world how much would we need to pay you the answer was million
in late and early aaron swartz an american computer programmer writer political organizer and internet activist used mit s data network to bulk download a substantial portion of jstor s collection of academic journal articles
when the bulk download was discovered a video camera was placed in the room to film the mysterious visitor and the relevant computer was left untouched
once video was captured of the visitor the download was stopped and swartz was identified
rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him in june they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data
the following month federal authorities charged swartz with several data theft related crimes including wire fraud computer fraud unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer and recklessly damaging a protected computer
prosecutors in the case claimed that swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on p p file sharing sites
swartz surrendered to authorities pleaded not guilty to all counts and was released on bail
in september u s
attorneys increased the number of charges against swartz from four to thirteen with a possible penalty of years in prison and million in fines
the case still was pending when swartz committed suicide in january
prosecutors dropped the charges after his suicide
the availability of most journals on jstor is controlled by a moving wall which is an agreed upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on jstor
this time period is specified by agreement between jstor and the publisher of the journal which usually is three to five years
publishers may request that the period of a moving wall be changed or request discontinuation of coverage
formerly publishers also could request that the moving wall be changed to a fixed wall a specified date after which jstor would not add new volumes to its database
as of november fixed wall agreements were still in effect with three publishers of journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers
in jstor started adding current issues of certain journals through its current scholarship program
beginning september jstor made public domain content available at no charge to the public
this early journal content program constitutes about of jstor s total content and includes over documents from more than journals that were published before in the united states and before in other countries
jstor stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time
the swartz controversy and greg maxwell s protest torrent of the same content led jstor to press ahead with the initiative
as of jstor does not have plans to extend it to other public domain content stating that we do not believe that just because something is in the public domain it can always be provided for free
in january jstor started a pilot program register read offering limited no cost access not open access to archived articles for individuals who register for the service
at the conclusion of the pilot in january jstor expanded register read from an initial publishers to include about journals from over publishers
registered readers may read up to six articles online every calendar month but may not print or download pdfs
as of jstor is conducting a pilot program with wikipedia whereby established editors are given reading privileges through the wikipedia library as with a university library
in jstor users performed nearly million searches with more than million article views and million article downloads
jstor has been used as a resource for linguistics research to investigate trends in language use over time and also to analyze gender differences and inequities in scholarly publishing revealing that in certain fields men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions and that women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single authored papers
jstor metadata is available through crossref and the unpaywall dump which as of identifies nearly million works hosted by jstor as toll access as opposed to over available in open access mainly through third party open access repositories
