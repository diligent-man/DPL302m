the politics of singapore takes the form of a parliamentary representative democratic republic whereby the president of singapore is the head of state the prime minister of singapore is the head of government and of a multi party system
executive power is exercised by the cabinet from the parliament and to a lesser extent the president
cabinet has the general direction and control of the government and is accountable to parliament
there are three separate branches of government the legislature executive and judiciary abiding by the westminster system
singapore has been described as being a de facto one party state
legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament of singapore
the legislature is the parliament which consists of the president as its head and a single chamber whose members are elected by popular vote
the role of the president as the head of state has been historically largely ceremonial although the constitution was amended in to give the president some veto powers in a few key decisions such as the use of the national reserves and the appointment of key judiciary civil service and singapore armed forces posts
they also exercise powers over civil service appointments and national security matters
singaporean politics have been dominated by the people s action party pap since the general election when lee kuan yew became singapore s first prime minister singapore was then a self governing state within the british empire
the pap has been the only ruling party to form the government since then
singapore joined the federation of malaysia in and gained independence in after being expelled
singapore has consistently been rated as the least corrupt country in asia and amongst the top ten cleanest in the world by transparency international
the world bank s governance indicators have also rated singapore highly on rule of law control of corruption and government effectiveness
however it is widely perceived that some aspects of the political process civil liberties and political and human rights are lacking
the economist intelligence unit rated singapore a flawed democracy in
freedom house deemed the press not free in
the workers party wp is the leading opposition party
wp took of the parliamentary seats in the election while the pap won the other
another new opposition party the progress singapore party psp obtained two ncmp seats in the election
one commonly cited reason for a lack of opposition in singapore is the use of defamation lawsuits by the pap to bankrupt political opponents and disqualify them from running for office when accusations were made against the ruling party
cases include former leader of the wp j
jeyaretnam and leader of the sdp chee soon juan who were bankrupted in and respectively
another reason given is the pursuit of legal action against journalists and bloggers critical of the pap and its policies
reporters without borders cites such lawsuits along with attempts at making critical journalists unemployable among its concerns when ranking the country st in the world for press freedom in
the pap has in the past threatened voters by saying that constituencies voting for opposition mps would be put at the bottom of the list for public housing programs
in then pap secretary general goh chok tong said by linking the priority of upgrading to electoral support we focus the minds of voters on the link between upgrading and the people whose policies make it possible
this has the desired result
as recently as lee hsien loong expressed that there has to be a distinction between opposition wards and the ones that voted for the pap in terms of housing upgrades
the boundaries of electoral constituencies in singapore are decided by the elections department which is under the control of the prime minister s office
electoral boundaries are redrawn just a few days before the general election
there have been accusations of gerrymandering via dissolving of constituencies with relatively stronger opposition support such as the cheng san group representation constituency grc
although singapore s laws are inherited from british and british indian laws including many elements of english common law the pap has also consistently rejected liberal democratic values which it typifies as western and states that there should not be a one size fits all solution to a democracy
laws restricting the freedom of speech exist to prohibit speech that may breed ill will or cause disharmony within singapore s multiracial multi religious society
for example in september three bloggers were convicted of sedition for posting racist remarks targeting minorities

ministers in singapore are the highest paid politicians in the world receiving a salary raise in and as a result prime minister lee hsien loong s pay jumped to s million five times the us earned by us president barack obama
although there was a public outcry regarding the high salary in comparison to the size of the country governed the government s firm stance was that this raise was required to ensure the continued efficiency and corruption free status of singapore s world class government
on may following the general election the prime minister announced that a committee would be appointed to review politicians remuneration and that revised salaries would take effect from that date

the elected members of parliament mps are elected on a plurality voting basis and represent either single member constituencies smcs or group representation constituencies grcs
in grcs political parties field a team of between three and six candidates
at least one candidate in the team must belong to a minority race
formerly there were no grcs and all constituencies of singapore were represented by one member but amendments to the parliamentary elections act in led to the creation of grcs thus creating a plurality voting system in the process
this development has led to complaints from opposition parties that they are often unable to field one let alone three or more candidates

removing the president from officebefore any law is passed it is first introduced in parliament as a draft known as a bill
bills are usually introduced by a minister on behalf of the cabinet known as government bills
however any member of parliament can introduce a bill known as a private member s bill
all bills must go through three readings in parliament and receive the president s assent to become an act of parliament
each bill goes through several stages before it becomes a law
the first stage is a mere formality known as the first reading where it is introduced without a debate
this is followed by the second reading where members of parliament debate on the general principles of the bill
if parliament opposes the bill it may vote to reject the bill
if the bill goes through the second reading the bill is sent to a select committee where every clause in the bill is examined
members of parliament who support the bill in principle but do not agree with certain clauses can propose amendments to those clauses at this stage
following its report back to parliament the bill will go through its third reading where only minor amendments will be allowed before it is passed
most bills passed by parliament are scrutinised by the presidential council for minority rights which makes a report to the speaker of parliament stating whether there are clauses in a bill which affects any racial or religious community
if approved by the council the bill will be presented for the president s assent
the last stage involves the granting of assent by the president before the bill officially becomes a law
the constitution of singapore is the supreme law of singapore and it is a codified constitution
the constitution cannot be amended without the support of more than two thirds of the members of parliament on the second and third readings

paper ballots are still used in singapore
however there is a concern that voting secrecy might be compromised as ballot papers have serial numbers on them
as stated in the elections department website
ballot papers can be examined only under strict conditions and there are safeguards that make it extremely difficult to find out how any particular voter voted
after the count all ballot papers and their counterfoils have to be sealed in the supreme court vault for six months after which all the ballot papers and other election documents are destroyed
during those six months these documents can only be retrieved by court order
the court will issue such an order only if it is satisfied that a vote has been fraudulently cast and the result of the election may be affected as a result
our courts have issued no such order since elections have been held here since the pap has been the dominant political party in singapore re elected continuously since
