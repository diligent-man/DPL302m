the stuart period of british history lasted from to during the dynasty of the house of stuart
the period ended with the death of queen anne and the accession of king george i from the german house of hanover
the period was plagued by internal and religious strife and a large scale civil war which resulted in the execution of king charles i in
the interregnum largely under the control of oliver cromwell is included here for continuity even though the stuarts were in exile
the cromwell regime collapsed and charles ii had very wide support for his taking of the throne in
his brother james ii was overthrown in in the glorious revolution
he was replaced by his protestant daughter mary ii and her dutch husband william iii
mary s sister anne was the last of the line
for the next half century james ii and his son james francis edward stuart and grandson charles edward stuart claimed that they were the true stuart kings but they were in exile and their attempts to return with french aid were defeated
england was ruled at the national level by royalty and nobility and at the local level by the lesser nobility and the gentry
together they comprised about of the families owned most of the good farmland and controlled local government affairs
the aristocracy was growing steadily in numbers wealth and power
from to the number of peers dukes earls marquises viscounts and barons grew from families to
they inherited their titles through primogeniture had a favoured position in legal matters enjoyed the highest positions in society and held seats in the house of lords
in the king looking for new revenue sources created the hereditary rank of baronet with a status below that of the nobility and no seat in lords and a price tag of about
the vast land holdings seized from the monasteries under henry viii of england in the s were sold mostly to local gentry greatly expanding the wealth of that class of gentlemen
the gentry tripled to from in the century after
many families died out and others moved up so that three fourths of the peers in had been created by stuart kings since
historians engaged in a lively debate dubbed the storm over the gentry about the theory that the rising gentry class increasingly took power away from the static nobility and generally reject it
both the gentry and the nobility were gaining power and the english civil war was not a battle between them
in terms of religious affiliation in england the catholics were down to about of the population but comprised about of the gentry and nobility
james vi king of scotland also became king of the entirely separate kingdom of england when elizabeth i of england died
he also became king of ireland but the english were just reestablishing lost control there
the english re conquest was completed after victory in the nine years war
james appointees in dublin as lord deputy of ireland established real control over ireland for the first time bringing a centralised government to the entire island and successfully disarmed the native lordships
the great majority of the irish population remained catholic but james promoted protestant plantations from scotland into the ulster region
the colonisers were known as scots irish or scotch irish
in turn many of them migrated to the new american colonies during the stuart period
king james was failing in physical and mental strength because of this he was often mocked by his family and his own father would throw objects at him when he would try to stand up and decision making was increasingly in the hands of charles and especially george villiers he was earl of buckingham from and duke from
buckingham showed a very high degree of energy and application as well as a huge appetite for rewards and riches
by he was effectively the ruler of england
in charles became the king of a land deeply involved in a european war and rent by escalating religious controversies
buckingham and charles developed a foreign policy based on an alliance with france against spain
major foreign adventures against c diz in and in support of french huguenots in were total disasters
widespread rumour shaped public opinion that blamed buckingham rather than the king for the ills that beset england
when parliament twice opened impeachment proceedings the king simply prorogued suspended the parliament
buckingham was assassinated in by john felton a dissatisfied army officer
the assassin was executed but he nevertheless became a heroic martyr across the three kingdoms
like his father king charles believed in the divine right of kings to rule and he was unable to work successfully with parliament
by he and buckingham had transformed the political landscape
in the king dissolved parliament and began a period of eleven years of personal rule
english government was quite small for the king had no standing army and no bureaucracy stationed around the country
laws were enforced primarily by local officials controlled by the local elites
military operations were typically handled by hired mercenaries
the greatest challenge king charles faced in ruling without a parliament was raising money
the crown was in debt nearly million financiers in the city refused new loans
charles saved money by signing peace treaties with france in and spain in and avoiding involvement in the thirty years war
he cut the usual budget but it was not nearly enough
then he discovered a series of ingenious methods to raise money without the permission of parliament
they had been rarely used but were nevertheless legal
he sold monopolies despite their unpopularity
he fined the landowners for supposedly encroaching on the royal forests
compulsory knighthood had been established in the middle ages when men of certain wealth were ordered to become knights in the king s service or else pay a fine
when knighthood lost its military status the fines continued for a time but they had been abandoned by
james reinstated the fine and hired new officials to search local records to find wealthy men who did not have knighthood status
they were forced to pay including oliver cromwell among thousands of other country gentlemen across rural england
was raised in addition to raising bitter anger among the gentry
the king finally crossed the line of legality when he began to levy ship money intended for naval defences upon interior towns
protests now escalated to include urban elites
all the new measures generated long term outrage but they did balance the short term budget which averaged without the need to call parliament into session
revolts broke out in scotland in response to the king s imposition of the book of common prayer which threatened to undermine the religion of the people
the scots drove english forces out and forced the king to subsidise the insurgents who were now occupying part of northern england
a major revolt among catholics in ireland killed thousands of scots irish there was no doubt it had to be suppressed and new taxes would be needed to pay the costs of military action
a new parliament had to be called
the long parliament elected in proved just as difficult for charles as had the short parliament
it assembled on november and quickly began proceedings to impeach and remove the king s leading counsellors for high treason
thomas wentworth st earl of strafford was taken into custody on november william laud the archbishop of canterbury was impeached on december john finch st baron finch now lord keeper of the great seal was impeached the following day and he fled to holland
to prevent the king from dissolving it at will parliament passed the triennial act which required parliament to be summoned at least once every three years and permitted the lord keeper and peers to summon parliament if the king failed to do so
the act was coupled with a subsidy bill and so to secure the latter charles grudgingly granted royal assent in february
the first english civil war of ended in victory for the parliamentarians over the royalists often called cavaliers
the parliamentarians were often called roundheads because of their short practical haircuts
the second english civil war was fought in charles lost and the execution of charles i took place in january
the monarchy was temporarily displaced by the commonwealth of england from to
oliver cromwell ruled directly from to his death in whereupon his commonwealth disintegrated
the convention parliament welcomed charles ii son of charles i to return from exile and become king
the war period saw a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between parliamentarians and royalists with most of the fighting in england
the first and second wars pitted the supporters of king charles i against the supporters of the long parliament while the third saw fighting between supporters of king charles ii and supporters of the rump parliament
the war ended with the parliamentarian victory at the battle of worcester on september
historians debate whether the main determinant of the outcome was based on superior operational decisions and decisive battlefield events as argued by malcolm wanklyn or rather parliament s long run superiority in manpower and money as argued by clive holmes
the overall outcome was threefold the trial and execution of charles i the exile of his son charles ii and the replacement of english monarchy with at first the commonwealth of england and then the protectorate under the personal rule of oliver cromwell
when cromwell died his son richard cromwell was incapable of governing and the puritan army directly ruled the three kingdoms to the growing disgust of all classes of people
the monopoly of the church of england on religion was strengthened by the suppression of the last remnants of catholicism and the powerful forces of puritanism and nonconformism
constitutionally the wars convinced everyone that an english monarch cannot govern alone nor could parliament
they were both essential
in the dominant figure in england although he refused the offer of kingship was oliver cromwell the highly successful parliamentarian general
he worked hard at the time to ensure good publicity for his reign and his successful wars
he remains a favourite topic of historians even as he is one of the most controversial figures in british history and his intense religiosity has long been out of fashion
after the execution of the king a republic was declared known as the commonwealth of england
a council of state was appointed to manage affairs which included cromwell among its members
his real power base was in the army cromwell tried but failed to unite the original group of royal independents centred around st john and saye and sele but only st john was persuaded to retain his seat in parliament
from the middle of until cromwell was away on campaign
in the meantime with the king gone and with him their common cause the various factions in parliament began to fight each other
on his return cromwell tried to galvanise the rump into setting dates for new elections uniting the three kingdoms under one polity and to put in place a broad brush tolerant national church
however the rump vacillated in setting election dates and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement
in frustration cromwell eventually dismissed the rump parliament in
he summoned a new parliament whose members were all nominated
sometimes known as the parliament of saints it was also called the barebones parliament
the parliament was based on an idea of major general thomas harrison s for a sanhedrin of saints
although cromwell did not subscribe to harrison s apocalyptic fifth monarchist beliefs which saw a sanhedrin as the precondition of christ s rule on earth he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of a cross section of sects
however its failure to deal with the complex political legal and religious problems facing england soon led to its closeure
in december cromwell was appointed lord protector with powers akin to those of a monarch
cromwell s power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army which he had built up during the civil wars and which he subsequently prudently guarded and during his period of dictatorship he divided england into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him
the major generals and deputy major generals called godly governors were central to cromwell s moral crusade beginning in october
they lasted less than a year
the generals not only supervised militia forces and security commissions but collected taxes and insured support for the government in the english and welsh provinces
they were resented by provincials
many members of parliament feared the generals threatened their reform efforts and authority
their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by major general john desborough to provide financial backing for their work which parliament voted down for fear of a permanent military state
ultimately however cromwell s failure to support his men sacrificing them to his opponents caused their demise
the first anglo dutch war broke out in against the republic of the seven united netherlands eventually won by the royal navy under admiral robert blake in
cromwell was aware of the contribution that jewish financiers made to the economic success of holland now england s leading commercial rival
it was this that led to his encouraging jews to return to england years after their banishment in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the civil wars
in cromwell was offered the crown by a re constituted parliament since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy he said no after long deliberation
he ruled as king in all but name but his office was not hereditary
instead cromwell was to nominate his own successor
cromwell s new rights and powers were laid out in the humble petition and advice a legislative instrument which replaced the instrument of government
the older historiography came in two flavours the whig history interpretation and the marxist historiography interpretation
the whig model dominant in the th century saw an inherent conflict between irresistible truly english ideals of liberty and individualism represented by the puritans and roundheads overcoming the medieval concept of the king as the unquestionable voice of god
historians became increasingly uncomfortable with the writing of history as a predetermined search for an idealistic goal and the whig approach lost favour after the first world war
meanwhile in the late th century the remarkably high quality scholarship of archivally oriented historians especially samuel rawson gardiner and charles harding firth had provided the rich details on national politics practically on a day by day basis
scholars however generally neglected the local dimension
in the post war era the class conflict of the marxist interpretation emerged as a powerful explanation that seemed to tie all the details together
it portrayed a battle between the declining crown and upper class feudalistic aristocracy versus the rising middle class gentry
marxists downplayed the religious dimension
on one side influential names included r
tawney lawrence stone and the marxist christopher hill
the main argument was that the civil war was a challenge launched by the rising gentry class to overcome the power of the crown and the aristocracy
marxists like hill saw the war as england s bourgeois revolution that is the overthrow of an outdated feudal order by the new middle class
the class conflict interpretation was vigorously challenged by conservative scholars such as hugh trevor roper who argued that the gentry was not rising but instead felt that its status was being undermined
it fought back against its exclusion from the power patronage and payoff by an extravagant court by the king s swelling state bureaucracy and by the nouveau riche financiers in london
marxist historiography itself lost much of its intellectual support after the s
revisionists came to the fore rejecting both whig and marxist approaches because they assumed historical events were the automatic playing out of mysterious forces such as liberty and class conflict new microscopic local studies demonstrated that the class differences between the two sides varied greatly from place to place and did not explain very much
once the revisionists had dispatched the older models the post revisionists began to offer a multiplicity of small scale explanations that fitted particular localities
historians now give much more emphasis to religiosity and to the diversity of local situations
instead of an argument that massive popular anger had built up in the early th century and caused the civil war the current approaches depict the early stuart period as marked by harmony good government and popular support
how then could there be a civil war the current scholarly solution is to emphasise what historians call the british problem involving the impossible tensions occurring when a single person tried to hold together his three kingdoms with their entirely different geographical ethnic political and religious values and traditions
widespread dissatisfaction with the lack of the king led to the restoration in which was based on strong support for inviting charles ii to take the throne
the restoration settlement of reestablished the monarchy and incorporated the lessons learned in the previous half century
the first basic lesson was that the king and the parliament were both needed for troubles cumulated when the king attempted to rule alone when parliament ruled without a king or when there was a military dictator
the tory perspective involved a greater respect for the king and for the church of england
the whig perspective involved a greater respect for parliament
the two perspectives eventually coalesced into opposing political factions throughout the th century
the second lesson was that the highly moralistic puritans were too inclined to divisiveness and political extremes
the puritans and indeed all protestants who did not closely adhere to the church of england were put under political and social penalties that lasted until the early th century
even more severe restrictions were imposed on catholics and unitarians
the third lesson was that england needed protection against organised political violence
politicized mobs in london or popular revolts in the rural areas were too unpredictable and too dangerous to be tolerated
the king s solution was a standing army a professional force controlled by the king
this solution became highly controversial
the restoration of was a deliberate return to the stability of the early th century
there was very little recrimination
king charles acted with moderation and self restraint and with energy and attention to details
the king reached out to everyone finding high positions for his old friends and allies as well as places for his former enemies
by far the most important role went to edward hyde who was made earl of clarendon and lord chancellor in
he was largely in control of royal affairs especially after his daughter anne hyde married the king s brother james he became king in
when the second anglo dutch war ended in failure in the king removed clarendon in a severe confrontation the earl was accused of treason and was banished to france
charles was willing to talk to every faction in england ireland and scotland even with the quakers who were hated by practically everyone else
charles gave out high offices in england with an eye toward favouring his longtime allies and making sure his erstwhile enemies received at least some symbolic positions
in scotland he included all of the important factions from the s
in ireland he retained the men currently in power
the king and parliament agreed on a general pardon the indemnity and oblivion act
it covered everyone with the exception of three dozen regicides who were tracked down for punishment
the terms of the settlement included giving the king a fixed annual payment of million scotland and ireland added small additional amounts
it was illegal to use dubious non parliamentary fund raising such as payments for knighthood forced loans and especially the much hated ship money
parliament did impose an entirely new excise tax on alcoholic beverages that raise substantial sums as did the customs for foreign trade was flourishing
parliament closed down the harsh special courts that charles had used before such as the star chamber court of high commission and the council of the north
parliament watched charles ministers closely for any signs of defiance and was ready to use the impeachment procedure to remove offenders and even to pass bills of attainder to execute them without a trial
religious issues proved the most difficult to resolve
charles reinstated the bishops but also tried to reach out to the presbyterians
catholics were entirely shut out of opportunities to practice their religion or connect to the papal states in rome
the royalists won a sweeping election victory in only presbyterians survived in parliament
severe restrictions were now imposed on the nonconformist protestant bodies in england preventing them from holding scheduled church services and prohibiting their members from holding government offices at the national or local level
for example the five mile law in made it a crime for nonconformist clergymen to be within miles of their old parish
the puritans still controlled the massachusetts bay colony and the connecticut colony but they kept a low profile during the interregnum
charles ii cancelled their charters and imposed centralised rule through the dominion of new england
his colonial policies were reversed by william iii
most of the smaller independent religious factions faded away except for the quakers
the congregationalists presbyterians and baptists remain and were later joined by the methodists
these non anglican protestants continued as a political factor with its leaders moving toward what became the whig party
the country gentry continued to form the basis of support for the church of england and for what became the tory party
parliament was especially alarmed at the success of cromwell s new model army which demonstrated that a well organized well led professional army was far superior to poorly trained militia units
cromwell had used his standing army to take full personal control and so it was much to be feared as a threat to traditional liberties
the new model army was permanently disbanded and all the soldiers received their full back pay
on the other hand as long as enemy nations such as spain and france had large standing armies england was practically defenceless on land
king and parliament all agreed on the wisdom of a strong expanded royal navy
but while the king tried to build up a small standing army parliament kept a very close nervous watch
puritanism was entirely out of fashion as the royal court introduced a level of hedonism that far exceeded anything england had ever seen
harris says at the center of this world was a libertine court a society of restoration rakes given more to drinking gambling swearing and whoring than to godliness presided over by the king himself and his equally rakish brother james duke of york
england never had a standing army with professional officers and careerist corporals and sergeants
it relied on militia organised by local officials private forces mobilised by the nobility or on hired mercenaries from europe
cromwell changed all that with his new model army of men that proved vastly more effective than untrained militia and enabled him to exert a powerful control at the local level over all of england
at the restoration parliament paid off cromwell s army and disbanded it
for many decades the cromwellian model was a horror story and the whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army
the militia acts of and prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents
calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so
however king charles managed to pull together four regiments of infantry and cavalry calling them his guards at a cost of from his general budget
this became the foundation of the permanent british army by it had grown to soldiers in marching regiments and men permanently stationed in garrisons
a rebellion in allowed james ii to raise the forces to men
there were in when england played a role in the closing stage of the franco dutch war
in william iii expanded the army to soldiers and then to in
parliament became very nervous and reduced the cadre to in
scotland and ireland had theoretically separate military establishments but they were unofficially merged with the english force
the british have always regarded the overthrow of king james ii of england in as a decisive break in history especially as it made the parliament of england supreme over the king and guaranteed a bill of legal rights to everyone
steven pincus argues that this revolution was the first modern revolution it was violent popular and divisive
he rejects older theories to the effect that it was an aristocratic coup or a dutch invasion
instead pincus argues it was a widely supported and decisive rejection of james ii
the people could not tolerate james any longer
he was too close to the french throne he was too roman catholic and they distrusted his absolutist modernisation of the state
what they got instead was the vision of william of orange shared by most leading englishmen that emphasised consent of all the elites religious toleration of all protestant sects free debate in parliament and aggressive promotion of commerce
pincus sees a dramatic transformation that reshaped religion political economy foreign policy and even the nature of the english state
during the joint rule of william and mary william made the decisions when he was in britain mary was in charge when he was out of the country and also handled church affairs
william encouraged the passage of major laws that protected personal liberties
of the toleration act which guaranteed religious toleration to protestant nonconformists
it did not however extend toleration as far as he wished still restricting the religious liberty of roman catholics non trinitarians and those of non christian faiths
in december one of the fundamental constitutional documents in english history the bill of rights was passed
the act restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier declaration of right and established restrictions on the royal prerogative
it provided that the sovereign could not suspend laws passed by parliament levy taxes without parliamentary consent infringe the right to petition raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent deny the right to bear arms to protestant subjects unduly interfere with parliamentary elections punish members of either house of parliament for anything said during debates require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments
william was opposed to the imposition of such constraints but he chose not to engage in a conflict with parliament and agreed to abide by the statute
the primary reason the english elite called on william to invade england in was to overthrow the king james ii and stop his efforts to reestablish catholicism and tolerate puritanism
however the primary reason william accepted the challenge was to gain a powerful ally in his war to contain the threatened expansion of king louis xiv of france
william s goal was to build coalitions against the powerful french monarchy protect the autonomy of the netherlands where william continued in power and to keep the spanish netherlands present date belgium out of french hands
the english elite was intensely anti french and generally supported william s broad goals
for his entire career in netherlands and britain william was the arch enemy of louis xiv
the french king and the denounced william as a usurper who had illegally taken the throne from the legitimate king james ii and ought to be overthrown
in may william now king of england with the support of parliament declared war on france
england and france would be at war almost continuously until with a short interlude made possible by the treaty of ryswick
the combined english and dutch fleets could overpower france in a far flung naval war but france still had superiority on land
william wanted to neutralise that advantage by allying with leopold i the habsburg emperor of the holy roman empire who was based in vienna austria
leopold however was tied down in war with the ottoman empire on his eastern frontiers william worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the ottomans and the empire
william displayed in imaginative europe wide strategy but louis always managed to come up with a counter play
william was usually supported by the english leadership which saw france as its greatest enemy
but eventually the expenses and war weariness but the second thoughts
at first parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars and for his subsidies to smaller allies
private investors created the bank of england in it provided a sound system that made financing wars much easier by encouraging bankers to loan money
in the long running nine years war his main strategy was to form a military alliance of england the netherlands the holy roman empire spain and some smaller states to attack france at sea and from land in different directions while defending the netherlands
louis xiv tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognise william as king of england and by giving diplomatic military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the english throne all based in france williams focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars spending a great deal of time in the netherlands where he continued to hold the dominant political office
his closest foreign policy advisers were dutch most notably william bentinck st earl of portland they shared little information with their english counterparts
the net result was that the netherlands remained independent and france never took control of the spanish netherlands
the wars were very expensive to both sides but inconclusive
william died just as the continuation war the war of the spanish succession was beginning
it was fought out by queen anne and ended in a draw
historian stephen b
baxter is a leading specialist on william iii and like nearly all his biographers he has a highly favourable opinion of the king
william iii was the deliverer of england from the tyranny and arbitrary government of the stuarts he repaired and improved an obsolete system of government and left it strong enough to withstand the stresses of the next century virtually unchanged
the army of marlborough and that of wellington and to a large extent that of raglan was the creation of william iii
so too was the independence of the judiciary
his government was very expensive at their peak the annual expenditures of william iii were four times as large as those of james ii
this new scale of government was bitterly unpopular
but the new taxes which were not in fact heavy by comparison with those borne by the dutch made england a great power
and they contributed to the prosperity of the country while they contributed to its strength by the process which is now called pump priming anne became queen in at age succeeding william iii whom she hated
for practically her entire reign the central issue was the war of the spanish succession in which britain played a major role in the european wide alliance against louis xiv of france
down until the parliament was dominated by the whig junto coalition
she disliked them and relied instead on her old friends duke of marlborough and his wife sarah churchill and chief minister lord godolphin
she made marlborough captain general and head of the army his brilliant victories boded well for britain at first
but the war dragged on into an expensive stalemate
the opposition tories had opposed the war all along and now won a major electoral victory in
anne reacted by dismissing marlborough and godolphin and turning to robert harley
she had miscarriages and babies but only one survived and he died at age so her death ended the stuart period
anne s intimate friendship with sarah churchill turned sour in as the result of political differences
the duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the queen in her memoirs as ignorant and easily led which was a theme widely accepted by historians until anne was re assessed in the late th century
anne took a lively interest in affairs of state and was a noted patroness of theatre poetry and music
she subsidised george frideric handel with a year
she began the practice of awarding high quality gold medals as rewards for outstanding political or military achievements
they were produced at the mint by isaac newton and engraver john croker
scotland and england were entirely separate countries having the same ruler since
queen anne ruling both countries worked to bring them together in the acts of union
public opinion in scotland was generally hostile but elite opinion was supportive especially after the english provided generous financial terms and timely bribes
the parliament of scotland agreed to the terms and disbanded
the new parliament of great britain was in practice simply the old parliament of england augmented by scots elected to commons it selected scottish peers for the house of lords
scotland was much smaller in terms of population and wealth
its colonial venture in the darien scheme had been a major financial and humanitarian disaster
the acts of union refunded the losses of the scottish investors in darien
in basic terms scotland retained its own presbyterian established church and its own legal and educational systems as well it is its own separate nobility
the scots now paid english taxes although in reduced rates and had a voice in the affairs of great britain
the long term economic benefits took a couple of generations to be realised and long standing distrust continued for generations
the risk of war between the two was greatly diminished although jacobite raids launched from the north hit england for another forty years
the new britain used its power to undermine the clanship system in the scottish highlands ambitious scots now had major career opportunities in the fast growing overseas british colonies and in the rapidly growing industrial and financial communities of england
scotland benefited says historian g n
clark gaining freedom of trade with england and the colonies as well as a great expansion of markets clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that england bestowed what it gained was
of inestimable value
scotland accepted the hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening england s military security and complicating her commercial relations
the sweeping successes of the eighteenth century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations by the time samuel johnson and james boswell made their tour in recorded in a journey to the western islands of scotland johnson noted that scotland was a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending and the wealth increasing and in particular that glasgow had become one of the greatest cities of britain
the total population of england grew steadily in the th century from to about then declined slightly and stagnated between and
the population was about million in million in million in million in and million in
by the greater london area held about people or one in nine of england s population
the next cities in size were norwich and bristol with a population of about each
about of the people lived in rural areas in compared to of a much larger population in
historians have recently placed stress on how people at the time dealt with the supernatural not just in formal religious practice and theology but in everyday life through magic and witchcraft
the persecution of witches began in england in and hundreds were executed
england was spared the frenzy on continental europe with over of europe s population in england executed only of the witches killed in the period
the government made witchcraft a capital crime under queen elizabeth i of england in
king james vi and i made the suppression of witchcraft a high priority in both scotland and in in england
judges across england sharply increased their investigation of accused witches thus generating a body of highly detailed local documentation that has provided the main basis for recent historical research on the topic
historians keith thomas and his student alan macfarlane study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology
they argued that english witchcraft was endemic year in and year out rather than happening in epidemic outbursts
older women were the favourite targets because they were marginal dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community
witchcraft accusations were the village s reaction to the breakdown of its internal community coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress
historian peter homer has emphasised the political basis of the witchcraft issue in the th century with the puritans taking the lead in rooting out the devil s work in their attempt to depaganise england and build a godly community
as the process of psychological modernisation reached more and more people fears of witchcraft and magic tended to steadily diminish
after puritans were largely excluded from the judiciary and lost their power to investigate
in jane wenham was the last woman found guilty of witchcraft in england
in parliament no longer believed that witchcraft was real despite the efforts of james erskine lord grange the scottish lord who made a fool of himself speaking in opposition
parliament passed the witchcraft act which made it a crime to accuse someone of witchcraft
the laws against witchcraft were not fully repealed until with the passing of the fraudulent mediums act
witchcraft was a minor issue of little importance in ireland
however scotland was a major centre of suppression scots were tried two thirds were convicted and executed the last of whom was janet horne in
there was no free schooling for ordinary children but in the towns and cities small local private schools were opened for the benefit of the boys of the middle classes and a few were opened for girls
the rich and the nobility relied on private tutors
private schools were starting to open for young men of the upper classes and universities operated in scotland and england
the university of oxford and the university of cambridge provided some education for prospective anglican ministers but otherwise had academic standards well below their counterparts in scotland
historians have looked at local documents to see how many men and women used their signature and how many used x s
literacy rates were very low before but grew steadily in the next three centuries with men twice as likely to be literate as comparable women
in literacy rates for women were by they had reached by about by about versus for men
two forces were at work protestant religion called for the ability to read the bible and changing social and economic conditions
for example towns grew rapidly providing jobs in retailing in which literacy was a distinct advantage
when the puritans fell out of power the tight social norms gave way to more liberal pleasures
the theatres returned and played a major role in high society in london where they were patronised by royalty
historian george clark argues
the best known fact about the restoration drama is that it is immoral
the dramatists did not criticise the accepted morality about gambling drink love and pleasure generally or try like the dramatists of our own time to work out their own view of character and conduct
what they did was according to their respective inclinations to mock at all restraints
some were gross others delicately improper
the dramatists did not merely say anything they liked they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it the first coffee houses appeared in the mid s and quickly became established in every city in many small towns
they exemplified the emerging standards of middle class masculine civility and politeness
downtown london boasted about by
admission was a penny for as long as a customer wanted
the customers could buy coffee and perhaps tea and chocolate as well as sandwiches and knickknacks
recent newspapers and magazines could be perused by middle class men with leisure time on their hands
widows were often the proprietors
the coffeehouses were quiet escapes suitable for conversation and free of noise disorder shouting and fighting in drinking places
the working class could more usually be found drinking in pubs or playing dice in the alleyways
many businessmen conducted their affairs there and some even kept scheduled hours
historian mark pendergast observes
each coffeehouse specialised in a different type of clientele
in one physicians could be consulted
others served protestants puritans catholics jews literati merchants traders fops whigs tories army officers actors lawyers clergy or wits
the coffeehouses provided england s first egalitarian meeting place where a man was expected to chat with his tablemates whether he knew them or not lloyd s coffee house opened in and specialised in providing shipping news for a clientele of merchants insurers and shipowners
in a few years it moved to a private business office that eventually became the famous insurance exchange lloyd s of london
by the s private clubs had become more popular and the penny coffee houses largely closed down
in science the royal society was formed in it sponsored and legitimised a renaissance of major discoveries led most notably by isaac newton robert boyle and robert hooke
new scientific discoveries were made during this period such as the laws of gravity and motion boyle s law and microscopy among many others
the period also witnessed the growth of a culture of political news and commentary on political events
this was engaged in by both elites and laypeople often involving a critical view or skeptical reading
the custom of the grand tour where upper class englishman travelled to italy were a largely th century phenomenon
however it originated in the th century with some of the earliest precedents set by thomas howard when he travelled to italy in
the travelogue coryat s crudities published by thomas coryat was also an early influence on the grand tour
the first mention of the term can be found in richard lassels th century book the voyage of italy
the grand tour experienced considerable development after
out in the countryside numerous architects built country houses the more magnificent the better for the nobility and the wealthier gentry
inigo jones one of the most well known of stuart era architects built the magnificent banqueting house in whitehall london in
numerous architects worked on the decorative arts designing intricate wainscoted rooms dramatic staircases lush carpets furniture and clocks in country houses open to tourism
the great fire of london in created the urgent necessity to rebuild many important buildings and stately houses
the accompanying act regulated buildings of a certain material preferably of brick or stone wall thickness and street widths while jetties were banned
sir christopher wren was in charge of the rebuilding damaged churches
more than city churches are attributable to wren
his greatest achievement was st paul s cathedral
historians have always emphasised the localism in rural england with readers gaining the impression that the little villages were self contained communities
however charles phythian adams has used local evidence to paint a much more complex picture
data from the location of brides and grooms the sources of financial credit and patterns of migration indicate that each village was embedded in a network of villages and transportation routes
people could relocate from one village to another inside these networks without feeling like they were strangers
the network would include for example one or more market towns county centres or small cities
roads existed and were supplemented by turnpikes
however the chief means of transportation was typically by water since it was much cheaper to move wagon loads of commodities especially wool and cloth by boat than over land
much effort was made to improve the river system by removing obstacles
a mania to build canals enlarged the range and lowered costs
after the coming of railroads enlarged the range of local networks so much that the localism was overwhelmed
the th century was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their businesses around the globe
by the s britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world daniel defoe boasted
we are the most diligent nation in the world
vast trade rich manufactures mighty wealth universal correspondence and happy success have been constant companions of england and given us the title of an industrious people as an island there was little incentive for gaining new territory
in the tudor and stuart periods the main foreign policy goal besides protecting the homeland from invasion was the building a worldwide trading network for its merchants manufacturers shippers and financiers
this required a hegemonic royal navy so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world s trading routes or invade the british isles
wool was the great commercial product
home production of wool supplied internal needs while raw wool and wool cloth made up of exports
trade was extensive with france the low countries and the baltic
the hanseatic league of german trading cities had once controlled of the english trade but it rapidly lost that role after and was expelled from england in
the english colonies in the west indies provided sugar most of which was re exported to the continent
the american colonies provided land for migrants masts for the navy food for the west indies slaves and tobacco for the home and the re export trades
the british gained dominance in the trade with india and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave sugar and commercial trades originating in west africa and the west indies
exports were stable at million from to then soared million in to million in and million in
the government supported the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed london based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import export businesses across the world
each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region
the first enterprise was the muscovy company set up in to trade with russia
other prominent enterprises included he east india company and the hudson s bay company in canada
the company of royal adventurers trading to africa had been set up in to trade in gold ivory and slaves in africa it was reestablished as the royal african company in and focused on the slave trade
other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale only the netherlands emphasised trade as much as england
woolen cloth was the chief export and most important employer after agriculture
the golden era of the wiltshire woolen industry was in the reign of henry viii
in the medieval period raw wool had been exported but now england had an industry based on its million sheep
london and towns purchased wool from dealers and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth
they washed the wool carded it and spun it into thread which was then turned into cloth on a loom
export merchants known as merchant adventurers exported woolens into the netherlands and germany as well as other lands
the arrival of huguenots from france brought in new skills that expanded the industry
government intervention proved a disaster in the early th century
a new company convinced parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old well established company of merchant adventurers
arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product the new company got parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth
there was massive dislocation marketplace as large unsold quantities built up prices fell and unemployment rose
worst of all the dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from england
exports fell by a third
quickly the ban was lifted and the merchant adventurers got its monopoly back
however the trade losses became permanent
stuart england was primarily consumed with internal affairs
king james i reigned was sincerely devoted to peace not just for his three kingdoms of england scotland and ireland but for europe as a whole
he disliked puritans and jesuits alike because of their eagerness for warfare
he called himself rex pacificus king of peace at the time europe was deeply polarised and on the verge of the massive thirty years war with the smaller established protestant states facing the aggression of the larger catholic empires
on assuming the throne james made peace with catholic spain and made it his policy to marry his son to the spanish infanta princess maria anna in the spanish match
the marriage of james daughter princess elizabeth to frederick v elector palatine on february was more than the social event of the era the couple s union had important political and military implications
across europe the german princes were banding together in the protestant union headquartered in heidelberg the capital of the electoral palatinate
king james calculated that his daughter s marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the protestants
he thus planned to have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements
in his na vet he did not realise that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving the destruction of the other side
spain s ambassador diego sarmiento de acu a st count of gondomar knew how to manipulate the king
the catholics in spain as well as the emperor ferdinand ii the vienna based leader of the habsburgs and head of the holy roman empire were both heavily influenced by the catholic counter reformation
they had the goal of expelling protestantism from their domains
lord buckingham in the s wanted an alliance with spain
buckingham took charles with him to spain to woo the infanta in
however spain s terms were that james must drop britain s anti catholic intolerance or there would be no marriage
buckingham and charles were humiliated and buckingham became the leader of the widespread british demand for a war against spain
meanwhile the protestant princes looked to britain since it was the strongest of all the protestant countries to provide them with military support for their cause
james son in law and daughter became king and queen of bohemia an event which outraged vienna
the thirty years war began as the habsburg emperor ousted the new king and queen of the kingdom of bohemia and massacred their followers
the catholic duchy of bavaria then invaded the electoral palatinate and james s son in law begged for james s military intervention
james finally realised that his policies had backfired and refused these pleas
he successfully kept britain out of the european wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades
james s backup plan was to marry his son charles to a french catholic princess who would bring a handsome dowry
parliament and the british people were strongly opposed to any catholic marriage were demanding immediate war with spain and strongly favoured the protestant cause in europe
james had alienated both elite and popular opinion in britain and parliament was cutting back its financing
historians credit james for pulling back from a major war at the last minute and keeping britain in peace
frederick s election as king of bohemia in deepened the thirty years war a conflagration that destroyed millions of lives in central europe but only barely touched britain
the intense hatred and rivalry of catholic versus protestant princes was the main cause
king james determination to avoid involvement in the continental conflict even during the war fever of was one of the most significant and most positive aspects of his reign
during the kings made repeated efforts to colonise guiana in south america
they all failed and the lands suriname were ceded to the dutch republic in
the anglo dutch wars were a series of three wars which took place between the english and the dutch from to
the causes included political disputes and increasing competition from merchant shipping
religion was not a factor since both sides were protestant
the british in the first anglo dutch war had the naval advantage with larger numbers of more powerful ships of the line which were well suited to the naval tactics of the era
the british also captured numerous dutch merchant ships
in the second anglo dutch war dutch naval victories followed
this second war cost london ten times more than it had planned on and the king sued for peace in with the treaty of breda
it ended the fights over mercantilism that is the use of force to protect and expand national trade industry and shipping meanwhile the french were building up fleets that threatened both the netherlands and great britain
in the third anglo dutch war the british counted on a new alliance with france but the outnumbered dutch outsailed both of them and king charles ii ran short of money and political support
the dutch gained domination of sea trading routes until
the british gained the thriving colony of new netherland which was renamed as the province of new york
the stuart period began in with the death of queen elizabeth i and the accession of king james i
there was a break in the middle but the stuarts were restored to the throne in
it ended in after years with the death of queen anne and the accession of king george i the first king of the house of hanover
the yellow bars show stuart rule
the house of stuart produced six monarchs who ruled during this period
