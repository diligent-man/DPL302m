older historiography came two flavour whig history interpretation marxist historiography interpretation
whig model dominant century saw inherent conflict irresistible truly english ideal liberty individualism represented puritan roundhead overcoming medieval concept king unquestionable voice god
historian became increasingly uncomfortable writing history predetermined search idealistic goal whig approach lost favour first world war
meanwhile late century remarkably high quality scholarship archivally oriented historian especially samuel rawson gardiner charles harding firth provided rich detail national politics practically day-by-day basis
post-war era class conflict marxist interpretation emerged powerful explanation seemed tie detail together
portrayed battle declining crown upper class feudalistic aristocracy versus rising middle class gentry
main argument wa civil war wa challenge launched rising gentry class overcome power crown aristocracy
marxist like hill saw war england's bourgeois revolutionthat overthrow outdated feudal order new middle class
class conflict interpretation wa vigorously challenged conservative scholar hugh trevor-roper argued gentry wa rising instead felt status wa undermined
fought back exclusion power patronage payoff extravagant court king's swelling state bureaucracy nouveau riche financier london
revisionist came fore rejecting whig marxist approach assumed historical event automatic playing mysterious force libertyand class conflict new microscopic local study demonstrated class difference two side varied greatly place place explain much
revisionist dispatched older model post-revisionists began offer multiplicity small-scale explanation fitted particular localities
historian give much emphasis religiosity diversity local situations
instead argument massive popular anger built early century caused civil war current approach depict early stuart period marked harmony good government popular support
could civil war current scholarly solution emphasise historian call british problem involving impossible tension occurring single person tried hold together three kingdom entirely different geographical ethnic political religious value traditions
widespread dissatisfaction lack king led restoration wa based strong support inviting charles ii take throne

england france would war almost continuously short interlude made possible treaty ryswick
combined english dutch fleet could overpower france far-flung naval war france still superiority land
william wanted neutralise advantage allying leopold habsburg emperor holy roman empire wa based vienna austria
