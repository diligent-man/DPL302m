each of the four series of books in the compilation is divided into volumes numbered from the beginning of the series with roman numerals
in series ii iii and iv each volume coincides with a book
in series i however it was found to be usually impracticable beginning with volume x to confine volumes as units of content within single books
volume x and most subsequent volumes in series i were therefore issued in parts distinguished by subsidiary roman numerals each occupying a separate book
beginning with volume xxiv arabic serial numbers were also printed on the backs of the books issued although these numbers were not included on the title pages and are therefore not universally used in citations

because of the enormous volume of material the lengthy time period of collection and publication and the constant and continuing process of correction by veterans of both sides still living contemporaneously the records are perhaps the most intensely peer reviewed documents in historical publication
historians have argued that some of the modifications made years after the events have decreased the accuracy of the records and were made simply to enhance personal reputations or to denigrate the reputations of rivals
