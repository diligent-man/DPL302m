time introduction line system wa referred high definition wa compared earlier system although lower definition line later standards
british government set committee television committee advise future tv broadcasting
committee recommended high definition service defined system line run bbc established
two tender received one baird company offering line mechanical system emi offering line all-electronic one
television committee advised unable choose two system tender accepted two system run together experimental period
broadcasting resulting bbc television service alexandra palace site began november first time-sharing broadcast line baird system however january three month trial baird system wa abandoned favour exclusive broadcasting line marconi-emi system vhf
soon became apparent television reception wa also possible well outside original intended service area
february engineer rca research station riverhead long island new york u able receive bbc signal km mi away due signal bounced back earth ionosphere
image recorded included two original three bbc announcer jasmine bligh brief shot elizabeth cowell excerpt unknown period costume drama bbc's station identification transmitted beginning end day's programmes
bbc temporarily ceased transmission september day german invasion poland outbreak world war ii wa imminent
bbc television service recommenced distant reception report received various part world including italy south africa india middle east north america caribbean
bbc lost monopoly british television market following year commercial network itv comprising consortium regional company wa launched
bbc launched bbc service uhf using line system older set could receive
several year bbc itv transmitted using line bbc line standard way receive wa use complex dual-standard line vhf uhf receiver
introduction colour bbc necessitated even complex dual-standard set receive three channels
november bbc itv also started broadcasting line pal colour uhf
programming wa entirely produced using new standard thus line broadcast served rebroadcast monochrome people newer receivers
thereafter receiver simpler single standard design could receive legacy line transmissions
one reason long switchover period wa difficulty matching coverage level new uhf line service high level geographic coverage achieved line vhf service
last line transmission seen january scotland officially shut one day earlier rest uk although actually switched various point next day
frequency used line system initially left empty later sold used purpose including dab trunked pmr commercial two-way radio systems
ireland's use line system began launch telefs ireann extended two main transmitter five relay serving east north country
wa many people area already line set receiving uk broadcast wale northern ireland
telefs ireann's primary standard wa line began using summer two year uk line channels
last line relay county donegal turned main transmitter shut free frequency rt relay fed standard converter local line transmitter
last five year rt's line simulcasting simple orthicon converter wa used essentially line camera pointed line monitor expensive system converter rt previously used inoperablethe line system wa used rediffusion television cable television service hong kong established making first british colony
service line system ended replaced line pal system free-to-air broadcast
brief time experimental line transmission station montrouge france eindhoven netherlands czechoslovakia switzerland
united state fcc briefly approved line color television standard october wa developed cbs
used rotating color wheel reduced number scan line increased field rate effective frame rate frame per second
however majority surviving line programme form black white film telerecordings usually optical soundtracks
occasionally video re-recording would employed instead line camera pointing line monitor
preserve original field interlaced format geometrical distortion owing curvature crt monitor used time
line programming may recorded played unmodified vhs betamax video recorder long input recorder baseband rather rf
thus various modern video recording line programming also exist
betamax wa sometimes preferred dropout compensator could switched certain model use pcm digital audio decoders
audio us amplitude modulation rather frequency modulation use modern analogue systems
addition system wa broadcast aspect ratio april changed common format
system transmitter used vestigial sideband transmission single exception alexandra palace london closed wa replaced crystal palace
since mid-s ha standard practice use field frequency equal ac main electric supply frequency submultiple thereof hz country hz america studio lighting generally us alternating current supply lamp synchronized field frequency unwelcome strobe effect could appear tv pictures
secondly smoothing filtering power supply circuit early tv receiver wa rather poor ripple superimposed dc could cause visual interference
however main problem wa susceptibility electron beam crt deflected stray magnetic field nearby transformer motors
picture wa locked main frequency interference would least static screen thus relatively unnoticeable
earliest tv set used main transformer care taken design prevent transformer's stray magnetic field disturbing electron beam crt
interlaced system requires accurate positioning scanning line horizontal vertical timebase must precise ratio
done passing one series electronic divider circuit produce other
therefore ha straightforward mathematical relationship line field frequency latter derived dividing former
technology constraint meant division process could done using small integer preferably greater good stability
line system used vertical frequency hz standard ac main supply frequency britain horizontal one hz using frame rate x derived from
used vestigial sideband filtering total bandwidth line tv channel mhz significantly le mhz required line system replaced britain
system country used anything six fourteen megahertz bandwidth per channel
use vhf frequency combined narrow vision bandwidth signal vhf low band frequency le affected noise bandwidth reduced meant line signal could received well even marginal conditions
therefore wa possible cover virtually uk relatively small number transmitting stations
use rather fm sound use positive rather negative video modulation made line signal prone audible visible impulse interference generated ignition system vehicles
interference manifested loud popping sound large bright spot picture viewer found much noticeable dark spot encountered interference encountered signal using negative video modulation
positive modulation interference could easily similar amplitude sync pulse represented transmitter output
early time-base circuit le able discriminate signal picture would break up
contrast negative modulation sync pulse represent peak transmitter output output
result impulse interference would cause visual dark spot wa large enough affect synchronisation picture
interference wa large enough picture wa probably unwatchable anyway
later introduction flywheel sync circuit rendered picture much stable could alleviated problem positive modulation
almost television system succeeded line system adopted negative modulation reason alone
first-generation agc merely detected average value transmitted signal however due positively modulated carrier peak power represented peak white guaranteed present
thus completely black picture agc circuit would increase rf gain restore average carrier amplitude
fact total light output early tv set wa practically constant regardless picture content
mid-s several manufacturer started introduce gated-agc system avoid issue
pulse would trigger gate would sample received video signal back porch wa guaranteed black-level transmitted end line-sync pulse start picture information
introduction negative modulation later system simplified problem peak carrier power represented sync pulse always guaranteed present
simple peak-detector agc circuit would detect amplitude sync pulse thus measuring strength received signal
line system produced noticeable hz whistle many set equal number line per second
high-pitched whistle wa caused magnetostriction line output transformer
crt-based television system produce noise higher number line per second later standard produce frequency pal's hz ntsc's hz upper end audible spectrum people able hear
modern set using plasma lcd oled display technology completely free effect composed million individually controllable element rather using single magnetically deflected beam requirement generate scanning signal
absence equalizing pulse facilitate interlace wa defended start bbc service ground caused lack interlace field synchronizing separator integrator type even time numerous circuit gave completely accurate interlace without equalizing pulses
question wa raised time time series test conducted cooperation british radio equipment manufacturers' association confirmed wa general need equalizing pulses
larger tv screen size scanned line fat enough give coverage crt
result wa lined picture darkness horizontal scanned line reducing picture brightness contrast
larger screen set often used spot wobble oscillator slightly elongated scanning spot vertically high frequency avoid line separation effect without reducing horizontal sharpness
spot wobble wa also utilised making telerecordings line programmes
late early-to-mid experimental colour broadcast made uk line system using ntsc colour encoding encoding wa enhancement original ntsc monochrome standard added ntsc standard could also provide colour broadcasting
subcarrier frequency wa mhz time line frequency signal bandwidth khz q signal bandwidth khz
test pal secam ntsc subcarrier frequency also attempted
broadcast uhf also experimental technology time others carried regular vhf network outside normal broadcasting hours
adopted ntsc line monochrome standard commercial broadcasting subsequent effort made upgrade standard could also accommodate compatible colour broadcasting system
eventually effort would prove successful repeated attempt consistently produced unsatisfactory result united state federal communication commission fcc officially approved commercial broadcast alternate line broadcasting system columbia broadcasting system cbs developed past decade
system wa field-sequential colour system electronically transmitted line monochrome picture
colour wa provided mechanically mean synchronized rotating transparent red-green-blue disk wa placed front receiver screen
regular broadcast channel used transmit line system signal million existing ntsc line television receiver could correctly process audio portion transmission unless set modified would display jumbled picture
cbs aired variety show special entitled premiere june officially launch commercial line colour broadcasting four month later cbs ended colour broadcasts
cbs's effort hindered beginning widespread lack acceptance ultimate setback came end year us
government temporarily banned manufacture colour television ostensibly conserve resource korean war
place approved newly improved satisfactory second ntsc line standard developed rca
provided colour broadcasting yet remained compatible existing line monochrome sets
