the line monochrome analogue television broadcasting system was the first fully electronic television system to be used in regular broadcasting
the number of television lines influences the image resolution or quality of the picture
it was introduced with the bbc television service in suspended for the duration of world war ii and remained in operation in the uk until
it was also used between and in ireland as well as from to for the rediffusion television cable service in hong kong
sometimes called the marconi emi system it was developed in by the emi research team led by isaac shoenberg
the figure of lines had been chosen following discussions over sunday lunch at the home of alan blumlein
the system used interlacing emi had been experimenting with a line all electronic interlaced system since
in the system the scanning lines were broadcast in two complementary fields times per second creating frames per second
the actual image was lines high and interlaced with additional unused lines making the frame up to lines to give the slow circuitry time to prepare for the next frame in modern terms it would be described as i
at the time of its introduction the line system was referred to as high definition which it was compared to earlier systems although of lower definition than line and later standards
in the british government set up a committee the television committee to advise on the future of tv broadcasting
the committee recommended that a high definition service defined by them as being a system of lines or more to be run by the bbc be established
the recommendation was accepted and tenders were sought from industry
two tenders were received one from the baird company offering a line mechanical system and the other from emi offering a line all electronic one
the television committee advised that they were unable to choose between the two systems and that both tenders should be accepted the two systems to be run together for an experimental period
broadcasting of the resulting bbc television service from its alexandra palace site began in november at first time sharing broadcasts with the line baird system however in january after three months of trials the baird system was abandoned in favour of exclusive broadcasting with the line marconi emi system on vhf
this became the standard for all british tv broadcasts until the s
it soon became apparent that television reception was also possible well outside the original intended service area
in february engineers at the rca research station riverhead long island new york in the us were able to receive the bbc signal km mi away due to the signal being bounced back to earth from the ionosphere
a few minutes of programming were recorded on mm movie film
this is now considered to be the only surviving example of pre war live british television
the images recorded included two of the original three bbc announcers jasmine bligh and in a brief shot elizabeth cowell an excerpt from an unknown period costume drama and the bbc s station identification transmitted at the beginning and end of the day s programmes
the bbc temporarily ceased transmissions on september the day of the german invasion of poland for the outbreak of world war ii was imminent
after the bbc television service recommenced in distant reception reports were received from various parts of the world including italy south africa india the middle east north america and the caribbean
the bbc lost its monopoly of the british television market in and the following year the commercial network itv comprising a consortium of regional companies was launched
in the bbc launched its bbc service on uhf using only a line system which older sets could not receive
for several years bbc and itv transmitted using the line and bbc with the line standard the only way to receive them all was to use a complex dual standard and line vhf and uhf receiver
the introduction of colour on bbc in necessitated an even more complex dual standard set to receive all three channels
in november bbc and itv also started broadcasting in line pal colour on uhf
their programming was now entirely produced using the new standard and thus the line broadcasts served only as a rebroadcast in monochrome for people who did not have the newer receivers
thereafter receivers were of a simpler single standard design which could not receive the legacy line transmissions
one reason for the long switchover period was the difficulty in matching the coverage level of the new uhf line service with the very high level of geographic coverage achieved with the line vhf service
the last line transmissions were seen on january in scotland they had been officially shut down one day earlier in the rest of the uk although they were actually switched off at various points the next day
this left only the uhf pal system in operation in the uk
the frequencies used by the line system were initially left empty but were later sold off they are now used for other purposes including dab and trunked pmr commercial two way radio systems
ireland s use of the line system began in with the launch of telef s ireann but only extended to two main transmitters and their five relays serving the east and north of the country
this was because many people in these areas already had line sets for receiving uk broadcasts from wales or northern ireland
telef s ireann s primary standard was line it began using this in the summer of more than two years before the uk had any line channels
the last line relays in county donegal were turned off in the main transmitters had been shut down in to free up frequencies for rt and after then the relays had been fed by standards converters from the local line transmitter
for the last five years of rt s line simulcasting a simple orthicon converter was used essentially a line camera pointed at a line monitor as the more expensive system converters that rt had previously used were now inoperable the line system was used in the rediffusion television cable television service in hong kong established in making it both the first british colony and the first predominantly chinese city to have television
the service of line system ended in replaced by line pal system free to air broadcast
for a brief time in there were experimental line transmissions from stations in montrouge in france and eindhoven in the netherlands czechoslovakia and switzerland
on the united states the fcc had briefly approved a line color television standard in october which was developed by cbs
the cbs system was incompatible with existing black and white receivers
it used a rotating color wheel reduced the number of scan lines from to and increased the field rate from to but had an effective frame rate of only frames per second
a few line videotapes still survive
however the majority of surviving line programmes are in the form of black and white film telerecordings usually with optical soundtracks
occasionally video re recording would be employed instead with a line camera pointing at a line monitor
this preserves the original field interlaced format but with some geometrical distortions owing to the curvature of the crt monitors used at the time
line programming may be recorded and played on an unmodified vhs or betamax video recorder as long as the input to the recorder is baseband rather than rf
thus various modern video recordings of line programming also exist
betamax was sometimes preferred for this as the dropout compensator could be switched off on certain models for use with pcm digital audio decoders
line is system a in the ccir assignment of broadcast systems
the audio uses amplitude modulation rather than the frequency modulation in use on modern analogue systems
in addition the system was broadcast in an aspect ratio of until april when it changed to the more common format
all system a transmitters used vestigial sideband transmission with the single exception of alexandra palace in london which closed down in when it was replaced by crystal palace
since the mid s it has been standard practice to use a field frequency equal to the ac mains electric supply frequency or a submultiple thereof hz in most countries hz in the americas because studio lighting generally uses an alternating current supply to the lamps and if these were not synchronized with the field frequency an unwelcome strobe effect could appear on tv pictures
secondly the smoothing filtering of power supply circuits in early tv receivers was rather poor and ripple superimposed on the dc could cause visual interference
however the main problem was the susceptibility of the electron beam in the crt being deflected by stray magnetic fields from nearby transformers or motors
if the picture was locked to the mains frequency this interference would at least be static on the screen and thus relatively unnoticeable
the very earliest tv sets used a mains transformer care had to be taken in design to prevent the transformer s stray magnetic field from disturbing the electron beam in the crt
because an interlaced system requires accurate positioning of scanning lines the horizontal and vertical timebase must be in a precise ratio
this is done by passing the one through a series of electronic divider circuits to produce the other
each division is by an odd integer
therefore there has to be a straightforward mathematical relationship between the line and field frequencies the latter being derived by dividing down from the former
the technology constraints of the s meant that this division process could only be done using small integers preferably no greater than for good stability
the number of lines was odd because of interlace
the line system used a vertical frequency of hz standard ac mains supply frequency in britain and a horizontal one of hz or using the frame rate x with being derived from
when used with vestigial sideband filtering the total bandwidth of a line tv channel is mhz significantly less than the mhz required by the line system i which replaced it in britain
systems in other countries used anything between six and fourteen megahertz of bandwidth per channel
the use of vhf frequencies combined with the narrow vision bandwidth am signals at vhf low band frequencies are less affected by noise as bandwidth is reduced meant that line signals could be received well even under marginal conditions
therefore it was possible to cover virtually all of the uk with a relatively small number of transmitting stations
the use of am rather than fm for sound and the use of positive rather than negative video modulation made line signals very prone to audible and visible impulse interference such as that generated by the ignition systems of vehicles
such interference manifested itself as a loud popping on sound and large bright spots on the picture which viewers found much more noticeable than the dark spots encountered when such interference is encountered on a signal using negative video modulation
with positive modulation interference could easily be of similar amplitude to the sync pulses which were represented by of the transmitter output
the early time base circuits were less able to discriminate between the signals and the picture would break up
by contrast in negative modulation sync pulses represent peak transmitter output output
as a result impulse interference would cause visual dark spots before it was large enough to affect the synchronisation of the picture
if the interference was large enough the picture was probably unwatchable anyway
the later introduction of flywheel sync circuits rendered the picture much more stable but these could not have alleviated some of the problems with positive modulation
almost all television systems that succeeded the line system adopted negative modulation for this reason alone
the agc circuit was problematic
first generation agc merely detected the average value of the transmitted signal however due to the positively modulated carrier peak power represented peak white not guaranteed to be present
thus for a completely black picture the agc circuit would increase the rf gain to restore the average carrier amplitude
the result was a screen that was not black but mid grey
in fact the total light output of early tv sets was practically constant regardless of the picture content
by the mid s several manufacturers started to introduce gated agc systems to avoid this issue
a delayed pulse was derived from the recovered line sync signal
this pulse would trigger a gate which would sample the received video signal during the back porch which was a guaranteed black level transmitted between the end of the line sync pulse and the start of the picture information
the introduction of negative modulation in later systems simplified the problem because peak carrier power represented sync pulses which were always guaranteed to be present
a simple peak detector agc circuit would detect the amplitude of only the sync pulses thus measuring the strength of the received signal
the line system produced a noticeable hz whistle in many sets equal to the number of lines per second
this high pitched whistle was caused by magnetostriction in the line output transformer
this is a common artifact in sets that use a cathode ray tube
while all crt based television systems produce such a noise the higher number of lines per second in later standards produces frequencies pal s hz and ntsc s hz that are at the upper end of the audible spectrum which not all people are able to hear
modern sets using plasma lcd or oled display technology are completely free of this effect as they are composed of a million or more individually controllable elements rather than using a single magnetically deflected beam so there is no requirement to generate the scanning signal
the absence of equalizing pulses to facilitate interlace was defended at the start of the bbc service on the grounds that it only caused a lack of interlace with field synchronizing separators of the integrator type and that there were even at that time numerous other circuits which gave completely accurate interlace without equalizing pulses
the question was raised again from time to time but a series of tests conducted during in cooperation with the british radio equipment manufacturers association confirmed that there was no general need for equalizing pulses
on some larger tv screen sizes the scanned lines were not fat enough to give coverage of the crt
the result was a lined picture with darkness between each horizontal scanned line reducing picture brightness and contrast
larger screen sets often used a spot wobble oscillator that slightly elongated the scanning spot vertically at high frequency to avoid this line separation effect without reducing horizontal sharpness
spot wobble was also utilised when making telerecordings of line programmes
during the late s and early to mid s some experimental colour broadcasts were made in the uk with the line system using ntsc colour encoding this encoding was a enhancement of the original ntsc monochrome standard added to the ntsc standard so that it could also provide for colour broadcasting
the subcarrier frequency was mhz times line frequency with an i signal bandwidth of khz and a q signal bandwidth of khz
tests with pal secam and other ntsc subcarrier frequencies were also attempted
some of these broadcasts were on uhf also an experimental technology at the time while others were carried over the regular vhf network outside of normal broadcasting hours
after the u s
adopted the ntsc line monochrome standard for commercial broadcasting in subsequent efforts were made to upgrade the standard so that it could also accommodate a compatible colour broadcasting system
eventually these efforts would prove successful but because repeated attempts had consistently produced unsatisfactory results in the united states federal communications commission fcc officially approved for commercial broadcast an alternate line broadcasting system which the columbia broadcasting system cbs had developed over the past decade
this system was a field sequential colour system which electronically transmitted a line monochrome picture
colour was provided mechanically by means of a synchronized rotating transparent red green blue disk which was placed in front of the receiver screen
regular broadcast channels were used to transmit the line system signals but the millions of existing ntsc line television receivers could only correctly process the audio portion of these transmissions so unless these sets were modified they would only display a jumbled picture
cbs aired a variety show special entitled premiere on june to officially launch commercial line colour broadcasting but just four months later cbs ended its colour broadcasts
cbs s efforts were hindered from the beginning by a widespread lack of acceptance and the ultimate setback came at the end of the year when the u s
government temporarily banned the manufacture of colour televisions ostensibly to conserve resources during the korean war
in the fcc rescinded its approval of the cbs line colour system
in its place it approved a newly improved and now satisfactory second ntsc line standard which had been developed by rca
it provided for colour broadcasting yet remained compatible with existing line monochrome sets
