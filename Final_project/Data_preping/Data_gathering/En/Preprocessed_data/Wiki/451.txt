slavery in the ancient world from the earliest known recorded evidence in sumer to the pre medieval antiquity mediterranean cultures comprised a mixture of debt slavery slavery as a punishment for crime and the enslavement of prisoners of war
masters could free slaves and in many cases such freedmen went on to rise to positions of power
this would include those children born into slavery but who were actually the children of the master of the house
the slave master would ensure that his children were not condemned to a life of slavery
the institution of slavery condemned a majority of slaves to agricultural and industrial labor and they lived hard lives

the sumerian king code of ur nammu includes laws relating to slaves written circa bce it is the oldest known tablet containing a law code surviving today
the babylonian code of hammurabi dating to c
bce also makes distinctions between the freeborn freed and slave
hittite texts from anatolia include laws regulating the institution of slavery
of particular interest is a law stipulating that reward for the capture of an escaped slave would be higher if the slave had already succeeded in crossing the halys river and getting farther away from the center of hittite civilization from which it can be concluded that at least some of the slaves kept by the hittites possessed a realistic chance of escaping and regaining their freedom possibly by finding refuge with other kingdoms or ethnic groups
in ancient egypt slaves were mainly obtained through prisoners of war
other ways people could become slaves was by inheriting the status from their parents
one could also become a slave on account of his inability to pay his debts

young slaves could not be put to hard work and had to be brought up by the mistress of the household
not all slaves went to houses
some also sold themselves to temples or were assigned to temples by the king

captive slaves were mostly assigned to the temples or a king and they had to do manual labor
the worst thing that could happen to a slave was being assigned to the quarries and mines
private ownership of slaves captured in war and given by the king to their captor certainly occurred at the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty bce
sales of slaves occurred in the twenty fifth dynasty bce and contracts of servitude survive from the twenty sixth dynasty c
bce and from the reign of darius apparently such a contract then required the consent of the slave
in the jewish bible the old testament there are many references to slaves giving rules for how they should behave and be treated

in the debate over slavery in england and the united states in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries both supporters of slavery and abolitionists cited the bible as support for their views
the study of slavery in ancient greece remains a complex subject in part because of the many different levels of servility from traditional chattel slave through various forms of serfdom such as helots penestai and several other classes of non citizens
most philosophers of classical antiquity defended slavery as a natural and necessary institution
aristotle believed that the practice of any manual or banausic job should disqualify the practitioner from citizenship
quoting euripides aristotle declared all non greeks slaves by birth fit for nothing but obedience
by the late th century bce passages start to appear from other greeks especially in athens which opposed slavery and suggested that every person living in a city state had the right to freedom subject to no one except those laws decided using majoritarianism
alcidamas for example said god has set everyone free
no one is made a slave by nature furthermore a fragment of a poem of philemon also shows that he opposed slavery
greece in pre roman times consisted of many independent city states each with its own laws
all of them permitted slavery but the rules differed greatly from region to region

it startled other greeks that athenians tolerated back chat from slaves old oligarch constitution of the athenians
pausanias writing nearly seven centuries after the event states that athenian slaves fought together with athenian freemen in the battle of marathon and the monuments memorialize them
spartan serfs helots could win freedom through bravery in battle
plutarch mentions that during the battle of salamis athenians did their best to save their women children and slaves
on the other hand much of the wealth of athens came from its silver mines at laurion where slaves working in extremely poor conditions produced the greatest part of the silver although recent excavations seem to suggest the presence of free workers at laurion
during the peloponnesian war between athens and sparta twenty thousand athenian slaves including both mine workers and artisans escaped to the spartans when their army camped at decelea in bc
other than flight resistance on the part of slaves occurred only rarely

house slaves living in their master s home and working at home on the land or in a shop
freelance slaves who didn t live with their master but worked in their master s shop or fields and paid him taxes from money they got from their own properties insofar as society allowed slaves to own property
public slaves who worked as police officers ushers secretaries street sweepers etc
war captives andrapoda who served primarily in unskilled tasks at which they could be chained for example rowers in commercial ships or miners in some areas of greece there existed a class of unfree laborers tied to the land and called penestae in thessaly and helots in sparta
penestae and helots did not rate as chattel slaves one could not freely buy and sell them
the comedies of menander show how the athenians preferred to view a house slave as an enterprising and unscrupulous rascal who must use his wits to profit from his master rescue him from his troubles or gain him the girl of his dreams
