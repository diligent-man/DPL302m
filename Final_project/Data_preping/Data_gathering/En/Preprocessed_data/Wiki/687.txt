furthermore positions not regarded as menial may nonetheless qualify as dead end jobs and forms of underemployment
a specialized employee working in a small firm in an underdeveloped local market for example might have few opportunities for advancement within the company while simultaneously facing a dearth of opportunities outside it
most dead end jobs offer little to no transferable skills and may hinder workers from pursuing careers in other companies
dead end jobs such as an internal auditing position within a firm according to cfo com should only be considered and accepted if an individual has a pre calculated exit strategy so that one is not stuck permanently within a position of no opportunities
law librarians and individuals who join firms that are enlisted into estate or trust work consist of low paying occupations which translate to dead end jobs with no opportunities of growth
few fast food franchise employees receive any type of work benefits and their wages are so low that they are unable to make enough income to supply themselves with life s basic necessities especially if they are employed part time
part time employees often need to work two to three jobs to make ends meet or require government assistance in the form of food stamps at the expense of other taxpayers to live
most of these fast food positions are considered dead end jobs because of the traits listed above in addition to the lack of opportunities within the fast food realm and the inability to organize to improve their working conditions
presently any positive modification to the wages and benefits for low paid fast food employees to make the occupation more appealing could signal a movement consisting of a mass firing of employees in favor of kiosks and robots
as andrew puzder former ceo of carl s jr
and hardee s stated robots and kiosks are always polite they always upsell they never take a vacation they never show up late there s never a slip and fall or an age sex or race discrimination case
dead end jobs are not limited to menial labor retail or fast food roles

a survey was conducted in scotland to obtain feedback on issues regarding education and professional topics
the results revealed that only one out of registered mental nurses rmns would recommend other individuals in pursuing their profession
over half of the participants in the survey mentioned that they have reached their career s highest level
additionally reprofiling exercises and skill mix activities conducted within this profession has led to a decrease of registered nurses within the industry
of the respondents also stated that their organizations provide no opportunities to grow despite being interested in progressing within their career
one out of six participants exclaimed that the position of a register mental nurse is a dead end job due to the reasons above in addition to there being no clear direction for their career path
because of these downfalls nurses who have reached their highest capacity demonstrate more signs of despondency about their career path compared to their counterparts employed at lower increments
a job residing within the realm of medical inspection is also considered a dead end job
there is an absence of progression in the areas of status responsibilities and salary for this current field of work
smos or school medical officers have experienced dissatisfaction with the lack of progression as described above in addition to the redundancy of work related activities
the responsibility of medical inspection of school children encompasses mainly of the routine inspection of a large population of children and presents very little to no feature of the greater interest in medicine
the starting salary of these workers is low and inadequate and they are not supplemented with any substantial raises to compensate their low starting salaries
certified nursing assistants cnas also known as long term care workers represent the frontline workers who assist individuals with disabilities with instrumental activities such as using the phone and daily activities such as bathing or eating
it is a challenge to recruit them and retain them as employees
according to the american health care association in there was a turnover rate for this occupation in nursing homes of per year
cnas earned a median hourly wage of only in which is slightly higher than other occupations such as grocery cashiers in and fast food cooks in
they also receive very few fringe benefits
approximately of cnas do not have health insurance provided by their firms

in europe temporary employment is utilized frequently and represents the heart of political and economic debates
these temporary contracts and job positions allow an increase in labor market flexibility and providing employers with the ability to dodge strict government regulations regarding the firing and hiring of employees as well as avoid regulations concerning fringe and pay benefits
previous research confirmed that a wage penalty existed with the utilization of fixed term contracts
this wage penalty was applied to young workers entering an occupation with low human capital investments and lasted for the first few years of employment but could lead to a pay off if the worker is viewed as highly productive in their occupation when pursuing a permanent contract
this is known as the learning effect and can be quite large
this form of contract can be a considered a dead end job if the worker is unable to meet the demands necessary by the employer or company
a study was performed within the united kingdom and germany on the topic of temporary employment conducted by fixed term contracts
the study indicated that for fixed term contracts some jobs consisting of a fixed term contract can lead to permanent employment with good benefits and exist as a stepping stone while others lead employees within a series of different fixed term contracts and positions with little room for improvement which in essence is another form of a dead end job
in countries such as italy spain and france there is a dramatic increase of temporary positions and short term contracts due to the benefit of being able to lay off temporary employees without restrictions or incurring statutory redundancy payments
because of this the number of temporary workers within the workforce has doubled between the years of and
temporary jobs do come at a cost
there is concern about lack of opportunities for career advancement for temporary workers in addition to the quality of these types of occupations
case study information has been discovered confirming that employer enthusiasm within the workplace has decreased due to the utilization of temporary jobs with dead end characteristics which resulted in low levels of motivation and retention of such employees within a firm
a study was conducted by alison l
booth marco francesconi and jeff frank which concluded that individuals participating in seasonal casual or fixed term employment report that they have not received the work related training necessary for the occupation and experience lower levels of job satisfaction in comparison to permanent ones
the study concluded that there is evidence that temporary jobs can be a stepping stone to a permanent job within a firm
the median time within a temporary position before such a switch is between months and and a half years and depends upon the gender of the individual and the type of contract whether it is a fixed term or seasonal contract
seasonal casual positions yield very little chance of obtaining a permanent position and can be categorized as dead end positions
fixed term contracts have a larger potential of being transitioned into a permanent one however males suffer a permanent earning loss during the transition in comparison to males who started in a permanent position from the beginning
females however within a fixed term position fully catch up to the wages of their permanent position counterparts
since the s occupations within many industrialized nations such as the united states have become less secure
as the traditional job hierarchies within a firm deteriorate and companies downsize due to unexpected circumstances such as a recession or employer changes both involuntary and voluntary the reduction in security in firms become more frequent
instead of residing under one employer and being promoted within the one company employees are climbing the corporate ladder by switching between employers
because of this many employees cannot expect to reside within the same firm for the next to years
based on research results conducted by anne kathrin kronberg within the emory university the externalization of job mobility affects gender disparities depending upon whether individuals work in bad or good occupations in addition to whether they leave their firms voluntary or not
if an individual leaves a job voluntarily then the gender gap closes the fastest within a benign occupation while a dead end job has stagnant results
if a worker leaves a job involuntarily gender disparities run narrow within bad jobs
for good jobs the gender gap closes initially but opens again swiftly in the s
the study s definition of good or bad was whether the occupation provided pension plans and health insurance to their employees in addition to whether the individual s earnings were above the federal poverty threshold of percent
before individuals with disabilities were subject to discrimination by being denied equal job opportunities companies failing to provide such individuals with reasonable accommodations being assigned to dead end classified occupations and underutilization as a whole
the phrase an individual with a disability references a person who has either a mental or physical impairment that limits the ability to perform one or several major life activities or is regarded to have or has had a record of an impairment or disability
on july the americans with disabilities act of ada was implemented and took effect to assist individuals with disabilities by eliminating such employment barriers so that they could fully participate in society and receive the same job opportunities that any other individual would receive
one possible side effect of being stationed in a dead end job for too long is the feeling of a lack of motivation and boredom
another possible side effect can be a short temper replacing the patience that the worker once had when first starting the position
the lack of motivation experienced by individuals within a dead end job can lead to discouragement in the direction of their career path and can cause their level of performance to suffer by either taking longer to complete a certain activity or task and or making more mistakes than usual due to a lack of concentration
all of these characteristics can lead an individual to an occupational crisis state
occupational crisis consists of an individual demonstrating a state of mixed negative thoughts and emotions consisting mainly of work related anxiety and frustration feelings of reaching a dead end within their career negative interpersonal relationships and experiences within the workplace and the consistent consideration of a career change due to making previous incorrect job choices
the occupational crisis scale was created to assist employees in identifying whether they were in a dead end in their career
three studies were performed to confirm the validity of the occupational crisis scale with an assorted number of finnish workers of them female in various occupations such as police officers firemen private caretakers labor welfare advisors and nurses
of individuals were ranked within the occupation crisis state based on this study and a preliminary study amongst vocation counseling clients
to remedy these psychological issues stemming from dead end jobs and their related work stress vocational help can be obtained so that problems do not continue to escalate or accumulate
for some individuals more time may be needed to consider what they desire in their work life and the utilization of occasional sick time education or vacation could help remedy their occupational crisis state
for other workers it may require a change in their work tasks occupation within their firm or a completely different job for them to experience a more satisfying life
vocational help can also assist workers with developing better coping skills which aid the individuals in handling their stresses and anxieties in all facets of life
