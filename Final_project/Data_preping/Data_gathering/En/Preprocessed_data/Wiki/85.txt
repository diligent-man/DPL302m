mont blanc french mont blanc m bl italian monte bianco monte bja ko both meaning white mountain is the highest mountain in the alps and western europe rising m ft above sea level
it is the second most prominent mountain in europe after mount elbrus and it is the eleventh most prominent mountain summit in the world
it gives its name to the mont blanc massif which straddles parts of france italy and switzerland
mont blanc s summit lies on the watershed line between the valleys of ferret and veny in italy and the valleys of montjoie and arve in france
ownership of the summit area has long been a subject of dispute between france and italy
the mont blanc massif is popular for outdoor activities like hiking climbing trail running and winter sports like skiing and snowboarding
the most popular climbing route to the summit of mont blanc is the go ter route which typically takes two days
the three towns and their communes which surround mont blanc are courmayeur in aosta valley italy and saint gervais les bains and chamonix in haute savoie france
the latter town was the site of the first winter olympics
a cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from courmayeur to chamonix through the col du g ant
the km mile mont blanc tunnel constructed between and runs beneath the mountain and is a major transalpine transport route
mont blanc and adjacent mountains in the massif are predominately formed from a large intrusion of granite termed a batholith which was forced up through a basement layer of gneiss and mica schists during the variscan mountain forming event of the late palaeozoic period
the summit of mont blanc is located at the point of contact of these two rock types
to the south west the granite contact is of a more intrusive nature whereas to the north east it changes to being more tectonic
the granites are mostly very coarse grained ranging in type from microgranites to porphyroid granites
the massif is tilted in a north westerly direction and was cut by near vertical recurrent faults lying in a north south direction during the variscan orogeny
further faulting with shear zones subsequently occurred during the later alpine orogeny
repeated tectonic phases have caused breakup of the rock in multiple directions and in overlapping planes
finally past and current glaciation caused significant sculpting of the landscape into its present day form
the first systematic account of the minerals of the mont blanc area was published in by venance payot
his list entitled statistique min ralogique des environs du mt blanc catalogued mineral types although it also included those present only as very small components of rocks
if these are excluded it is known today that at least separate mineral species occur across the wider range of the mont blanc massif
located on the watershed between the rh ne and the po the massif of mont blanc is also situated between the two different climatic regions of the northern and western alps and that of the southern alps
climatic conditions on the mer de glace are similar to those found on the northern side of the swiss alps
the climate is cold and temperate k ppen climate classification cfb and is greatly influenced by altitude
being the highest part of the alps mont blanc and surrounding mountains can create their own weather patterns
temperatures drop as the mountains gain in height and the summit of mont blanc is a permanent ice cap with temperatures around c f
the summit is also prone to strong winds and sudden weather changes
because of its great overall height a considerable proportion is permanently glaciated or snow covered and is exposed to extremely cold conditions
there is however significant variation in precipitation with altitude
for example the village of chamonix below mont blanc is at an elevation of approximately metres ft and receives around mm in of annual precipitation whilst the col du midi which is at metres ft above sea level receives significantly more totalling mm in
however at an even higher altitude near to the summit of mont blanc precipitation is considerably less with only around mm in recorded despite the latter measurements being taken at a height of metres ft
since swiss naturalist horace b n dict de saussure began to go to chamonix to observe mont blanc
he tried with the courmayeur mountain guide jean laurent jordaney a native of pr saint didier who accompanied de saussure since on the miage glacier and on mont crammont
the first recorded ascent of mont blanc at the time neither within italy nor france was on august by jacques balmat and the doctor michel paccard
this climb initiated by horace b n dict de saussure who gave a reward for the successful ascent traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering
the first woman to reach the summit was marie paradis in
at the scale of the mont blanc massif the border between italy and france passes along most of the main alpine watershed from the aiguille des glaciers to mont dolent where it reaches the border with switzerland
however its precise location near the summits of mont blanc and nearby d me du go ter has been disputed since the th century
italian officials claim the border follows the watershed splitting both summits between italy and france while french officials claim the border avoids the two summits placing both of them entirely with france
the size of these two distinct disputed areas is approximately ha on mont blanc and ha on d me du go ter
since the french revolution the issue of the ownership of the summit has been debated
from to the entire mountain was within the duchy of savoy
in the duke of savoy victor amadeus ii acquired the kingdom of sardinia
the resulting state of sardinia was to become preeminent in the italian unification
in september the french revolutionary army of the alps under anne pierre de montesquiou f zensac seized savoy without much resistance and created a department of the mont blanc
in a treaty of may victor amadeus iii of sardinia was forced to cede savoy and nice to france
in article of this treaty it says the border between the sardinian kingdom and the departments of the french republic will be established on a line determined by the most advanced points on the piedmont side of the summits peaks of mountains and other locations subsequently mentioned as well as the intermediary peaks knowing starting from the point where the borders of faucigny the duchy of aoust and the valais to the extremity of the glaciers or monts maudits first the peaks or plateaus of the alps to the rising edge of the col mayor
this act further states that the border should be visible from the town of chamonix and courmayeur
however neither is the peak of the mont blanc visible from courmayeur nor is the peak of the mont blanc de courmayeur visible from chamonix because part of the mountains lower down obscure them
after the napoleonic wars the congress of vienna restored the king of sardinia in savoy nice and piedmont his traditional territories overruling the treaty of paris
forty five years later after the second italian war of independence it was replaced by a new legal act
this act was signed in turin on march by napoleon iii and victor emmanuel ii of savoy and deals with the annexation of savoy following the french neutrality for the plebiscites held in tuscany modena parma and romagna to join the kingdom of sardinia against the pope s will
a demarcation agreement signed on march defined the new border
with the formation of italy for the first time mont blanc was located on the border of france and italy along the old border on the watershed between the department of savoy and that of piedmont formerly belonging to the kingdom of savoy
the act and attached maps are still legally valid for both the french and italian governments
in the second half of the nineteenth century on surveys carried out by a cartographer of the french army captain jj mieulet a topographic map was published in france which incorporated the summit into french territory making the state border deviate from the watershed line and giving rise to the differences with the maps published in italy in the same period
nato maps take data from the italian national mapping agency the istituto geografico militare which is based upon past treaties in force
modern swiss mapping published by the federal office of topography plots a region of disputed territory statut de territoire contest around the summits of both mont blanc and the d me du go ter
one of its interpretations of the french italian border places both summits straddling a line running directly along the geographic ridgeline watershed between france and italy thus sharing their summits equally between both states
however a second interpretation places both summits as well as that of mont blanc de courmayeur although much less clearly in the latter case solely within france
as of the border dispute between the two countries is ongoing

the first professional scientific investigations on the summit were conducted by the botanist meteorologist joseph vallot at the end of the th century
he wanted to stay near the top of the summit to undertake detailed research so he built his permanent cabin
in pierre janssen an astronomer and the director of the meudon astrophysical observatory considered the construction of an observatory at the summit of mont blanc
gustave eiffel agreed to take on the project provided he could build on a rock foundation if found at a depth of less than m ft below the ice
in the swiss surveyor imfeld dug two metre long ft horizontal tunnels metres ft below the ice summit but found nothing solid
consequently the eiffel project was abandoned
despite this the observatory was built in
during the cold wave of january a temperature of c f was recorded on mont blanc being the lowest ever recorded there
levers attached to the ice supported the observatory
this worked to some extent until when the building started leaning heavily
the movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly but three years later two years after janssen s death a crevasse started opening under the observatory
it was abandoned
eventually the building fell and only the tower could be saved in extremis
the mountain was the scene of two fatal air crashes air india flight in and air india flight in
both planes were approaching geneva airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent and people respectively died
the latter passengers included nuclear scientist homi j
bhabha known as the father of india s nuclear programme
in a drilling project was initiated to carve a tunnel through the mountain
the mont blanc tunnel would connect chamonix france and courmayeur italy and become one of the major transalpine transport routes between the two countries
in the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic with a length of metres mi
in a transport truck caught fire in the tunnel beneath the mountain
in total people were killed when the fire raged out of control
the tunnel was renovated in the aftermath to increase driver safety
renovations include computerised detection equipment extra security bays a parallel escape shaft and a fire station in the middle of the tunnel
the escape shafts also have clean air flowing through them via vents
any people in the security bays now have live video contact to communicate with the control centre
a remote site for cargo safety inspection was created on each side aosta in italy and passy le fayet in france
here all trucks are inspected before entering the tunnel
these remote sites are also used as staging areas to control commercial traffic during peak hours
the renovated tunnel reopened three years after the disaster
the summit of mont blanc is a thick perennial ice and snow dome whose thickness varies
no exact and permanent summit elevation can therefore be determined though accurate measurements have been made on specific dates
for a long time its official elevation was m ft
in the ign and expert surveyors with the aid of gps technology measured it to be m ft in
after the heatwave in europe a team of scientists remeasured the height on and september
the team was made up of the glaciologist luc moreau two surveyors from the gps company three people from the ign seven expert surveyors four mountain guides from chamonix and saint gervais and four students from various institutes in france
this team noted that the elevation was m ft in and the peak was cm in away from where it had been in
after these results were published more than points were measured to assess the effects of climate change and the fluctuations in the height of the mountain at different points
since then the elevation of the mountain has been measured every two years
the summit was measured again in and the results were published on december
the height was found to be m ft in cm in more than the previous recorded height
the rock summit was found to be at m ft some m ft west of the ice covered summit
in the summit was measured at m ft and in at m ft
in the summit was measured at m ft and in at m ft
from the summit of mont blanc on a clear day the jura the vosges the black forest and the massif central mountain ranges can be seen as well as the principal summits of the alps
several classic climbing routes lead to the summit of mont blanc
the most popular route is the go ter route also known as the voie des cristalliers or the voie royale
starting from saint gervais les bains the tramway du mont blanc tmb is taken to get to the gare du nid d aigle
the ascent begins in the direction of the refuge de t te rousse crossing the grand couloir or go ter corridor considered dangerous because of frequent rockfalls leading to the go ter hut for night shelter
the next day the route leads to the d me du go ter past the emergency vallot cabin and l arr te des bosses
la voie des monts is also known as la travers e
starting from chamonix the t l ph rique de l aiguille du midi is taken towards the col du midi
the cosmiques hut is used to spend the night
the next day the ascent continues over mont blanc du tacul and mont maudit
the historic itinerary via the grands mulets hut or old normal route on the french side which is most frequently traversed in winter by ski or in summer to descend to chamonix
the normal italian itinerary is also known as la route des aiguilles grises
after crossing the miage glacier climbers spend the night at the gonella refuge
the next day one proceeds through the col des aiguilles grises and the d me du go ter concluding at l ar te des bosses bosses ridge
the miage bionnassay mont blanc crossing is usually done in three days and has been described as a truly magical expedition of ice and snow ar tes at great altitude
the route begins from contamines montjoie with the night spent in the conscrits hut
the following day the d mes de miages is crossed and the night is spent at the durier cabin
the third day proceeds over l aiguille de bionnassay and the d me du go ter finally reaching the summit of mont blanc via the bosses ridge nowadays the summit is ascended by an average of mountaineer tourists each year
it could be considered a technically easy yet arduous ascent for someone well trained and acclimatised to the altitude
from l aiguille du midi where the cable car stops mont blanc seems quite close being m ft higher
but while the peak seems deceptively close the la voie des monts route known to be more technical and challenging than other more commonly used routes requires more ascent over two other metres ft mountains mont blanc du tacul and mont maudit before the final section of the climb is reached and the last metres ft push to the summit is undertaken
each year climbing deaths occur on mont blanc and on the busiest weekends normally around august the local rescue service performs an average of missions mostly directed to aid people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain
some routes require knowledge of high altitude mountaineering a guide or at least an experienced mountaineer and all require proper equipment
all routes are long and arduous involving delicate passages and the hazard of rockfall or avalanche
climbers may also suffer altitude sickness occasionally life threatening particularly if they are not properly acclimatised
a estimate suggests there had been to alpinist fatalities in total more than on any other mountain
these numbers exclude the fatalities of air india flight and air india flight two planes that crashed into mont blanc
despite unsubstantiated claims recurring in media that some estimates put the fatality rate at an average of hikers a year actual reported annual numbers at least since the s are between and in fourteen people died out of summit attempts and two remained missing with in as of august
a french study on the especially risky go ter couloir on the normal route on mont blanc and necessary rescue operations found that between and there were deaths between the t te rousse refuge m and the go ter refuge m
there were more in none in and in

for example in the grand mulets route previously popular in the th century was blocked by virtually impenetrable crevasse fields and the gouter hut was closed by municipal decree for some days because of a very high rockfall danger with some stranded climbers evacuated by helicopter
in a crevasse opened at high altitude also indicating previously unobserved glacial movements
the new crevasse forms an obstacle to be scaled by climbing parties on the final part of the itinerary to the top shared by the popular go ter route and the grand mulets route
