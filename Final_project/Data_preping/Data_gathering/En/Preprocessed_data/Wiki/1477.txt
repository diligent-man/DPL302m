abo blood type discovered karl landsteiner received nobel prize physiology medicine discovery
abo blood type also present primate ape old world monkeys
abo blood type first discovered austrian physician karl landsteiner working pathological-anatomical institute university vienna medical university vienna
found red blood cell would clump together agglutinate mixed test tube serum different person human blood also agglutinated animal blood
wa first evidence blood variation exist human wa believed human similar blood
next year made definitive observation blood serum individual would agglutinate certain individuals
based classified human blood three group namely group group b group c
defined group blood agglutinates group b never type
wa discovery blood group landsteiner wa awarded nobel prize physiology medicine in
paper referred specific blood group interaction isoagglutination also introduced concept agglutinin antibody actual basis antigen-antibody reaction abo system
thus discovered two antigen agglutinogen b two antibody agglutinin anti-a anti-b
third group c indicated absence b antigen contains anti-a anti-b
following year student adriano sturli alfred von decastello discovered fourth type naming simply referred particular type
ludwik hirszfeld emil freiherr von dungern introduced term null group landsteiner designated c ab type discovered sturli von decastello
czech serologist jan jansk independently introduced blood type classification local journal
used roman numerical ii iii iv corresponding modern b ab
moss devised slightly different classification using numerical ii iii iv corresponding modern ab b o
two system created confusion potential danger medical practice
moss's system wa adopted britain france u jansk's wa preferred european country part us
resolve chaos american association immunologist society american bacteriologist association pathologist bacteriologist made joint recommendation jansky classification adopted based priority
landsteiner moved rockefeller institute medical research new york
member committee national research council concerned blood grouping suggested substitute jansk's moss's system letter b ab
wa another confusion use figure german null introduced hirszfeld von dungern others used letter ohne meaning without zero landsteiner chose latter classification wa adopted national research council became variously known national research council classification international classification popularly new landsteiner classification
new system wa gradually accepted early wa universally followed
first practical use blood typing transfusion wa american physician reuben ottenberg in
large-scale application started first world war citric acid wa developed blood clot prevention

much published literature claiming abh substance attached glycosphingolipids finne et al
found human erythrocyte glycoprotein contain polylactosamine chain contains abh substance attached represent majority antigens
main glycoprotein carrying abh antigen identified band band protein glycophorin
later yamamoto's group showed precise glycosyl transferase set confers b epitopes
abo blood type controlled single gene abo gene three type allele inferred classical genetics i
gene encodes glycosyltransferasethat enzyme modifies carbohydrate content red blood cell antigens

couple type type b also type child heterozygous iiii
cis-ab phenotype ha single enzyme creates b antigens
resulting red blood cell usually express b antigen level would expected common group b red blood cell help solve problem apparently genetically impossible blood group

two subgroup always interchangeable far transfusion concerned individual produce antibody antigen
development dna sequencing ha possible identify much larger number allele abo locus categorized b term reaction transfusion distinguished variation dna sequence
six common allele white individual abo gene produce one's blood type
study also identified rare allele generally weaker glycosylation activity
people weak allele sometimes express anti-a antibody though usually clinically significant stably interact antigen body temperature
ci ab another rare variant b gene transmitted together single parent
distribution blood group b ab varies across world according population
also variation blood type distribution within human subpopulations
uk distribution blood type frequency population still show correlation distribution placenames successive invasion migration including celt norseman dane anglo-saxon norman contributed morpheme placenames gene population
native celt tended type blood population tended type a
two common allele share first nucleotide group allele a
however unlike group allele guanosine base subsequently deleted
variant found worldwide likely predates human migration africa
evolutionary biologist theorize four main lineage abo gene mutation creating type occurred least three time humans
oldest youngest lineage comprise following allele aao b o
theory contradict previously held theory type blood evolved first
possible food environmental antigen bacterial viral plant antigen epitope similar enough b glycoprotein antigens
antibody created environmental antigen first year life cross-react abo-incompatible red blood cell come contact blood transfusion later life
anti-a antibody hypothesized originate immune response towards influenza virus whose epitope similar enough d-n-galactosamine glycoprotein able elicit cross-reaction
anti-b antibody hypothesized originate antibody produced gram-negative bacteria e
however likely force driving evolution allele diversity simply negative frequency-dependent selection cell rare variant membrane antigen easily distinguished immune system pathogen carrying antigen hosts
thus individual possessing rare type better equipped detect pathogens
high within-population diversity observed human population would consequence natural selection individuals
