Mali's population consists of Sub-Saharan ethnic groups sharing similar historic cultural and religious traditions
Exceptions are two nomadic northern groups the Tuaregs a Berber people and Maurs or Moors of Arabo-Berber origins
In Mali and Niger the Moors are also known as Azawagh Arabs named after the Azawagh region of the Sahara
Azawagh Arabs speak mainly Hassaniya Arabic which is one of the regional varieties of Arabic
The Tuaregs traditionally have opposed the central government
Starting in June in the north Tuaregs seeking greater autonomy led to clashes with the military
In April the government and most opposing factions signed a pact to end the fighting and restore stability in the north
Its major aims are to allow greater autonomy to the north and increase government resource allocation to what has been a traditionally impoverished region
The peace agreement was celebrated in in Timbuktu during an official and highly publicized ceremony called Flamme de la Paix--peace flame
Historically interethnic relations throughout the rest of the country were facilitated by easy mobility on the Niger River and across the country's vast savannahs
Each ethnic group was traditionally tied to a specific occupation all working within proximity to each other although the distinctions were often blurred

In recent years this linkage has shifted considerably as ethnic groups seek nontraditional sources of income
