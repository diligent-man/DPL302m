This article is about the demographic features of the population of Mali, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
In 2018, Mali's population was an estimated 19.1 million, with an annual growth rate of 2.7%
This figure can be  compared to 4,638,000 in 1950
The population is predominantly rural (68% in 2002), and 5–10% of Malians are nomadic
More than 90% of the population lives in the southern part of the country, especially in Bamako, which has over 1 million residents.
In 2007, about 48% of Malians were less than 15 years old, 49% were 15–64 years old, and 3% were 65 and older
The median age was 15.9 years
The birth rate in 2007 was 49.6 births per 1,000, and the total fertility rate was 7.4 children per woman.
The death rate in 2007 was 16.5 deaths per 1,000
Life expectancy at birth was 49.5 years total (47.6 for males and 51.5 for females)
Mali has one of the world's highest rates of infant mortality, with 106 deaths per 1,000 live births.
The proportion of the population aged below 15 in 2010 was 47.2%
50.6%  of the population were aged between 15 and 65 years of age
2.2% of the population were aged 65 years or older.

Mali's population consists of Sub-Saharan ethnic groups, sharing similar historic, cultural, and religious traditions
Exceptions are two nomadic northern groups, the Tuaregs, a Berber people, and Maurs (or Moors), of Arabo-Berber origins
In Mali and Niger, the Moors are also known as Azawagh Arabs, named after the Azawagh region of the Sahara
Azawagh Arabs speak mainly Hassaniya Arabic which is one of the regional varieties of Arabic.
The Tuaregs traditionally have opposed the central government
Starting in June 1990 in the north, Tuaregs seeking greater autonomy led to clashes with the military
In April 1992, the government and most opposing factions signed a pact to end the fighting and restore stability in the north
Its major aims are to allow greater autonomy to the north and increase government resource allocation to what has been a traditionally impoverished region
The peace agreement was celebrated in 1996 in Timbuktu during an official and highly publicized ceremony called "Flamme de la Paix"--(peace flame).
Historically, interethnic relations throughout the rest of the country were facilitated by easy mobility on the Niger River and across the country's vast savannahs
Each ethnic group was traditionally tied to a specific occupation, all working within proximity to each other, although the distinctions were often blurred.
The Bambara, Malinké, Sarakole, Dogon and Songhay are farmers; the Fula or Fulani, Maur, and Tuareg are herders, while the Bozo are fishers
In recent years this linkage has shifted considerably, as ethnic groups seek nontraditional sources of income.
People of European origin form a small minority in the country
They include those of mixed European and African descendant, as well as those of full European background
The latter includes the French, as well as the Spanish, Irish, Italian and Portuguese origins
Some of them descend from the Arma people (1% of the nation's population)
They mainly live in Bamako, Sikasso, Kalabancoro, Koutiala, Ségou, Kayes, Kati, Mopti, Niono, Gao, San, Koro, Bla, Bougouni, Mandé, Baguineda-Camp, Kolondiéba, Kolokani, and others.

Fertility data as of 2012-2013 (DHS Program):
Mali had an estimated net migration rate of –6.6 migrants per 1,000 people in 2006
About 3 million Malians are believed to reside in Côte d'Ivoire and France
Conversely, according to a 2003 estimate, Mali hosts about 11,000 Mauritanians; most are Fulani herders who routinely engage in cross-border migration
In addition, there are several thousand refugees from Côte d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and Liberia in Bamako and other urban areas of Mali.

French is the country's official language and is spoken somewhat by 30% of Malians.
An estimated 95% of Malians are Sunni Muslim, 4% adhere to indigenous or traditional animist beliefs, and 1% are Christian (about two-thirds Roman Catholic and one-third Protestant)
Atheism and agnosticism are believed to be rare among Malians, most of whom practice their religion on a daily basis
Islam as practiced in Mali can be moderate, tolerant, and adapted to local conditions; relations between Muslims and practitioners of minority religious faiths are generally amicable
The constitution establishes a secular state and provides for freedom of religion, and the government largely respects this right.
Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world
In 2000 only 62–65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind; only 8 percent was estimated to have access to modern sanitation facilities
Only 20 percent of the nation’s villages and livestock watering holes had modern water facilities.
There were an estimated 140,000 cases of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) reported in 2003, and an estimated 1.9 percent of the adult population was afflicted with HIV/AIDS that year, among the lowest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa (see also HIV/AIDS in Africa)
In the same year, there were 12,000 AIDS deaths
The infant mortality rate is 69.5 deaths/1,000 live births (75.3/1,000 among males and 63.5/1,000 among females) (2017 est.)
Life expectancy at birth is 60.3 years (58.2 years among males and 62.5 years among females) (2017 est.).
In the 2000–01 school year, the primary school enrollment rate was 61% (71% of males and 51% of females)
The primary school completion rate is also low: only 36 percent of students in 2003 (and lower for females)
The majority of students reportedly leave school by age 12
In the late 1990s, the secondary school enrollment rate was 15% percent (20% of males and 10% of females).
According to United States government estimates, the adult literacy rate (defined as those over age 15 who can read and write) was 46.4 percent for the total population in 2003 (53.5 percent for males and 39.6 percent for females)
According to United Nations sources, however, the literacy rate is actually much lower—only 27–30 percent overall and as low as 12 percent for females, among the lowest rates in Africa.
