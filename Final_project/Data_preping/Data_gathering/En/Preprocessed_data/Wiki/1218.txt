Love Is a Four Letter Word is the fourth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz released on April by Atlantic Records
I Won't Give Up was released as the album's first single on January
In November Mraz posted on his MySpace page plans for a new album to be recorded starting in December writing In weeks time I will enter the studio and begin recording the next album
Only a handful of songs are written and slated but the momentum of love is with me
Every day new verses get added on
The songs are coming together piece by piece
The process is unlike any of the other records before this
It's like I'm being gifted the album without having to do the work
I'm creating that in months the project will be complete and then we'll hit the road again with new sounds and new musicians
In Mraz spent some time in London England where he worked on songs for his new album with the producer Martin Terefe and wrote with the British singer-songwriter Dido
In August Mraz had a QA interview with Spin magazine in which he said that possible titles for his fourth album were Peace Canoe or The Love Album
On December Mraz told Jeff Benjamin of Billboard that the album is finished except for one track he was attempting to re-work as an acoustic version
Describing the album he said It's not a departure in the sound of the genre in any way it's just different tones different textures
Musically I think people are going to like it
There's a couple of up-tempo tunes but mostly the rhythm of the heartbeat kind of takes precedence on this record
It feels more like the pace of life
At least based on my life and what I've been doing
On January during a performance streamed live from the Bing Bar at the Sundance Film Festival Mraz told the audience that the album's title was Love Is a Four Letter Word
At Metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of to reviews from mainstream critics the album received an average score of based on reviews which indicates generally favorable reviews
Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album out of stars writing Mraz pushes himself into new territory creating music that's perilously close to sounding seductive Kyle Anderson wrote for Entertainment Weekly that he tiptoes the line between hammock-strung wisdom and twee navet with such goofball charisma that otherwise forgettable love-each-other-doodles become sweetly breezy anthems Matthew Horton from Virgin Media wrote that It's all light as air of course and corny as hell but Mraz isn't here to kick James any statues
If you're after unchallenging whimsy with the odd sparky arrangement he'll continue to do just fine Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian complimented his words with a variety of genres that show him to be a cracking musician She also wrote that this is pure undemanding pleasure his voice has a natural affinity with elegant lounge-jazz and introspective folk-blues as well as the delicately hewn soft rock that made his name Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone gave the album out of stars writing that inspired perhaps by the massive success of his lite-reggae anthem I'm Yours he's added more world-music textures to his folk pop and turned up the blissed-out vibes on the album Sandy Cohen from The Boston Globe wrote The songs about heartache don't detract from the optimistic vibe of this -song collection
Jon Caramanica from The New York Times criticized the album writing that the album is filled with platitudes and eventually psychobabble dippy even by Mr
Mraz's standards Phil Mongredien from The Observer gave the album only star out of writing that the lyrics alternate between the ludicrous and the banal Amy Dawson from Metro UK wrote that Mraz's earnest melodic guitar pop exerts mainstream appeal but this will all be a bit earnest teen drama soundtrack for some Loh Chuan Junn from MediaCorp's xinmsn opined that every song on this album is listenable but when put on loop Mraz's relentlessly upbeat and happy romanticism grows increasing annoying for even the least cynical
