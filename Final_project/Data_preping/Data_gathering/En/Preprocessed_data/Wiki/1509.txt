the outer border of the red circle shows sheaves of wheat and the inner sheaves of rice which together represent agricultural workers
at the center of the bottom portion of the border is a cog wheel that represents industrial workers
according to the description of the national emblem of the people s republic of china these elements taken together symbolise the revolutionary struggles of the chinese people since the may fourth movement and the coalition of the proletariat which succeeded in founding the people s republic of china
the national emblem appearing in modern times is often designed directly based on european heraldry
but in fact the development of national emblem design in human society also has a long process
as a symbol of a country even without the artistic concept of european heraldry human beings will explore totem worship with similar concept in social practice
for example there was no legal national emblem in the qing dynasty but the dragon totem in the yellow dragon flag was widely used as a substantive national emblem in the official designs of the government such as silver coins and passports
in the early days of the people s republic of china there was also the design of the national seal with the nature of the national emblem
in ancient china the national seal was the certificate of the emperors of the orthodox dynasties in previous dynasties
its symbolic power and stamping effect were similar to that of the modern national emblem
when the people s republic of china was just established it also took the traditional seal designed based on the traditional seal as an official duty for example the national seal seal of the central people s government of the people s republic of china in the national museum of china but later it was officially changed to the european round seal design
the empire of china during the manchu led qing dynasty did not have an official state emblem but the flag featured the azure dragon on a plain yellow field with a red sun of the three legged crow in the upper left corner
it became the first national flag of china and is usually referred to as the yellow dragon flag
following the end of manchu rule new national symbols were deemed necessary by the leaders to represent the changed circumstances
the renowned writers lu xun qian daosun and xu shoushang from the ministry of education were tasked with designing a new national emblem
it was presented on august and was adopted as national emblem in february
president emperor yuan shikai continued its use during his short imperial reign from to
the emblem is based on the ancient symbols of the twelve ornaments
these are first mentioned as already ancient in the book of documents by emperor shun who was one of the legendary three sovereigns and five emperors
oral tradition holds that he lived sometime between and bc
according to the book the emperor wished for the symbols to be used on official robes of the state
the northern expedition led by general chiang kai shek and the kuomintang party led to the overthrow of the fractious yet internationally recognized beiyang government in
this ushered in a one party state under the kuomintang known as the nanjing decade
the state emblem was therefore replaced with the kuomintang blue sky with a white sun party symbol
the blue sky white sun and a wholly red earth flag has remained the flag of the republic of china to this day
during this period under the kmt s political tutelage the blue sky with a white sun flag shared the same prominence as the roc flag
a common wall display consisted of the kmt flag perched on the left and the roc flag perched on the right each tilted at an angle with a portrait of national father sun yat sen displayed in the center
after the promulgation of the constitution of the republic of china the party flag was removed from such a display and the national flag was moved to the center
since the roc government moved to taiwan and especially in the years since the end of martial law the kuominmtang flag has lost some of its prominence
however it is still frequently seen on kmt party buildings in political rallies and other meetings of kmt and the pan blue coalition
the first communist government in china known as the chinese soviet republic had the emblem adopted in
it consisted of an hammer and sickle on a globe and the grain ears are placed under and on both sides of the earth
above the earth and the five pointed star is written the chinese soviet republic on the top and the workers of the world unite written on the bottom
on july the government held a public competition for the design of the national emblem however no satisfactory designs were selected
therefore on september the first plenary session of chinese people s political consultative conference cppcc decided to invite designers for the proposals of the national emblem and two groups from two universities were selected in september
three proposals were selected for the first round discussion
the designers from china central academy of fine arts zhang ding zhang guangyu zhou lingzhao and zhong ling handed out their proposals with variations on september
the symbolism of their first design was the red star symbolizes communism and the ccp
the cog and wheat rice symbolizes unification of industrial workers and peasants
the rising earth with china in red symbolizes the socialist revolution in china and the world revolution ideal on asian counties
rays behind the earth symbolizes the provincial administrative divisions at that time
the name of the people s republic of china is written on the red ribbon below
the design was based on their design of the emblem of cppcc and was influenced by socialist heraldry of the eastern bloc
the designers from the department of architecture at tsinghua university liang sicheng lin huiyin mo zongjiang zhu changzhong li zongjin and gao zhuang handed their proposal on october
according to their proposal the design was a mixture of traditional chinese culture and maoist new democratic revolution ideals
the design imitated the style of mirrors in han dynasty symbolizing brightness
the disc was made of jade a symbol of peace and unity
decorative carvings on the disc was in tang dynasty style
the stars from national flag and a cog were placed in the center of the disc surrounded by wheats symbolizing unity of working class and socialism
the red ribbon tied a smaller jade ring symbolising the unification of chinese people
the other proposal by zhang ding zhang guangyu zhou lingzhao was a perspective depiction of tian anmen gate members of the first cppcc committee discussed these three proposals on june
the result of the discussion was the china central academy of fine arts proposal was too colourful to be regarded as trademarks and proposal from tsinghua university was regarded as bourgeois due to its use of traditional symbols
the committee suggested the groups include the tian anmen gate a symbol of chinese revolution that served as the location of the may fourth movement and foundation ceremony of the people s republic of china on october
the two groups then worked on a second round of proposals
the second proposal from tsinghua university standardized the design of the tian anmen gate on the emblem and selected red and yellow as the main colours
their proposal was selected and the design was standardized and simplified by gao zhuang
this design was officially made the national emblem on september by the central people s government
the emblem is also displayed along with the national flag at the end of a video clip with the national anthem march of the volunteers regularly played on chinese television such as state run china central television cctv on a daily basis
national standard of china gb specifies the construction material and color of the national emblem
before the communist takeover of mainland china the roc had provinces design their own emblems
only two emblems were used so far
on april taiyuan city officially announced its emblem becoming the first city in the people s republic of china to have a city emblem
hong kong and macao each have their own emblem
the national people s congress have passed the standardized use of the two special administrative regions emblems
under chinese law since november only hong kong and macau are allowed to have their own emblems and other localities that had them had to stop using theirs
this rule was ignored in when the city of chengdu chose the golden sun bird found under the city s jinsha site as its emblem
