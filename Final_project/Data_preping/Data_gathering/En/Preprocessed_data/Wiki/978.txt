tidal marsh also known type tidal wetland marsh found along river coast estuary flood drain tidal movement adjacent estuary sea ocean
tidal marsh experience many overlapping persistent cycle including diurnal semi-diurnal tide day-night temperature fluctuation spring-neap tide seasonal vegetation growth decay upland runoff decadal climate variation centennial millennial trend sea level climate
tidal marsh formed area sheltered wave beside edge bay upper slop intertidal water fresh saline
also impacted transient disturbance hurricane flood storm upland fires
tidal marsh differentiated freshwater brackish salt according salinity water
coastal marsh lie along coast estuarine marsh lie inland within tidal zone
location determines controlling process age disturbance regime future persistence tidal marshes
extensive research ha conducted deltaic tidal freshwater marsh chesapeake bay formed result historic deforestation intensive agriculture
tidal marsh categorized salinity level elevation sea level
tidal marsh commonly zoned lower marsh also called intertidal marsh upper high marsh based elevation sea level
middle marsh zone also exists tidal freshwater marshes
tidal marsh may classified back-barrier marsh estuarine brackish marsh tidal freshwater marsh depending influence sea level
coastal tidal marsh found within coastal watershed encompass variety type including fresh salt marsh bottomland hardwood swamp mangrove swamp palustrine wetlands
tidal marsh also form main shoreline barrier islands
elongated shifting landforms evolve parallel close proximity shoreline tidal marsh
many become fully submerged high tide become directly attached mainland low tide
barrier island formation includes mechanism offshore bar theory spit accretion theory climate change
tidal marsh ecosystem provide numerous service including supplying habitat support diverse range biodiversity
area spawning ground home feeder fish lie low food chain serve crucial rest-stops migratory birds
additionally provide suitable habitat various tidal salt marsh specialist bird specie seaside sparrow ammospiza maritima willet tringa semipalmata found tidal marsh connecticut us
ecosystem service include role significant carbon sink shoreline stabilizers
tidal marsh provide flood protection upland area storing ground water lessen impact storm surge nearby shorelines
tidal marsh located along coastline also act intricate filtration system watersheds
area absorb trap pollutant water run-off travel higher elevation open water
historically global loss tidal marsh attributed implementation tidal restriction draining activities
tidal restriction method include diking tide gate impoundment implemented coastal land internationally favour creating agricultural land exemplified large-scale diking ha occurred atlantic canada us
historical change due anthropogenic activity tidal marsh lasting impact today
tidal marsh experienced gold rush filled marsh sediment due erosion
logging ha also damaged tidal marsh due decomposition filling marshes
tidal marsh sensitivity anthropogenic activity created long lasting affects
currently rising sea level one leading threat tidal marsh caused global warming climate change
pollution due urbanization also continues endanger tidal marsh ecosystems
restoration tidal marsh removal tidal restriction re-establish degraded ecosystem service underway internationally decades
deliberate natural restoration practice occurred u united kingdom europe canada
research show tidal marsh restoration evaluated various factor vegetation biogeochemical response eg
salinity sediment deposition ph carbon sequestration hydrologic response wildlife community responses
salt marsh coastal ecosystem land open saltwater regularly flooded
