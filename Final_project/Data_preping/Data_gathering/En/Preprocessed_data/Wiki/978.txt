a tidal marsh also known as a type of tidal wetland is a marsh found along rivers coasts and estuaries which floods and drains by the tidal movement of the adjacent estuary sea or ocean
tidal marshes experience many overlapping persistent cycles including diurnal and semi diurnal tides day night temperature fluctuations spring neap tides seasonal vegetation growth and decay upland runoff decadal climate variations and centennial to millennial trends in sea level and climate
tidal marshes are formed in areas that are sheltered from waves such as beside edges of bays in upper slops of intertidal and where water is fresh or saline
they are also impacted by transient disturbances such as hurricanes floods storms and upland fires
tidal marshes are differentiated into freshwater brackish and salt according to the salinity of their water
coastal marshes lie along coasts and estuarine marshes lie inland within the tidal zone
location determines the controlling processes age disturbance regime and future persistence of tidal marshes
tidal freshwater marshes are further divided into deltaic and fringing types
extensive research has been conducted on deltaic tidal freshwater marshes in chesapeake bay which were formed as a result of historic deforestation and intensive agriculture
tidal marshes can be further categorized by salinity level elevation and sea level
tidal marshes are commonly zoned into lower marshes also called intertidal marshes and upper or high marshes based on their elevation above sea level
a middle marsh zone also exists for tidal freshwater marshes
tidal marshes may be further classified into back barrier marshes estuarine brackish marshes and tidal freshwater marshes depending on the influence of sea level
coastal tidal marshes are found within coastal watersheds and encompass a variety of types including fresh and salt marshes bottomland hardwood swamps mangrove swamps and palustrine wetlands
tidal marshes also form between a main shoreline and barrier islands
these elongated shifting landforms evolve parallel and in close proximity to the shoreline of a tidal marsh
many become fully submerged at high tide and become directly attached to the mainland when at low tide
barrier island formation includes mechanisms such as offshore bar theory spit accretion theory and climate change
tidal marsh ecosystems provide numerous services including supplying habitats to support a diverse range of biodiversity
their areas are spawning grounds and home to feeder fish that lie low on the food chain and serve as crucial rest stops for migratory birds
additionally they provide suitable habitat to various tidal salt marsh specialist bird species such as the seaside sparrow ammospiza maritima and the willet tringa semipalmata found in tidal marshes in connecticut u s
other ecosystem services include their role as significant carbon sinks and shoreline stabilizers
tidal marshes provide flood protection to upland areas by storing ground water and lessen the impact of storm surges on nearby shorelines
tidal marshes located along coastlines also act as intricate filtration systems for watersheds
these areas absorb and trap pollutants from water run off that travels from higher elevations to open water
historically the global loss of tidal marshes can be attributed to the implementation of tidal restrictions and other draining activities
tidal restrictions methods include diking tide gates and impoundments which were implemented on coastal lands internationally in favour of creating agricultural land as exemplified with large scale diking that has occurred in atlantic canada and the u s
in the bay of fundy
historical changes due to anthropogenic activity to tidal marshes have a lasting impact on them today
tidal marshes have experienced the gold rush which filled some marshes with sediment due to erosion
logging has also damaged tidal marshes due to their decomposition and filling of marshes
tidal marshes sensitivity to anthropogenic activity have created long lasting affects
currently rising sea levels is one of the leading threats to tidal marshes caused by global warming and climate change
pollution due to urbanization also continues to endanger tidal marsh ecosystems
restoration of tidal marshes through the removal of tidal restrictions to re establish degraded ecosystem services have been underway internationally for decades
deliberate and natural restoration practices have occurred in the u s united kingdom europe and canada
research shows that tidal marsh restoration can be evaluated through various factors such as vegetation biogeochemical responses e g
salinity sediment deposition ph and carbon sequestration hydrologic responses and wildlife community responses
salt marsh coastal ecosystem between land and open saltwater that is regularly flooded
brackish marsh marsh with brackish level of salinity
