iranian georgians or persian georgians georgian persian are iranian citizens who are ethnically georgian and are an ethnic group living in iran
today s georgia was a subject to iran in the ancient times under the achaemenid and sassanian empires and from the th century till the early th century starting with the safavids in power and later qajars
shah abbas i his predecessors and successors relocated by force hundreds of thousands of christian and jewish georgians as part of his programs to reduce the power of the qizilbash develop industrial economy strengthen the military and populate newly built towns in various places in iran including the provinces of isfahan mazandaran and khuzestan
a certain number of these among them members of the nobility also migrated voluntarily over the centuries as well as some that moved as muhajirs in the th century to iran following the russian conquest of the caucasus
the georgian community of fereydunshahr have retained their distinct georgian identity to this day despite having been obliged to adopt certain aspects of iranian culture such as the persian language and twelver shia islam
most likely the first extant community of georgians within iran was formed following shah tahmasp i s invasions of georgia and the rest of the caucasus in which he deported some georgians and other caucasians back to mainland safavid iran
the first genuine compact georgian settlements however appeared in iran in the s when shah abbas i relocated some two hundred thousand from their historical homeland eastern georgian provinces of kakheti and kartli following a punitive campaign he conducted against his formerly most loyal georgian servants namely teimuraz i of kakheti and luarsab ii of kartli
most of modern day iranian georgians are the latters descendants although the first large movements of georgians from the caucasus to the heartland of the safavid empire in iran happened as early as during the rule of tahmasp i
subsequent waves of large deportations after abbas also occurred throughout the rest of the th but also the th and th centuries the last ones by the qajar dynasty
a certain amount also migrated as muhajirs in the th century to iran following the russian conquest of the caucasus
the georgian deportees were settled by the shah s government into the scarcely populated lands which were quickly made by their new inhabitants into the lively agricultural areas
many of these new settlements were given georgian names reflecting the toponyms found in georgia
during the safavid era georgia became so politically and somewhat culturally intertwined with iran that georgians replaced the qizilbash among the safavid officials alongside the circassians and armenians
during his travels the italian adventurer pietro della valle claimed that there was no household in persia without its georgian slaves noticing the huge amounts of georgians present everywhere in society
the later safavid capital isfahan was home to many georgians
many of the city s inhabitants were of georgian circassian and daghistani descent
engelbert kaempfer who was in safavid persia in estimated their number at
following an agreement between shah abbas i and his georgian subject teimuraz i of kakheti tahmuras khan whereby the latter submitted to safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region s w li governor and for having his son serve as d ru a prefect of isfahan in perpetuity a georgian prince converted to islam served as governor
he was accompanied by a certain number of soldiers and they spoke in georgian among themselves
there must also have been some georgian orthodox christians
the royal court in isfahan had a great number of georgian ol ms military slaves as well as georgian women
although they spoke persian or turkic their mother tongue was georgian
during the last days of the safavid empire the safavids arch enemy namely the neighboring ottoman turks as well as neighboring imperial russia but also the tribal afghans from the far off easternmost regions of the empire took advantage of iranian internal weakness and invaded iran
the iranian georgian contribution in wars against the invading afghans was crucial
georgians fought in the battle of golnabad and in the battle of fereydunshahr
in the latter battle they brought a humiliating defeat to the afghan army
in total the persian sources mention that during the safavid era georgians were transplanted to mainland iran during the first two centuries while the georgian sources keep this number at
during the afsharid dynasty georgian families were moved to mainland iran according to the persian sources while the georgian sources keep it on persons
during the qajar dynasty the last iranian empire that would despite very briefly have effective control over georgia georgians were moved to iran according to the persian sources while the georgian ones mention persons
this last large wave of georgian movement and settlement towards mainland iran happened as a result of the battle of krtsanisi in
despite their isolation from georgia many georgians have preserved their language and some traditions but embraced islam
the ethnographer lado aghniashvili was first from georgia to visit this community in
in the aftermath of world war i the georgian minority in iran was caught in the pressures of the rising cold war
in this compact ethnic community along with other ethnic minorities that populated northern iran came to the attention of the soviet as a possible instrument for fomenting unrest in iranian domestic politics
while the soviet georgian leadership wanted to repatriate them to georgia moscow clearly preferred to keep them in iran
the soviet plans were abandoned only after joseph stalin realized that his plans to obtain influence in northern iran foiled by both iranian stubbornness and united states pressure
in june the new georgian president mikheil saakashvili became the first georgian politician to have visited the iranian georgian community in fereydunshahr
thousands of local georgians gave the delegation a warm welcome which included waving of the newly adopted georgian national flag with its five crosses
saakashvili who stressed that the iranian georgians have historically played an important role in defending iran put flowers on the graves of the iranian georgian dead of the eight years long iran iraq war
many iranian military commanders and administrators were islamized georgians
many members of the safavid and qajar dynasties and nobility had georgian blood
in fact the heavily mixed safavid dynasty was of partial georgian origins from its very beginning

the names of actors cyrus gorjestani and sima gorjestani as well as the late nematollah gorji suggest that they are were at least from the paternal side of georgian origin
reza shah pahlavi s mother was a georgian muhajir who most likely came to mainland persia after persia was forced to cede all of its territories in the caucasus following the russo persian wars several decades prior to reza shah s birth
for a more lengthy discussion on georgians and persia refer to
the georgian language is still used by a minority of people in iran
the center of georgians in iran is fereydunshahr a small city km to the west of isfahan in the area historically known as fereydan
in this area there are georgian towns and villages around fereydunshahr
in this region the old georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in iran and most people speak and understand the georgian language there
there were other compact settlements in khorasan at abbas abad half way between shahrud and sabzevar where there remained only one old woman who remembered georgian in mazandaran at behshahr and farah abad gilan isfahan province at najafabad badrud rahmatabad yazdanshahr and amir abad
these areas are frequently called gorji mahalleh georgian neighborhood
many georgians or iranians of partial georgian descent are also scattered in major iranian cities such as tehran isfahan rasht dezful karaj and shiraz
most of these communities no longer speak the georgian language but retain aspects of georgian culture and keep a georgian conscious
some argue that iranian georgians retain remnants of christian traditions but there is no evidence for this
most georgians in fereydunshahr and fereydan speak and understand georgian
iranian georgians observe the shia traditions and also non religious traditions similar to other people in iran
they observe the traditions of nowruz
the local self designation of georgians in iran like the rest of the georgians over the world is kartveli georgian from kartvelebi georgian namely georgians although occasionally the ethnonyms gorj gorji or even gurj i from persian gorji which means georgian
they call their language kartuli georgian
as rezvani states this is not surprising given that all other georgian dialects in iran are extinct
the number of georgians in iran is estimated to be over
according to encyclopaedia georgiana some lived in rural fereydan c
and a more recent estimation cited by rezvani published written in states that there may be more than georgians in fereydan
modern day estimations regarding the number of iranian georgians are that they compose over
they are also the largest caucasus derived group in the nation ahead of the circassians
