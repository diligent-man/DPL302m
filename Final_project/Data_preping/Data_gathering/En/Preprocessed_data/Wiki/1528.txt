specific data on concentrations or exposure are lacking
phenothrin has been found to possess antiandrogen properties and was responsible for a small epidemic of gynecomastia via isolated environmental exposure
the epa has not assessed its effect on cancer in humans
however one study performed by the mount sinai school of medicine linked sumithrin with breast cancer the link made by its effect on increasing the expression of a gene responsible for mammary tissue proliferation
in the u s
epa cancelled permission to use phenothrin in several flea and tick products at the request of the manufacturer hartz mountain industries
