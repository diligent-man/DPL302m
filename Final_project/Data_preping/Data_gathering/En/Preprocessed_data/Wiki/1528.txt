Phenothrin also called sumithrin and d-phenothrin is a synthetic pyrethroid that kills adult fleas and ticks
It has also been used to kill head lice in humans
d-Phenothrin is used as a component of aerosol insecticides for domestic use
It is often used with methoprene an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's biological lifecycle by killing the eggs
Phenothrin is primarily used to kill fleas and ticks
It is also used to kill head lice in humans but studies conducted in Paris and the United Kingdom have shown widespread resistance to phenothrin
Environmental Protection Agency EPA study found that micrograms were enough to kill honey bees
It is also extremely toxic to aquatic life with a study showing concentrations of ppb killing mysid shrimp
It has increased risk of liver cancer in rats and mice in long-term exposure
It is capable of killing mosquitoes although remains poisonous to cats and dogs with seizures and deaths being reported due to poisoning
Specific data on concentrations or exposure are lacking
Phenothrin has been found to possess antiandrogen properties and was responsible for a small epidemic of gynecomastia via isolated environmental exposure
The EPA has not assessed its effect on cancer in humans
However one study performed by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine linked sumithrin with breast cancer the link made by its effect on increasing the expression of a gene responsible for mammary tissue proliferation
EPA cancelled permission to use phenothrin in several flea and tick products at the request of the manufacturer Hartz Mountain Industries
The products were linked to a range of adverse reactions including hair loss salivation tremors and numerous deaths in cats and kittens
In the short term the agreement called for new warning labels on the products
As of March the sale and distribution of Hartz's phenothrin-containing flea and tick products for cats has been terminated
However EPA's product cancellation order did not apply to Hartz flea and tick products for dogs and Hartz continues to produce many of its flea and tick products for dogs
