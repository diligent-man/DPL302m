Maria Rye received her education at home and read for herself in the large library of her father
Coming under the influence of Charles Kingsley's father then vicar of St Luke's Church she devoted herself at the age of sixteen to parochial work in Chelsea She was impressed by the lack of opportunity of employment for women outside the teaching profession In succession to Mary Howitt she soon became secretary of the association for promoting the Married Women's Property bill which was brought forward by Sir Thomas Erskine Perry in but was not fully passed till
She joined the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women on its foundation but disapproving of the women's franchise movement which the leading members supported soon left it In she undertook a private law stationer's business at Portugal Street Lincoln's Inn in order to give employment to middle class girls At the same time she helped to establish the Victoria Press in association with her business in under the charge of Emily Faithfull and the employment bureau and telegraph school in Great Coram Street with Isa Craig as secretary The telegraph school anticipated the employment of girls as telegraph clerks
The law stationer's business prospered but the applications for employment were far in excess of the demands of the concern With Jane Lewin she consequently raised a fund for assisting middle class girls to emigrate and to the question of emigration she devoted the rest of her life
She founded in the Female Middle class Emigration Society absorbed since in the United British Women's Emigration Association Between and she was instrumental in sending girls of the middle class and domestic servants to Australia New Zealand and Canada and she visited these colonies to form committees for the protection of the emigrants
From when she handed over her law business to Lewin Rye devoted herself exclusively to the emigration of pauper children or in a phrase which she herself coined 'gutter children' After visiting in New York the Little Wanderers' Home for the training of derelict children for emigrant life which Mr Van Meter a Baptist minister from Ohio had founded she resolved to give the system a trial in London Encouraged by Anthony Ashley Cooper th Earl of Shaftesbury and The Times newspaper and with the financial support of William Rathbone VI MP in she purchased Avenue House High Street Peckham and with her two younger sisters in spite of public opposition and prejudice took there from the streets or the workhouses waifs and strays from the ages of three to sixteen Fifty girls from Kirkdale industrial school Liverpool were soon put under her care they were trained in domestic economy and went through courses of general and religious instruction
At Niagara Canada Rye also acquired a building which she called 'Our Western Home' It was opened on December To this house Miss Rye drafted the children from Peckham and after further training they were distributed in Canada as domestic servants among respectable families The first party left England in October She received a civil list pension of Â£ in
Poor law children were subsequently received at Peckham from St George's Hanover Square Wolverhampton Bristol Reading and other towns By Rye had found homes in Canada for some five hundred children She accompanied each batch of emigrants and visited the children already settled there The work was continued with great success for over a quarter of a century and did much to diminish the vicious habits and the stigma of pauperism Lord Shaftesbury remained a consistent supporter and in Henry Petty Fitzmaurice th Marquess of Lansdowne then governor general of Canada warmly commended the results of her pioneer system which Thomas John Barnardo and others subsequently adopted and extended
In owing to the continuous strain Rye transferred the two institutions in Peckham and Niagara with their funds to the Church of England Waifs and Strays Society now The Children's Society In her farewell report of she stated that English and Scottish children then in Canada had been sent out from her home in England
She retired with her sister Elizabeth to 'Baconsthorpe' Hemel Hempstead where she spent the remainder of her life There she died after four years' suffering of intestinal cancer on November and was buried in the churchyard
