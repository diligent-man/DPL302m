In Sanatana Dharma Ekadashi holds great importance Ekadashi is favourite tithi of Lord Krishna and devotees observe upvas to be closer to Krishna In Nepal and India Ekādaśī is considered a day to cleanse the body aid repair and rejuvenation and is usually observed by partial or complete fast High protein and carbohydrate containing foods such as beans and grains are not consumed by observant people during the fast as it is a day to cleanse the body Instead only fruit vegetables and milk products are eaten This period of abstinence starts from sunrise on the day of Ekādaśī to sunrise on the following day Rice is not eaten on Ekadashi
The timing of each Ekādaśī is according to the position of the moon The Indian calendar marks progression from a full moon to a new moon as divided into fifteen equal arcs Each arc measures one lunar day called a tithi The time it takes the moon to traverse a particular distance is the length of that lunar day Ekādaśī refers to the th tithi or lunar day The eleventh tithi corresponds to a precise phase of the waxing and waning moon In the bright half of the lunar month the moon will appear roughly full on Ekādaśī and in the dark half of the lunar month the moon will be about dark on Ekādaśī
There are usually Ekādaśīs in a calendar year Occasionally there are two extra Ekādaśīs that happen in a leap year Each Ekādaśī day is purported to have particular benefits that are attained by the performance of specific activities
