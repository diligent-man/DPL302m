Robert Bourassa GOQ French pronunciation b bu asa July October was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the nd premier of Quebec from to and from to A member of the Liberal Party of Quebec he served a total of just under years as premier Bourassa's tenure was marked by major events affecting Quebec including the October Crisis and the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords
Bourassa was born to a working class family in Montreal the son of Adrienne n e Courville and Aubert Bourassa a port authority worker Robert Bourassa graduated from the Universit de Montr al law school in and was admitted to the Barreau du Qu bec the following year On August he married Andr e Simard an heiress of the powerful shipbuilding Simard family of Sorel Quebec Later he studied at Keble College University of Oxford and also obtained a degree in political economy at Harvard University in On his return to Quebec he was employed at the federal Department of National Revenue as a fiscal adviser He also worked as a professor of public finance at Universit de Montr al and Universit Laval
Bourassa was first elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec MLA for the riding of Mercier in then won the Quebec Liberal Party leadership election on January He positioned himself as a young competent administrator He chose jobs as his slogan which emphasized that job creation would be his priority Bourassa felt the extensive hydro electric resources of Quebec were the most effective means of completing the modernization of Quebec and sustaining job creation He successfully led his party into government in the election defeating the conservative Union Nationale government and becoming the youngest premier in Quebec history
One of Bourassa's first crises as premier was the October Crisis of in which his deputy Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and later murdered by members of the Front de lib ration du Quebec Bourassa requested that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoke the War Measures Act which allowed for search and arrest of anyone associated with or thought to be associated with the FLQ He further requested military assistance from the federal government which resulted in the deployment of troops to guard vital points in Montreal and assist police The army was withdrawn on January and Paul Rose and some of his accomplices were found guilty of murder later that year
Bourassa and Trudeau often clashed over issues of federal provincial relations and Quebec nationalism with Trudeau opposing what he saw as concessions to sovereignism In June he participated in an attempt at constitutional reform the Victoria Charter which quickly unravelled when Bourassa backed away from the proposed deal after it was strongly criticised by Quebec opinion leaders for not giving Quebec more powers
On October Trudeau announced in the House of Commons that after much deliberation the policy of multiculturalism would be implemented in Canada Bourassa documented his strong opposition to Trudeau's policy in a letter which he released to the press on November and stated he had serious misgivings about the principle of the multicultural policy The policy document tabled in the House dissociates culture from language which seemed to Bourassa a questionable basis on which to found a policy Bourassa declared that Quebec did not accept the federal government's approach to the principle of multiculturalism
During his time in power Bourassa implemented policies aimed at protecting the status of the French language in Quebec In he introduced Bill which declared French to be the sole official language of the province As a result Quebec was no longer institutionally bilingual French and English though the rights of anglophones were still protected under the British North America Acts Many businesses and professionals were unable to operate under such requirements Bill angered Anglophones while not going far enough for many Francophones Bourassa was vilified by both groups In response Trudeau described Bourassa as a mangeur de hot dogs hotdog eater
Bourassa initiated the James Bay hydroelectric project in that led to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of with the Cree and Inuit inhabitants of the region The Bourassa government also played a major role in rescuing the Olympic Games in Montreal from huge cost overruns and construction delays Bourassa's government became embroiled in corruption scandals
On March workers belonging to the F d ration des travailleurs et travailleuses du Qu bec union working on the LG construction site of the James Bay project rioted using their bulldozers to destroy the site they were working on while other workers set buildings afire The riot caused million in damage and was part of an extortion attempt on the part of the union boss Andr D d Desjardins who was known in Quebec as the King of Construction In response to the violence at the LG site which confirmed long standing rumors about thuggish practices on the part of construction unions Bourassa appointed a commission consisting of a well respected judge Robert Cliche a prominent Montreal labour lawyer Brian Mulroney and Guy Chevrette the vice president of the Centrale de l'enseignement du Qu bec whose legal counsel was another prominent lawyer Lucien Bouchard to investigate corruption in the construction industry in Quebec The Cliche commission as it became known held days of hearings on live TV interviewing people from the construction industry who testified to widespread corruption and violence in the construction industry and to the close ties between the Bourassa cabinet the Mafia and corrupt construction union bosses Bouchard had wanted to have Bourassa testify before the commission but Mulroney prevented this saying that having the Premier of Quebec testify before the commission would be a violation of executive privilege Nonetheless the Cliche commission established the Quebec construction industry was dominated by a casual brutality with thuggish union bosses teaching union organizers how best to break legs Workers who complained about corruption on the part of their bosses had their dogs murdered and their teenage children beaten up
When the Cliche commission presented its report in May the document was described as an expos of an organized system of corruption without parallel in North America as the commission noted that it was political corruption that had enabled the corruption in the construction industry In an editorial the Montreal Gazette wrote about the Cliche commission report A devastating document For some four years the Bourassa government worked hand in glove with gangster union leadership in the province's construction industry The Cliche commission had little impact on the problem of corruption in the Quebec construction industry but turned public opinion against Bourassa whose special adviser had asked the corrupt construction unions to help the Liberals win a by election in exchange for giving firms that employed workers in the corrupt unions exclusive contracts to work on the James Bay project
Bourassa lost the provincial election to Ren L vesque leader of the sovereigntist Parti Qu b cois in a massive landslide brought on by the language controversy and the corruption scandals among other things Bourassa himself was heavily defeated in his own riding by PQ challenger G rald Godin He resigned as Liberal Party leader and accepted teaching positions in Europe and the United States He remained in political exile until he returned to politics by winning the Quebec Liberal Party leadership election on October On June he won a by election in Bertrand
Bourassa led the PLQ to victory in the election However he lost his own seat to Parti Qu b cois candidate Jean Guy Parent On January he was elected in a by election in the Liberal stronghold of Saint Laurent after the sitting Liberal MNA Germain Leduc resigned in his favour
During his second term as premier Bourassa invoked the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to override a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that declared parts of the Charter of the French Language unconstitutional causing some of his anglophone ministers to resign A few years later however he introduced modifications to the language charter These compromises reduced the controversy over language that had been a dominant feature of Quebec politics over the previous decades
Bourassa also pushed for Quebec to be acknowledged in the Canadian constitution as a distinct society promising Quebec residents that their grievances could be resolved within Canada with a new constitutional deal He worked closely with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and received many concessions from the federal government culminating in the Meech Lake Accord in and the Charlottetown Accord in The Meech Lake Accord failed in June when two provinces Manitoba and Newfoundland refused to ratify the agreement their premiers had signed That failure revived the Quebec separatist movement The Charlottetown Accord was defeated in a nationwide plebiscite in it was heavily defeated even in Quebec partly due to the perception that Bourassa had given away too much at the negotiations
Bourassa retired from politics in He was replaced as Liberal leader and premier by Daniel Johnson Jr who lost an election to the sovereigntist Parti Qu b cois after only nine months
In Bourassa who had spent much of his vacation time in hot climates died in Montreal of malignant melanoma at the age of and was interred at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal
No matter what anyone says and no matter what anyone does Quebec is today and forever a distinct society free and capable of assuming its destiny and development watch excerpts of original speech watch English dubbing Meech Lake Accord
There was no censorship of the press in general the War Measures Act could have been made even more radical
A diplomat had been kidnapped a cabinet minister had been kidnapped they were under threats of murder The police forces were rather tired After a whole week we were unable to find those that had effected the kidnappings

On October Montreal Mayor G rald Tremblay announced that Montreal's Park Avenue would be named after Bourassa On November the Montreal city council voted in favour of renaming Park Avenue after Bourassa If as had been expected Quebec's Toponymy Commission had approved the name change all of Park Avenue and its continuation Bleury would have been renamed Robert Bourassa Avenue This would have caused the newly named street to intersect Ren L vesque Boulevard named after a long time political rival to Bourassa That boulevard in turn had been renamed from Dorchester Boulevard in in a decision that was also not without controversy This decision by the City of Montreal without any consultation with the people of the city caused an immediate controversy though many of those opposed to the change considered it a fait accompli The proposal spawned substantial grass roots opposition both because of the lack of prior citizen input and because Park is itself a meaningful street name associated with the city's Mount Royal park In addition to protests and active opposition by a committee of Montreal residents and businesses opposed to the name change an online petition garnered more than virtual signatures against this renaming On February Montreal mayor G rald Tremblay withdrew his proposal to rename Park Avenue However there is a Robert Bourassa Blvd located in the Duvernay district of Laval Quebec
