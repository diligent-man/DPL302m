GS-specific cyclin-D is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CCND gene
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell cycle
Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases
Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event
This cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK or CDK whose activity is required for cell cycle GS transition
This protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation of tumor suppressor protein Rb
The CDK activity associated with this cyclin was reported to be necessary for cell cycle progression through G phase into mitosis after UV radiation
Mutations in CCND are implicated in cases of breast cancer
Cyclin D has been shown to interact with
