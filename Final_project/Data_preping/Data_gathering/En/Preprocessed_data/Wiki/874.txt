the constitutional convention took place in philadelphia from may to september
although the convention was intended to revise the league of states and first system of government under the articles of confederation the intention from the outset of many of its proponents chief among them james madison of virginia and alexander hamilton of new york was to create a new frame of government rather than fix the existing one
the delegates elected george washington of virginia former commanding general of the continental army in the late american revolutionary war and proponent of a stronger national government to become president of the convention
the result of the convention was the creation of the constitution of the united states placing the convention among the most significant events in american history
the convention took place in the old pennsylvania state house now known as independence hall in philadelphia
at the time the convention was not referred to as a constitutional convention
it was contemporarily known as the federal convention the philadelphia convention or the grand convention at philadelphia
nor did most of the delegates arrive intending to draft a new constitution
many assumed that the purpose of the convention was to discuss and draft improvements to the existing articles of confederation and would not have agreed to participate otherwise
once the convention began however most of the delegates though not all came to agree in general terms that the goal would be a new system of government not simply a revised version of the articles of confederation
several broad outlines were proposed and debated most notably james madison s virginia plan and william paterson s new jersey plan
the virginia plan was selected as the basis for the new government and the delegates quickly reached consensus on a general blueprint of a federal government with three branches legislative executive and judicial along with the basic role of each branch
however disagreement over the specific design and powers of the branches delayed progress for weeks and threatened the success of the convention
the most contentious disputes involved the legislature specifically the composition and election procedures for the senate as the upper legislative house of a bicameral congress and whether proportional representation was to be defined by a state s geography or by its population
the role of the executive was also hotly debated including the key issues of whether to divide the executive power among three people or vest the power in a single chief executive to be called the president how a president would be elected the length of a presidential term and the number of allowable terms what offenses should be impeachable and whether judges should be chosen by the legislature or the executive
finally slavery was also a contentious issue with the delegates debating the insertion of a fugitive slave clause whether to allow the abolition of the slave trade and whether slaves were to be counted in proportional representation
most of the time during the convention was spent on deciding these issues
progress was slow until mid july when the connecticut compromise resolved enough lingering arguments for a draft written by the committee of detail to gain acceptance
though more modifications and compromises were made over the following weeks most of this draft can be found in the finished version of the constitution
after several more issues were debated and resolved the committee of style produced the final version in early september
it was voted on by the delegates inscribed on parchment with engraving for printing and signed by thirty nine of fifty five delegates on september
the completed proposed constitution was printed in several copies for review which began the debates and ratification process
soon after it was also printed in newspapers for public review
during the american revolution the thirteen american states replaced their colonial governments with republican constitutions based on the principle of separation of powers organizing government into legislative executive and judicial branches
these revolutionary constitutions endorsed legislative supremacy by placing most power in the legislature since it was viewed as most representative of the people including power traditionally considered as belonging to the executive and judicial branches
state governors lacked significant authority and state courts and judges were under the control of the legislative branch
after declaring independence from britain in the thirteen states created a permanent alliance to coordinate american efforts to win the revolutionary war
this alliance the united states was to be governed according to the articles of confederation which was more of a treaty between independent countries than a national constitution
the articles were adopted by the second continental congress in but not finally ratified by all states until
during the confederation period the united states was essentially a federation of independent republics with the articles guaranteeing state sovereignty and independence
the confederation was governed by the congress of the confederation a unicameral legislature whose members were chosen by the state legislatures and in which each state cast a single vote
congress was given a limited set of powers mainly in the area of waging war and foreign affairs
it could not levy taxes or tariffs and it could only request money from the states with no power to force delinquent states to pay
since the articles could only be amended by a unanimous vote of the states any state had effective veto power over any proposed change
a super majority nine of thirteen state delegations was required for congress to pass major legislation such as declaring war making treaties or borrowing money
the confederation had no executive or judicial branches which meant the confederation government lacked effective means to enforce its own laws and treaties against state non compliance
it soon became evident to nearly all that the confederation government as originally organized was inadequate for managing the various problems confronting the united states
once the immediate task of winning the war had passed states began to look to their own interests rather than those of the whole country
by the mid s states were refusing to provide congress with funding which meant the confederation government could not pay the interest on its foreign debt pay soldiers stationed along the ohio river or defend american navigation rights on the mississippi river against spanish interference
in rhode island vetoed an amendment that would have allowed congress to levy taxes on imports to pay off federal debts
a second attempt was made to approve a federal impost in however this time it was new york which disapproved
the confederation congress also lacked the power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce
britain france and spain imposed various restrictions on american ships and products while the us was unable to coordinate retaliatory trade policies
when states like massachusetts or pennsylvania placed reciprocal duties on british trade neighboring states such as connecticut and delaware established free ports to gain an economic advantage
in the s some states even began applying customs duties against the trade of neighboring states
in congress proposed an amendment to give it powers over foreign trade however it failed to receive unanimous approval by the states
many upper class americans complained that state constitutions were too democratic and as a result legislators were more concerned with maintaining popular approval than doing what was best for the nation
the most pressing example was the way state legislatures responded to calls for economic relief in the s
many people were unable to pay taxes and debts due to a post war economic depression that was exacerbated by a scarcity of gold and silver coins
states responded by issuing paper currency which often depreciated in value and by making it easier to defer tax and debt payments
these policies favored debtors at the expense of creditors and it was proposed that congress be given power to prevent such populist laws
when the government of massachusetts refused to enact similar relief legislation rural farmers resorted to violence in shays rebellion
this rebellion was led by a former revolutionary war captain daniel shays a small farmer with tax debts who had never received payment for his service in the continental army
the rebellion took months for massachusetts to put down and some desired a federal army that would be able to put down such insurrections
these and other issues greatly worried many of the founders that the union as it existed up to that point was in danger of breaking apart
in september delegates from five states met at the annapolis convention and invited all states to a larger convention to be held in philadelphia in
the confederation congress later endorsed this convention for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation
rhode island was the only state that refused to send delegates though it would become the last state to ratify the constitution in may
originally planned to begin on may the convention had to be postponed when very few of the selected delegates were present on that day due to the difficulty of travel in the late th century
on may only delegates from virginia and pennsylvania were present
it was not until may that a quorum of seven states was secured and the convention could begin inside the pennsylvania state house
new hampshire delegates would not join the convention until july more than halfway through the proceedings
among the first things that the convention did were to choose a presiding officer unanimously electing george washington to be the president of the convention and to select james mchenry to be the convention s secretary
the convention then adopted rules to govern its proceedings
each state delegation received a single vote either for or against a proposal in accordance with the majority opinion of the state s delegates
this rule increased the power of the smaller states
when a state s delegates divided evenly on a motion the state did not cast a vote
throughout the convention delegates would regularly come and go
only to delegates were present on a typical day and each state had its own quorum requirements
maryland and connecticut allowed a single delegate to cast its vote
new york required all three of its delegates to be present
if too few of a state s delegates were in attendance the state did not cast a vote
after two of new york s three delegates abandoned the convention in mid july with no intention of returning new york was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the convention although alexander hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates
the rules allowed delegates to demand reconsideration of any decision previously voted on
this allowed the delegates to take straw votes to measure the strength of controversial proposals and to change their minds as they worked for consensus
it was also agreed that the discussions and votes would be kept secret until the conclusion of the meeting
despite the sweltering summer heat the windows of the meeting hall were nailed shut to keep the proceedings a secret from the public
although william jackson was elected as secretary his records were brief and included very little detail
madison s notes of debates in the federal convention of supplemented by the notes of robert yates remain the most complete record of the convention
due to the pledge to secrecy madison s account was not published until after his death in
james madison of virginia arrived in philadelphia eleven days early and determined to set the convention s agenda
before the convention madison studied republics and confederacies throughout history such as ancient greece and contemporary switzerland
in april he drafted a document titled vices of the political system of the united states which systematically evaluated the american political system and offered solutions for its weaknesses
due to his advance preparation madison s blueprint for constitutional revision became the starting point for the convention s deliberations
madison believed the solution to america s problems was to be found in a strong central government
congress needed compulsory taxation authority as well as power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce
to prevent state interference with the federal government s authority madison believed there needed to be a way to enforce the federal supremacy such as an explicit right of congress to use force against non compliant states and the creation of a federal court system
madison also believed the method of representation in congress had to change
since under madison s plan congress would exercise authority over citizens directly not simply through the states representation ought to be apportioned by population with more populous states having more votes in congress
madison was also concerned with preventing a tyranny of the majority
the government needed to be neutral between the various factions or interest groups that divided society creditors and debtors rich and poor or farmers merchants and manufacturers
madison believed that a single faction could more easily control the government within a state but would have a more difficult time dominating a national government comprising many different interest groups
the government could be designed to further insulate officeholders from the pressures of a majority faction
to protect both national authority and minority rights madison believed congress should be granted veto power over state laws
while waiting for the convention to formally begin madison sketched out his initial proposal which became known as the virginia plan and reflected his views as a strong nationalist
the virginia and pennsylvania delegates agreed with madison s plan and formed what came to be the predominant coalition within the convention
the plan was modeled on the state governments and was written in the form of fifteen resolutions outlining basic principles
it lacked the system of checks and balances that would become central to the us constitution
it called for a supreme national government and was a radical departure from the articles of confederation
on may edmund randolph the governor of virginia presented the virginia plan to the convention
the same day charles pinckney of south carolina introduced his own plan that also greatly increased the power of the national government however the supporters of the virginia plan ensured that it rather than pinckney s plan received the most consideration
many of pinckney s ideas did appear in the final draft of the constitution
his plan called for a bicameral legislature made up of a house of delegates and a senate
the popularly elected house would elect senators who would serve for four year terms and represent one of four regions
the national legislature would have veto power over state laws
the legislature would elect a chief executive called a president
the president and his cabinet would have veto power over legislation
the plan also included a national judiciary
on may the convention agreed at the request of gouverneur morris that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative executive and judiciary
this was the convention s first move towards going beyond its mandate merely to amend the articles of confederation and instead produce an entirely new government
once it had agreed to the idea of a supreme national government the convention began debating specific parts of the virginia plan
the virginia plan called for the unicameral confederation congress to be replaced with a bicameral congress
this would be a truly national legislature with power to make laws in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent it would also be able to veto state laws
representation in both houses of congress would be apportioned according either to quotas of contribution a state s wealth as reflected in the taxes it paid or the size of each state s non slave population
the lower house of congress would be directly elected by the people while the upper house would be elected by the lower house from candidates nominated by state legislatures
immediately after agreeing to form a supreme national government the delegates turned to the virginia plan s proposal for proportional representation in congress
virginia pennsylvania and massachusetts the most populous states were unhappy with the one vote per state rule in the confederation congress because they could be outvoted by the smaller states despite representing more than half of the nation s population
nevertheless the delegates were divided over the best way to apportion representatives
quotas of contribution appealed to southern delegates because they would include slave property but rufus king of massachusetts highlighted the impractical side of such a scheme
if the national government did not impose direct taxes which for the next century it rarely did he noted representatives could not be assigned
calculating such quotas would also be difficult due to lack of reliable data
basing representation on the number of free inhabitants was unpopular with delegates from the south where forty percent of the population was enslaved
in addition the small states were opposed to any change that decreased their own influence
delaware s delegation threatened to leave the convention if proportional representation replaced equal representation so debate on apportionment was postponed
on june william paterson of new jersey reminded the delegates that they were sent to philadelphia to revise the articles of confederation not to establish a national government
while he agreed that the confederation congress needed new powers including the power to coerce the states he was adamant that a confederation required equal representation for states
james madison records his words as follows
on may the delegates discussed the structure of congress and how its members would be selected
the division of the legislature into an upper and lower house was familiar and had wide support
the british parliament had an elected house of commons and a hereditary house of lords
all the states had bicameral legislatures except for pennsylvania
the delegates quickly agreed that each house of congress should be able to originate bills
they also agreed that the new congress would have all the legislative powers of the confederation congress and veto power over state laws
there was some opposition to the popular election of the lower house or house of representatives
elbridge gerry of massachusetts and roger sherman of connecticut feared the people were too easily misled by demagogues and that popular election could lead to mob rule and anarchy
pierce butler of south carolina believed that only wealthy men of property could be trusted with political power
the majority of the convention however supported popular election
george mason of virginia said the lower house was to be the grand depository of the democratic principle of the government
there was general agreement that the upper house or senate should be smaller and more selective than the lower house
its members should be gentlemen drawn from the most intelligent and virtuous among the citizenry
experience had convinced the delegates that such an upper house was necessary to tame the excesses of the democratically elected lower house
the virginia plan s method of selecting the senate was more controversial
members concerned with preserving state power wanted state legislatures to select senators while james wilson of pennsylvania proposed direct election by the people
it was not until june that the delegates unanimously decided that state legislatures would choose senators
on the question of proportional representation the three large states still faced opposition from the eight small states
james wilson realized that the large states needed the support of the deep south states of georgia and the carolinas
for these southern delegates the main priority was protection of slavery
working with john rutledge of south carolina wilson along with charles pinckney of south carolina and roger sherman of connecticut proposed the three fifths compromise on june
this resolution apportioned seats in the house of representatives based on a state s free population plus three fifths of its slave population
nine states voted in favor with only new jersey and delaware against
this compromise would give the south at least a dozen additional congressmen and electoral college votes
that same day the large state slave state alliance also succeeded in applying the three fifths ratio to senate seats though this was later overturned
as english law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions law making embodied in the legislature and law executing embodied in the king and his courts the division of the legislature from the executive and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point
even so the form the executive should take its powers and its selection would be sources of constant dispute through the summer of
at the time few nations had nonhereditary executives that could serve as models
the dutch republic was led by a stadtholder but this office was usually inherited by members of the house of orange
the swiss confederacy had no single leader and the elective monarchies of the holy roman empire and polish lithuanian commonwealth were viewed as corrupt
as a result of their colonial experience americans distrusted a strong chief executive
under the articles of confederation the closest thing to an executive was the committee of the states which was empowered to transact government business while congress was in recess
however this body was largely inactive
the revolutionary state constitutions made the governors subordinate to the legislatures denying them executive veto power over legislation
without veto power governors were unable to block legislation that threatened minority rights
states chose governors in different ways
many state constitutions empowered legislatures to select them but several allowed direct election by the people
in pennsylvania the people elected an executive council and the legislature appointed one of its members to be chief executive
the virginia plan proposed a national executive chosen by congress
it would have power to execute national laws and be vested with the power to make war and treaties
whether the executive would be a single person or a group of people was not defined
the executive together with a convenient number of federal judges would form a council of revision with the power to veto any act of congress
this veto could be overridden by an unspecified number of votes in both houses of congress
james wilson feared that the virginia plan made the executive too dependent on congress
he argued that there should be a single unitary executive
members of a multiple executive would most likely be chosen from different regions and represent regional interests
in wilson s view only a single executive could represent the entire nation while giving energy dispatch and responsibility to the government
wilson used his understanding of civic virtue as defined by the scottish enlightenment to help design the presidency
the challenge was to design a properly constituted executive that was fit for a republic and based on civic virtue by the general citizenry
he spoke times calling for a chief executive who would be energetic independent and accountable
he believed that the moderate level of class conflict in american society produced a level of sociability and inter class friendships that could make the presidency the symbolic leader of the entire american people
wilson did not consider the possibility of bitterly polarized political parties
he saw popular sovereignty as the cement that held america together linking the interests of the people and of the presidential administration
the president should be a man of the people who embodied the national responsibility for the public good and provided transparency and accountability by being a highly visible national leader as opposed to numerous largely anonymous congressmen
on june wilson proposed that the executive consist of a single person this motion was seconded by charles pinckney whose plan called for a single executive and specifically named this official a president
edmund randolph agreed with wilson that the executive needed vigor but he disapproved of a unitary executive which he feared was the foetus of monarchy
randolph and george mason led the opposition against a unitary executive but most delegates agreed with wilson
the prospect that george washington would be the first president may have allowed the proponents of a unitary executive to accumulate a large coalition
wilson s motion for a single executive passed on june
initially the convention set the executive s term of office to seven years but this would be revisited
wilson also argued that the executive should be directly elected by the people
only through direct election could the executive be independent of both congress and the states
this view was unpopular
a few delegates such as roger sherman elbridge gerry and pierce butler opposed the direct election of the executive because they considered the people too easily manipulated
however most delegates did not question the intelligence of the voters rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late th century
due to a lack of information the average voter would be too ignorant about the candidates to make an informed decision
sherman proposed an arrangement similar to a parliamentary system in which the executive should be appointed by and directly accountable to the legislature
a majority of delegates favored the president s election by congress for a seven year term though there was concern that this would give the legislature too much power
southern delegates supported selection by state legislatures but this was opposed by nationalists such as madison who feared that such a president would become a power broker between different states interests rather than a symbol of national unity
realizing that direct election was impossible wilson proposed what would become the electoral college the states would be divided into districts in which voters would choose electors who would then elect the president
this would preserve the separation of powers and keep the state legislatures out of the selection process
initially however this scheme received little support
the issue was one of the last major issues to be resolved
resolution was achieved by adjustment to the electoral college proposal
at the time before the formation of modern political parties there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college
the method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue
most thought that the house of representatives should then choose the president since it most closely reflected the will of the people
this caused dissension among delegates from smaller states who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage
to resolve this dispute the convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc rather than individually
the virginia plan made no provision for removing the executive
on june john dickinson of delaware proposed that the president be removed from office by congress at the request of a majority of state legislatures
madison and wilson opposed this state interference in the national executive branch
sherman argued that congress should be able to remove the president for any reason in what was essentially a vote of no confidence
george mason worried that would make the president a mere creature of the legislature and violate the separation of powers
dickinson s motion was rejected but in the aftermath of the vote there was still no consensus over how an unfit president should be removed from office
on june the delegates debated the council of revision
wilson and alexander hamilton of new york disagreed with the mixing of executive and judicial branches
they wanted the president to have an absolute veto to guarantee his independence from the legislative branch
remembering how colonial governors used their veto to extort money from the legislature benjamin franklin of pennsylvania opposed giving the president an absolute veto
gerry proposed that a two thirds majority in both houses of congress be able to overrule any veto of the council of revision
this was amended to replace the council with the president alone but madison insisted on retaining a council of revision and consideration of the veto power was postponed
in the english tradition judges were seen as agents of the king and his court who represented him throughout his realm
madison believed that in the american states this direct link between state executives and judges was a source of corruption through patronage and thought the link had to be severed between the two thus creating the third branch of the judiciary which had been without any direct precedent before this point
on june delegates unanimously agreed to a national judiciary of one supreme tribunal and one or more inferior tribunals
the delegates disagreed on how federal judges should be chosen
the virginia plan called for the national legislature to appoint judges
james wilson wanted the president to appoint judges to increase the power of that office
on june the revised report on the virginia plan was issued
this report summarized the decisions made by the delegates in the first two weeks of the convention
it was agreed that a national judiciary be established to consist of one supreme tribunal
congress would have the power to create and appoint inferior courts
judges were to hold office during good behavior and the senate would appoint them
the small state delegates were alarmed at the plan taking shape a supreme national government that could override state laws and proportional representation in both houses of congress
william paterson and other delegates from new jersey connecticut maryland and new york created an alternative plan that consisted of several amendments to the articles of confederation
under the new jersey plan as it was called the confederation congress would remain unicameral with each state having one vote
congress would be allowed to levy tariffs and other taxes as well as regulate trade and commerce
congress would elect a plural federal executive whose members would serve a single term and could be removed by congress at the request of a majority of state governors
there would also be a federal judiciary to apply us law
federal judges would serve for life and be appointed by the executives
laws enacted by congress would take precedence over state laws
this plan was introduced on june
on june alexander hamilton of new york presented his own plan that was at odds with both the virginia and new jersey plans
it called for the constitution to be modeled on the british government
the bicameral legislature included a lower house called the assembly elected by the people for three year terms
the people would choose electors who would elect the members of a senate who served for life
electors would also choose a single executive called the governor who would also serve for life
the governor would have an absolute veto over bills
there would also be a national judiciary whose members would serve for life
hamilton called for the abolition of the states or at least their reduction to sub jurisdictions with limited powers
some scholars have suggested that hamilton presented this radical plan to help secure passage of the virginia plan by making it seem moderate by comparison
the plan was so out of step with political reality that it was not even debated and hamilton would be troubled for years by accusations that he was a monarchist
on june the delegates voted on the new jersey plan
with the support of the slave states and connecticut the large states defeated the plan by a margin
maryland s delegation was divided so it did not vote
this did not end the debate over representation
rather the delegates found themselves in a stalemate that lasted into july
on several occasions the connecticut delegation roger sherman oliver ellsworth and william samuel johnson proposed a compromise that the house would have proportional representation and the senate equal representation
a version of this compromise had originally been crafted and proposed by sherman on june
he agreed with madison that the senate should be composed of the wisest and most virtuous citizens but he also saw its role as defending the rights and interests of the states
james madison recorded sherman s june speech as follows
on june johnson made a similar point that in one branch the people ought to be represented in the other the states neither side was ready yet to embrace the concept of divided sovereignty between the states and a federal government however
the distrust between large and small state delegates had reached a low point exemplified by comments made on june by gunning bedford jr
as reported by robert yates bedford stated
as the convention was entering its second full month of deliberations it was decided that further consideration of the prickly question of how to apportion representatives in the national legislature should be referred to a committee composed of one delegate from each of the eleven states present at that time at the convention
the members of this grand committee as it has come to be known included william paterson of new jersey robert yates of new york luther martin of maryland gunning bedford jr
of delaware oliver ellsworth of connecticut abraham baldwin of georgia elbridge gerry of massachusetts george mason of virginia william davie of north carolina john rutledge of south carolina and benjamin franklin of pennsylvania
the committee s composition heavily favored the smaller states as even the large state delegates tended to be more moderate
while the convention took a three day recess in observance of the fourth of july holiday the grand committee began its work
franklin proposed and the committee adopted a compromise similar to the connecticut plan
membership in the house would be apportioned by population with members elected from districts of forty thousand people
each state would have an equal vote in the senate
to gain large state support however franklin proposed that the house of representatives have exclusive power to originate bills concerned with raising money or government salaries this would become the origination clause
the committee presented its report on july but the compromise was not immediately adopted by the convention
for the next eleven days the convention stalled as delegates attempted to gain as many votes for their states as possible
on july a five man committee was appointed to allocate specific numbers of representatives to each state
it called for a member house of representatives and used t he number of blacks and whites with some regard to supposed wealth as a basis of allocating representatives to each state
the northern states had representatives while the southern states had
delegates from non slave states objected to counting slaves as they could not vote
on july a new committee was chosen to reconsider the allocation of representatives
this time there were eleven members one from each state
it recommended a member house with allocation of representatives based on the number of free inhabitants and three fifths of slaves
under this new scheme northern states had representatives and the south had
southern delegates protested the north s greater representation and argued that their growing populations had been underestimated
the committee of eleven s report was approved but the divergent interests of the northern and southern states remained obstacles to reaching consensus
on july edmund randolph called for a regular census on which to base future reallocation of house seats
during the debate on the census south carolina delegates pierce butler and charles cotesworth pinckney sought to replace the three fifths ratio with a full count of the slave population
they argued that slave property contributed to the wealth of the southern states and as such should be used in calculating representation
this irritated northern delegates already reluctant to support the three fifths compromise
james wilson one of the authors of the three fifths compromise asked are slaves to be admitted as citizens then why are they not admitted on an equality with white citizens are they admitted as property then why is not other property admitted into the computation
after fierce debate the delegates voted to apportion representation and direct taxation based on all free inhabitants and three fifths of the slave population
this formula would apply to the existing states as well as any states created in the future
the first census would occur six years after the new federal government began operations and every ten years afterwards
on july john rutledge and james wilson attempted to secure proportional representation in the senate
charles pinckney proposed a form of semi proportional representation in which the smaller states would gain more representation than under a completely proportional system
this proposal was defeated
in a close vote on july the convention adopted the connecticut compromise also known as the great compromise as recommended by the grand committee
on july the convention decided that each state should have two senators rather than three
it rejected a proposal by luther martin of maryland that senators from the same state cast a single joint vote which was the practice in the confederation congress
martin believed this was necessary if the senate was to represent the interests of the states
instead the convention gave senators individual voting power
this accomplished the nationalist goal of preventing state governments from having a direct say in congress s choice to make national laws
the final document was thus a mixture of madison s original national constitution and the desired federal constitution that many of the delegates sought
on july the delegates worked to define the powers of congress
the virginia plan asserted the supremacy of the national government giving congress authority to legislate in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent and stating that congressional legislation would take precedence over conflicting state laws
in a motion introduced by gunning bedford the convention approved this provision with only south carolina and georgia voting against
four small states connecticut new jersey delaware and maryland accepted the expansion of congressional power
later in life madison explained that this was a result of the great compromise
once the small states were assured they would be represented in the new government they exceeded all others in zeal for a strong national government
the virginia plan also gave congress veto power over state laws
madison believed this provision was crucial to prevent the states from engaging in irresponsible behavior such as had occurred under the confederation government
gouverneur morris feared the congressional veto would alienate states that might otherwise support the constitution
luther martin argued that it would be too impractical and time consuming asking shall the laws of the states be sent up to the general legislature before they shall be permitted to operate
the convention rejected the congressional veto
in its place martin proposed language taken from the new jersey plan that was unanimously approved by the convention that the legislative acts of the us made by virtue and pursuance of the articles of union and all treaties made and ratified under the authority of the us shall be the supreme law of the respective states
and that the
states shall be bound thereby in their decisions
in june the delegates voted to let congress appoint the executive but there remained concerns that this would make the executive branch subservient to the legislature
on july the convention returned to the topic
direct election by the people was defeated by a nine to one vote
luther martin then proposed an amended version of james wilson s idea for an electoral college first introduced in june
wilson had proposed that people vote for electors who would then select the president
martin s version called for state legislatures to choose electors but this was also defeated
later on july elbridge gerry unsuccessfully proposed that governors choose electors a policy that would have increased state influence over the presidency
after reaffirming congressional selection the delegates voted to allow the president to serve multiple terms a reversal of their earlier decision to limit the president to serving a single seven year term
james mcclurg of virginia went further and proposed that the president serve a lifelong term during good behavior
mcclurg believed this would protect the independence of the executive branch but this was rejected for being too close to monarchy
the convention decided that the method of removing an unfit president would be legislative impeachment
at the time impeachment was used by the british parliament to depose the king s ministers see impeachment in the united kingdom
needing a break from discussing the presidency the delegates once again considered the judicial branch on july
they were still divided over the method of appointment
half of the convention wanted the senate to choose judges while the other half wanted the president to do it
luther martin supported senate appointment because he thought that body s members would defend the interests of the individual states
nathaniel gorham suggested a compromise appointment by the president with the advice and consent of the senate
while the meaning of advice and consent was still undefined the proposal gained some support
on july madison offered an alternative compromise the president would appoint judges but the senate could veto an appointment by a two thirds majority
this proposal would have made it very hard for the senate to block judicial appointments
madison s proposal failed to garner support and the delegates ended by reaffirming that the senate would appoint judges
on july wilson and madison tried unsuccessfully to revive madison s council of revision proposal
while judges had a role in reviewing the constitutionality of laws argued gorham mixing the policy judgments of the president with the legal judgments of a court would violate separation of powers
john rutledge agreed saying judges ought never to give their opinion on a law till it comes before them
the delegates recognized that a major flaw with the articles of confederation was that any constitutional amendment required unanimous approval of the states
on july the convention endorsed the need for a different way of amending the constitution but it was not prepared to vote on specifics
it also discussed how the completed constitution would become law
oliver ellsworth and william paterson argued that state legislatures should ratify the constitution to align with precedent under the articles of confederation and because the legislatures represented the will of the people
nathaniel gorham argued that state legislators would reject the constitution to protect their own power
george mason believed that state legislatures lacked the authority to ratify the new constitution because they were creations of the state constitutions
mason argued that only the people acting through specially called state conventions could authorize a new government
madison agreed with mason
he considered the articles of confederation to be a mere treaty among the states but a true constitution could only be adopted by the people themselves
by a vote of nine to one the delegates voted to submit the constitution to state ratifying conventions
the convention adjourned from july to august to await the report of the committee of detail which was to produce a first draft of the constitution
it was chaired by john rutledge with the other members including edmund randolph oliver ellsworth james wilson and nathaniel gorham
though the committee did not record minutes of its proceedings three key surviving documents offer clues to the committee s handiwork an outline by randolph with edits by rutledge extensive notes and a second draft by wilson also with rutledge s edits and the committee s final report to the convention
from this evidence it is thought that the committee used the original virginia plan the decisions of the convention on modifications to that plan and other sources such as the articles of confederation provisions of the state constitutions and even charles pinckney s plan to produce the first full draft which author david o
stewart has called a remarkable copy and paste job
randolph adopted two rules in preparing his initial outline that the constitution should only include essential principles avoiding minor provisions that would change over time and that it should be stated in simple and precise language
much of what was included in the committee s report consisted of numerous details that the convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged and as such much of the committee s proposal would ultimately be incorporated into the final version of the constitution without debate
examples of these details included the speech and debate clause which grants members of congress immunity for comments made in their jobs and the rules for organizing the house of representatives and the senate
however rutledge himself a former state governor was determined that while the new national government should be stronger than the confederation government had been the national government s power over the states should not be limitless and at rutledge s urging the committee went beyond what the convention had proposed
as stewart describes it the committee hijacked and remade the constitution altering critical agreements the convention delegates had already made enhancing the powers of the states at the expense of the national government and adding several far reaching provisions that the convention had never discussed
the first major change insisted on by rutledge was meant to sharply curtail the essentially unlimited powers to legislate in all cases for the general interests of the union that the convention only two weeks earlier had agreed to grant the congress
rutledge and randolph worried that the broad powers implied in the language agreed on by the convention would have given the national government too much power at the expense of the states
in randolph s outline the committee replaced that language with a list of specific enumerated powers many adopted from the articles of confederation that would strictly limit the congress authority to measures such as imposing taxes making treaties going to war and establishing post offices
rutledge however was not able to convince all the members of the committee to accept the change
over the course of a series of drafts a catchall provision the necessary and proper clause was eventually added most likely by wilson a nationalist little concerned with the sovereignty of individual states giving the congress the broad power to make all laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof another revision of wilson s draft also placed eight specific limits on the states such as barring them from independently entering into treaties and from printing their own money providing a certain degree of balance to the limits on the national government intended by rutledge s list of enumerated powers
in addition wilson s draft modified the language of the supremacy clause adopted by the convention to ensure that national law would take precedence over inconsistent state laws
these changes set the final balance between the national and state governments that would be entered into the final document as the convention never challenged this dual sovereignty between nation and state that had been fashioned by rutledge and wilson
another set of radical changes introduced by the committee of detail proved far more contentious when the committee s report was presented to the convention
on the day the convention had agreed to appoint the committee southerner charles cotesworth pinckney of south carolina had warned of dire consequences should the committee fail to include protections for slavery in the southern states or allow for taxing of southern agricultural exports
in response to pinckney and his fellow southern delegates the committee had included three provisions that explicitly restricted the congress authority in ways favorable to southern interests
the proposed language would bar the congress from ever interfering with the slave trade
it would also prohibit taxation of exports and would require that any legislation concerning regulation of foreign commerce through tariffs or quotas that is any laws akin to england s navigation acts pass only with two thirds majorities of both houses of congress
while much of the rest of the committee s report would be accepted without serious challenge on the convention floor these last three proposals provoked outrage from northern delegates and slavery opponents
the final report of the committee which became the first draft of the constitution was the first workable constitutional plan as madison s virginia plan had simply been an outline of goals and a broad structure
even after it issued this report the committee continued to meet off and on until early september
another month of discussion and relatively minor refinement followed during which several attempts were made to alter the rutledge draft though few were successful
some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money
madison in particular wanted to push the constitution back in the direction of his virginia plan
one important change that did make it into the final version included the agreement between northern and southern delegates to empower congress to end the slave trade starting in
southern and northern delegates also agreed to strengthen the fugitive slave clause in exchange for removing a requirement that two thirds of congress agree on navigation acts regulations of commerce between states and foreign governments
the two thirds requirement was favored by southern delegates who thought congress might pass navigation acts that would be economically harmful to slaveholders
once the convention had finished amending the first draft from the committee of detail a new set of unresolved questions were sent to several different committees for resolution
the committee of detail was considering several questions related to habeas corpus freedom of the press and an executive council to advise the president
two committees addressed questions related to the slave trade and the assumption of war debts
a new committee was created the committee on postponed parts to address other questions that had been postponed
its members such as madison were delegates who had shown a greater desire for compromise and were chosen for this reason as most in the convention wanted to finish their work and go home
the committee dealt with questions related to the taxes war making patents and copyrights relations with indigenous tribes and franklin s compromise to require money bills to originate in the house
the biggest issue they addressed was the presidency and the final compromise was written by madison with the committee s input
they adopted wilson s earlier plan for choosing the president by an electoral college and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority which many such as madison thought would be nineteen times out of twenty
the committee also shortened the president s term from seven years to four years freed the president to seek re election after an initial term and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the senate
they also created the office of the vice president whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office to preside over the senate and to cast tie breaking votes in the senate
the committee transferred important powers from the senate to the president for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors
one controversial issue throughout much of the convention had been the length of the president s term and whether the president was to be term limited
the problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by congress the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to congress so a shorter term with eligibility for re election became a viable option
near the end of the convention gerry randolph and mason emerged as the main force of opposition
their fears were increased as the convention moved from madison s vague virginia plan to the concrete plan of rutledge s committee of detail
some have argued that randolph s attacks on the constitution were motivated by political ambition in particular his anticipation of possibly facing rival patrick henry in a future election
the main objection of the three was the compromise that would allow congress to pass navigation acts with a simple majority in exchange for strengthened slave provisions
among their other objections was an opposition to the office of vice president
though most of their complaints did not result in changes a couple did
mason succeeded in adding high crimes and misdemeanors to the impeachment clause
gerry also convinced the convention to include a second method for ratification of amendments
the report out of the committee of detail had included only one mechanism for constitutional amendment that required two thirds of the states to ask congress to convene a convention for consideration of amendments
upon gerry s urging the convention added back the virginia plan s original method whereby congress would propose amendments that the states would then ratify
all amendments to the constitution save the st amendment have been made through this latter method
despite their successes these three dissenters grew increasingly unpopular as most other delegates wanted to bring the convention s business to an end and return home
as the convention was drawing to a conclusion and delegates prepared to refer the constitution to the committee on style to pen the final version one delegate raised an objection over civil trials
he wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters and mason saw in this a larger opportunity
mason told the convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights which he thought could be prepared in a few hours
gerry agreed though the rest of the committee overruled them
they wanted to go home and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic
few at the time realized how important the issue would become with the absence of a bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti federalists against ratification
most of the convention s delegates thought that states already protected individual rights and that the constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights so there was no need to include protections of rights
once the convention moved beyond this point the delegates addressed a couple of last minute issues
importantly they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the house of representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected unmodified by the senate
the new language empowered the senate to modify spending bills proposed by the house
once the final modifications had been made the committee of style and arrangement was appointed to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house unlike other committees whose members were named so the committees included members from different regions this final committee included no champions of the small states
its members mostly supported a strong national government and were unsympathetic to calls for states rights
they were william samuel johnson connecticut alexander hamilton new york gouverneur morris pennsylvania james madison virginia and rufus king massachusetts
on wednesday september the report of the committee of style was ordered printed for the convenience of the delegates
for three days the convention compared this final version with the proceedings of the convention
the constitution was then ordered engrossed on saturday september by jacob shallus and was submitted for signing on september
it made at least one important change to what the convention had agreed to king wanted to prevent states from interfering in contracts
although the convention never took up the matter his language was now inserted creating the contract clause
gouverneur morris is credited both now and then as the chief draftsman of the final document including the stirring preamble
not all the delegates were pleased with the results thirteen left before the ceremony and three of those remaining refused to sign edmund randolph of virginia george mason of virginia and elbridge gerry of massachusetts
mason demanded a bill of rights if he was to support the constitution
the bill of rights was not included in the constitution submitted to the states for ratification but many states ratified the constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow
shortly before the document was to be signed gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from to citizens
a similar measure had been proposed earlier and failed by one vote
george washington spoke up here making his only substantive contribution to the text of the constitution in supporting this move
the convention adopted it without further debate
gorham would sign the document although he had openly doubted whether the united states would remain a single unified nation for more than years
ultimately of the delegates who attended had been chosen from states ended up signing but it is likely that none were completely satisfied
their views were summed up by benjamin franklin who said i confess that there are several parts of this constitution which i do not at present approve but i am not sure i shall never approve them
i doubt too whether any other convention we can obtain may be able to make a better constitution
it therefore astonishes me sir to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does and i think it will astonish our enemies rhode island never sent delegates and two of new york s three delegates did not stay at the convention for long
therefore as george washington stated the document was executed by eleven states and colonel hamilton washington signed the document first and then moving by state delegation from north to south as had been the custom throughout the convention the delegates filed to the front of the room to sign their names
at the time the document was signed franklin gave a persuasive speech involving an anecdote on a sun that was painted on the back of washington s chippendale chair
as recounted in madison s notes
whilst the last members were signing it doctr
franklin looking towards the presidents chair at the back of which a rising sun happened to be painted observed to a few members near him that painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun
i have said he often and often in the course of the session and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue looked at that behind the president without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting but now at length i have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun the constitution was then submitted to the states for ratification pursuant to its own article vii
slavery was one of the most difficult issues confronting the delegates
slavery was widespread in the states at the time of the convention
at least a third of the convention s delegates owned slaves including all of the delegates from virginia and south carolina
slaves comprised approximately one fifth of the population of the states and apart from northernmost new england where slavery had largely been eliminated slaves lived in all regions of the country
however more than of the slaves lived in the south where approximately in families owned slaves in the largest and wealthiest state virginia that figure was nearly in families
the entire agrarian economy of the south was based on slave labor and the southern delegates to the convention were unwilling to accept any proposal that they believed would threaten the institution
whether slavery was to be regulated under the new constitution was a matter of such intense conflict between the north and south that several southern states refused to join the union if slavery were not to be allowed
delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery be outlawed within the new nation
however they continued to argue that the constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade including in the importation of new slaves from africa and the export of slaves to other countries
the convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue
during the convention s late july recess the committee of detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves
the convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late august so they referred the matter to an eleven member committee for further discussion
this committee helped work out a compromise congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade but not for another twenty years that is not until
in exchange for this concession the federal government s power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two thirds majorities of both houses of congress to simple majorities
another contentious slavery related question was whether slaves would be counted as part of the population in determining representation of the states in the congress or would instead be considered property and as such not be considered for purposes of representation
delegates from states with a large population of slaves argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation but as property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on the basis of population
delegates from states where slavery had become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation but not in determining representation
finally delegate james wilson proposed the three fifths compromise
this was eventually adopted by the convention
fifty five delegates attended sessions of the constitutional convention and are considered the framers of the constitution although only delegates actually signed
the states had originally appointed representatives to the convention but a number of the appointees did not accept or could not attend leaving who would ultimately craft the constitution
almost all of the framers had taken part in the revolution with at least having served in the continental forces most in positions of command
all but two or three had served in colonial or state government during their careers
the vast majority about of the delegates were or had been members of the confederation congress and many had been members of the continental congress during the revolution
several had been state governors
only two delegates roger sherman and robert morris would sign all three of the nation s founding documents the declaration of independence the articles of confederation and the constitution
more than half of the delegates had trained as lawyers several had even been judges although only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business
others were merchants manufacturers shippers land speculators bankers or financiers
several were physicians or small farmers and one was a minister
of the who owned slaves depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income
most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings and most except for roger sherman alexander hamilton and william few were very comfortably wealthy
george washington and robert morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country
their depth of knowledge and experience in self government was remarkable
as thomas jefferson in paris semi seriously wrote to john adams in london it really is an assembly of demigods
did not sign the final draft of the u s
constitution
randolph mason and gerry were the only three present in philadelphia at the time who refused to sign
several prominent founders are notable for not participating in the constitutional convention
thomas jefferson was abroad serving as the minister to france
john adams was in britain serving as minister to that country but he wrote home to encourage the delegates
patrick henry refused to participate because he smelt a rat in philadelphia tending toward the monarchy also absent were john hancock and samuel adams
many of the states older and more experienced leaders may have simply been too busy with the local affairs of their states to attend the convention which had originally been planned to strengthen the existing articles of confederation not to write a constitution for a completely new national government
the film a more perfect union which portrays the events and discussions of the constitutional convention was largely filmed in independence hall
