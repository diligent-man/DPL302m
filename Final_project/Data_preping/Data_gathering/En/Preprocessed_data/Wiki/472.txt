The Wehrmacht German pronunciation ˈveːɐ̯maxt listen lit 'defence force' was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from to
It consisted of the Heer army the Kriegsmarine navy and the Luftwaffe air force
The designation Wehrmacht replaced the previously used term Reichswehr and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted
After the Nazi rise to power in one of Adolf Hitler's most overt and audacious moves was to establish the Wehrmacht a modern offensively-capable armed force fulfilling the Nazi rgime's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours
This required the reinstatement of conscription and massive investment and defense spending on the arms industry
The Wehrmacht formed the heart of Germany's politico-military power
In the early part of the Second World War the Wehrmacht employed combined arms tactics close-cover air-support tanks and infantry to devastating effect in what became known as Blitzkrieg lightning war
Its campaigns in France the Soviet Union and North Africa are regarded by historians as acts of boldness
At the same time the far-flung advances strained the Wehrmacht's capacity to the breaking point culminating in its first major defeat in the Battle of Moscow by late Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres
The German operational art proved no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition making the Wehrmacht's weaknesses in strategy doctrine and logistics readily apparent
Closely cooperating with the SS and the Einsatzgruppen the German armed forces committed numerous war crimes despite later denials and promotion of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht
The majority of the war crimes took place in the Soviet Union Poland Yugoslavia Greece and Italy as part of the war of annihilation against the Soviet Union the Holocaust and Nazi security warfare
During World War II about million men served in the Wehrmacht
By the time the war ended in Europe in May German forces consisting of the Heer the Kriegsmarine the Luftwaffe the Waffen-SS the Volkssturm and foreign collaborator units had lost approximately men about half of whom were missing or killed during the war
Only a few of the Wehrmacht's upper leadership went on trial for war crimes despite evidence suggesting that more were involved in illegal actions
According to Ian Kershaw most of the three million Wehrmacht soldiers who invaded the USSR participated in committing war crimes
The German term Wehrmacht stems from the compound word of German wehren to defend and Macht power force
It has been used to describe any nation's armed forces for example Britische Wehrmacht meaning British Armed Forces
The Frankfurt Constitution of designated all German military forces as the German Wehrmacht consisting of the Seemacht sea force and the Landmacht land force
In the term Wehrmacht also appears in Article of the Weimar Constitution establishing that The Reich's President holds supreme command of all armed forces ie
From Germany's national defense force was known as the Reichswehr a name that was dropped in favor of Wehrmacht on May
In January after World War I ended with the signing of the armistice of November the armed forces were dubbed Friedensheer peace army
In March the national assembly passed a law founding a -strong preliminary army the Vorlufige Reichswehr
The terms of the Treaty of Versailles were announced in May and in June Germany signed the treaty that among other terms imposed severe constraints on the size of Germany's armed forces
The army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy
The fleet was to consist of at most six battleships six cruisers and twelve destroyers
Submarines tanks and heavy artillery were forbidden and the air-force was dissolved
A new post-war military the Reichswehr was established on March
General conscription was abolished under another mandate of the Versailles treaty
The Reichswehr was limited to men and thus the armed forces under the leadership of Hans von Seeckt retained only the most capable officers
The American historians Alan Millet and Williamson Murray wrote In reducing the officers corps Seeckt chose the new leadership from the best men of the general staff with ruthless disregard for other constituencies such as war heroes and the nobility Seeckt's determination that the Reichswehr be an elite cadre force that would serve as the nucleus of an expanded military when the chance for restoring conscription came essentially led to the creation of a new army based upon but very different from the army that existed in World War I
In the s Seeckt and his officers developed new doctrines that emphasized speed aggression combined arms and initiative on the part of lower officers to take advantage of momentary opportunities
Though Seeckt retired in his influence on the army was still apparent when it went to war in
Germany was forbidden to have an air force by the Versailles treaty nonetheless Seeckt created a clandestine cadre of air force officers in the early s
These officers saw the role of an air force as winning air superiority strategic bombing and close air support
That the Luftwaffe did not develop a strategic bombing force in the s was not due to a lack of interest but because of economic limitations
The leadership of the Navy led by Grand Admiral Erich Raeder a close protg of Alfred von Tirpitz was dedicated to the idea of reviving Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet
Officers who believed in submarine warfare led by Admiral Karl Dönitz were in a minority before
By Germany had begun covertly circumventing the conditions of the Versailles treaty
A secret collaboration with the Soviet Union began after the Treaty of Rapallo
Major-General Otto Hasse de traveled to Moscow in to further negotiate the terms
Germany helped the Soviet Union with industrialization and Soviet officers were to be trained in Germany
German tank and air-force specialists could exercise in the Soviet Union and German chemical weapons research and manufacture would be carried out there along with other projects
In a fighter-pilot school was established at Lipetsk where several hundred German air force personnel received instruction in operational maintenance navigation and aerial combat training over the next decade until the Germans finally left in September
However the arms buildup was done in secrecy until Hitler came to power and it received broad political support
After the death of President Paul von Hindenburg on August Adolf Hitler assumed the office of President of Germany and thus became commander in chief
In February the Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg acting on his own initiative had all of the Jews serving in the Reichswehr given an automatic and immediate dishonorable discharge
Again on his own initiative Blomberg had the armed forces adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms in May
In August of the same year on Blomberg's initiative and that of the Ministeramt chief General Walther von Reichenau the entire military took the Hitler oath an oath of personal loyalty to Hitler
Hitler was most surprised at the offer the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is false
The oath read I swear by God this sacred oath that to the Leader of the German empire and people Adolf Hitler supreme commander of the armed forces I shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath
By Germany was openly flouting the military restrictions set forth in the Versailles Treaty German rearmament was announced on March with the Edict for the Buildup of the Wehrmacht German Gesetz fr den Aufbau der Wehrmacht and the reintroduction of conscription
While the size of the standing army was to remain at about the -man mark decreed by the treaty a new group of conscripts equal to this size would receive training each year
The conscription law introduced the name Wehrmacht the Reichswehr was officially renamed the Wehrmacht on May
Hitler's proclamation of the Wehrmacht's existence included a total of no less than divisions in its original projection contravening the Treaty of Versailles in grandiose fashion
In December General Ludwig Beck added tank battalions to the planned rearmament program
Hitler originally set a time frame of years for remilitarization but soon shortened it to four years
With the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the Anschluss the German Reich's territory increased significantly providing a larger population pool for conscription
Recruitment for the Wehrmacht was accomplished through voluntary enlistment and conscription with million being drafted and million volunteering in the period
The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht during its existence from to is believed to have approached million
The German military leadership originally aimed at a homogeneous military possessing traditional Prussian military values
However with Hitler's constant wishes to increase the Wehrmacht's size the Army was forced to accept citizens of lower class and education decreasing internal cohesion and appointing officers who lacked real-war experience from previous conflicts especially World War I and the Spanish Civil War
The effectiveness of officer training and recruitment by the Wehrmacht has been identified as a major factor in its early victories as well as its ability to keep the war going as long as it did even as the war turned against Germany
As the Second World War intensified Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe personnel were increasingly transferred to the army and voluntary enlistments in the SS were stepped up as well
Following the Battle of Stalingrad in fitness and physical health standards for Wehrmacht recruits were drastically lowered with the regime going so far as to create special diet battalions for men with severe stomach ailments
Rear-echelon personnel were more often sent to front-line duty wherever possible especially during the final two years of the war where inspired by constant propaganda the oldest and youngest were being recruited and driven by instilled fear and fanaticism to serve on the fronts and often to fight to the death whether judged to be cannon fodder or elite troops
Prior to World War II the Wehrmacht strove to remain a purely ethnic German force as such minorities within and outside of Germany such as the Czechs in annexed Czechoslovakia were exempted from military service after Hitler's takeover in
Foreign volunteers were generally not accepted in the German armed forces prior to
With the invasion of the Soviet Union in the government's positions changed
German propagandists wanted to present the war not as a purely German concern but as a multi-national crusade against the so-called Jewish Bolshevism
Hence the Wehrmacht and the SS began to seek out recruits from occupied and neutral countries across Europe the Germanic populations of the Netherlands and Norway were recruited largely into the SS while non-Germanic people were recruited into the Wehrmacht
The voluntary nature of such recruitment was often dubious especially in the later years of the war when even Poles living in the Polish Corridor were declared ethnic Germans and drafted
After Germany's defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad the Wehrmacht also made substantial use of personnel from the Soviet Union including the Caucasian Muslim Legion Turkestan Legion Crimean Tatars ethnic Ukrainians and Russians Cossacks and others who wished to fight against the Soviet regime or who were otherwise induced to join
Between and anti-communist White migrs who had left Russia after the Russian Revolution joined the ranks of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS with acting as interpreters and more than serving in the guard force of the Russian Protective Corps
In the beginning women in Nazi Germany were not involved in the Wehrmacht as Hitler ideologically opposed conscription for women stating that Germany would not form any section of women grenade throwers or any corps of women elite snipers However with many men going to the front women were placed in auxiliary positions within the Wehrmacht called Wehrmachtshelferinnen lit 'Female Wehrmacht Helper' participating in tasks as
operators of listening equipment in anti-aircraft defense operating projectors for anti-aircraft defense employees within meteorology services and auxiliary civil defense personnel
volunteer nurses in military health service as the German Red Cross or other voluntary organizationsThey were placed under the same authority as Hiwis auxiliary personnel of the army German Behelfspersonal and they were assigned to duties within the Reich and to a lesser extent in the occupied territories for example in the general government of occupied Poland in France and later in Yugoslavia in Greece and in Romania
By women were serving as Wehrmachtshelferinnen half of whom were volunteers while the other half performed obligatory services connected to the war effort German Kriegshilfsdienst
Basically Wehrmacht had to consist of only pure Germans but as the war progressed a large number of foreign volunteers and conscripts had to be mobilized due to a lack of manpower and the number reached even in the lowest estimate
Legally the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht was Adolf Hitler in his capacity as Germany's head of state a position he gained after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in August
With the creation of the Wehrmacht in Hitler elevated himself to Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces retaining the position until his suicide on April
The title of Commander-in-Chief was given to the Minister of the Reichswehr Werner von Blomberg who was simultaneously renamed the Reich Minister of War
Following the Blomberg-Fritsch Affair Blomberg resigned and Hitler abolished the Ministry of War
As a replacement for the ministry the Wehrmacht High Command Oberkommando der Wehrmacht OKW under Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel was put in its place
Placed under the OKW were the three branch High Commands Oberkommando des Heeres OKH Oberkommando der Marine OKM and Oberkommando der Luftwaffe OKL
The OKW was intended to serve as a joint command and coordinate all military activities with Hitler at the top
Though many senior officers such as von Manstein had advocated for a real tri-service Joint Command or appointment of a single Joint Chief of Staff Hitler refused
Even after the defeat at Stalingrad Hitler refused stating that Göring as Reichsmarschall and Hitler's deputy would not submit to someone else or see himself as an equal to other service commanders
However a more likely reason was Hitler feared it would break his image of having the Midas touch concerning military strategy
With the creation of the OKW Hitler solidified his control over the Wehrmacht
Showing restraint at the beginning of the war Hitler also became increasingly involved in military operations at every scale
Additionally there was a clear lack of cohesion between the three High Commands and the OKW as senior generals were unaware of the needs capabilities and limitations of the other branches
With Hitler serving as Supreme Commander branch commands were often forced to fight for influence with Hitler
However influence with Hitler not only came from rank and merit but also who Hitler perceived as loyal leading to inter-service rivalry rather than cohesion between his military advisers
The German Army furthered concepts pioneered during World War I combining ground Heer and air force Luftwaffe assets into combined arms teams
Coupled with traditional war fighting methods such as encirclements and the battle of annihilation the Wehrmacht managed many lightning quick victories in the first year of World War II prompting foreign journalists to create a new word for what they witnessed Blitzkrieg
Germany's immediate military success on the field at the start of the Second World War coincides the favorable beginning they achieved during the First World War a fact which some attribute to their superior officer corps
The Heer entered the war with a minority of its formations motorized infantry remained approximately foot-borne throughout the war and artillery was primarily horse-drawn
The motorized formations received much attention in the world press in the opening years of the war and were cited as the reason for the success of the invasions of Poland September Denmark and Norway April Belgium France and Netherlands May Yugoslavia and Greece April and the early stage of Operation Barbarossa in the Soviet Union June
After Hitler declared war on the United States in December the Axis powers found themselves engaged in campaigns against several major industrial powers while Germany was still in transition to a war economy
German units were then overextended undersupplied outmaneuvered outnumbered and defeated by its enemies in decisive battles during and at the Battle of Moscow the Siege of Leningrad Stalingrad Tunis in North Africa and the Battle of Kursk
The German Army was managed through mission-based tactics rather than order-based tactics which was intended to give commanders greater freedom to act on events and exploit opportunities
In public opinion the German Army was and sometimes still is seen as a high-tech army
However such modern equipment while featured much in propaganda was often only available in relatively small numbers
Only to of all units in the Eastern Front were motorized baggage trains often relied on horse-drawn trailers due to poor roads and weather conditions in the Soviet Union and for the same reasons many soldiers marched on foot or used bicycles as bicycle infantry
As the fortunes of war turned against them the Germans were in constant retreat from and onward
The Panzer divisions were vital to the German army's early success
In the strategies of the Blitzkrieg the Wehrmacht combined the mobility of light tanks with airborne assault to quickly progress through weak enemy lines enabling the German army to quickly and brutally take over Poland and France
These tanks were used to break through enemy lines isolating regiments from the main force so that the infantry behind the tanks could quickly kill or capture the enemy troops
Originally outlawed by the Treaty of Versailles the Luftwaffe was officially established in under the leadership of Hermann Göring
First gaining experience in the Spanish Civil War it was a key element in the early Blitzkrieg campaigns Poland France USSR
The Luftwaffe concentrated production on fighters and small tactical bombers like the Messerschmitt Bf fighter and the Junkers Ju Stuka dive bomber
The planes cooperated closely with the ground forces
Overwhelming numbers of fighters assured air-supremacy and the bombers would attack command- and supply-lines depots and other support targets close to the front
The Luftwaffe would also be used to transport paratroopers as first used during Operation Weserbung
Due to the Army's sway with Hitler the Luftwaffe was often subordinated to the Army resulting in it being used as a tactical support role and losing its strategic capabilities
The Western Allies' strategic bombing campaign against German industrial targets particularly the round the clock Combined Bomber Offensive and Defence of the Reich deliberately forced the Luftwaffe into a war of attrition
With German fighter force destroyed the Western Allies had air supremacy over the battlefield denying support to German forces on the ground and using its own fighter-bombers to attack and disrupt
Following the losses in Operation Bodenplatte in the Luftwaffe was no longer an effective force
The Treaty of Versailles disallowed submarines while limiting the size of the Reichsmarine to six battleships six cruisers and twelve destroyers
Following the creation of the Wehrmacht the navy was renamed the Kriegsmarine
With the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement Germany was allowed to increase its navy's size to be tonnage of the Royal Navy and allowed for the construction of U-boats
This was partly done to appease Germany and because Britain believed the Kriegsmarine would not be able to reach the limit until
The navy was also prioritized last in the German rearmament scheme making it the smallest of the branches
In the Battle of the Atlantic the initially successful German U-boat fleet arm was eventually defeated due to Allied technological innovations like sonar radar and the breaking of the Enigma code
Large surface vessels were few in number due to construction limitations by international treaties prior to
The pocket battleships Admiral Graf Spee and Admiral Scheer were important as commerce raiders only in the opening year of the war
No aircraft carrier was operational as German leadership lost interest in the Graf Zeppelin which had been launched in
Following the loss of the German battleship Bismarck in with Allied air-superiority threatening the remaining battle-cruisers in French Atlantic harbors the ships were ordered to make the Channel Dash back to German ports
Operating from fjords along the coast of Norway which had been occupied since convoys from North America to the Soviet port of Murmansk could be intercepted though the Tirpitz spent most of her career as fleet in being
After the appointment of Karl Dönitz as Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine in the aftermath of the Battle of the Barents Sea Germany stopped constructing battleships and cruisers in favor of U-boats
Though by the navy had already lost a number of its large surface ships which could not be replenished during the war
The Kriegsmarine's most significant contribution to the German war effort was the deployment of its nearly U-boats to strike at Allied convoys
The German naval strategy was to attack the convoys in an attempt to prevent the United States from interfering in Europe and to starve out the British
Karl Doenitz the U-Boat Chief began unrestricted submarine warfare which cost the Allies men and ships
The U-boat war remained costly for the Allies until early spring of when the Allies began to use countermeasures against U-Boats such as the use of Hunter-Killer groups airborne radar torpedoes and mines like the FIDO
The submarine war cost the Kriegsmarine U-boats with more than U-boat crewmen killed
In the beginning there was friction between the SS and the army as the army feared the SS would attempt to become a legitimate part of the armed forces of Nazi Germany partly due to the fighting between the limited armaments and the perceived fanaticism towards Nazism
However on August Hitler codified the role of the SS and the army in order to end the feud between the two
The arming of the SS was to be procured from the Wehrmacht upon payment however in peacetime no organizational connection with the Wehrmacht exists The army was however allowed to check the budget of the SS and inspect the combat readiness of the SS troops
In the event of mobilization the Waffen-SS field units could be placed under the operational control of the OKW or the OKH
All decisions regarding this would be at Hitler's personal discretion
Though there existed conflict between the SS and Wehrmacht many SS officers were former army officers which ensured continuity and understanding between the two
Throughout the war army and SS soldiers worked together in various combat situations creating bonds between the two groups
Guderian noted that every day the war continued the Army and the SS became closer together
Towards the end of the war army units would even be placed under the command of the SS in Italy and the Netherlands
The relationship between the Wehrmacht and the SS improved however the Waffen-SS was never considered the fourth branch of the Wehrmacht
The Wehrmacht directed combat operations during World War II from September May as the German Reich's armed forces umbrella command-organization
After the OKH became the de facto Eastern Theatre higher-echelon command-organization for the Wehrmacht excluding Waffen-SS except for operational and tactical combat purposes
The OKW conducted operations in the Western Theatre
The operations by the Kriegsmarine in the North and Mid-Atlantic can also be considered as separate theatres considering the size of the area of operations and their remoteness from other theatres
The Wehrmacht fought on other fronts sometimes three simultaneously redeploying troops from the intensifying theatre in the East to the West after the Normandy landings caused tensions between the General Staffs of both the OKW and the OKH as Germany lacked sufficient materiel and manpower for a two-front war of such magnitude
Major campaigns and battles in Eastern and Central Europe included
Operation Barbarossa conducted by Army Group North Army Group Centre and Army Group South
Nazi security warfare largely carried out by security divisions of the Wehrmacht by Order Police and by Waffen-SS units in the occupied territories behind Axis front-linesPhoney War Sitzkrieg September to May between the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France
Defense of the Reich air-campaign to For a time the Axis Mediterranean Theatre and the North African Campaign were conducted as a joint campaign with the Italian Army and may be considered a separate theatre
Invasion of the Balkans and Greece Operation Marita
The North African Campaign in Libya Tunisia and Egypt between the UK and Commonwealth and later US forces and the Axis forces
The Italian Theatre was a continuation of the Axis defeat in North Africa and was a campaign for defence of ItalyMore than soldiers were wounded during the conflict while more than became prisoners
In all approximately soldiers from Germany and other nationalities fighting for the German armed forces—including the Waffen-SS Volkssturm and foreign collaborationist units—are estimated to have been killed in action died of wounds died in custody or gone missing in World War II
Included in this number are Soviet citizens conscripted by Germany
In addition to the losses at the hands of the elements and enemy fighting at least soldiers were executed as sentences by the military court
In comparison the Red Army executed France the US and the UK
Nazi propaganda had told Wehrmacht soldiers to wipe out what were variously called Jewish Bolshevik subhumans the Mongol hordes the Asiatic flood and the red beast
While the principal perpetrators of the civil suppression behind the front lines amongst German armed forces were the Nazi German political armies the SS-Totenkopfverbnde the Waffen-SS and the Einsatzgruppen which were responsible for mass-murders primarily by implementation of the so-called Final Solution of the Jewish Question in occupied territories the traditional armed forces represented by the Wehrmacht committed and ordered war crimes of their own eg
the Commissar Order particularly during the invasion of Poland in and later in the war against the Soviet Union
Prior to the outbreak of war Hitler informed senior Wehrmacht officers that actions which would not be in the taste of German generals would take place in occupied areas and ordered them that they should not interfere in such matters but restrict themselves to their military duties
Some Wehrmacht officers initially showed a strong dislike for the SS and objected to the army committing war crimes with the SS though these objections were not against the idea of the atrocities themselves
Later during the war relations between the SS and Wehrmacht improved significantly
The common soldier had no qualms with the SS and often assisted them in rounding up civilians for executions
The Army's Chief of Staff General Franz Halder in a directive declared that in the event of guerrilla attacks German troops were to impose collective measures of force by massacring entire villages
Cooperation between the SS Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht involved supplying the death squads with weapons ammunition equipment transport and even housing
Partisan fighters Jews and Communists became synonymous enemies of the Nazi regime and were hunted down and exterminated by the Einsatzgruppen and Wehrmacht alike something revealed in numerous field journal entries from German soldiers
With the implementation of the Hunger Plan hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of Soviet civilians were deliberately starved to death as the Germans seized food for their armies and fodder for their draft horses
According to Thomas Khne an estimated people were killed during the Wehrmacht's Nazi security warfare in the Soviet Union
While secretly listening to conversations of captured German generals British officials became aware that the German Army had taken part in the atrocities and mass-murder of Jews and were guilty of war crimes
American officials learned of the Wehrmacht's atrocities in much the same way
Taped conversations of soldiers detained as POWs revealed how some of them voluntarily participated in mass executions
During the war the Wehrmacht committed numerous war crimes against the civilian population in occupied countries
This includes massacres of civilians and running forced brothels in occupied areas
Massacres would in many cases come as reprisals for acts of resistance
With these reprisals the Wehrmacht's response would vary in severity and method depending on the scale of resistance and whether it was in East or West Europe
Often the number of hostages to be shot was calculated based on a ratio of hostages executed for every German soldier killed and hostages executed for every German soldier wounded
Other times civilians would be rounded up and shot with machine guns
To combat German officials' fear of venereal disease and masturbation the Wehrmacht established numerous brothels throughout Nazi Germany and its occupied territories
Women would often be kidnapped off the streets and forced to work in the brothels with an estimated minimum of women being forced to serve as prostitutes
While the Wehrmacht's prisoner-of-war camps for inmates from the west generally satisfied the humanitarian requirement prescribed by international law prisoners from Poland and the USSR were incarcerated under significantly worse conditions
Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of and the following spring million of the million Soviet prisoners taken died while in German hands
Among German historians the view that the Wehrmacht had participated in wartime atrocities particularly on the Eastern Front grew in the late s and the s
In the s public conception in Germany was influenced by controversial reactions and debates about the exhibition of war crime issues
The Israeli historian Omer Bartov a leading expert on the Wehrmacht wrote in that the Wehrmacht was a willing instrument of genocide and that it is untrue that the Wehrmacht was an apolitical professional fighting force that had only a few bad apples
Bartov argues that far from being the untarnished shield as successive German apologists stated after the war the Wehrmacht was a criminal organization
Evans a leading expert on modern German history wrote that the Wehrmacht was a genocidal organization
Shepherd writes that There is now clear agreement amongst historians that the German Wehrmacht
identified strongly with National Socialism and embroiled itself in the criminality of the Third Reich British historian Ian Kershaw concludes that the Wehrmacht's duty was to ensure that the people who met Hitler's requirements of being part of the Aryan Herrenvolk Aryan master race had living space
Several high-ranking Wehrmacht officers including Hermann Hoth Georg von Kchler Georg-Hans Reinhardt Karl von Roques Walter Warlimont and others were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the High Command Trial given sentences ranging from time served to life
Originally there was little resistance within the Wehrmacht as Hitler actively went against the Treaty of Versailles and attempted to recover the army's honor
The first major resistance began in with the Oster conspiracy where several members of the military wanted to remove Hitler from power as they feared a war with Czechoslovakia would ruin Germany
However following the success of the early campaigns in Poland Scandinavia and France belief in Hitler was restored
With the defeat in Stalingrad trust in Hitler's leadership began to wane
This caused an increase in resistance within the military
The resistance culminated in the July plot when a group of officers led by Claus von Stauffenberg attempted to assassinate Hitler
The attempt failed resulting in the execution of people and the standard military salute being replaced with the Hitler salute
Some members of the Wehrmacht did save Jews and non-Jews from the concentration camps andor mass murder
Anton Schmid a sergeant in the army helped between and Jewish men women and children escape from the Vilna Ghetto in Lithuania
He was court-martialed and executed as a consequence
Albert Battel a reserve officer stationed near the Przemysl ghetto blocked an SS detachment from entering it
He then evacuated up to Jews and their families to the barracks of the local military command and placed them under his protection
Wilm Hosenfeld an army captain in Warsaw helped hid or rescued several Poles including Jews in occupied Poland
He helped the Polish-Jewish composer Władysław Szpilman who was hiding among the city's ruins by supplying him with food and water
According to Wolfram Wette only three Wehrmacht soldiers are known for being executed for rescuing Jews Anton Schmid Friedrich Rath and Friedrich Winking
Following the unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht which went into effect on May some Wehrmacht units remained active either independently eg
in Norway or under Allied command as police forces
The last Wehrmacht unit to come under Allied control was an isolated weather station in Svalbard which formally surrendered to a Norwegian relief ship on September
of the Allied Control Council ACC all German land naval and air forces the SS SA SD
and Gestapo with all their organizations staffs and institution including the General Staff the Officers' corps the Reserve Corps military schools war veterans' organizations and all other military and quasi-military organizations together with all clubs and associations which serve to keep alive the military tradition in Germany shall be completely and finally abolished in accordance with the methods and procedures to be laid down by the Allied Representatives The Wehrmacht was officially dissolved by the ACC Law on August which proclaimed the OKW OKH the Ministry of Aviation and the OKM to be disbanded completely liquidated and declared illegal
Immediately following the end of the war many were quick to dismiss the Wehrmacht due to its failures and claim allied superiority
However historians have since reevaluated the Wehrmacht in terms of fighting power and tactics giving it a more favorable assessment with some calling it one of the best in the world partly due to its ability to regularly inflict higher losses than it received while it fought outnumbered and outgunned
Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld who attempted to examine the military force of the Wehrmacht in a purely military context concluded The German army was a superb fighting organization
In point of morale elan troop cohesion and resilience it probably had no equal among twentieth century armies German historian Rolf-Dieter Mller comes to the following conclusion In the purely military sense you can indeed say that the impression of a superior fighting force rightly exists
The proverbial efficiency was even greater than previously thought because the superiority of the opponent was much higher than at that time German officers suspected
The analysis of Russian archive files finally gives us a clear picture in this regard Strategic thinker and professor Colin S
Gray believed that the Wehrmacht possessed outstanding tactical and operational capabilities
However following a number of successful campaigns German policy began to have victory disease asking the Wehrmacht to do the impossible
The continued use of the Blitzkrieg also led to Soviets learning the tactic and using it against the Wehrmacht
Soon after the war ended former Wehrmacht officers veterans' groups and various far-right authors began to state that the Wehrmacht was an apolitical organization which was largely innocent of Nazi Germany's war crimes and crimes against humanity
Attempting to benefit from the clean Wehrmacht myth veterans of the Waffen-SS declared that the organisation had virtually been a branch of the Wehrmacht and therefore had fought as honourably as it
Its veterans organisation HIAG attempted to cultivate a myth of their soldiers having been Soldiers like any other
Following the division of Germany many former Wehrmacht and SS officers in West Germany feared a Soviet invasion of the country
To combat this several prominent officers created a secret army unknown to the general public and without mandate from the Allied Control Authority or the West German government
By the mid-s tensions of the Cold War led to the creation of separate military forces in the Federal Republic of Germany and the socialist German Democratic Republic
The West German military officially created on May took the name Bundeswehr lit 'Federal Defence'
Its East German counterpart—created on March —took the name National People's Army German Nationale Volksarmee
Both organizations employed many former Wehrmacht members particularly in their formative years though neither organization considered themselves successors to the Wehrmacht
However according to historian Hannes Heer Germans still have a hard time when it comes to openly dealing with their Nazi past as such of the military bases named after Wehrmacht soldiers only bases have changed names
Wehrmacht veterans in West Germany have received pensions through the War Victims' Assistance Act German Bundesversorgungsgesetz from the government
According to The Times of Israel The benefits come through the Federal Pension Act which was passed in to support war victims whether civilians or veterans of the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS
