chamunda sanskrit iso c mu also known as chamundeshwari chamundi or charchika is a fearsome form of chandi the hindu divine mother durga or shakthi and is one of the seven matrikas mother goddesses
she is also one of the chief yoginis a group of sixty four or eighty one tantric goddesses who are attendants of the warrior goddess parvati
the name is a combination of chanda and munda two monsters whom chamunda killed
she is closely associated with kali another fierce aspect of parvati
she is identified with goddesses parvati kali or durga
the goddess is often portrayed as residing in cremation grounds or around holy fig trees
the goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine
the practice of animal sacrifices has become less common with shaivite and vaishnavite influences
ramakrishna gopal bhandarkar says that chamunda was originally a tribal goddess worshipped by the tribals of the vindhya mountains in central india
these tribes were known to offer goddesses animal as well as human sacrifices along with rituals offering liquor
these methods of worship were retained in tantric worship of chamunda after assimilation into hinduism
he proposes the fierce nature of this goddess is due to her association with rudra shiva identified with fire god agni at times
wangu also backs the theory of the tribal origins of the goddess
the black or red coloured chamunda is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls mundamala
she is described as having four eight ten or twelve arms holding a damaru drum trishula trident sword a snake skull mace khatvanga thunderbolt a severed head and panapatra drinking vessel wine cup or skull cup kapala filled with blood
standing on a corpse of a man shava or preta or seated on a defeated demon or corpse pretasana
chamunda is depicted adorned by ornaments of bones skulls and serpents
she also wears a yajnopavita a sacred thread worn by mostly hindu priests of skulls
she wears a jata mukuta that is headdress formed of piled matted hair tied with snakes or skull ornaments
sometimes a crescent moon is seen on her head
her eye sockets are described as burning the world with flames
she is accompanied by evil spirits
she is also shown to be surrounded by skeletons or ghosts and beasts like jackals who are shown eating the flesh of the corpse which the goddess sits or stands on
the jackals and her fearsome companions are sometimes depicted as drinking blood from the skull cup or blood dripping from the severed head implying that chamunda drinks the blood of the defeated enemies
this quality of drinking blood is a usual characteristic of all matrikas and chamunda in particular
at times she is depicted seated on an owl her vahana mount or vehicle
her banner figures an eagle
these characteristics a contrast to usual hindu goddess depiction with full breasts and a beautiful face are symbols of old age death decay and destruction
chamunda is often said as a form of kali representing old age and death
she appears as a frightening old woman projecting fear and horror
in hindu scripture devi mahatmya chamunda emerged as chandika jayasundara from an eyebrow of goddess kaushiki a goddess created from sheath of durga and was assigned the task of eliminating the demons chanda and munda generals of demon kings shumbha nishumbha
she fought a fierce battle with the demons ultimately killing them
according to a later episode of the devi mahatmya durga created matrikas from herself and with their help slaughtered the demon army of shumbha nisumha
in this version kali is described as a matrika who sucked all the blood of the demon raktab ja from whose blood drop rose another demon
kali is given the epithet chamunda in the text
thus the devi mahatmya identifies chamunda with kali
in the varaha purana the story of raktabija is retold but here each of matrikas appears from the body of another matrika
chamunda appears from the foot of the lion headed goddess narasimhi
here chamunda is considered a representation of the vice of tale telling pasunya
the varaha purana text clearly mentions two separate goddesses chamunda and kali unlike devi mahatmya
according to another legend chamunda appeared from the frown of the benign goddess parvati to kill demons chanda and munda
here chamunda is viewed as a form of parvati
the matsya purana tells a different story of chamunda s origins
she with other matrikas was created by shiva to help him kill the demon andhakasura who has an ability like raktab ja to generate from his dripping blood
chamunda with the other matrikas drinks the blood of the demon ultimately helping shiva kill him
ratnakara in his text haravijaya also describes this feat of chamunda but solely credits chamunda not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of andhaka
having drunk the blood chamunda s complexion changed to blood red
the text further says that chamunda does a dance of destruction playing a musical instrument whose shaft is mount meru the string is the cosmic snake shesha and gourd is the crescent moon
she plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world
chamunda is one of the saptamatrikas or seven mothers
the matrikas are fearsome mother goddesses abductors and eaters of children that is they were emblematic of childhood pestilence fever starvation and disease
they were propitiated in order to avoid those ills that carried off so many children before they reached adulthood
chamunda is included in the saptamatrika seven matrikas or mothers lists in the hindu texts like the mahabharata chapter vana parva the devi purana and the vishnudharmottara purana
she is often depicted in the saptamatrika group in sculptures examples of which are ellora and elephanta caves
though she is always portrayed last rightmost in the group she is sometimes referred to as the leader of the group
while other matrikas are considered as shaktis powers of male divinities and resemble them in their appearance chamunda is the only matrika who is a shakti of the great goddess devi rather than a male god
she is also the only matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own all other matrikas are always worshipped together
the devi purana describe a pentad of matrikas who help ganesha to kill demons
further sage mandavya is described as worshipping the m rpa caka the five mothers chamunda being one of them
the mothers are described as established by the creator god brahma for saving king harishchandra from calamities
apart from usual meaning of chamunda as slayer of demons chanda and munda the devi purana gives a different explanation chanda means terrible while munda stands for brahma s head or lord or husband
in the vishnudharmottara purana where the matrikas are compared to vices chamunda is considered as a manifestation of depravity
every matrika is considered guardian of a direction
chamunda is assigned the direction of south west
chamunda being a matrika is considered one of the chief yoginis who are considered to be daughters or manifestations of the matrikas
in the context of a group of sixty four yoginis chamunda is believed to have created seven other yoginis together forming a group of eight
in the context of eighty one yoginis chamunda heads a group of nine yoginis
