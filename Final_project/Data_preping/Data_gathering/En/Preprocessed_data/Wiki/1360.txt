Chamunda (Sanskrit: चामुण्डा, ISO-15919: Cāmuṇḍā), also known as Chamundeshwari, Chamundi or Charchika, is a fearsome form of Chandi, the Hindu Divine Mother Durga or Shakthi and is one of the seven Matrikas (mother goddesses).
She is also one of the chief Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses, who are attendants of the warrior goddess Parvati
The name is a combination of Chanda and Munda, two monsters whom Chamunda killed
She is closely associated with Kali, another fierce aspect of Parvati
She is identified with goddesses Parvati, Kali or Durga.
The goddess is often portrayed as residing in cremation grounds or around holy fig trees
The goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine
The practice of animal sacrifices has become less common with Shaivite and Vaishnavite influences.
Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar says that Chamunda was originally a tribal goddess, worshipped by the tribals of the Vindhya mountains in central India
These tribes were known to offer goddesses animal as well as human sacrifices along with rituals offering liquor
These methods of worship were retained in Tantric worship of Chamunda, after assimilation into Hinduism
He proposes the fierce nature of this goddess is due to her association with Rudra (Shiva), identified with fire god Agni at times
Wangu also backs the theory of the tribal origins of the goddess.
The black or red coloured Chamunda is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls (Mundamala)
She is described as having four, eight, ten or twelve arms, holding a Damaru (drum), trishula (trident), sword, a snake, skull-mace (khatvanga), thunderbolt, a severed head and panapatra (drinking vessel, wine cup) or skull-cup (kapala), filled with blood
Standing on a corpse of a man (shava or preta) or seated on a defeated demon or corpse (pretasana)
Chamunda is depicted adorned by ornaments of bones, skulls, and serpents
 She also wears a Yajnopavita (a sacred thread worn by mostly Hindu priests) of skulls
She wears a jata mukuta, that is, headdress formed of piled, matted hair tied with snakes or skull ornaments
Sometimes, a crescent moon is seen on her head
Her eye sockets  are described as burning the world with flames
She is accompanied by evil spirits
She is also shown to be surrounded by skeletons or ghosts and beasts like jackals, who are shown eating the flesh of the corpse which the goddess sits or stands on
The jackals and her fearsome companions are sometimes depicted as drinking blood from the skull-cup or blood dripping from the severed head, implying that Chamunda drinks the blood of the defeated enemies
This quality of drinking blood is a usual characteristic of all Matrikas, and Chamunda in particular
At times, she is depicted seated on an owl, her vahana (mount or vehicle)
Her banner figures an eagle.
These characteristics, a contrast to usual Hindu goddess depiction with full breasts and a beautiful face, are symbols of old age, death, decay and destruction
Chamunda is often said as a form of Kali, representing old age and death
She appears as a frightening old woman,  projecting fear and horror.
In Hindu scripture Devi Mahatmya, Chamunda emerged as Chandika Jayasundara from an eyebrow of goddess Kaushiki, a goddess created from "sheath" of Durga and was assigned the task of eliminating the demons Chanda and Munda, generals of demon kings Shumbha-Nishumbha
She fought a fierce battle with the demons, ultimately killing them.
According to a later episode of the Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughtered the demon army of Shumbha-Nisumha
In this version, Kali is described as a Matrika who sucked all the blood of the demon Raktabīja, from whose blood drop rose another demon
Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text
Thus, the Devi Mahatmya identifies Chamunda with Kali.
In the Varaha Purana, the story of Raktabija is retold, but here each of Matrikas appears from the body of another Matrika
Chamunda appears from the foot of the lion-headed goddess Narasimhi
Here, Chamunda is considered a representation of the vice of tale-telling (pasunya)
The Varaha Purana text clearly mentions two separate goddesses Chamunda and Kali, unlike Devi Mahatmya.
According to another legend, Chamunda appeared from the frown of the benign goddess Parvati to kill demons Chanda and Munda
Here, Chamunda is viewed as a form of Parvati.
The Matsya Purana tells a different story of Chamunda's origins
She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabīja - to generate from his dripping blood
Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks the blood of the demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him
Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka
Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red
The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the string is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon
She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.
Chamunda is one of the saptamatrikas or Seven Mothers
The Matrikas are fearsome mother goddesses, abductors and eaters of children; that is, they were emblematic of childhood pestilence, fever, starvation, and disease
They were propitiated in order to avoid those ills, that carried off so many children before they reached adulthood.
Chamunda is included in the Saptamatrika (seven Matrikas or mothers) lists in the Hindu texts like the Mahabharata (Chapter 'Vana-parva'), the Devi Purana and the Vishnudharmottara Purana
She is often depicted in the Saptamatrika group in sculptures, examples of which are Ellora and Elephanta caves
Though she is always portrayed last (rightmost) in the group, she is sometimes referred to as the leader of the group
While other Matrikas are considered as Shaktis (powers) of male divinities and resemble them in their appearance, Chamunda is the only Matrika who is a Shakti of the great Goddess Devi rather than a male god
She is also the only Matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own; all other Matrikas are always worshipped together.
The Devi Purana describe a pentad of Matrikas who help Ganesha to kill demons
Further, sage Mandavya is described as worshipping the Māṭrpaňcaka (the five mothers), Chamunda being one of them
The mothers are described as established by  the creator god Brahma for saving king Harishchandra from calamities
Apart from usual meaning of Chamunda as slayer of demons Chanda and Munda, the Devi Purana gives a different explanation: Chanda means terrible while Munda stands for Brahma's head or lord or husband.
In the Vishnudharmottara Purana - where the Matrikas are compared to vices - Chamunda is considered as a manifestation of depravity
Every matrika is considered guardian of a direction
Chamunda is assigned the direction of south-west.
Chamunda, being a Matrika, is considered one of the chief Yoginis, who are considered to be daughters or manifestations of the Matrikas
In the context of a group of sixty-four yoginis, Chamunda is believed to have created seven other yoginis, together forming a group of eight
In the context of eighty-one yoginis, Chamunda heads a group of nine yoginis.
A South Indian inscription describes ritual sacrifices of sheep to Chamunda
In Bhavabhuti's eighth century Sanskrit play, Malatimadhva describes a devotee of the goddess trying to sacrifice the heroine to Chamunda's temple, near a cremation ground, where the goddess temple is
A stone inscription at Gangadhar, Rajasthan, deals with a construction to a shrine to Chamunda and the other Matrikas, "who are attended by Dakinis" (female demons) and rituals of daily Tantric worship (Tantrobhuta) like the ritual of Bali (offering of grain).
The Chapa dynasty worshiped her as their kuladevi
The Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas worship her as kuladevi and temples are in Sinugra and Chandiya
Alungal family, a lineage of Mukkuva caste — (Hindu caste of seafarer origin) in Kerala — worship chamundi in Chandika form, as Kuladevta and temple is in Thalikulam village of Thrissur, Kerala
This is an example of Chamunda worship across caste sects.
In the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of Palampur, is the renowned Chamunda Devi Temple which depicts scenes from the Devi Mahatmya, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata
The goddess's image is flanked by the images of Hanuman and Bhairava
Another temple, Chamunda Nandikeshwar Dham, also found in Kangra, is dedicated to Shiva and Chamunda
According to a legend, Chamunda was enshrined as chief deity "Rudra Chamunda", in the battle between the demon Jalandhara and Shiva.
In Gujarat, two Chamunda shrines are on the hills of Chotila and Parnera.
There are multiple Chamunda temples in Odisha
The 8th-century Baitala Deula is the most prominent of them, also being one of the earliest temples in Bhubaneswar
The Mohini temple and Chitrakarini temple in Bhubaneswar are also dedicated to Chamunda
Kichakeshwari Temple, near the Baripada and Charchika Temple, near Banki enshrine forms of Chamunda.
Another temple is Chamundeshwari Temple on Chamundi Hill, Mysore
Here, the goddess is identified with Durga, who killed the buffalo demon
Chamundeshwari or Durga, the fierce form of Shakti, a tutelary deity held in reverence for centuries by the Maharaja of Mysore.
The Chamunda Mataji temple in Mehrangarh Fort, Jodhpur, was established in 1460 after the idol of the goddess Chamunda — the Kuladevi and iṣṭa-devatā (tutelary deity) of the Parihar rulers — was moved from the old capital of Mandore by the then-ruler Jodha of Mandore
The goddess is still worshiped by the royal family of Jodhpur and other citizens of the city
The temple witnesses festivities in Dussehra: the festival of the goddess.
Another temple, Sri Chamundeshwari Kshetram is near Jogipet, in Medak District in Telangana State.
Sree Shakthan Kulangara temple is one of chamundeshwari temples.It is located in Koyilandy,Kozhikode District in Kerala.
One Chamunda mata temple is situated in Dewas, Madhya pradesh, It is situated on a hill top named Tekri above 300 feet
Chamunda mata in dewas also called choti mata (younger sister of Tulja mata, situated at the same hill top).Early Jains were dismissive of Chamunda, the goddess who demands blood sacrifice - which is against the primary principle of Ahimsa of Jainism
Some Jain legends portray Chamunda as a goddess defeated by Jain monks like Jinadatta and Jinaprabhasuri.
Another Jain legend tells the story of conversion of Chamunda into a Jain goddess
According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavir image for the temple in Osian and was happy with the conversions of Hindu Oswal clan to Jainism
At the time of Navaratri, a festival that celebrates the Hindu Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains
The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand
Jain monk Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor
Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian was beneficial for him
She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess of the Osvals
The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour by Jains
Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals
Many Kshatriyas and even the Jain community worship her as her Kuladevi "family deity".
