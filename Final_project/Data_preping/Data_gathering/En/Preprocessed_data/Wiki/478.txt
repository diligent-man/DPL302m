anthony s college kandy since
it is considered to be one of the oldest annual school cricket encounters in sri lanka
this encounter is being played for the john halangoda memorial trophy and is awarded to the team who manages to win the match by means of an outright win or failing that a first innings win
but a first innings win will not go into the records as a win to the relevant team
out of the games played the trinitians have won with ending in favour of the antonians
the last outright win for the antonians was in and trinity won last under niroshan dickwella in after the win under thushara weerasuriya
the victory came after years
anthony s college kandy are the current holders of the trophy after their st innings win in as they managed to restrict trinity college to after posting for the loss of wickets
the winner of the limited overs encounter usually played a week after the day match will be awarded the sir richard aluwihare trophy
the first encounter was played at the bogambara grounds in march the antonians won
trinity won the next match and a long contested series has followed
to during the world war i st
anthony s college premises including the practice pitches and the playing fields were occupied by the british army
as a result antonian cricket deprived and they had lost to trinity for times consecutively
without a playground of their own the antonians were no match for the trinitians even with the like of legendary jack anderson in the team
the post war period was inauspicious for the antonians as they had a poor run in the field
trinity during that time had c
dharmalingam a left arm bowler who for two consecutive years nagged the antonians with his left arm spin
in he took for and in had the figures of for and for inclusive of a double hat trick a world record
then there was t
werapitiya with scores of in and in the highest score made by a trinitian
meanwhile the antonians came back fighting in and nearly tumbled the trinitians asgiriya after getting back their premises with facilities restored and having the services of a renowned cricket coach in mr
john halangoda
the strong trinity batting line up crumbled under the spin bowling of dicky dunuwille the antonian mystery bowler who was later responsible in changing the fortunes of antonian cricket
antonians however lost the match by runs due to a spectacular fielding performance where seven close in catches were grabbed by trinity s clarence senanayake to dismiss the antonians
the antonians won the very next encounter at katugastota oval where dicky dunuwilla taking for once again mesmerized the trinitians and the antonians since then have not looked back
during the post independence period trinity has registered only four wins against the antonian tally of eight wins
most antonian victories in the series have been registered during the period
a disagreement between the two schools regarding the age rule resulted in the cancellation of the match in and
also in the match did not play as the trinity stopped playing mid way during that season due to disciplinary reasons
