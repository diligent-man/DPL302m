Senge Dongma or Siṃhavaktra also known as the Lion Face Dakini or Lion-headed Dakini is a wisdom dakini of the Dzogchen tradition
She is represented as a fierce dakini with the head of a snow lion
Her mouth is depicted with a roar symbolizing untamed fury and jubilant laughter
She is naked symbolizing that she herself is completely free of discursive thought
She is considered to be an emanation or manifestation of Guhyajnana Dakini the principal Dakini teacher of Padmasambhava in Uddiyana or of Mandarava one of his consorts or of Sangwa Yeshe
As a meditation deity her main function is averting magical attacks
According to both John Reynolds and John Lash she is the Indian equivalent of the Egyptian goddess Sekmet
According to the curators of the Himalayan Art Resources the wisdom Dakini Simhamukha is visualized
There are at least two major lineages of transmission one in the Nyingma and another in the Sakya school
Although according to the tertön Nyangral Nyima Özer the Nyingma Simhamukha is based on the Sakya tradition of Bari Lotsawa
According to the terma in Tibetan gong ter 'a treasure of the mind' tradition of the Nyingma school Senge Dongma is a manifestation of Padmasambhava a secret spiritual form of Guru Rinpoche specifically for removing spiritual obstacles and negativity
Accomplished practitioners often visualize Padmasambhava as Simhamukha during their meditative practices
The Sakya lineage began with a terma discovered by Bari Lotsawa who transmitted the teachings to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo
Tertön Sogyal is credited with discovering and transcribing a terma he found in a remote hermitage
