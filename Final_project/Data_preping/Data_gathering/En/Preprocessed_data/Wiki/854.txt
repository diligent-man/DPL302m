In Tibetan Buddhism, Siṃhamukhā (Tib
Senge Dongma) or Siṃhavaktra, also known as the Lion Face Dakini or Lion-headed Dakini, is a wisdom dakini of the Dzogchen tradition
She is represented as a fierce dakini with the head of a snow lion
Her mouth is depicted with a roar, symbolizing untamed fury and jubilant laughter
Her roar  disperses discursive thoughts
She is naked, symbolizing that she herself is completely free of discursive thought.
She is considered to be an emanation or manifestation of Guhyajnana Dakini (the principal Dakini teacher of Padmasambhava in Uddiyana), or of Mandarava (one of his consorts), or of Sangwa Yeshe
She represents the accomplished female practitioner
As a meditation deity, her main function is averting magical attacks.
According to both John Reynolds and John Lash, she is the Indian equivalent of the Egyptian goddess Sekmet.
According to the curators of the Himalayan Art Resources, the wisdom Dakini Simhamukha is visualized
According to John Reynolds, Simhamukha
There are at least two major lineages of transmission, one in the Nyingma and another in the Sakya school
Although according to the tertön Nyangral Nyima Özer, the Nyingma Simhamukha is based on the Sakya tradition of Bari Lotsawa.
According to the terma (in Tibetan: gong ter, 'a treasure of the mind') tradition of the Nyingma school, Senge Dongma is a manifestation of Padmasambhava, a secret spiritual form of Guru Rinpoche specifically for removing spiritual obstacles and negativity
Accomplished practitioners often visualize Padmasambhava as Simhamukha during their meditative practices
According to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo,
The Sakya lineage began with a terma discovered by Bari Lotsawa (1040–1111), who transmitted the teachings to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo
According to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo,
Tertön Sogyal is credited with discovering and transcribing a terma he found in a remote hermitage.
