co invention of item response theory an integrated framework for asking and answering a variety of practical problems related to the design and analysis of tests
creation of an approach and software for structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis LISREL used throughout the social sciences to test theoretical relationships among variables
seminal contributions to modern validity theory including the idea that validity was a unitary concept and that the evaluation of score meaning requires consideration of the consequences of test use as those consequences may imply functional problems with the test
development of widely used approaches to data analysis when there are missing data
generation of approaches to causal modeling from observational data
invention of the In Basket Test used throughout the world to assess applicants for managerial jobs in a wide variety of industries
development of methods for detecting test unfairness including invention of the Standardization approach to Differential Item Functioning DIF and application of the Mantel Haenszel method

In England and Wales ETS Europe a unit of the ETS Global for profit subsidiary was contracted to mark and process the National Curriculum assessments on behalf of the government ETS Global took over this role in from Edexcel a subsidiary of Pearson which had encountered significant and repeated problems in carrying out the marking and processing contract As was the case for Edexcel The first year of ETS Global's operation was struck by a number of problems including the late arrival of scripts to examiners a database of student entries being unavailable and countrywide reports of problems with the marking of the papers The opposition Conservative Party Tory criticized the awarding of the contracts to ETS and produced a dossier listing previous problems with ETS's service The ETS contract with the QCA was terminated in August with an agreement to pay back m and cancel invoices worth m Subsequently the contract for National Curriculum assessment marking and processing was again awarded to Edexcel Like the two prior contracts the Edexcel contract has encountered significant quality problems and the tests themselves the focus of longstanding controversy in the English education community and among the public have been subjected to a massive boycott by schools
In ETS released the My Credentials Vault Service with Interfolio Inc to simplify the entire letter of recommendation process
ETS has been criticized for being a highly competitive business operation that is as much multinational monopoly as nonprofit institution
Due to its legal status as a non profit organization ETS is exempt from paying federal corporate income tax on many but not all of its operations Furthermore it does not need to report financial information to the Securities and Exchange Commission though it does annually report detailed financial information to the IRS on Form which is publicly available
In response to growing criticism of its monopolistic power New York state passed the Educational Testing Act a disclosure law which required ETS to make available certain test questions and graded answer sheets to students
Problems administering England's national tests in by ETS Europe were the subject of thousands of complaints recorded by the Times Educational Supplement Their operations were also described as a shambles in the UK Parliament where a financial penalty was called for Complaints included papers not being marked properly or not being marked at all and papers being sent to the wrong schools or lost completely It has even been suggested that the quality of service is so poor that the Department for Children Schools and Families formerly the Department for Education and Skills might not be able to publish the league tables of school performance However the contract was ended by mutual consent The UK government asked Lord Sutherland to conduct an inquiry into the failure of the tests The report included in its main findings
primary responsibility for this summer s delivery failure rests with ETS Global BV which won the public contract to deliver the tests
ETS s capacity to deliver the contract proved to be insufficient A lack of comprehensive planning and testing by ETS of its systems and processes was a key factor in the delivery failure
In students of James A Garfield High School in East Los Angeles California achieved unexpectedly high exam results on the ETS Advanced Placement Exam ETS implied that the students may have cheated to obtain such results based on common mistakes across different exams The students were required to prove their abilities and innocence by taking a second exam which they did successfully
Americans for Educational Testing Reform AETR claims that ETS is violating its non profit status through excessive profits executive compensation and governing board member pay which the IRS specifically advises against AETR further claims that ETS is acting unethically by selling test preparation materials directly lobbying legislators and government officials and refusing to acknowledge test taker rights It also criticises ETS for forcing GRE test takers to participate in research experiments during the actual exam
In the BBC reported that the Home Office has suspended English language tests run by ETS after a BBC investigation uncovered systematic fraud in the student visa system Secret filming of government approved English exams needed for a visa showed entire rooms of candidates having the tests faked for them
