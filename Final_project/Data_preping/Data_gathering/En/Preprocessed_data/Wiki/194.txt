The Glorious Revolution in Scotland was part of a wider series of events between in England and Scotland known as the Glorious Revolution It covers the deposition of James VII his replacement by his daughter Mary II and her husband William III of Orange and the political settlement thereafter Scotland and England were linked but separate countries each with its own Parliament decisions in one did not bind the other
Issues included religious freedom but also arbitrary rule and the divine right of kings the Revolution ended a century of political dispute by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown
James became King in February with widespread support in both countries but tolerance for his personal beliefs did not apply to Roman Catholicism in general James suspended the English and Scottish Parliaments when they refused to pass his measures and ruled by decree it was this response that most damaged him
The birth of James Francis Edward Stuart in June replaced Mary with a Roman Catholic heir and caused widespread civil disorder in Scotland and England A coalition of English politicians issued a declaration known as the Invitation to William agreeing to support Dutch military intervention to enforce Mary's rights as heir to the English throne On November William landed in South West England and James fled to France on December
Despite playing little role in the Invitation there were many Scots in William's invasion force including the Scots Brigade under Hugh Mackay Scottish politicians were closely involved on both sides many of William's advisors were Scots exiles like Leven and Melville while James' closest counsellors were Scots Catholic converts the Earl of Perth and his brother Melfort On January the Scottish Privy Council asked William to take over pending election of a Convention to agree a settlement In February William and Mary were appointed joint monarchs of England in March the Convention met to agree a Settlement for Scotland
While the Revolution itself was quick and relatively bloodless pro Stuart revolts in Scotland starting with the Jacobite rising of caused significant casualties Although Jacobitism persisted into the late th century the Revolution ended a century of political dispute by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown
In one of the Revolution's amendments the Claim of Right Act was referenced in legal arguments as to whether Scotland was bound by Brexit
The Glorious Revolution in Scotland has been poorly understood because no full scale treatment exists comparable to those we possess for England and we have no scholarly analysis of the Scottish constitutional settlement of as encapsulated in the Claim of Right and the Articles of Grievances on a par with the English Declaration of Rights
The different paths of the Glorious Revolution in Scotland and England stemmed from political and religious differences between the two kingdoms which experienced the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Restoration differently Close links between religion and political ideology meant disputes caused huge dislocation and damage casualties in the Civil Wars were proportionally higher in percentage terms than those later experienced by the United Kingdom in the First World War
Presbyterian versus Episcopalian now implies differences in both structure and doctrine but this was not the case in the th century Episcopalian meant governance by bishops appointed by the monarch while Presbyterian structures were ruled by Elders nominated by congregations in Scotland both sides were doctrinal Calvinists Since bishops sat in the Scottish Parliament arguments over their role were as much about politics as religious practice Changes of regime in and led to the victors excluding their opponents making the contest for control of the kirk increasingly bitter
As Charles II had no legitimate children his brother James was heir to the Scottish and English thrones In he secretly converted to Catholicism when this became public knowledge in the Parliament of England attempted to exclude him from the English throne
Support for James was far greater in Scotland the Scottish Succession Act confirmed his status as the legal heir 'regardless of religion ' The Act also stated its aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without ' the dreadfull consequences of a civil war ' This was reaffirmed in the Scottish Test Act with the crucial qualifier all government officials and MPs 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion ' Tolerance for James' personal beliefs did not extend to Catholicism in general and his failure to appreciate that distinction ultimately led to his deposition
In James' position in Scotland was more secure than it was in England The Scottish Succession and Test Acts made obedience to the monarch a legal obligation 'regardless of religion' but in return confirmed the primacy of the Church of Scotland or Kirk Argyll's Rising collapsed due to lack of popular support repealing the Test Act undermined James' Episcopalian base while rewarding the dissident Presbyterians who backed Argyll
The perception that James was willing to ignore his commitments his Coronation Oath and his own supporters undermined his policies They were also badly timed since the October Edict of Fontainebleau revoked tolerance for French Protestants causing an estimated to Protestants to flee France in the next five years The killing of over Swiss Waldensians in reinforced fears that Protestant Europe was threatened by a French led Catholic counter reformation
In June two events turned dissent into a crisis the birth of James Francis Edward on June created a Catholic heir who would precede James' Protestant daughter Mary married to William of Orange in the succession Though James argued that he merely wanted to increase freedom for Catholics his prosecution of the Seven Bishops seemed to go beyond this and was perceived as an assault on the Episcopalian establishment their acquittal on June destroyed James' political authority
In many feared civil war if James were bypassed by anti Catholic riots made it seem only his removal could prevent one James's chief advisor the Earl of Sunderland secretly co ordinated with Henry Sydney to prepare the Invitation to William assuring him of support from across the English political class for armed intervention Anxious to secure English financial and military support against France William landed in Brixham on November with men as he advanced much of the Royal Army deserted and James went into exile on December
Parliament offered the English throne to William and Mary in February a large majority agreed that Mary should replace her father but William's demand he be made joint monarch and sole ruler if she died was only narrowly approved In Scotland the split within the Kirk made William more important his Calvinism meant that Presbyterians saw him as a natural ally while the Episcopalian minority needed his support to retain control
On January the Scottish Privy Council asked William to take over government pending a Scottish Convention that would agree a settlement of the delegates elected in March were classed as Presbyterian with a tiny minority loyal to James this made the Convention a contest between Episcopalians and Presbyterians over control of the kirk and the limits of Royal authority
On March James landed in Ireland and on th a Letter to the Convention was read out demanding obedience and threatening punishment for non compliance Public anger meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides Tensions were high with the Duke of Gordon holding Edinburgh Castle for James and Viscount Dundee recruiting Highland levies This exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops
The English Parliament held James had 'abandoned' his throne in Scotland the Convention argued he 'forfeited' it by his actions listed in the Articles of Grievances This was a fundamental change if Parliament could decide James had forfeited his throne monarchs derived legitimacy from Parliament not God ending the principle of divine right of kings
In an attempt to preserve Episcopalianism the Scottish Bishops proposed Union with England but this was rejected by the English Parliament On April the Convention ended James' reign and adopted the Articles of Grievances and the Claim of Right Act that made Parliament the primary legislative power in Scotland
On May William and Mary accepted the Scottish throne and the Convention became a full Parliament on June Dundee's rising highlighted William's reliance on Presbyterian support and he ended attempts to retain the Bishops leading to the Act of Settlement restoring Presbyterianism The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in greater independence for Parliament and kirk but the ending of Episcopacy isolated a significant part of the political class this would be a major factor in debates over the Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement
Key figures in the new government were Lord Melville who joined William in the Netherlands in after the Rye House Plot and the Earl of Stair a former member of James VII's administration In Melville was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland with Stair as Lord Advocate a combination intended to minimise Presbyterian dominance of Parliament
The first session was a stalemate over abolishing Episcopacy in the Kirk and the Committee of the Articles an unelected body that decided what legislation Parliament could debate As a result Parliament refused to approve taxes or nominations for legal officers effectively closing the law courts and William blocked implementation of legislation by withholding Royal Assent to Acts approved by Parliament
A majority of MPs formed themselves into an anti government group called the Club led by Sir James Montgomery previously one of William's chief supporters but angered by Melville being preferred as Secretary of State While some like Montgomery simply resented exclusion from office most opposed the government on political grounds and primarily wanted to eliminate the Committee of the Articles The government compromised by agreeing to remove bishops from the kirk but resisted abolition of the Committee of the Articles before Parliament was suspended on August following the Battle of Killiecrankie
Parliament reconvened in April in an atmosphere of high tension due to the Jacobite war in Ireland fears of an Irish invasion of Scotland and continuing unrest in the Highlands An alleged Jacobite conspiracy called the Montgomery Plot was uncovered involving Montgomery the Marquess of Annandale and Lord Ross In the resulting panic Melville agreed to abolish the Committee of the Articles although it is still unclear how serious the plot actually was Its principal objective achieved the Club disintegrated and on June Parliament approved an Act ending Episcopacy and a grant of taxes
The constitutional settlement that emerged from the and Parliamentary sessions was less radical than in The Crown retained important prerogative powers including the right to summon prorogue and dissolve Parliament but in return abolition of the Committee of Articles gave Parliament control of the legislative agenda
Conflicts between Protestors and Resolutioners during the Protectorate then Episcopalians and Cameronians after had left deep divisions while also normalising the eviction of defeated opponents The Kirk's General Assembly meeting in November was the first since and even before it convened over conformist and Episcopalian ministers had been removed from their livings
This meant the Assembly was overwhelmingly composed of radical Presbyterians who rejected any measure of Episcopalianism or the reinstatement of those already evicted Despite being a fellow Calvinist William was more tolerant towards Episcopalians seeing them as potential allies while recognising the dangers of alienating an important political constituency However the Assembly eliminated Episcopacy and created two commissions for the south and north of the Tay which over the next years removed almost two thirds of all ministers The General Assembly of refused to reinstate even those Episcopalian ministers who pledged to accept Presbyterianism leaving many presbyteries with few or no parish clergy
William issued two acts of indulgence in and restoring ministers who accepted him as king nearly one hundred clergy took advantage of this and a further measure of indulgence in left only a small remnant of Jacobite Episcopalians and some Society people The final settlement was closer to that of rather than the more radical position of and the degree of independence between Kirk and State remained ambiguous Despite the theoretical abolition of lay patronage heritors and elders retained the right to nominate candidates for their own parishes who could then be called by the congregation
The Scottish Parliament was dominated by Presbyterians with a small group of Stuart loyalists known as Jacobites from Jacobus Latin for James This included members of the Roman Catholic minority conservative Episcopalians or those with personal ties such as Viscount Dundee his military chief in Scotland The vast majority were unenthusiastic about either James or William while the Jacobites were also split between Protestant and Roman Catholic factions
Dundee led a campaign in Scotland to support James' landing in Ireland where clan rivalries or simple opportunism were often more important than allegiance to William or James The Presbyterian Macleans joined the Jacobites in order to regain territories in Mull lost to the Campbells in the s while the Jacobite Keppoch MacDonalds tried to sack Inverness and were bought off only after Dundee intervened Despite victory at Killiecrankie in July the Jacobites suffered heavy losses including Dundee himself Organised resistance ended with defeat at Battle of Cromdale on May although it took another two years to enforce allegiance to the new regime
The Glorious Revolution settled the dominance of the Presbyterians in the Church of Scotland and the Whigs in politics but alienated a significant segment of the political class The Whig dominance continued in both Scotland and England well into the mid eighteenth century
As in England the Revolution confirmed the ascendancy of Parliament over the Crown but by removing bishops from the Kirk it alienated a significant segment of the political class In the long term Episcopalianism rather than Highlander or Lowlander was a key determinant of Jacobite support in both and Scotland's involvement in the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession ultimately led to the Acts of Union and the creation of Great Britain as the danger of a divided succession between Scotland and England drove the need for a lasting resolution
