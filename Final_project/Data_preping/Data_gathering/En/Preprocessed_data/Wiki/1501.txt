The Honor Rolls of Baseball were established in 1946 by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum's Permanent Committee to establish as a second level of induction designed to recognize non-playing contributors
The committee designed the Honor Rolls to commemorate managers, executives, umpires and sportswriters, as an addition to their regular vote of old-time players
Though sportswriter Henry Chadwick was elected in 1938, the Hall had not devised a plan to extend recognition to these contributors, and this was the first attempt.
On April 23, 1946, the Permanent Committee voted to induct 11 players into the Baseball Hall of Fame, along with 39 non-players into the Honor Rolls, separated into their respective category
This second-tier list consisted of five managers, 11 umpires, 11 executives and 12 sportswriters.
