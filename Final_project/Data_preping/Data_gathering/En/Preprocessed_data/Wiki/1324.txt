adam prize presented university cambridge commemorates prediction position neptune
adam wa born lidcot farm laneast near launceston cornwall eldest seven children
parent thomas adam poor tenant farmer wife tabitha knill grylls
family devout wesleyan enjoyed music among john's brother thomas became missionary george farmer william grylls adam professor natural philosophy astronomy king's college london
tabitha wa farmer's daughter received rudimentary education john couch uncle whose small library inherited
john attended laneast village school acquired greek algebra
learned classic wa largely self-taught mathematics studying library devonport mechanics' institute reading rees's cyclopdia samuel vince's fluxions
observed halley's comet landulph following year started make astronomical calculation prediction observation engaging private tutoring finance activities
mother inherited small estate badharlick promise mathematician induced parent send university cambridge
october entered sizar st john's college graduating ba
alexis bouvard published astronomical table orbit uranus making prediction future position based newton's law motion gravitation
subsequent observation revealed substantial deviation table leading bouvard hypothesise perturbing body
adam learnt irregularity still undergraduate became convinced perturbation theory
adam believed face anything attempted could use observed data uranus utilising nothing newton's law gravitation deduce mass position orbit perturbing body
final examination adam wa elected fellow college spent summer vacation cornwall calculating first six iterations
worked problem back cambridge tutored undergraduate sending money home educate brother even taught bed maker read
apparently adam communicated work james challis director cambridge observatory mid-september controversy how
october adam returning cornwall vacation without appointment twice called astronomer royal george biddell airy greenwich
failing find home adam reputedly left manuscript solution without detailed calculations
appears adam regard question trivial often alleged failed complete response
various theory discussed adams's failure reply general nervousness procrastination disorganisation
meanwhile urbain le verrier november presented acadmie de science paris memoir uranus showing preexisting theory failed account motion
reading le verrier's memoir airy wa struck coincidence initiated desperate race english priority discovery planet
discovery neptune september announced paris become apparent neptune observed august challis lacked up-to-date star-map wa recognized planet
keen controversy arose france england merit two astronomers
fact became known wa wide recognition two astronomer independently solved problem uranus wa ascribed equal importance
however subsequent assertion brit stole neptune adams's british contemporary retrospectively ascribed credit wa due
also notable included foregoing discussion reference adam publicly acknowledged le verrier's priority credit forgetting mention role galle paper gave 'on perturbation uranus' royal astronomical society november
adam held bitterness towards challis airy acknowledged failure convince astronomical world
lay fellowship st john's college came end existing statute permit re-election
however pembroke college possessed greater freedom elected following year lay fellowship held rest life

hoped work would leverage vacant post superintendent hm nautical almanac office john russell hind wa preferred adam lacking necessary ability organiser administrator
since ancient time moon's mean rate motion relative star treated constant edmond halley suggested mean rate wa gradually increasing
later eighteenth century richard dunthorne estimated rate arcsecondscentury term resulting difference lunar longitude effect became known secular acceleration moon
pierre-simon laplace given explanation term change eccentricity earth's orbit
considered radial gravitational force moon sun earth obtained close agreement historical record observations
insistence acadmie de science damoiseau plana francesco carlini revisited laplace's work investigating quadratic higher-order perturbing term obtained similar result addressing radial neglecting tangential gravitational force moon
adam published paper showing tangential term vanish first-order theory laplace become substantial quadratic term admitted
small term integrated time come large effect adam concluded plana overestimated secular acceleration approximately per century
plana admitted adams's conclusion claiming revised analysis arrived results
however soon recanted publishing third result different adams's plana's earlier work
delaunay calculated fourth-order term duplicated adams's result leading adam publish calculation fifth sixth seventh-order terms
later year philippe gustave doulcet comte de pontcoulant published claim tangential force could effect though peter andreas hansen seems cast role arbitrator declared burden proof rested pontcoulant lamenting need discover effect account balance
much controversy centred around convergence power series expansion used adam duplicated result without using power series
sir john lubbock also duplicated adams's result plana finally concurred
adams's view wa ultimately accepted developed winning gold medal royal astronomical society in
adam became professor mathematics university st andrew lectured session returning cambridge lowndean professorship astronomy geometry
two year later succeeded challis director cambridge observatory post adam held death
great meteor shower november turned attention leonids whose probable path period already discussed predicted hubert anson newton in
newton asserted longitude ascending node marked shower would occur wa increasing problem explaining variation attracted europe's leading astronomers
using powerful elaborate analysis adam ascertained cluster meteor belongs solar system traverse elongated ellipse year subject definite perturbation larger planet jupiter saturn uranus
definitive orbit leonids coincided comet ptempel-tuttle thereby suggested later widely accepted close relationship comet meteors
