John Couch Adams FRS FRSE FRAS kuːtʃ June January was a British mathematician and astronomer He was born in Laneast near Launceston Cornwall and died in Cambridge
His most famous achievement was predicting the existence and position of Neptune using only mathematics The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton At the same time but unknown to each other the same calculations were made by Urbain Le Verrier Le Verrier would send his coordinates to Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle who confirmed the existence of the planet on September finding it within ° of Le Verrier's predicted location There was and to some extent still is some controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery see Discovery of Neptune
Adams was Lowndean Professor in the University of Cambridge from until his death He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in In he attended the International Meridian Conference as a delegate for Britain
A crater on the Moon is jointly named after him Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams Neptune's outermost known ring and the asteroid Adams are also named after him The Adams Prize presented by the University of Cambridge commemorates his prediction of the position of Neptune His personal library is held at Cambridge University Library
Adams was born at Lidcot a farm at Laneast near Launceston Cornwall the eldest of seven children His parents were Thomas Adams a poor tenant farmer and his wife Tabitha Knill Grylls The family were devout Wesleyans who enjoyed music and among John's brothers Thomas became a missionary George a farmer and William Grylls Adams professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at King's College London Tabitha was a farmer's daughter but had received a rudimentary education from John Couch her uncle whose small library she had inherited John was intrigued by the astronomy books from an early age
John attended the Laneast village school where he acquired some Greek and algebra From there he went at the age of twelve to Devonport where his mother's cousin the Rev John Couch Grylls kept a private school There he learned classics but was largely self taught in mathematics studying in the Library of Devonport Mechanics' Institute and reading Rees's Cyclopædia and Samuel Vince's Fluxions He observed Halley's comet in from Landulph and the following year started to make his own astronomical calculations predictions and observations engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities
In his mother inherited a small estate at Badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the University of Cambridge In October he entered as a sizar at St John's College graduating BA in as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizewinner of his year
In Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables leading Bouvard to hypothesise some perturbing body Adams learnt of the irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the perturbation theory Adams believed in the face of anything that had been attempted before that he could use the observed data on Uranus and utilising nothing more than Newton's law of gravitation deduce the mass position and orbit of the perturbing body On July he noted his intention to work on the problem
After his final examinations in Adams was elected fellow of his college and spent the summer vacation in Cornwall calculating the first of six iterations While he worked on the problem back in Cambridge he tutored undergraduates sending money home to educate his brothers and even taught his bed maker to read
Apparently Adams communicated his work to James Challis director of the Cambridge Observatory in mid September but there is some controversy as to how On October Adams returning from a Cornwall vacation without appointment twice called on Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in Greenwich Failing to find him at home Adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution again without the detailed calculations Airy responded with a letter to Adams asking for some clarification It appears that Adams did not regard the question as trivial as is often alleged but he failed to complete a response Various theories have been discussed as to Adams's failure to reply such as his general nervousness procrastination and disorganisation
Meanwhile Urbain Le Verrier on November presented to the Académie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion On reading Le Verrier's memoir Airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for English priority in discovery of the planet The search was begun by a laborious method on July Only after the discovery of Neptune on September had been announced in Paris did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on and August but because Challis lacked an up to date star map it was not recognized as a planet
A keen controversy arose in France and England as to the merits of the two astronomers As the facts became known there was wide recognition that the two astronomers had independently solved the problem of Uranus and each was ascribed equal importance However there have been subsequent assertions that The Brits Stole Neptune and that Adams's British contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due But it is also notable and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references that Adams himself publicly acknowledged Le Verrier's priority and credit not forgetting to mention the role of Galle in the paper that he gave 'On the Perturbations of Uranus' to the Royal Astronomical Society in November
Adams held no bitterness towards Challis or Airy and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world
His lay fellowship at St John's College came to an end in and the existing statutes did not permit his re election However Pembroke College which possessed greater freedom elected him in the following year to a lay fellowship which he held for the rest of his life
Despite the fame of his work on Neptune Adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism He was particularly adept at fine numerical calculations often making substantial revisions to the contributions of his predecessors However he was extraordinarily uncompetitive reluctant to publish imperfect work to stimulate debate or claim priority averse to correspondence about it and forgetful in practical matters It has been suggested that these are symptoms of Asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the repetitive behaviours and restricted interests necessary to perform the Neptune calculations in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with Challis and Airy
In he published new and accurate tables of the Moon's parallax which superseded Johann Karl Burckhardt's and supplied corrections to the theories of Marie Charles Damoiseau Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana and Philippe Gustave Doulcet
He had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of HM Nautical Almanac Office but John Russell Hind was preferred Adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator
Since ancient times the Moon's mean rate of motion relative to the stars had been treated as being constant but in Edmond Halley had suggested that this mean rate was gradually increasing Later during the eighteenth century Richard Dunthorne estimated the rate as + arcsecondscentury in terms of the resulting difference in lunar longitude an effect that became known as the secular acceleration of the Moon Pierre Simon Laplace had given an explanation in in terms of changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit He considered only the radial gravitational force on the Moon from the Sun and Earth but obtained close agreement with the historical record of observations
In at the insistence of the Académie des sciences Damoiseau Plana and Francesco Carlini revisited Laplace's work investigating quadratic and higher order perturbing terms and obtained similar results again addressing only a radial and neglecting tangential gravitational force on the Moon Hansen obtained similar results in and
In Adams published a paper showing that while tangential terms vanish in the first order theory of Laplace they become substantial when quadratic terms are admitted Small terms integrated in time come to have large effects and Adams concluded that Plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately per century
At first Le Verrier rejected Adams's results In Plana admitted Adams's conclusions claiming to have revised his own analysis and arrived at the same results However he soon recanted publishing a third result different both from Adams's and Plana's own earlier work Delaunay in calculated the fourth order term and duplicated Adams's result leading Adams to publish his own calculations for the fifth sixth and seventh order terms Adams now calculated that only of the observed was accounted for by gravitational effects Later that year Philippe Gustave Doulcet Comte de Pontécoulant published a claim that the tangential force could have no effect though Peter Andreas Hansen who seems to have cast himself in the role of arbitrator declared that the burden of proof rested on Pontécoulant while lamenting the need to discover a further effect to account for the balance Much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power series expansion used and in Adams duplicated his results without using a power series Sir John Lubbock also duplicated Adams's results and Plana finally concurred Adams's view was ultimately accepted and further developed winning him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in The unexplained drift is now known to be due to tidal acceleration
In Adams became professor of mathematics at the University of St Andrews but lectured only for a session before returning to Cambridge for the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry Two years later he succeeded Challis as director of the Cambridge Observatory a post Adams held until his death
The great meteor shower of November turned his attention to the Leonids whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by Hubert Anson Newton in Newton had asserted that the longitude of the ascending node that marked where the shower would occur was increasing and the problem of explaining this variation attracted some of Europe's leading astronomers
Using a powerful and elaborate analysis Adams ascertained that this cluster of meteors which belongs to the Solar System traverses an elongated ellipse in years and is subject to definite perturbations from the larger planets Jupiter Saturn and Uranus These results were published in
Some experts consider this Adams's most substantial achievement His definitive orbit for the Leonids coincided with that of the comet PTempel Tuttle and thereby suggested the later widely accepted close relationship between comets and meteors
Ten years later George William Hill described a novel and elegant method for attacking the problem of lunar motion Adams briefly announced his own unpublished work in the same field which following a parallel course had confirmed and supplemented Hill's
Over a period of forty years he periodically addressed the determination of the constants in Carl Friedrich Gauss's theory of terrestrial magnetism Again the calculations involved great labour and were not published during his lifetime They were edited by his brother William Grylls Adams and appear in the second volume of the collected Scientific Papers Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime He calculated the Euler Mascheroni constant perhaps somewhat eccentrically to decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the nd
Adams had boundless admiration for Newton and his writings and many of his papers bear the cast of Newton's thought In Isaac Newton Wallop th Earl of Portsmouth donated his private collection of Newton's papers to Cambridge University Adams and G G Stokes took on the task of arranging the material publishing a catalogue in
The post of Astronomer Royal was offered him in but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in Cambridge He was British delegate to the International Meridian Conference at Washington in when he also attended the meetings of the British Association at Montreal and of the American Association at Philadelphia
He is reputed to have been offered a knighthood on Queen Victoria's Cambridge visit but to have declined either out of modesty or fear of the financial consequences of such social distinction
