sycamore quantum processor created google's artificial intelligence division
sycamore completed task second google claimed nature paper would take state-of-the-art supercomputer year finish
estimate time would taken classical supercomputer google ran portion quantum circuit simulation summit powerful classical computer world
later ibm made counter-argument claiming task would take day classical system like summit
google's claim upheld would represent exponential leap computing power
august quantum engineer working google reported largest chemical simulation quantum computer hartree-fock approximation sycamore paired classical computer analyzed result provide new parameter qubit system
april researcher working sycamore reported able realize ground state toric code topologically ordered state qubits
showed long-range entanglement property state measuring non-zero topological entropy simulating anyon interferometry braiding statistic preparing topological quantum error correcting code one logical qubit
july collaboration consisting google multiple university reported observation discrete time crystal sycamore processor
chip qubits wa used obtain many body localization configuration spins
configuration wa stimulated laser achieve periodically driven floquet system spin flipped vice versa periodic cycle multiple laser cycles
energy wa absorbed laser system remained protected eigenstate orde
