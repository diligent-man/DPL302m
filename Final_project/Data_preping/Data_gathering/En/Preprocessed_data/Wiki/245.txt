Sycamore is a quantum processor created by Google's Artificial Intelligence division It has qubits
In Sycamore completed a task in seconds that Google claimed in a Nature paper would take a state of the art supercomputer years to finish Thus Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy To estimate the time that would be taken by a classical supercomputer Google ran portions of the quantum circuit simulation on the Summit the most powerful classical computer in the world Later IBM made a counter argument claiming that the task would only take days on a classical system like Summit If Google's claims are upheld then it would represent an exponential leap in computing power
In August quantum engineers working for Google reported the largest chemical simulation on a quantum computer a Hartree Fock approximation with Sycamore paired with a classical computer that analyzed results to provide new parameters for the qubit system
In April researchers working with Sycamore reported that they were able to realize the ground state of the toric code a topologically ordered state with qubits They showed long range entanglement properties of the state by measuring non zero topological entropy simulating anyon interferometry and their braiding statistics and preparing a topological quantum error correcting code with one logical qubit
In July a collaboration consisting of Google and multiple universities reported the observation of a discrete time crystal on the Sycamore processor The chip of qubits was used to obtain a many body localization configuration of up and down spins The configuration was stimulated with a laser to achieve a periodically driven Floquet system where all up spins are flipped for down and vice versa in periodic cycles which are multiples of the laserâ€™s cycles No energy was absorbed from the laser so the system remained in a protected eigenstate order
