The Battle of Intombe (also Intombi or Intombi River Drift) was an action fought on 12 March 1879, between Zulu troops loyal to Mbilini waMswati and British soldiers and African civilian conductors, drivers and Voorloopers (scouts) defending a convoy of wagons on the road from Derby to Lüneberg
The convoy straggled badly along the road due to the rains and bogged on both sides of the Intombe river, which had risen and was in spate due to the rains
Most of the wagons were laagered (parked close together as an obstacle), somewhat haphazardly, close to the river on the Derby side (the north bank) with a small party and two wagons on the Lüneberg side (the south bank).
The Zulu leader Mbilini waMswati and his followers could see how vulnerable the convoy was from the high ground of the Tafelberg
Mbilini assembled a large force of Zulu irregulars and attacked the laager on 12 March
Using the early morning mist for camouflage, the Zulu were able to rush the laager and overrun the British and their African auxiliaries
A few men managed to reach the river and dived in, hoping to be washed across to the south bank where the small British party there engaged the Zulus on the north back with rifle-fire
About twelve men from the north bank got across the river and joined the small force there.
The officer commanding the party on the south bank mounted a horse and deserted his men, command devolving on sergeant Anthony Booth who formed square and retreated southwards, holding off Zulus who crossed the river to pursue them
When the officer reached safety he alerted the garrison which set out on every horse that they could find with 150 infantry following on foot
Booth and his party were rescued and the carnage at the laager examined, the last of the Zulu being seen making their escape with about 250 cattle and much of the supplies plundered from the wagons.
The village of Lüneberg (27°19′1″S 30°36′57″E﻿ / ﻿27.31694°S 30.61583°E﻿ / -27.31694; 30.61583) was in the disputed territories to the north of Zululand and had been laagered by its 120 white settlers, after news arrived of the Zulu victory at Isandlwana
In the hot weather, conditions in the laager were poor and diseases spread
The Zulus posed a serious threat to the area which was attacked on the night of 10/11 February
Fearing a repeat of the attack, the British dispatched four companies of the 80th Regiment of Foot (Major Charles Tucker) to garrison the village.
In late February 1879, a convoy of eighteen wagons carrying 90,000 rounds of  .577/450 Martini–Henry ammunition, mealies (coarse maize flour), tinned food, biscuits, a rocket battery and other weapons for the 80th Regiment, was sent from Lydenburg to supply the garrison
From the Transvaal border the convoy was escorted by D Company (Captain Anderson accompanied by Lieutenant Daubeney) of the 80th Regiment, from Lüneberg, which rendezvoused on the road from Derby on 1 March
By 5 March, the convoy was still 5 mi (8 km) short of Meyer's Drift, 8 mi (13 km) from Lüneberg, having been hampered by rains which caused the rivers to swell and the ground to soften.
The wagons being shoved most of the way and fearing a Zulu attack, Tucker sent an order to Anderson to reach Lüneberg that night 'at any cost'
The company commander took this literally, abandoned the wagons and returned to Lüneberg
The Swazi pretender Mbilini waMswati and his Zulu irregulars were watching the convoy and as soon as the escort departed, the wagons were attacked by looters, the drivers and voorloopers (scouts) running for Derby
Soon afterwards, an advanced party despatched by Hamu arrived and drove off the looters in turn, who came back as soon as Hamu's men departed; the raiding party lifted stores and forty oxen.
When Anderson reached Lüneberg without the supplies, Tucker was aghast and sent Captain David Moriarty and 106 men to bring in the convoy
The escort had got six wagons to the far bank of the Intombe, 4 mi (6 km) from Lüneberg
Six other wagons were 3 mi (5 km) further back
By the time the Moriarty party reached Meyer's Drift the river had risen; a camp was established on the Lüneberg side and the men began to lash a raft of planks and barrels together with rope
A few men at a time were ferried across, except for a party of 35 commanded by Lieutenant Lindop
On the far side, Moriarty and the rest of the party went to recover the wagons but found that most had been emptied by the looters.
It took until around noon on 11 March to get all of the wagons to the Derby side of the river, by when two wagons had been transported to the Lüneberg side
The Intombe had risen again and was flowing at 7 kn (8 mph; 13 km/h), far too fast to cross
Moriarty ordered the wagons to be laagered for the night
The Moriarty party, out for five nights, soaked through and unable to cook food did not laager the wagons as tightly as possible, leaving gaps between them, in a "V" with the ends at the river
By the afternoon, the river had subsided, leaving the laager wide open at both end of the "V".
On 11 March, Tucker inspected the laager at the river and found it to be poorly constructed
He was not impressed with the inverted 'V' shape in which the wagons were arranged, with the base at the river
The amount of water in the river had diminished and there was a gap of several yards between river and base
There were other flaws in the arrangement; Tucker considered that it afforded 'no protection whatever in the event of the Zulus attacking in numbers'
The garrison was weakened by being on both sides of the river, thirty men being laagered on the other bank
Mbilini waMswati, the local Zulu leader, gathered about 800 men on a height known as Tafelberg 3 mi (5 km) north-east of the ford (Myer's Drift) to attack the laager
Mbilini reconnoitred the laager late on 11 March and saw how vulnerable it was
Exploiting a mist to approach the laager unseen, Mbilini led his Zulus forward to the attack early on 12 March.
On the night of 11 March 1879, two sentries were stationed 20 yd (18 m) from the laager but a 50 yd (46 m) rise in front of them limited their line of sight
At 3:30 a.m
on 12 March, a shot was heard close to the camp
The men returned to their beds after Moriarty decided that it was of no consequence
An hour and a half later, a sentry on the far bank saw, through a clearing in the mist, a huge mass of Zulus advancing silently on the camp.
Moriarty charged out of his tent with his revolver at the ready and killed three Zulus before being shot from the front and stabbed with an assegai from behind and was said to have shouted "Fire away boys, death or glory! I'm done" as he fell
Few of his comrades managed to put up any resistance and many were cut down
Survivors fled into the river, still in spate, flowing at 7 kn (8 mph; 13 km/h), hoping to be washed to the far bank
The troops on the far bank provided as much covering fire as possible
Upon what survivors they could see reaching the Lüneberg side of the river, Lieutenant Henry Hollingworth Harward, Moriarty's second-in-command, gave the order to withdraw as several hundred Zulus were crossing the river
No sooner had he done this, he grabbed the first horse he spotted and fled, abandoning his men.
These survivors were left under the command of Sergeant Anthony Booth
For 3 mi (5 km), the Zulus pursued the group of around forty survivors
Whenever they drew closer, several of the bolder troops along with Booth, stopped to deliver a volley, which dispersed their pursuers
Four men who split from the group to take a short cut to Lüneberg were overtaken and killed
The others made it to Raby's Farm, around 2 mi (3 km) from Lüneberg, where the Zulus broke off their pursuit
Booth was later awarded the Victoria Cross
The wagons at the laager were looted and all the ammunition and supplies were carried off by the Zulus or destroyed.
Harward arrived at Lüneberg and told Tucker of what had happened; Tucker ordered all his mounted troops to accompany him to the camp and 150 infantry to follow
Tucker and his mounted force spotted 'dense masses' of Zulus leaving the scene of the battle as they approached
At the camp, they discovered one soldier who had made a miraculous escape by being carried down the river and then making his way back to the camp
He and two African wagon drivers were the only survivors.
Comparisons can be made between Intombe and Rorke's Drift
At Intombe a force of 500 to 800 Zulu had quickly overrun and defeated over 100 British regular infantry in laager
At Rorke's Drift, over 100 British regular infantry were able to stand off 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu from behind hastily constructed but sturdy fortifications for nearly a day
Intombe demonstrated the vulnerability of the slow and awkward supply lines that the British army was dependent on and the price of complacency
If the Zulus continued to exploit this vulnerability, invading British columns could be halted or turned back.
Eight months after the incident, Harward was brought from England, under arrest, charged with "misbehaviour before the enemy and shamefully abandoning a party of the regiment under his command when attacked" and other lesser charges
Harward was acquitted, supposedly because he left to get reinforcements which, by their promptitude, prevented Harward's party from annihilation
Sir Garnet Wolseley was so appalled at the verdict that he added adverse comments to it, which were read to every regiment in the army
Harward resigned his commission in May 1880.
In 1988, Donald Morris wrote that the bodies of Captain Moriarty, Surgeon Cobbins, three conductors, fifteen African voorloopers and sixty troops were found in the encampment
In 1995, John Lock wrote that there were only around fifty survivors out of the 150 men; for weeks afterwards, as the river rose and fell with the rains, corpses were found in the water and along the banks
Rifles, the 90,000 rounds of Martini-Henry ammunition and 225 lb (102 kg) of gunpowder were also lost
In 1998, Morris wrote of eighty men killed, 62 of the dead being British soldiers along with three conductors and 15 African voorloopers
In 2009, John Laband wrote that one officer and sixty men, a civilian surgeon, two wagon conductors and fifteen African drivers were killed; thirty Zulu dead were found on the banks of the Ntombe
In 2012, Adrian Greaves wrote that the British and their local allies had suffered casualties of an officer, a doctor, 64 other ranks and fifteen Africans killed and twenty missing, presumed drowned.
