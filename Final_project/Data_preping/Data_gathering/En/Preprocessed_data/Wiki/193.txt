The Battle of Intombe also Intombi or Intombi River Drift was an action fought on March between Zulu troops loyal to Mbilini waMswati and British soldiers and African civilian conductors drivers and Voorloopers scouts defending a convoy of wagons on the road from Derby to L neberg The convoy straggled badly along the road due to the rains and bogged on both sides of the Intombe river which had risen and was in spate due to the rains Most of the wagons were laagered parked close together as an obstacle somewhat haphazardly close to the river on the Derby side the north bank with a small party and two wagons on the L neberg side the south bank
The Zulu leader Mbilini waMswati and his followers could see how vulnerable the convoy was from the high ground of the Tafelberg Mbilini assembled a large force of Zulu irregulars and attacked the laager on March Using the early morning mist for camouflage the Zulu were able to rush the laager and overrun the British and their African auxiliaries A few men managed to reach the river and dived in hoping to be washed across to the south bank where the small British party there engaged the Zulus on the north back with rifle fire About twelve men from the north bank got across the river and joined the small force there
The officer commanding the party on the south bank mounted a horse and deserted his men command devolving on sergeant Anthony Booth who formed square and retreated southwards holding off Zulus who crossed the river to pursue them When the officer reached safety he alerted the garrison which set out on every horse that they could find with infantry following on foot Booth and his party were rescued and the carnage at the laager examined the last of the Zulu being seen making their escape with about cattle and much of the supplies plundered from the wagons
The village of L neberg S E S E was in the disputed territories to the north of Zululand and had been laagered by its white settlers after news arrived of the Zulu victory at Isandlwana In the hot weather conditions in the laager were poor and diseases spread The Zulus posed a serious threat to the area which was attacked on the night of February Fearing a repeat of the attack the British dispatched four companies of the th Regiment of Foot Major Charles Tucker to garrison the village
In late February a convoy of eighteen wagons carrying rounds of Martini Henry ammunition mealies coarse maize flour tinned food biscuits a rocket battery and other weapons for the th Regiment was sent from Lydenburg to supply the garrison From the Transvaal border the convoy was escorted by D Company Captain Anderson accompanied by Lieutenant Daubeney of the th Regiment from L neberg which rendezvoused on the road from Derby on March By March the convoy was still mi km short of Meyer's Drift mi km from L neberg having been hampered by rains which caused the rivers to swell and the ground to soften
The wagons being shoved most of the way and fearing a Zulu attack Tucker sent an order to Anderson to reach L neberg that night 'at any cost' The company commander took this literally abandoned the wagons and returned to L neberg The Swazi pretender Mbilini waMswati and his Zulu irregulars were watching the convoy and as soon as the escort departed the wagons were attacked by looters the drivers and voorloopers scouts running for Derby Soon afterwards an advanced party despatched by Hamu arrived and drove off the looters in turn who came back as soon as Hamu's men departed the raiding party lifted stores and forty oxen
When Anderson reached L neberg without the supplies Tucker was aghast and sent Captain David Moriarty and men to bring in the convoy The escort had got six wagons to the far bank of the Intombe mi km from L neberg Six other wagons were mi km further back By the time the Moriarty party reached Meyer's Drift the river had risen a camp was established on the L neberg side and the men began to lash a raft of planks and barrels together with rope A few men at a time were ferried across except for a party of commanded by Lieutenant Lindop On the far side Moriarty and the rest of the party went to recover the wagons but found that most had been emptied by the looters
It took until around noon on March to get all of the wagons to the Derby side of the river by when two wagons had been transported to the L neberg side The Intombe had risen again and was flowing at kn mph km h far too fast to cross Moriarty ordered the wagons to be laagered for the night The Moriarty party out for five nights soaked through and unable to cook food did not laager the wagons as tightly as possible leaving gaps between them in a V with the ends at the river By the afternoon the river had subsided leaving the laager wide open at both end of the V
On March Tucker inspected the laager at the river and found it to be poorly constructed He was not impressed with the inverted 'V' shape in which the wagons were arranged with the base at the river The amount of water in the river had diminished and there was a gap of several yards between river and base There were other flaws in the arrangement Tucker considered that it afforded 'no protection whatever in the event of the Zulus attacking in numbers' The garrison was weakened by being on both sides of the river thirty men being laagered on the other bank Mbilini waMswati the local Zulu leader gathered about men on a height known as Tafelberg mi km north east of the ford Myer's Drift to attack the laager Mbilini reconnoitred the laager late on March and saw how vulnerable it was Exploiting a mist to approach the laager unseen Mbilini led his Zulus forward to the attack early on March
On the night of March two sentries were stationed yd m from the laager but a yd m rise in front of them limited their line of sight At a m on March a shot was heard close to the camp The men returned to their beds after Moriarty decided that it was of no consequence An hour and a half later a sentry on the far bank saw through a clearing in the mist a huge mass of Zulus advancing silently on the camp
Moriarty charged out of his tent with his revolver at the ready and killed three Zulus before being shot from the front and stabbed with an assegai from behind and was said to have shouted Fire away boys death or glory I'm done as he fell Few of his comrades managed to put up any resistance and many were cut down Survivors fled into the river still in spate flowing at kn mph km h hoping to be washed to the far bank The troops on the far bank provided as much covering fire as possible Upon what survivors they could see reaching the L neberg side of the river Lieutenant Henry Hollingworth Harward Moriarty's second in command gave the order to withdraw as several hundred Zulus were crossing the river No sooner had he done this he grabbed the first horse he spotted and fled abandoning his men
These survivors were left under the command of Sergeant Anthony Booth For mi km the Zulus pursued the group of around forty survivors Whenever they drew closer several of the bolder troops along with Booth stopped to deliver a volley which dispersed their pursuers Four men who split from the group to take a short cut to L neberg were overtaken and killed The others made it to Raby's Farm around mi km from L neberg where the Zulus broke off their pursuit Booth was later awarded the Victoria Cross The wagons at the laager were looted and all the ammunition and supplies were carried off by the Zulus or destroyed
Harward arrived at L neberg and told Tucker of what had happened Tucker ordered all his mounted troops to accompany him to the camp and infantry to follow Tucker and his mounted force spotted 'dense masses' of Zulus leaving the scene of the battle as they approached At the camp they discovered one soldier who had made a miraculous escape by being carried down the river and then making his way back to the camp He and two African wagon drivers were the only survivors
Comparisons can be made between Intombe and Rorke's Drift At Intombe a force of to Zulu had quickly overrun and defeated over British regular infantry in laager At Rorke's Drift over British regular infantry were able to stand off to Zulu from behind hastily constructed but sturdy fortifications for nearly a day Intombe demonstrated the vulnerability of the slow and awkward supply lines that the British army was dependent on and the price of complacency If the Zulus continued to exploit this vulnerability invading British columns could be halted or turned back
Eight months after the incident Harward was brought from England under arrest charged with misbehaviour before the enemy and shamefully abandoning a party of the regiment under his command when attacked and other lesser charges Harward was acquitted supposedly because he left to get reinforcements which by their promptitude prevented Harward's party from annihilation Sir Garnet Wolseley was so appalled at the verdict that he added adverse comments to it which were read to every regiment in the army Harward resigned his commission in May
In Donald Morris wrote that the bodies of Captain Moriarty Surgeon Cobbins three conductors fifteen African voorloopers and sixty troops were found in the encampment In John Lock wrote that there were only around fifty survivors out of the men for weeks afterwards as the river rose and fell with the rains corpses were found in the water and along the banks Rifles the rounds of Martini Henry ammunition and lb kg of gunpowder were also lost In Morris wrote of eighty men killed of the dead being British soldiers along with three conductors and African voorloopers In John Laband wrote that one officer and sixty men a civilian surgeon two wagon conductors and fifteen African drivers were killed thirty Zulu dead were found on the banks of the Ntombe In Adrian Greaves wrote that the British and their local allies had suffered casualties of an officer a doctor other ranks and fifteen Africans killed and twenty missing presumed drowned
