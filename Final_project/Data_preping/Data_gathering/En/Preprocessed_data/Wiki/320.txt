A computing platform or digital platform is an environment in which a piece of software is executed It may be the hardware or the operating system OS even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces or other underlying software as long as the program code is executed with it Computing platforms have different abstraction levels including a computer architecture an OS or runtime libraries A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run
A platform can be seen both as a constraint on the software development process in that different platforms provide different functionality and restrictions and as an assistant to the development process in that they provide low level functionality ready made For example an OS may be a platform that abstracts the underlying differences in hardware and provides a generic command for saving files or accessing the network
Hardware alone in the case of small embedded systems Embedded systems can access hardware directly without an OS this is referred to as running on bare metal
A browser in the case of web based software The browser itself runs on a hardware OS platform but this is not relevant to software running within the browser
An application such as a spreadsheet or word processor which hosts software written in an application specific scripting language such as an Excel macro This can be extended to writing fully fledged applications with the Microsoft Office suite as a platform
Software frameworks that provide ready made functionality
Cloud computing and Platform as a Service Extending the idea of a software framework these allow application developers to build software out of components that are hosted not by the developer but by the provider with internet communication linking them together The social networking sites Twitter and Facebook are also considered development platforms
A virtual machine VM such as the Java virtual machine or NET CLR Applications are compiled into a format similar to machine code known as bytecode which is then executed by the VM
A virtualized version of a complete system including virtualized hardware OS software and storage These allow for instance a typical Windows program to run on what is physically a Mac Some architectures have multiple layers with each layer acting as a platform to the one above it In general a component only has to be adapted to the layer immediately beneath it For instance a Java program has to be written to use the Java virtual machine JVM and associated libraries as a platform but does not have to be adapted to run for the Windows Linux or Macintosh OS platforms However the JVM the layer beneath the application does have to be built separately for each OS
