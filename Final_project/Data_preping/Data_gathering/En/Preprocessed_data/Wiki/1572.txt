the real presence of christ in the eucharist is the christian doctrine that jesus christ is present in the eucharist not merely symbolically or metaphorically but in a true real and substantial way
there are a number of christian denominations that teach that christ is truly present in the eucharist including catholicism eastern orthodoxy oriental orthodoxy the church of the east the moravian church lutheranism anglicanism methodism irvingism and reformed christianity
the differences in the teachings of these churches primarily concern the mode of christ s presence in the lord s supper
the real presence is rejected or interpreted in light of remembrance per certain translations of the new testament by other protestants including general baptists anabaptists the plymouth brethren some non denominational christian churches as well as those identifying with liberal christianity and segments of the restoration movement such as jehovah s witnesses
efforts at mutual understanding of the range of beliefs by these churches led in the s to consultations on baptism eucharist and ministry by the world council of churches
the real presence of christ in the eucharist has been affirmed since very ancient times
early christian writers referred to the eucharistic elements as jesus s body and the blood
the short document known as the teachings of the apostles or didache which may be the earliest christian document outside of the new testament to speak of the eucharist says let no one eat or drink of your eucharist unless they have been baptized into the name of the lord for concerning this also the lord has said give not that which is holy to the dogs
ignatius of antioch writing in about ad to the roman christians says i desire the bread of god the heavenly bread the bread of life which is the flesh of jesus christ the son of god who became afterwards of the seed of david and abraham and i desire the drink of god namely his blood which is incorruptible love and eternal life
writing to the christians of smyrna in the same year he warned them to stand aloof from such heretics because among other reasons they abstain from the eucharist and from prayer because they confess not the eucharist to be the flesh of our saviour jesus christ which suffered for our sins and which the father of his goodness raised up again
in about justin martyr referring to the eucharist wrote not as common bread and common drink do we receive these but in like manner as jesus christ our savior having been made flesh by the word of god had both flesh and blood for our salvation so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of his word and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished is the flesh and blood of that jesus who was made flesh
in about ad tertullian wrote having taken the bread and given it to his disciples he made it his own body by saying this is my body that is the figure of my body
a figure however there could not have been unless there were first a veritable body
an empty thing or phantom is incapable of a figure
if however as marcion might say he pretended the bread was his body because he lacked the truth of bodily substance it follows that he must have given bread for us
the apostolic constitutions compiled c says let the bishop give the oblation saying the body of christ and let him that receiveth say amen
and let the deacon take the cup and when he gives it say the blood of christ the cup of life and let him that drinketh say amen
ambrose of milan died wrote
other fourth century christian writers say that in the eucharist there occurs a change transelementation transformation transposing alteration of the bread into the body of christ
augustine declares that the bread consecrated in the eucharist actually becomes in latin fit the body of christ the faithful know what i m talking about they know christ in the breaking of bread
it isn t every loaf of bread you see but the one receiving christ s blessing that becomes the body of christ
in the th century charles the bald posed two unclearly formulated questions whether the faithful receive the body of christ in mystery or in truth and whether the body is the same that was born of mary and suffered on the cross
ratramnus understood in truth to mean simply what is perceptible to the senses plain unvarnished reality rei manifestae demonstratio and declared that the consecration leaves the bread and wine unchanged in their outward appearance and thus insofar as these are signs of the body and blood of christ hidden under the veil of the signs the faithful receive the body of christ not in veritate but in figura in mysterio in virtute figure mystery power
ratramnus opposed capharnaitic tendencies but in no way betrayed a symbolist understanding such as that of th century berengarius
radbertus on the other hand developed the realism of the gallican and roman liturgy and the ambrosian theology of the identity of the sacramental and historical body of the lord
the dispute ended with radbertus s letter to frudiger in which he stressed further the identity of the sacramental and historical body of christ but met the opposing view to the extent of emphasizing the spiritual nature of the sacramental body
friedrich kempf comments since paschasius had identified the eucharistic and the historical body of the lord without more precisely explaining the eucharistic species his teaching could and probably did promote a grossly materialistic capharanaitic interpretation
the question of the nature of the eucharist became virulent for a second time in the western church in the th century when berengar of tours denied that any material change in the elements was needed to explain the eucharistic presence
this caused a controversy which led to the explicit clarification of the catholic doctrine of the eucharist
in the fourth lateran council used the word transubstantiated in its profession of faith when speaking of the change that takes place in the eucharist
it was only later in the th century that aristotelian metaphysics was accepted and a philosophical elaboration in line with that metaphysics was developed which found classic formulation in the teaching of saint thomas aquinas
it was only then that scholasticism cast christian theology in the terms of aristotelianism
the metaphysical aspects of the real presence of christ in the eucharist were firstly described since the time of the latin juvenile treatise titled de venerabili sacramento altaris on the reverend sacrament of the altar
during the later medieval period the question was debated within the western church
following the protestant reformation it became a central topic of division amongst the various emerging confessions
the lutheran doctrine of the real presence known as the sacramental union was formulated in the augsburg confession of
luther decidedly supported this doctrine publishing the sacrament of the body and blood of christ against the fanatics in
saying that bread and body are two distinct substances he declared that out of two kinds of objects a union has taken place which i shall call a sacramental union
thus the main theological division in this question turned out to be not between catholicism and protestantism but within protestantism especially between luther and zwingli who discussed the question at the marburg colloquy of but who failed to come to an agreement
zwingli s view became associated with the term memorialism suggesting an understanding of the eucharist held purely in memory of christ
while this accurately describes the position of the anabaptists and derived traditions it is not the position held by zwingli himself who affirmed that christ is truly in substance though not naturally physically present in the sacrament
the position of the church of england on this matter the real presence is clear and highlighted in the thirty nine articles of religion
the council of trent held in reaction to the protestant reformation and initiating the catholic counter reformation promulgated the view of the presence of christ in the eucharist as true real and substantial and declared that by the consecration of the bread and of the wine a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the substance substantia of the body of christ our lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood which conversion is by the holy catholic church suitably and properly called transubstantiation
the scholastic aristotelian philosophy of substance was not included in the council s definitive teaching but rather the more general idea of substance that had predated thomas aquinas
eastern orthodoxy did not become involved in the dispute prior to the th century
it became virulent in when cyril lucaris denied the doctrine of transubstantiation using the greek translation metousiosis for the concept
to counter the teaching of lucaris metropolitan petro mohyla of kiev drew up in latin an orthodox confession in defense of transubstantiation
this confession was approved by all the greek speaking patriarchs those of constantinople alexandria antioch and jerusalem in and again by the synod of jerusalem also referred to as the council of bethlehem
the catholic church declares that the presence of christ in the eucharist is true real and substantial
by saying christ is truly present in the eucharist it excludes any understanding of the presence as merely that of a sign or figure
by stating that his presence in the eucharist is real it defines it as objective and independent of the thoughts and feelings of the participants whether they have faith or not lack of faith may make reception of the sacrament fruitless for holiness but it does not make his presence unreal
in the third place the catholic church describes the presence of christ in the eucharist as substantial that is involving the underlying substance not the appearances of bread and wine
these maintain all their physical properties as before unlike what happens when the appearance of something or somebody is altered but the basic reality remains the same it is the teaching of the catholic church that in the eucharist the appearance is quite unchanged but the basic reality has become the body and blood of christ
the change from bread and wine to a presence of christ that is true real and substantial is called transubstantiation
the catholic church does not consider the term transubstantiation an explanation of the change it declares that the change by which the signs of bread and wine become the body and blood of christ occurs in a way surpassing understanding
one hymn of the church ave verum corpus greets christ in the eucharist as follows in translation from the original latin hail true body born of mary virgin and which truly suffered and was immolated on the cross for mankind
the catholic church also holds that the presence of christ in the eucharist is entire it does not see what is really in the eucharist as a lifeless corpse and mere blood but as the whole christ body and blood soul and divinity nor does it see the persisting outward appearances of bread and wine and their properties such as weight and nutritional value as a mere illusion but objectively existing as before and unchanged
in the view of the catholic church the presence of christ in the eucharist is of an order different from the presence of christ in the other sacraments in the other sacraments he is present by his power rather than by the reality of his body and blood the basis of the description of his presence as real
the eastern orthodox churches and the oriental orthodox churches as well as the churches of the east believe that in the eucharist the bread and wine are objectively changed and become in a real sense the body and blood of christ
the theologians brad harper and paul louis metzger state that
the greek term metousiosis is sometimes used by eastern orthodox christians to describe the change since this term is not bound up with the scholastic theory of substance and accidents but it does not have official status as a dogma of the orthodox communion
similarly coptic orthodox christians are fearful of using philosophical terms concerning the real presence of christ in the eucharist preferring uncritical appeals to biblical passages like cor
or the discourse in john
while the roman catholic church believes that the change takes place at the words of institution or consecration the eastern orthodox church teaches that the change takes place anywhere between the proskomedia the liturgy of preparation and the epiklesis calling down or invocation of the holy spirit upon us and upon these gifts here set forth
therefore it teaches that the gifts should be treated with reverence throughout the entirety of the service
we don t know the exact time in which the change takes place and this is left to mystery
the words of the ethiopic liturgy are representative of the faith of oriental orthodoxy i believe i believe i believe and profess to the last breath that this is the body and the blood of our lord god and saviour jesus christ which he took from our lady the holy and immaculate virgin mary the mother of god
the eastern orthodox church s synod of jerusalem declared we believe the lord jesus christ to be present not typically nor figuratively nor by superabundant grace as in the other mysteries
but truly and really so that after the consecration of the bread and of the wine the bread is transmuted transubstantiated converted and transformed into the true body itself of the lord which was born in bethlehem of the ever virgin mary was baptised in the jordan suffered was buried rose again was received up sitteth at the right hand of the god and father and is to come again in the clouds of heaven and the wine is converted and transubstantiated into the true blood itself of the lord which as he hung upon the cross was poured out for the life of the world
lutherans believe in the real presence of the body and blood of christ in the eucharist that the body and blood of christ are truly and substantially present in with and under the forms of the consecrated bread and wine the elements so that communicants orally eat and drink the holy body and blood of christ himself as well as the bread and wine cf
augsburg confession article in this sacrament
the lutheran doctrine of the real presence is more accurately and formally known as the sacramental union it has been inaccurately called consubstantiation a term which is specifically rejected by most lutheran churches and theologians since it creates confusion about the actual doctrine and it subjects the doctrine to the control of an abiblical philosophical concept in the same manner as in their view does the term transubstantiation
for lutherans there is no sacrament unless the elements are used according to christ s institution consecration distribution and reception
this was first articulated in the wittenberg concord of in the formula nihil habet rationem sacramenti extra usum a christo institutum nothing has the character of a sacrament apart from the use instituted by christ
some lutherans use this formula as their rationale for opposing in the church the reservation of the consecrated elements private masses the practice of corpus christi and the belief that the reliqu what remains of the consecrated elements after all have communed in the worship service are still sacramentally united to the body and blood of christ
this interpretation is not universal among lutherans
the consecrated elements are treated with reverence and in some lutheran churches are reserved as in orthodox catholic and anglican practice
the external eucharistic adoration is usually not practiced by most lutherans except for bowing genuflecting and kneeling to receive the eucharist from the words of institution and elevation to reception of the holy meal
the reliqu traditionally are consumed by the celebrant after the people have communed except that a small amount may be reserved for delivery to those too ill or infirm to attend the service
in this case the consecrated elements are to be delivered quickly preserving the connection between the communion of the ill person and that of the congregation gathered in public divine service
lutherans use the terms in with and under the forms of consecrated bread and wine and sacramental union to distinguish their understanding of the eucharist from those of the reformed and other traditions
anglicans prefer a view of objective presence that maintains a definitive change but allows how that change occurs to remain a mystery
likewise methodists postulate a par excellence presence as being a holy mystery
anglicans generally and officially believe in the real presence of christ in the eucharist but the specific forms of that belief range from a corporeal presence real objective presence sometimes even with eucharistic adoration mainly high church anglo catholics to belief in a pneumatic presence mainly low church reformed anglicans
in anglican theology a sacrament is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace
in the eucharist the outward and visible sign is that of bread and wine while the inward and spiritual grace is that of the body and blood of christ
the classic anglican aphorism with regard to the debate on the eucharist is the poem by john donne he was the word that spake it he took the bread and brake it and what that word did make it i do believe and take it divine poems
on the sacrament
during the english reformation the doctrine of the church of england was strongly influenced by continental reformed theologians whom cranmer had invited to england to aid with the reforms
among these were martin bucer peter martyr vermigli bernardino ochino paul fagius and jan aski
john calvin was also urged to come to england by cranmer but declined saying that he was too involved in the swiss reforms
consequently early on the church of england has a strong reformed if not particularly calvinistic influence
the view of the real presence as taught in the thirty nine articles therefore bears much resemblance to the doctrine of the pneumatic presence of christ in the eucharist held by bucer martyr and calvin
the anglican thirty nine articles of religion contends that
for many anglicans whose mysticism is intensely incarnational it is extremely important that god has used the mundane and temporal as a means of giving people the transcendent and eternal
some have extended this view to include the idea of a presence that is in the realm of spirit and eternity and not to be about corporeal fleshiness
during the oxford movement of the th century tractarians advanced a belief in the real objective presence of christ in the eucharist but maintained that the details of how he is present remain mystery of faith a view also held by the orthodox church and methodist church
indeed one of the oldest anglo catholic devotional societies the confraternity of the blessed sacrament was founded largely to promote belief in the real objective presence of christ in the eucharist
from some anglican perspectives the real presence of christ in the holy eucharist does not imply that jesus christ is present materially or locally
this is in accord with the standard roman catholic view as expressed for instance by st
thomas aquinas who while saying that the whole christ is present in the sacrament also said that this presence was not as in a place
real does not mean material the lack of the latter does not imply the absence of the former
the eucharist is not intrinsic to christ as a body part is to a body but extrinsic as his instrument to convey divine grace
some anglicans see this understanding as compatible with different theories of christ s presence a corporeal presence consubstantation or pneumatic presence without getting involved in the mechanics of change or trying to explain a mystery of god s own doing
anglican and roman catholic theologians participating in the first anglican roman catholic international commission arcic i declared that they had reached substantial agreement on the doctrine of the eucharist
this claim was accepted by the lambeth conference of anglican bishops resolution but firmly questioned in the official roman catholic response to the final report of arcic i of
the followers of john wesley have typically affirmed that the sacrament of holy communion is an instrumental means of grace through which the real presence of christ is communicated to the believer but have otherwise allowed the details to remain a mystery
in particular methodists reject the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation see article xviii of the articles of religion the primitive methodist church in its discipline also rejects the lollardist doctrine of consubstantiation
in the united methodist church affirmed its view of the sacrament and its belief in the real presence in an official document entitled this holy mystery a united methodist understanding of holy communion archived april at the wayback machine
of particular note here is the church s unequivocal recognition of the anamnesis as more than just a memorial but rather a re presentation of christ jesus and his love
holy communion is remembrance commemoration and memorial but this remembrance is much more than simply intellectual recalling
do this in remembrance of me luke corinthians is anamnesis the biblical greek word
this dynamic action becomes re presentation of past gracious acts of god in the present so powerfully as to make them truly present now
christ is risen and is alive here and now not just remembered for what was done in the past in conformity with the sunday service of the methodists methodism s first liturgical text in congregations of the allegheny wesleyan methodist connection african methodist episcopal zion church bethel methodist church congregational methodist church evangelical methodist church evangelical wesleyan church first bible holiness church first congregational methodist church free methodist church lumber river conference of the holiness methodist church metropolitan church association pilgrim holiness church among many other methodist connexions the presider says the following when delivering the eucharistic elements to each of the faithful which is reflective of the methodist teachings of the real presence of christ in the lord s supper and the lord s supper being a sacramental means of grace
this affirmation of real presence is also illustrated in the language of the united methodist eucharistic liturgy where in the epiclesis of the great thanksgiving the celebrating minister prays over the elements
pour out your holy spirit on us gathered here and on these gifts of bread and wine
make them be for us the body and blood of christ that we may be for the world the body of christ redeemed by his blood methodists assert that jesus is truly present and that the means of his presence is a holy mystery
the communion hymn come sinners to the gospel feast by methodist divine charles wesley includes the following stanza and is often sung during methodist services of worship in which the lord s supper is celebrated
come and partake the gospel feast
be saved from sin in jesus rest
o taste the goodness of our god
and eat his flesh and drink his blood the distinctive feature of the methodist doctrine of the real presence is that the way christ manifests his presence in the eucharist is a sacred mystery the focus is that christ is truly present in the sacrament
the discipline of the free methodist church thus teaches
many within the holiness pentecostal tradition which is largely wesleyan arminian in theology as are the methodist churches also affirm this understanding of the real presence of christ in the eucharist
nicolaus zinzendorf a bishop of the moravian church stated that holy communion is the most intimate of all connection with the person of the saviour the moravian church adheres to a view known as the sacramental presence teaching that in the sacrament of holy communion
those in the reformed tradition inclusive of continental reformed presbyterian congregationalist reformed anglican and reformed baptist churches particularly those following john calvin hold that the reality of christ s body and blood do not come corporally physically to the elements but that the spirit truly unites things separated in space calvin
this view is known as the real spiritual presence spiritual presence or pneumatic presence of christ in the lord s supper
following a phrase of saint augustine the calvinist view is that no one bears away from this sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith
the flesh and blood of christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to god s elect believers calvin said but those who partake by faith receive benefit from christ and the unbelieving are condemned by partaking
by faith not a mere mental apprehension and in the holy spirit the partaker beholds god incarnate and in the same sense touches him with hands so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine christ s presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in
this view holds that the elements may be disposed of without ceremony as they are not changed in an objective physical sense and as such the meal directs attention toward christ s bodily resurrection and return
actual practices of disposing of leftover elements vary widely
the reformed doctrine of holy communion the lord s supper the eucharist is the belief in the real presence penumatic in the sacrament and that it is a holy mystery
reformed theology has traditionally taught that jesus body is seated in heaven at the right hand of god therefore his body is not physically present in the elements nor do the elements turn into his body in a physical or any objective sense
however reformed theology has also historically taught that when the holy communion is received not only the spirit but also the true body and blood of jesus christ are received through the spirit but these are only received by those partakers who eat worthily i e repentantly with faith
the holy spirit unites the christian with jesus though they are separated by a great distance

belgic confession article
the congregationalist theologian alfred ernest garvie explicated the congregationalist belief regarding the pneumatic presence in the holy catholic church from the congregational point of view
the baptist confession of faith in which reformed baptists believe affirms the lord s supper to be a means of spiritual nourishment and growth stating
in three denominations which historically held to a reformed view of the supper the reformed church in america the united church of christ and the presbyterian church u s a representative of the continental reformed congregationalist and presbyterian traditions signed a formula of agreement with the evangelical lutheran church in america a document which stressed that the theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel mutual affirmation and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the gospel mutual admonition a common calling page hence in seeking to come to consensus about the real presence see open communion the churches have affirmed the real spiritual presence of christ in the lord s supper
edward irving who founded the irvingian churches such as the new apostolic church taught the real presence of christ in the eucharist irving insisted on the real presence of the humiliated humanity of christ in the lord s supper the catholic apostolic church has thus held to the doctrine of the real presence of christ with regard to the elements in the communion service the catechism of the new apostolic church the largest of the irvingian denominations teaches
huldrych zwingli a swiss reformer taught
those who adhere to the zwinglian view do so at jesus s words about doing this in remembrance rather than any transformation or any physical presence
rather christ is really present at the thanksgiving and in the memory
zwingli s words that the true body of christ is eaten in a sacramental and spiritual manner is understood in a way where the physical objects and actions are the spiritual reminder of what jesus had done that he has instituted
this comes from the belief that the historical understanding of the early church taught that sacraments are done in contemplation of faith as the proclamation of salvation and the strengthening of faith in the hearts of believers
general baptists anabaptists the plymouth brethren some non denominational churches see communion also called the lord s supper or the lord s table as signifying the body and blood of jesus a memorial of the last supper and the passion with symbolic and meaningful elements which is done by the ordinance of jesus
this view is known as memorialism or the zwinglian view as it was taught by zwingli a swiss reformer
those who hold to the memorial understanding deny the strong sense of transubstantiation as articulated by lanfranc in the th century arguing more akin to berengarius who was a symbolist
it is pointed out that while early church fathers used the language of real presence this is not similar to a hard understanding of transubstantiation
rather interpreting in the context of other early church father writings those who emphasize the symbolic nature of the eucharist point out the symbolic language used by tertullian cyprian and others noting a differentiation between the real presence of christ being used to mean a bodily presence
further it is understood that the dispute arose much later in the th and th centuries about the nature of the eucharist
anabaptists affirm that communion is a memorial and locate the presence of jesus not in the elements themselves but teach that the mystery of communion with the living christ in his supper comes into being by the power of the spirit dwelling in and working through the collected members of christ s body
as such in celebrations of the eucharist anabaptist congregations looked to the living christ in their hearts and in their midst who transformed members and elements together into a mysterious communion creating his body in many members ground like grains and crushed like grapes into one bread and one drink
many christian churches holding to a doctrine of the real presence of christ in the eucharist for example catholic eastern orthodox lutheran moravian anglican methodist oriental orthodox reformed and irvingian reserve to ordained clergy the function of consecrating the eucharist but not necessarily that of distributing the elements to communicants
others do not speak of ordination but still reserve these functions to leaders who are given titles such as pastor elder and deacon
