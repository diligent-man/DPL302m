the school s official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to when unlv adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a confederate uniform
scarlet and gray were traditional colors of the confederacy with its gray uniforms and red based flag

named one of all american mascots he competed for the title of capital one mascot of the year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting

unlv s mascot is based on the university s split from their literal northern rival university of nevada reno and not on any direct reference to the actual confederacy
as unlv was once a southern campus of the university of nevada reno when it became its own university unlv was seen as literally the south splitting from the north
unlv had been seen as the little brother to unr for quite some time even though las vegas has always been the more densely populated city of the two
