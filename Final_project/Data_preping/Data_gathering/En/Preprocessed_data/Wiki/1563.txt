In statistics originally in geostatistics kriging or Kriging also known as Gaussian process regression is a method of interpolation based on Gaussian process governed by prior covariances Under suitable assumptions of the prior kriging gives the best linear unbiased prediction BLUP at unsampled locations Interpolating methods based on other criteria such as smoothness eg smoothing spline may not yield the BLUP The method is widely used in the domain of spatial analysis and computer experiments The technique is also known as Wiener Kolmogorov prediction after Norbert Wiener and Andrey Kolmogorov
The theoretical basis for the method was developed by the French mathematician Georges Matheron in based on the master's thesis of Danie G Krige the pioneering plotter of distance weighted average gold grades at the Witwatersrand reef complex in South Africa Krige sought to estimate the most likely distribution of gold based on samples from a few boreholes The English verb is to krige and the most common noun is kriging both are often pronounced with a hard g following an Anglicized pronunciation of the name Krige The word is sometimes capitalized as Kriging in the literature
Though computationally intensive in its basic formulation kriging can be scaled to larger problems using various approximation methods
Kriging predicts the value of a function at a given point by computing a weighted average of the known values of the function in the neighborhood of the point The method is closely related to regression analysis Both theories derive a best linear unbiased estimator based on assumptions on covariances make use of Gauss Markov theorem to prove independence of the estimate and error and use very similar formulae Even so they are useful in different frameworks kriging is made for estimation of a single realization of a random field while regression models are based on multiple observations of a multivariate data set
The kriging estimation may also be seen as a spline in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with the reproducing kernel given by the covariance function The difference with the classical kriging approach is provided by the interpretation while the spline is motivated by a minimum norm interpolation based on a Hilbert space structure kriging is motivated by an expected squared prediction error based on a stochastic model
Kriging with polynomial trend surfaces is mathematically identical to generalized least squares polynomial curve fitting
Kriging can also be understood as a form of Bayesian inference Kriging starts with a prior distribution over functions This prior takes the form of a Gaussian process
samples from a function will be normally distributed where the covariance between any two samples is the covariance function or kernel of the Gaussian process evaluated at the spatial location of two points A set of values is then observed each value associated with a spatial location Now a new value can be predicted at any new spatial location by combining the Gaussian prior with a Gaussian likelihood function for each of the observed values The resulting posterior distribution is also Gaussian with a mean and covariance that can be simply computed from the observed values their variance and the kernel matrix derived from the prior
In geostatistical models sampled data are interpreted as the result of a random process The fact that these models incorporate uncertainty in their conceptualization doesn't mean that the phenomenon the forest the aquifer the mineral deposit has resulted from a random process but rather it allows one to build a methodological basis for the spatial inference of quantities in unobserved locations and to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimator
A stochastic process is in the context of this model simply a way to approach the set of data collected from the samples The first step in geostatistical modulation is to create a random process that best describes the set of observed data
generic denomination of a set of geographic coordinates is interpreted as a realization
where the set of samples is dispersed there are
The set of random variables constitutes a random function of which only one realization is known the set
of observed data With only one realization of each random variable it's theoretically impossible to determine any statistical parameter of the individual variables or the function The proposed solution in the geostatistical formalism consists in assuming various degrees of stationarity in the random function in order to make the inference of some statistic values possible
For instance if one assumes based on the homogeneity of samples in area
where the variable is distributed the hypothesis that the first moment is stationary ie all random variables have the same mean then one is assuming that the mean can be estimated by the arithmetic mean of sampled values
The hypothesis of stationarity related to the second moment is defined in the following way the correlation between two random variables solely depends on the spatial distance between them and is independent of their location Thus if
displaystyle Cbig ZxZxbig =Cbig ZxiZxi+mathbf h big =Ch
displaystyle gamma big ZxZxbig =gamma big ZxiZxi+mathbf h big =gamma h
This hypothesis allows one to infer those two measures the variogram and the covariogram
displaystyle gamma h=frac Nhsum ijin Nhbig Zxi Zxjbig
displaystyle Ch=frac Nhsum ijin Nhbig Zxi mhbig big Zxj mhbig
denotes the set of pairs of observations
is the number of pairs in the setIn this set
denote the same element Generally an approximate distance
is used implemented using a certain tolerance
Spatial inference or estimation of a quantity

is calculated from a linear combination of the observed values
displaystyle hat Zx=beginbmatrixwwcdots wNendbmatrixcdot beginbmatrixzzvdots zNendbmatrix=sum i=nwixtimes Zxi
are intended to summarize two extremely important procedures in a spatial inference process
reflect the structural proximity of samples to the estimation location
at the same time they should have a desegregation effect in order to avoid bias caused by eventual sample clustersWhen calculating the weights
there are two objectives in the geostatistical formalism unbias and minimal variance of estimation
the criterion for global unbias intrinsic stationarity or wide sense stationarity of the field implies that the mean of the estimations must be equal to mean of the real values
The second criterion says that the mean of the squared deviations
must be minimal which means that when the cloud of estimated values versus the cloud real values is more disperse the estimator is more imprecise
Depending on the stochastic properties of the random field and the various degrees of stationarity assumed different methods for calculating the weights can be deduced ie different types of kriging apply Classical methods are
Ordinary kriging assumes constant unknown mean only over the search neighborhood of
Simple kriging assumes stationarity of the first moment over the entire domain with a known mean
Universal kriging assumes a general polynomial trend model such as linear trend model
Indicator kriging uses indicator functions instead of the process itself in order to estimate transition probabilities
Multiple indicator kriging is a version of indicator kriging working with a family of indicators Initially MIK showed considerable promise as a new method that could more accurately estimate overall global mineral deposit concentrations or grades However these benefits have been outweighed by other inherent problems of practicality in modelling due to the inherently large block sizes used and also the lack of mining scale resolution Conditional simulation is fast becoming the accepted replacement technique in this case
Disjunctive kriging is a nonlinear generalisation of kriging
Log normal kriging interpolates positive data by means of logarithms
Latent kriging assumes the various krigings on the latent level second stage of the nonlinear mixed effects model to produce a spatial functional prediction This technique is useful when analyzing a spatial functional data
is a spatial location longitude latitude of the
Co kriging denotes the joint kriging of data from multiple sources with a relationship between the different data sources Co kriging is also possible in a Bayesian approach
Bayesian kriging departs from the optimization of unknown coefficients and hyperparameters which is understood as a Maximum Likelihood estimate from the Bayesian perspective Instead the coefficients and hyperparameters are estimated from their expectation valuesAn advantage of Bayesian kriging is that it allows to quantify the evidence for and the uncertainty of the kriging emulator If the emulator is employed to propagate uncertainties the quality of the kriging emulator can be assessed by comparing the emulator uncertainty to the total uncertainty see also Bayesian Polynomial Chaos Bayesian kriging can also be mixed with co krigingThe unknown value
is interpreted as a random variable located in
as well as the values of neighbors samples
is also interpreted as a random variable located in
a result of the linear combination of variables
In order to deduce the kriging system for the assumptions of the model the following error committed while estimating
displaystyle epsilon x=hat Zx Zx=beginbmatrixWT endbmatrixcdot beginbmatrixZxcdots ZxNZxendbmatrixT=sum i=Nwixtimes Zxi Zx
The two quality criteria referred to previously can now be expressed in terms of the mean and variance of the new random variable
Lack of biasSince the random function is stationary
displaystyle Leftrightarrow msum i=Nwix m=Leftrightarrow sum i=Nwix=Leftrightarrow mathbf Tcdot W=
In order to ensure that the model is unbiased the weights must sum to one
but the dispersion around their mean determines the difference between the quality of estimators To find an estimator with minimum variance we need to minimize
displaystyle beginalignedoperatorname Var epsilon x=operatorname Var leftbeginbmatrixWT endbmatrixcdot beginbmatrixZxcdots ZxNZxendbmatrixTright=beginbmatrixWT endbmatrixcdot operatorname Var leftbeginbmatrixZxcdots ZxNZxendbmatrixTrightcdot beginbmatrixW endbmatrixendaligned

Once defined the covariance model or variogram
valid in all field of analysis of
then we can write an expression for the estimation variance of any estimator in function of the covariance between the samples and the covariances between the samples and the point to estimate
displaystyle begincasesoperatorname Var big epsilon xbig =WTcdot operatorname Var xicdot W operatorname Cov xixTcdot W WTcdot operatorname Cov xix+operatorname Var xoperatorname Var big epsilon xbig =operatorname Cov +sum isum jwiwjoperatorname Cov xixj sum iwiCxixendcases
Some conclusions can be asserted from this expression The variance of estimation
is not quantifiable to any linear estimator once the stationarity of the mean and of the spatial covariances or variograms are assumed
grows when the covariance between the samples and the point to estimate decreases This means that when the samples are farther away from
when the variable is less disperse the variance is lower in any point of the area
does not depend on the values of the samples which means that the same spatial configuration with the same geometrical relations between samples and the point to estimate always reproduces the same estimation variance in any part of the area
this way the variance does not measure the uncertainty of estimation produced by the local variableSystem of equations

is a Lagrange multiplier used in the minimization of the kriging error
Simple kriging is mathematically the simplest but the least general It assumes the expectation of the random field is known and relies on a covariance function However in most applications neither the expectation nor the covariance are known beforehand
The practical assumptions for the application of simple kriging are
Wide sense stationarity of the field variance stationary
The covariance function is a crucial design choice since it stipulates the properties of the Gaussian process and thereby the behaviour of the model The covariance function encodes information about for instance smoothness and periodicity which is reflected in the estimate produced A very common covariance function is the squared exponential which heavily favours smooth function estimates For this reason it can produce poor estimates in many real world applications especially when the true underlying function contains discontinuities and rapid changes
System of equationsThe kriging weights of simple kriging have no unbiasedness condition and are given by the simple kriging equation system
displaystyle beginpmatrixwvdots wnendpmatrix=beginpmatrixcxxcdots cxxnvdots ddots vdots cxnxcdots cxnxnendpmatrix beginpmatrixcxxvdots cxnxendpmatrix
This is analogous to a linear regression of
EstimationThe interpolation by simple kriging is given by
displaystyle hat Zx=beginpmatrixzvdots znendpmatrix'beginpmatrixcxxcdots cxxnvdots ddots vdots cxnxcdots cxnxnendpmatrix beginpmatrixcxxvdots cxnxendpmatrix
displaystyle operatorname Var big hat Zx Zxbig =underbrace cxx operatorname Var big Zxbig underbrace beginpmatrixcxxvdots cxnxendpmatrix'beginpmatrixcxxcdots cxxnvdots ddots vdots cxnxcdots cxnxnendpmatrix beginpmatrixcxxvdots cxnxendpmatrix operatorname Var big hat Zxbig
which leads to the generalised least squares version of the Gauss Markov theorem Chiles Delfiner p

The kriging estimation honors the actually observed value
is the best linear unbiased estimator of
if the assumptions hold However eg Cressie
As with any method if the assumptions do not hold kriging might be bad
There might be better nonlinear andor biased methods
No properties are guaranteed when the wrong variogram is used However typically still a good interpolation is achieved
Best is not necessarily good eg in case of no spatial dependence the kriging interpolation is only as good as the arithmetic mean
as a measure of precision However this measure relies on the correctness of the variogramAlthough kriging was developed originally for applications in geostatistics it is a general method of statistical interpolation and can be applied within any discipline to sampled data from random fields that satisfy the appropriate mathematical assumptions It can be used where spatially related data has been collected in D or D and estimates of fill in data are desired in the locations spatial gaps between the actual measurements
To date kriging has been used in a variety of disciplines including the following
Prediction of oil production curve of shale oil wellsAnother very important and rapidly growing field of application in engineering is the interpolation of data coming out as response variables of deterministic computer simulations eg finite element method FEM simulations In this case kriging is used as a metamodeling tool ie a black box model built over a designed set of computer experiments In many practical engineering problems such as the design of a metal forming process a single FEM simulation might be several hours or even a few days long It is therefore more efficient to design and run a limited number of computer simulations and then use a kriging interpolator to rapidly predict the response in any other design point Kriging is therefore used very often as a so called surrogate model implemented inside optimization routines
