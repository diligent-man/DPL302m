Treaty ports Chinese Japanese were the port cities in China and Japan that were opened to foreign trade mainly by the unequal treaties forced upon them by Western powers as well as cities in Korea opened up similarly by the Japanese Empire
The British established their first treaty ports in China after the First Opium War by the Treaty of Nanking in
As well as ceding the island of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom in perpetuity the treaty also established five treaty ports at Shanghai Canton Guangzhou Ningpo Ningbo Foochow Fuzhou and Amoy Xiamen
The following year the Chinese and British signed the Treaty of the Bogue which added provisions for extraterritoriality and the most favored nation status for the latter country
Subsequent negotiations with the Americans Treaty of Wanghia and the French Treaty of Whampoa led to further concessions for these nations on the same terms as the British
The second group of treaty ports was set up following the end of the Arrow War in and eventually more than treaty ports were established in China alone involving many foreign powers
Foreigners all lived in prestigious sections newly built for them on the edges of existing port cities
They enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the unequal treaties
Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers such as in the concessions in China effectively removing them from the control of local governments
Western images of the Chinese treaty ports focus on the distinctive geography of the bund a long narrow strip of land in a prime location on the waterfront where the businesses offices warehouses and residences of all foreigners were located
The Shanghai Bund was the largest and most famous
The North Riverbank in Ningbo nowadays known as the Old Bund was the first in China opening in years before the Shanghai bund
A typical bund contained British German French American Japanese and other nationals
The bund was a self-governing operation with its shops restaurants recreational facilities parks churches courts police and local government
The facilities were generally off-limits to the natives
The British who by far dominated foreign trade with China normally were the largest presence
Businessmen and officials typically brought their own families with them and stayed for years but sent their older children back to England for education
Officially the foreign powers were not allowed to station military units in the bund but in practice there often was a warship or two in the harbor
The treaty port system in China lasted approximately one hundred years
The major powers involved were the British the French and the Americans although by the end of the th century all the major powers were involved
The system effectively ended when Japan took control of most of the ports in the late s the Russians relinquished their treaty rights in the wake of the Russian revolution in and the Germans were expelled in
The three main treaty powers the British the Americans and the French continued to hold their concessions and extraterritorial jurisdictions until the Second World War
This ended when the Japanese stormed into their concessions in late
They formally relinquished their treaty rights in a new equal treaties agreement with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government in exile in Chungking in
The international communities that were residues of the treaty port era ended in the late s when the communists took over and nearly all foreigners left
Although the great majority of Chinese lived in traditional rural areas a handful of booming treaty port cities became vibrant centers that had an enormous long-term impact on the Chinese economy and society
Above all Shanghai became the dominant urban center
Tianjin and Shenyang followed Hong Kong although a British colony not a treaty port was similar
Foreigners were welcomed and had stable safe bases as did Christian missionaries
Outside the ports the only foreigners were occasional Christian missionaries and they often encountered serious difficulties
The other cities that became treaty ports between and were of minor importance
The Shanghai International Settlement rapidly developed into one of the world's most modern cities often compared to Paris Berlin and London
It set the standard of modernity for China and all of East Asia
In Shanghai the British and American settlements combined in into an international settlement with the French settlement operated separately nearby
The foreigners took out long-term leases on the land and set up factories offices warehouses sanitation police gardens restaurants hotels banks and private clubs
The Shanghai Municipal Council was created in with nine members who were elected by three dozen foreign landowners at first and by about electors in the s
Chinese residents comprised of the total population of Shanghai but complained about taxation without representation
Eventually the Council admitted five Chinese representatives
The European community promoted technological and economic innovation as well as knowledge industries that proved especially attractive to Chinese entrepreneurs as models for their cities across the growing nation
First of all they were the major port of entry for all imports and exports - except for opium which was handled by smugglers in other cities
Foreign entrepreneurs introduce the latest European manufacturing techniques providing a model followed sooner or later by all of China
The first establishments focused on shipbuilding ship repair railway repair and factories producing textiles matches porcelain flour and machinery
Tobacco cigarettes textiles and food products were the specialty in Canton
Financing was handled by branch banks as well as entirely new operations such as HSBC -the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which remains a world-class establishment into the st century
Across the modernizing world railway construction was a major financial and industrial endeavor usually led by the British
Investments now poured into building a railway-plus-telegraph system knitting China together connecting the treaty ports and other major cities as well as mining districts and agricultural centers
Chinese entrepreneurs learned their skills in the port cities and soon applied for and received bank loans for their startups
Chinese merchants headquartered there set up branches across Southeast Asia including British Singapore and Malaya the Dutch East Indies French Indochina and the American Philippines
The information industry flourished in the port cities with printing shops newspapers magazines and pamphlets in Chinese and European languages
Book publishers often featured Chinese translations of European classics in philosophy politics literature and social issues
This vast network with Shanghai as its center spurred the transformation of the Chinese urban population
In their thoughts tastes and daily activities the educated and affluent groups of the urban population began to abandon traditional ways of living and started to embrace what they saw as modern lifestylesChristian missionaries saw all of the Chinese population as their target audience but they were headquartered in the port cities
The missionaries had very modest success in the conversion of the Chinese population but discovered they became widely popular for setting up medical and educational facilities
For example St John's University in Shanghai - first set up faculties of theology Western learning and Chinese languages then expanded to cover literature science medicine and intense coverage of Western languages eagerly sought by the ambitious Chinese intellectuals and entrepreneurs who had rejected the old Confucian exam system for the Western model of modernity
Engineering schools were established as well and by a network of universities colleges teacher training schools and specialized industrial schools was headquartered in the Port cities and diffusing their alumni across urban China
Many adopted ideas and used the facilities newly opened to them to network with each other set up organizations and publications and plot a revolution against the Qing government
Aggressive Japanese moves to dominate China in World War I caused a strong backlash of nationalism in the May Fourth Movement which focused its ire not just on Japan but also on the entire port city system as emblematic of imperialism that should no longer be tolerated
The national government had almost no police power in the port cities allowing secret societies to flourish in the Chinese community some of which turned into criminal gangs
Eventually Shanghai had a strong underground illegal underworld that was ready to employ violence

The treaty with the United States was followed by similar ones with Britain the Netherlands Russia and France
The ports permitted legal extraterritoriality for citizens of the treaty nations
The system of treaty ports ended in Japan in the year as a consequence of Japan's rapid transition to a modern nation
Japan had sought treaty revision earnestly and in signed a new treaty with Britain which revised or abrogated the previous unequal treaty
The new treaties came into force in July
Following the Ganghwa Treaty of the Korean kingdom of Joseon agreed to the opening of three strategic ports and the extension of legal extraterritoriality to merchants from Meiji Japan
