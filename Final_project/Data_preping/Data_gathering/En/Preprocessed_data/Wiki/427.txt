The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is an autonomous body responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India
It reports to the Department of Agricultural Research and Education, Ministry of Agriculture
The Union Minister of Agriculture serves as its president
It is the largest network of agricultural research and education institutes in the world.
The committee to Advise on Renovation and Rejuvenation of Higher Education (Yashpal Committee, 2009) has recommended setting up of a constitutional body – the National Commission for Higher Education and Research – which would be a unified supreme body to regulate all branches of higher education including agricultural education
Presently, regulation of agricultural education is the mandate of ICAR, Veterinary Council of India (Veterinary sub-discipline) and Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (Forestry sub-discipline).
2006: ICAR represented in the First Governing Body of the FAO Seed Treaty (ITPGRFA) in Madrid, Spain.
2006: ICAR developed a vaccine against bird flu
The vaccine was developed at the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, the only facility in the country to conduct tests for the H5N1 variant of bird flu
It was entrusted with the task of developing a vaccine by the ICAR after the Avian Influenza outbreak in February.
2007: Launch of US - India Agricultural Knowledge Initiative.
2008: India-Brazil-South Africa Joint Working Group on Agriculture Initiated.

It was an indigenous effort by 31 scientists led by Nagendra Kumar Singh of NRCPB
The first draft of the sequence was published in J

ICAR provides accreditation to agriculture universities, colleges and programmes, through its accreditation unit, National Agricultural Education Accreditation Board (NAEAB)
The board was established in 1996  and given its current name in 2017
The accreditation serves only as a badge of quality assurance
It is not mandatory, is not a form of affiliation or recognition and does not give approval to open an institute or a program
As of 1 April 2021, NAEAB lists only 39 accredited institutes.
While ICAR accreditation is voluntary, since 2016-17 it is linked with the release of grants for education quality assurance for State Agricultural Universities
It is also used by some institutes as an affiliation or admission requirements
In September 2021, Goa University has reinstated affiliation to a college, after previously cancelling the affiliation because the college was not accredited by NAEAB
In 2022, students were not accepted to master's degree at Rajiv Gandhi University because their B.Sc
in Agriculture degree was from an unaccredited private university.
