In mathematics a first-order partial differential equation is a partial differential equation that involves only first derivatives of the unknown function of n variables
Such equations arise in the construction of characteristic surfaces for hyperbolic partial differential equations in the calculus of variations in some geometrical problems and in simple models for gas dynamics whose solution involves the method of characteristics
of a single first-order partial differential equation can be found then additional solutions may be obtained by forming envelopes of solutions in that family
In a related procedure general solutions may be obtained by integrating families of ordinary differential equations
The general solution to the first order partial differential equation is a solution which contains an arbitrary function
But the solution to the first order partial differential equations with as many arbitrary constants as the number of independent variables is called the complete integral
The below discussions on the type of integrals are based on the textbook A Treatise on Differential Equations Chaper IX th edition by Andrew Forsyth
The solutions are described in relatively simple manner in two or three dimensions with which the key concepts are trivially extended to higher dimensions
A general first-order partial differential equation in three dimensions has the form
be the complete integral that contains three arbitrary constants
From this we can obtain three relations by differentiation
the above three relations can be used to eliminate three constants and obtain an equation original partial differential equation relating
Note that the elimination of constants leading to the partial differential equation need not be unique ie two different equations can result in the same complete integral for example elimination of constants from the relation
Once a complete integral is found a general solution can be constructed from it
The general integral is obtained by making the constants functions of the coordinates ie
These functions are chosen such that the forms of
are unaltered so that the elimination process from complete integral can be utilized
Differentiation of the complete integral now provides
displaystyle phi x+pphi u=-axphi a+bxphi b+cxphi c
displaystyle phi y+qphi u=-ayphi a+byphi b+cyphi c
displaystyle phi z+rphi u=-azphi a+bzphi b+czphi c
in which we require the right-hand side terms of all the three equations to vanish identically so that elimination of
This requirement can be written more compactly by writing it as
displaystyle Jphi a=quad Jphi b=quad Jphi c=
then there exists a functional relation between
because whenever a determinant is zero the columns or rows are not linearly independent
from the two equations derived we obtain
displaystyle phi a+phi cpsi ada+phi b+phi cpsi bdb=
The above two equations can be used to solve
Thus a general integral describes a relation between
zero but this is not always needed
displaystyle phi a=quad phi b=quad phi c=
The three equations can be used to solve the three unknowns
this way leads to what are called singular integrals
Usually most integrals fall into three categories defined above but it may happen that a solution does not fit into any of three types of integrals mentioned above
that satisfies the partial differential equation is said to a special integral if we are unable to determine
from the above set of equations then
will turn out to be one of the three integrals described before
The complete integral in two-dimensional space can be written as
The general integral is obtained by eliminating
displaystyle phi xyzapsi a=quad phi a+psi aphi b=
The singular integral if it exists can be obtained by eliminating
displaystyle phi xyzab=quad phi a=quad phi b=
If a complete integral is not available solutions may still be obtained by solving a system of ordinary equations
To obtain this system first note that the PDE determines a cone analogous to the light cone at each point if the PDE is linear in the derivatives of u it is quasi-linear then the cone degenerates into a line
In the general case the pairs pq that satisfy the equation determine a family of planes at a given point
The envelope of these planes is a cone or a line if the PDE is quasi-linear
and dp and dq are increments of p and q that satisfy F=
Hence the generator of the cone is a line with direction
This direction corresponds to the light rays for the wave equation
To integrate differential equations along these directions we require increments for p and q along the ray
This can be obtained by differentiating the PDE
The integration of these equations leads to a ray conoid at each point
General solutions of the PDE can then be obtained from envelopes of such conoids
Two definitions of linear dependence are given for first-order linear partial differential equations
displaystyle leftbeginarraycsum limits ijaijdfrac partial yjpartial xi+f=vdots sum limits ijaijndfrac partial yjpartial xi+fn=endarrayright
textstyle Zkequiv sum ijaijkfrac partial yjpartial xi+fk
textstyle sum kckZk+sum kldklfrac partial partial xlZk=
the Eqs are thought as differential linear dependent
this definition degenerates into the definition I
The div-curl systems Maxwell's equations Einstein's equations with four harmonic coordinates and
Yang-Mills equations with gauge conditions are well-determined in definition II whereas are over-determined in definition I
Characteristic surfaces for the wave equation are level surfaces for solutions of the equation
There is little loss of generality if we set
A family of solutions with planes as level surfaces is given by
displaystyle uvec x=vec pcdot vec x-vec x
displaystyle vec p=frac cquad textandquad vec xquad textis arbitrary
If x and x are held fixed the envelope of these solutions is obtained by finding a point on the sphere of radius c where the value of u is stationary
displaystyle uvec x=pm frac cvec x-vec x
These solutions correspond to spheres whose radius grows or shrinks with velocity c
The initial value problem for this equation consists in specifying a level surface S where u= for t=
The solution is obtained by taking the envelope of all the spheres with centers on S whose radii grow with velocity c
This envelope is obtained by requiring that
displaystyle frac cvec x-vec xquad hboxis stationary forquad vec xin S
Thus the envelope corresponds to motion with velocity c along each normal to S
This is the Huygens' construction of wave fronts each point on S emits a spherical wave at time t= and the wave front at a later time t is the envelope of these spherical waves
The normals to S are the light rays
