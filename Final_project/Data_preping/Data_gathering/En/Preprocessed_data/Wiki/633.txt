In mathematics, a first-order partial differential equation is a partial differential equation that involves only first derivatives of the unknown function of n variables
The equation takes the form
F
(
x
1
,
…
,
x
n
,
u
,
u
x
1
,
…
u
x
n
)
=
0.
{\displaystyle F(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n},u,u_{x_{1}},\ldots u_{x_{n}})=0.\,}
Such equations arise in the construction of characteristic surfaces for hyperbolic partial differential equations, in the calculus of variations, in some geometrical problems, and in simple models for gas dynamics whose solution involves the method of characteristics
If a family of solutions
of a single first-order partial differential equation can be found, then additional solutions may be obtained by forming envelopes of solutions in that family
In a related procedure, general solutions may be obtained by integrating families of ordinary differential equations.
The general solution to the first order partial differential equation is a solution which contains an arbitrary function
But, the solution to the first order partial differential equations with as many arbitrary constants as the number of independent variables is called the complete integral
The following n-parameter family of solutions
ϕ
(
x
1
,
x
2
,
…
,
x
n
,
u
,
a
1
,
a
2
,
…
,
a
n
)
{\displaystyle \phi (x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n},u,a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n})}
is a complete integral if
det
|
ϕ
x
i
a
j
|
≠
0
{\displaystyle {\text{det}}|\phi _{x_{i}a_{j}}|\neq 0}
The below discussions on the type of integrals are based on the textbook A Treatise on Differential Equations (Chaper IX, 6th edition, 1928) by Andrew Forsyth.
The solutions are described in relatively simple manner in two or three dimensions with which the key concepts are trivially extended to higher dimensions
A general first-order partial differential equation in three dimensions has the form
F
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
u
,
p
,
q
,
r
)
=
0
,
{\displaystyle F(x,y,z,u,p,q,r)=0,\,}
where
p
=
u
x
,
q
=
u
y
,
r
=
u
z
.
{\displaystyle p=u_{x},\,q=u_{y},\,r=u_{z}.}
Suppose
ϕ
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
u
,
a
,
b
,
c
)
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi (x,y,z,u,a,b,c)=0}
be the complete integral that contains three arbitrary constants
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
From this we can obtain three relations by differentiation
ϕ
x
+
p
ϕ
u
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi _{x}+p\phi _{u}=0}
ϕ
y
+
q
ϕ
u
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi _{y}+q\phi _{u}=0}
ϕ
z
+
r
ϕ
u
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi _{z}+r\phi _{u}=0}
Along with the complete integral
ϕ
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi =0}
, the above three relations can be used to eliminate three constants and obtain an equation (original partial differential equation) relating
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
u
,
p
,
q
,
r
)
{\displaystyle (x,y,z,u,p,q,r)}
Note that the elimination of constants leading to the partial differential equation need not be unique, i.e., two different equations can result in the same complete integral, for example, elimination of constants from the relation
u
=
(
x
−
a
)
2
+
(
y
−
b
)
2
+
z
−
c
{\displaystyle u={\sqrt {(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}}}+z-c}
leads to
p
2
+
q
2
=
1
{\displaystyle p^{2}+q^{2}=1}
and
r
=
1
{\displaystyle r=1}
.
Once a complete integral is found, a general solution can be constructed from it
The general integral is obtained by making the constants functions of the coordinates, i.e.,
a
=
a
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
,
b
=
b
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
,
c
=
c
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
{\displaystyle a=a(x,y,z),\,b=b(x,y,z),\,c=c(x,y,z)}
These functions are chosen such that the forms of
(
p
,
q
,
r
)
{\displaystyle (p,q,r)}
are unaltered so that the elimination process from complete integral can be utilized
Differentiation of the complete integral now provides
ϕ
x
+
p
ϕ
u
=
−
(
a
x
ϕ
a
+
b
x
ϕ
b
+
c
x
ϕ
c
)
{\displaystyle \phi _{x}+p\phi _{u}=-(a_{x}\phi _{a}+b_{x}\phi _{b}+c_{x}\phi _{c})}
ϕ
y
+
q
ϕ
u
=
−
(
a
y
ϕ
a
+
b
y
ϕ
b
+
c
y
ϕ
c
)
{\displaystyle \phi _{y}+q\phi _{u}=-(a_{y}\phi _{a}+b_{y}\phi _{b}+c_{y}\phi _{c})}
ϕ
z
+
r
ϕ
u
=
−
(
a
z
ϕ
a
+
b
z
ϕ
b
+
c
z
ϕ
c
)
{\displaystyle \phi _{z}+r\phi _{u}=-(a_{z}\phi _{a}+b_{z}\phi _{b}+c_{z}\phi _{c})}
in which we require the right-hand side terms of all the three equations to vanish identically so that elimination of
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
from
ϕ
{\displaystyle \phi }
results in the partial differential equation
This requirement can be written more compactly by writing it as
J
ϕ
a
=
0
,
J
ϕ
b
=
0
,
J
ϕ
c
=
0
{\displaystyle J\phi _{a}=0,\quad J\phi _{b}=0,\quad J\phi _{c}=0}
where
J
=
∂
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
∂
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
|
a

{\displaystyle J={\frac {\partial (a,b,c)}{\partial (x,y,z)}}={\begin{aligned}{\begin{vmatrix}a_{x}&a_{y}&a_{z}\\b_{x}&b_{y}&b_{z}\\c_{x}&c_{y}&c_{z}\end{vmatrix}}\end{aligned}}}
is the Jacobian determinant
The condition
J
=
0
{\displaystyle J=0}
leads to the general solution
Whenever
J
=
0
{\displaystyle J=0}
, then there exists a functional relation between
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
because whenever a determinant is zero, the columns (or rows) are not linearly independent
Take this functional relation to be
c
=
ψ
(
a
,
b
)
.
{\displaystyle c=\psi (a,b).}
Once
(
a
,
b
)
{\displaystyle (a,b)}
is found, the problem is solved
From the above relation, we have
d
c
=
ψ
a
d
a
+
ψ
b
d
b
{\displaystyle dc=\psi _{a}da+\psi _{b}db}
By summing the original equations
(
a
x
ϕ
a
+
b
x
ϕ
b
+
c
x
ϕ
c
)
=
0
{\displaystyle (a_{x}\phi _{a}+b_{x}\phi _{b}+c_{x}\phi _{c})=0}
,
(
a
y
ϕ
a
+
b
y
ϕ
b
+
c
y
ϕ
c
)
=
0
{\displaystyle (a_{y}\phi _{a}+b_{y}\phi _{b}+c_{y}\phi _{c})=0}
and
(
a
z
ϕ
a
+
b
z
ϕ
b
+
c
z
ϕ
c
)
=
0
{\displaystyle (a_{z}\phi _{a}+b_{z}\phi _{b}+c_{z}\phi _{c})=0}
we find
ϕ
a
d
a
+
ϕ
b
d
b
+
ϕ
c
d
c
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi _{a}da+\phi _{b}db+\phi _{c}dc=0}
Now eliminating
d
c
{\displaystyle dc}
from the two equations derived, we obtain
(
ϕ
a
+
ϕ
c
ψ
a
)
d
a
+
(
ϕ
b
+
ϕ
c
ψ
b
)
d
b
=
0
{\displaystyle (\phi _{a}+\phi _{c}\psi _{a})da+(\phi _{b}+\phi _{c}\psi _{b})db=0}
Since
a
{\displaystyle a}
and
b
{\displaystyle b}
are independent, we require
(
ϕ
a
+
ϕ
c
ψ
a
)
=
0
{\displaystyle (\phi _{a}+\phi _{c}\psi _{a})=0}
(
ϕ
a
+
ϕ
c
ψ
a
)
=
0.
{\displaystyle (\phi _{a}+\phi _{c}\psi _{a})=0.}
The above two equations can be used to solve
a
{\displaystyle a}
and
b
{\displaystyle b}
Substituting
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
in
ϕ
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi =0}
, we obtain the general integral
Thus a general integral describes a relation between
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
u
)
{\displaystyle (x,y,z,u)}
, two known independent functions
(
a
,
b
)
{\displaystyle (a,b)}
and an arbitrary function
ψ
(
a
,
b
)
{\displaystyle \psi (a,b)}
Note that we have assumed
c
=
ψ
(
a
,
b
)
{\displaystyle c=\psi (a,b)}
to make the determinant
J
{\displaystyle J}
zero, but this is not always needed
The relations
c
=
ψ
(
a
)
{\displaystyle c=\psi (a)}
or,
c
=
ψ
(
b
)
{\displaystyle c=\psi (b)}
suffice to make the determinant zero.
Singular integral is obtained when
J
≠
0
{\displaystyle J\neq 0}
In this case, elimination of
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
from
ϕ
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi =0}
works if
ϕ
a
=
0
,
ϕ
b
=
0
,
ϕ
c
=
0.
{\displaystyle \phi _{a}=0,\quad \phi _{b}=0,\quad \phi _{c}=0.}
The three equations can be used to solve the three unknowns
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
Solution obtained by elimination of
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
this way leads to what are called singular integrals.
Usually, most integrals fall into three categories defined above, but it may happen that a solution does not fit into any of three types of integrals mentioned above
These solutions are called special integrals
A relation
χ
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
u
)
=
0
{\displaystyle \chi (x,y,z,u)=0}
that satisfies the partial differential equation is said to a special integral if we are unable to determine
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
from the following equations
ϕ
x
χ
u
−
χ
x
ϕ
u
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi _{x}\chi _{u}-\chi _{x}\phi _{u}=0}
ϕ
y
χ
u
−
χ
y
ϕ
u
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi _{y}\chi _{u}-\chi _{y}\phi _{u}=0}
ϕ
z
χ
u
−
χ
z
ϕ
u
=
0.
{\displaystyle \phi _{z}\chi _{u}-\chi _{z}\phi _{u}=0.}
If we able to determine
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
from the above set of equations, then
χ
=
0
{\displaystyle \chi =0}
will turn out to be one of the three integrals described before.
The complete integral in two-dimensional space can be written as
ϕ
(
x
,
y
,
u
,
a
,
b
)
=
0
{\displaystyle \phi (x,y,u,a,b)=0}
The general integral is obtained by eliminating
a
{\displaystyle a}
from the following equations
ϕ
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
a
,
ψ
(
a
)
)
=
0
,
ϕ
a
+
ψ
a
ϕ
b
=
0.
{\displaystyle \phi (x,y,z,a,\psi (a))=0,\quad \phi _{a}+\psi _{a}\phi _{b}=0.}
The singular integral if it exists can be obtained by eliminating
(
a
,
b
)
{\displaystyle (a,b)}
from the following equations
ϕ
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
a
,
b
)
=
0
,
ϕ
a
=
0
,
ϕ
b
=
0.
{\displaystyle \phi (x,y,z,a,b)=0,\quad \phi _{a}=0,\quad \phi _{b}=0.}
If a complete integral is not available, solutions may still be obtained by solving a system of ordinary equations
To obtain this system, first note that the PDE determines a cone (analogous to the light cone) at each point: if the PDE is linear in the derivatives of u (it is quasi-linear), then the cone degenerates into a line
In the general case, the pairs (p,q) that satisfy the equation determine a family of planes at a given point:
u
−
u
0
=
p
(
x
−
x
0
)
+
q
(
y
−
y
0
)
,
{\displaystyle u-u_{0}=p(x-x_{0})+q(y-y_{0}),\,}
where
F
(
x
0
,
y
0
,
u
0
,
p
,
q
)
=
0.
{\displaystyle F(x_{0},y_{0},u_{0},p,q)=0.\,}
The envelope of these planes is a cone, or a line if the PDE is quasi-linear
The condition for an envelope is
F
p
d
p
+
F
q
d
q
=
0
,
{\displaystyle F_{p}\,dp+F_{q}\,dq=0,\,}
where F is evaluated at
(
x
0
,
y
0
,
u
0
,
p
,
q
)
{\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0},u_{0},p,q)}
, and dp and dq are increments of p and q that satisfy F=0
Hence the generator of the cone is a line with direction
d
x
:
d
y
:
d
u
=
F
p
:
F
q
:
(
p
F
p
+
q
F
q
)
.
{\displaystyle dx:dy:du=F_{p}:F_{q}:(pF_{p}+qF_{q}).\,}
This direction corresponds to the light rays for the wave equation.
To integrate differential equations along these directions, we require increments for p and q along the ray
This can be obtained by differentiating the PDE:
F
x
+
F
u
p
+
F
p
p
x
+
F
q
p
y
=
0
,
{\displaystyle F_{x}+F_{u}p+F_{p}p_{x}+F_{q}p_{y}=0,\,}
F
y
+
F
u
q
+
F
p
q
x
+
F
q
q
y
=
0
,
{\displaystyle F_{y}+F_{u}q+F_{p}q_{x}+F_{q}q_{y}=0,\,}
Therefore the ray direction in
(
x
,
y
,
u
,
p
,
q
)
{\displaystyle (x,y,u,p,q)}
space is
d
x
:
d
y
:
d
u

d
p

d
q
=
F
p

F
q

:
(

)
:
(

q
)
.
{\displaystyle dx:dy:du:dp:dq=F_{p}:F_{q}:(pF_{p}+qF_{q}):(-F_{x}-F_{u}p):(-F_{y}-F_{u}q).\,}
The integration of these equations leads to a ray conoid at each point
(
x
0
,
y
0
,
u
0
)
{\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0},u_{0})}
General solutions of the PDE can then be obtained from envelopes of such conoids.

The div-curl systems, Maxwell's equations, Einstein's equations (with four harmonic coordinates) and

Characteristic surfaces for the wave equation are level surfaces for solutions of the equation

.
{\displaystyle u_{t}^{2}=c^{2}\left(u_{x}^{2}+u_{y}^{2}+u_{z}^{2}\right).\,}
There is little loss of generality if we set
u

=

{\displaystyle u_{t}=1}
: in that case u satisfies

{\displaystyle u_{x}^{2}+u_{y}^{2}+u_{z}^{2}={\frac {1}{c^{2}}}.\,}
In vector notation, let
x
→
=
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
and
p
→
=
(
u
x
,
u
y
,
u
z
)
.
{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}=(x,y,z)\quad {\hbox{and}}\quad {\vec {p}}=(u_{x},u_{y},u_{z}).\,}
A family of solutions with planes as level surfaces is given by
u
(
x
→
)
=
p
→
⋅
(
x
→
−
x
0
→
)
,
{\displaystyle u({\vec {x}})={\vec {p}}\cdot ({\vec {x}}-{\vec {x_{0}}}),\,}
where
|
p

=
1
c
,
and
x
0
→
is arbitrary
.
{\displaystyle |{\vec {p}}\,|={\frac {1}{c}},\quad {\text{and}}\quad {\vec {x_{0}}}\quad {\text{is arbitrary}}.\,}
If x and x0 are held fixed, the envelope of these solutions is obtained by finding a point on the sphere of radius 1/c where the value of u is stationary
This is true if
p
→
{\displaystyle {\vec {p}}}
is parallel to
x
→
−
x
0
→
{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}-{\vec {x_{0}}}}
Hence the envelope has equation
u
(
x

)
=
±
1
c
|
x
→
−
x
0
→
|
.
{\displaystyle u({\vec {x}})=\pm {\frac {1}{c}}|{\vec {x}}-{\vec {x_{0}}}\,|.}
These solutions correspond to spheres whose radius grows or shrinks with velocity c
These are light cones in space-time.
The initial value problem for this equation consists in specifying a level surface S where u=0 for t=0
 The solution is obtained by taking the envelope of all the spheres with centers on S, whose radii grow with velocity c
This envelope is obtained by requiring that
1
c
|
x
→
−
x
0
→
|
is stationary for
x
0
→
∈
S
.
{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{c}}|{\vec {x}}-{\vec {x_{0}}}\,|\quad {\hbox{is stationary for}}\quad {\vec {x_{0}}}\in S.\,}
This condition will be satisfied if
|
x
→
−
x
0
→
|
{\displaystyle |{\vec {x}}-{\vec {x_{0}}}\,|}
is normal to S
Thus the envelope corresponds to motion with velocity c along each normal to S
This is the Huygens' construction of wave fronts: each point on S emits a spherical wave at time t=0, and the wave front at a later time t is the envelope of these spherical waves
The normals to S are the light rays.
