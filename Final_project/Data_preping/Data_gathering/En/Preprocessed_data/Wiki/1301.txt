he spent his entire life in al andalus most of it in seville and almeria

al bakri wrote about europe north africa and the arabian peninsula
only two of his works have survived
his mu jam m ista jam contains a list of place names mostly within the arabian peninsula with an introduction giving the geographical background
his most important work is his kit b al mas lik wa al mam lik book of highways and of kingdoms
this was composed in based on literature and the reports of merchants and travellers including muhammad ibn y suf al warr q and abraham ben jacob
it is one of the most important sources for the history of west africa and gives crucial information on the ghana empire the almoravid dynasty and the trans saharan trade
although the material borrowed from al warraq dated from the th century he also included information on events that occurred close to the time that he wrote
al bakri mentions the earliest urban centres in the trans saharan trade to embrace islam late in the th century gao was one of the very few along the niger river to have native muslim inhabitants
other centres along the serpentine bends of the great river eventually followed takrur senegal songhay mali kanem bornu chad and hausa territories nigeria
by the th century reports on these and other flourishing islamic cities made their way north to al andalus in southern iberia enabling al bakri to write in his kitab al masalik wa al mamalik book of highways and kingdoms the city of ghana consists of two towns situated on a plain and that one of these towns which is inhabited by muslims is large and possesses twelve mosques in one of which they assemble for the friday prayer
there are salaried imams and muezzins as well as jurists and scholars
his works are noted for the relative objectivity with which they present information
for each area he describes the people their customs as well as the geography climate and main cities
similar information was also contained in his written geography of the arabian peninsula and in the encyclopedia of the world in which he wrote
he also presented various anecdotes about each area
