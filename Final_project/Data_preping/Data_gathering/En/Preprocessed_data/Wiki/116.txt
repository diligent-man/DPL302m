The Uyghurs wi rz WEE goorz or u i rz alternatively spelled Uighurs Uygurs or Uigurs are a Turkic ethnic group originating from and culturally affiliated with the general region of Central and East Asia The Uyghurs are recognized as native to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China They are one of China's officially recognized ethnic minorities The Uyghurs are recognized by the Chinese government as a regional minority and the titular people of Xinjiang
The Uyghurs have traditionally inhabited a series of oases scattered across the Taklamakan Desert within the Tarim Basin These oases have historically existed as independent states or were controlled by many civilizations including China the Mongols the Tibetans and various Turkic polities The Uyghurs gradually started to become Islamized in the th century and most Uyghurs identified as Muslims by the th century Islam has since played an important role in Uyghur culture and identity
An estimated of Xinjiang's Uyghurs still live in the Tarim Basin The rest of Xinjiang's Uyghurs mostly live in r mqi the capital city of Xinjiang which is located in the historical region of Dzungaria The largest community of Uyghurs living in another region of China are the Uyghurs living in Taoyuan County in north central Hunan Significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs exist in other Turkic countries such as Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Uzbekistan Pakistan and Turkey Smaller communities live in Saudi Arabia Jordan Australia Russia and Sweden
Since the Chinese government has subjected Uyghurs living in Xinjiang to widespread abuses that include forced sterilization and forced labor Scholars estimate that at least one million Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained in the Xinjiang internment camps since Chinese government officials claim that these camps created under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's administration serve the goals of ensuring adherence to Chinese Communist Party CCP ideology preventing separatism fighting terrorism and providing vocational training to Uyghurs
In the Uyghur language the ethnonym is written in Arabic script in Uyghur Cyrillic and Uyghur or Uygur as the standard Chinese romanization GB in Latin they are all pronounced as j In Chinese this is transcribed into characters as which is romanized in pinyin as W iw ' r
In English the name is officially spelled Uyghur by the Xinjiang government but also appears as Uighur Uigur and Uygur These reflect the various Cyrillic spellings and The name is usually pronounced in English as wi r although some Uyghurs and Uyghur scholars advocate for using the closer pronunciation u i r instead with the vowels in the beginning of the word pronounced like the vowels in the English word ruin
The term's original meaning is unclear Old Turkic inscriptions record a word uy ur Old Turkic romanized uj ur an example is found on the Sudzi inscription I am khan ata of Yaglaqar came from the Uigur land Old Turkic Uy ur jerinte Ya laqar qan ata keltim It is transcribed into Tang annals as Mandarin Hu h but probably u i t in Middle Chinese It was used as the name of one of the Turkic polities formed in the interim between the First and Second G kt rk Khaganates AD The Old History of the Five Dynasties records that in or the Chinese acceded to a Uyghur request and emended their transcription to Mandarin Hu h but u i u t in Middle Chinese
Modern etymological explanations for the name Uyghur range from derivation from the verb follow accommodate oneself and adjective non rebellious i e from Turkic uy u to the verb meaning wake rouse or stir i e from Turkic o ur None of these is thought to be satisfactory because the sound shift of and to j does not appear to be in place by this time The etymology therefore cannot be conclusively determined and its referent is also difficult to fix The Huihe and Huihu seem to be a political rather than a tribal designation or it may be one group among several others collectively known as the Toquz Oghuz The name fell out of use in the th century but was reintroduced in the early th century by the Soviet Bolsheviks to replace the previous terms Turk and Turki The name is currently used to refer to the settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of the Tarim Basin who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices distinguishable from the nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia
The earliest record of a Uyghur tribe appears in accounts from the Northern Wei th th century A D wherein they were named Yuanhe MC ZS n t and derived from a confederation named lit High Carts read as G och in Mandarin Chinese but originally with the reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciation k ut a later known as the Tiele Ti l G och in turn has been connected to the Uyghur Qangqil or
Throughout its history the term Uyghur has had an increasingly expansive definition Initially signifying only a small coalition of Tiele tribes in northern China Mongolia and the Altai Mountains it later denoted citizenship in the Uyghur Khaganate Finally it was expanded into an ethnicity whose ancestry originates with the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in the year causing Uyghur migration from Mongolia into the Tarim Basin
The Uyghur's conquest migrations and assimilation replaced the various Indo European speakers of the region to create a distinct identity because the language and culture of the Turkic migrants eventually supplanted the original Indo European influences This fluid definition of Uyghur and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs create confusion as to what constitutes true Uyghur ethnography and ethnogenesis Contemporary scholars consider modern Uyghurs to be the descendants of a number of peoples including the ancient Uyghurs of Mongolia migrating into the Tarim Basin after the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate Iranic Saka tribes and other Indo European peoples inhabiting the Tarim Basin before the arrival of the Turkic Uyghurs They represent of the total population of China
Uyghur activists identify with the Tarim mummies remains of an ancient people inhabiting the region but research into the genetics of ancient Tarim mummies and their links with modern Uyghurs remains problematic both to Chinese government officials concerned with ethnic separatism and to Uyghur activists concerned the research could affect their indigenous claim
The term Uyghur was not used to refer to a specific existing ethnicity in the th century it referred to an 'ancient people' A late th century encyclopedia entitled The cyclop dia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia said the Uigur are the most ancient of Turkish tribes and formerly inhabited a part of Chinese Tartary Xinjiang now occupied by a mixed population of Turk Mongol and Kalmuck Before Western writers called the Turkic speaking Muslims of the oases Turki and the Turkic Muslims who had migrated from the Tarim Basin to Ili r mqi and Dzungaria in the northern portion of Xinjiang during the Qing dynasty were known as Taranchi meaning farmer The Russians and other foreigners referred to them as Sart Turk or Turki In the early th century they identified themselves by different names to different peoples and in response to different inquiries they called themselves Sarts in front of Kazakhs and Kyrgyz while they called themselves Chantou if asked about their identity after first identifying as a Muslim The term Chantou Ch'an t'ou meaning Rag head or Turban Head was used to refer to the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang including by Hui Tungan people These groups of peoples often identify themselves by their originating oasis instead of an ethnicity for example those from Kashgar may refer to themselves as Kashgarliq or Kashgari while those from Hotan identity themselves as Hotani Other Central Asians once called all the inhabitants of Xinjiang's Southern oases Kashgari a term still used in some regions of Pakistan The Turkic people also used Musulman which means Muslim to describe themselves
Rian Thum explored the concepts of identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in Altishahr the native Uyghur name for Eastern Turkestan or Southern Xinjiang before the adoption of the name Uyghur in the s referring to them by the name Altishahri in his article Modular History Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did have a sense that they were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq and the Han Chinese Khitay before they became known as Uyghurs There was no single name used for their identity various native names Altishahris used for identify were Altishahrlik Altishahr person yerlik local Turki and Musulm n Muslim the term Musulm n in this situation did not signify religious connotations because the Altishahris exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz while identifying themselves as Musulm n Dr Laura J Newby says the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people considered themselves separate from other Turkic Muslims since at least the th century
The name Uyghur reappeared after the Soviet Union took the th century ethnonym from the Uyghur Khaganate then reapplied it to all non nomadic Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang It followed western European orientalists like Julius Klaproth in the th century who revived the name and spread the use of the term to local Turkic intellectuals and a th century proposal from Russian historians that modern day Uyghurs were descended from the Kingdom of Qocho and Kara Khanid Khanate formed after the dissolution of the Uyghur Khaganate Historians generally agree that the adoption of the term Uyghur is based on a decision from a conference in Tashkent attended by Turkic Muslims from the Tarim Basin Xinjiang There Uyghur was chosen by them as the name of their ethnicity although delegates noted the modern groups referred to as Uyghur are distinct from the old Uyghur Khaganate According to Linda Benson the Soviets and their client Sheng Shicai intended to foster a Uyghur nationality to divide the Muslim population of Xinjiang whereas the various Turkic Muslim peoples preferred to identify themselves as Turki East Turkestani or Muslim
On the other hand the ruling regime of China at that time the Kuomintang grouped all Muslims including the Turkic speaking people of Xinjiang into the Hui nationality The Qing dynasty and the Kuomintang generally referred to the sedentary oasis dwelling Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang as turban headed Hui to differentiate them from other predominantly Muslim ethnicities in China In the s foreigners travelers in Xinjiang such as George W Hunter Peter Fleming Ella Maillart and Sven Hedin referred to the Turkic Muslims of the region as Turki in their books Use of the term Uyghur was unknown in Xinjiang until The area governor Sheng Shicai came to power adopting the Soviet ethnographic classification instead of the Kuomintang's and became the first to promulgate the official use of the term Uyghur to describe the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang Uyghur replaced rag head
Sheng Shicai's introduction of the Uighur name for the Turkic people of Xinjiang was criticized and rejected by Turki intellectuals such as Pan Turkist Jadids and East Turkestan independence activists Muhammad Amin Bughra Mehmet Emin and Masud Sabri They demanded the names T rk or T rki be used instead as the ethnonyms for their people Masud Sabri viewed the Hui people as Muslim Han Chinese and separate from his people while Bughrain criticized Sheng for his designation of Turkic Muslims into different ethnicities which could sow disunion among Turkic Muslims After the Communist victory the Chinese Communist Party under Chairman Mao Zedong continued the Soviet classification using the term Uyghur to describe the modern ethnicity
In current usage Uyghur refers to settled Turkic speaking urban dwellers and farmers of the Tarim Basin and Ili who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia However Chinese government agents designate as Uyghur certain peoples with significantly divergent histories and ancestries from the main group These include the Lopliks of Ruoqiang County and the Dolan people thought to be closer to the Oirat Mongols and the Kyrgyz The use of the term Uyghur led to anachronisms when describing the history of the people In one of his books the term Uyghur was deliberately not used by James Millward
Another ethnicity the Western Yugur of Gansu identify themselves as the Yellow Uyghur Sar q Uyghur Some scholars say the Yugurs' culture language and religion are closer to the original culture of the original Uyghur Karakorum state than is the culture of the modern Uyghur people of Xinjiang Linguist and ethnographer S Robert Ramsey argues for inclusion of both the Eastern and Western Yugur and the Salar as sub groups of the Uyghur based on similar historical roots for the Yugur and on perceived linguistic similarities for the Salar
Turkistani is used as an alternate ethnonym by some Uyghurs For example the Uyghur diaspora in Arabia adopted the identity Turkistani Some Uyghurs in Saudi Arabia adopted the Arabic nisba of their home city such as Al Kashgari from Kashgar Saudi born Uyghur Hamza Kashgari's family originated from Kashgar
The actual size of the Uyghur population particularly in China has been the subject of some dispute Official figures released by Chinese authorities place the Uyghur population within the Xinjiang region to be just over million comprising approximately half of the total regional population The Uyghur population within China generally remains centered in Xinjiang region with some smaller subpopulations elsewhere in the country such as in Taoyuan County where an estimated live As early as however some Uyghur groups wrote that their population was being vastly undercounted by Chinese authorities claiming that their population actually exceeded million Population disputes have continued into the present with some activists and groups such as the Uyghur Congress and Uyghur American Association claiming that the Uyghur population ranges between and million Some have even claimed that the real number of Uyghurs is actually million Scholars however have generally rejected these claims with Professor Dru C Gladney writing in the book Xinjiang China's Muslim Borderland that there is scant evidence to support Uyghur claims that their population within China exceeds million
A study of mitochondrial DNA therefore the matrilineal genetic contribution found the frequency of Western Eurasian specific haplogroup in Uyghurs to be and East Asian haplogroup to be Uyghurs in Kazakhstan on the other hand were shown to have European Western Eurasian maternal mtDNA
A study based on paternal DNA shows West Eurasian haplogroups J and R in Uyghurs make up to and East Asian haplogroups C N D and O to
One study by Xu et al using samples from Hetian Hotan only found Uyghurs have about an average of European or West Asian Western Eurasian ancestry and about East Asian or Siberian ancestry Eastern Eurasian From the same area it is found that the proportion of Uyghur individuals with European West Asian ancestry ranges individually from to while their East Asian Siberian ancestry ranges individually from to Further study by the same team showed an average of slightly greater European West Asian component at ranging individually from to in the Uyghur population in southern Xinjiang but only ranging individually from to in the northern Uyghur population
A different study by Li et al used a larger sample of individuals from a wider area and found a higher East Asian component of about on average while the European West Asian component was about Overall Uyghur show relative more similarity to Western East Asians than to Eastern East Asians The authors also cite anthropologic studies which also estimate about Western proportions which are in agreement with their genetic results
A study based on autosomal DNA shows that average Uyghurs are closest to other Turkic people in Central Asia and China as well as various Chinese populations The analysis of the diversity of cytochrome B further suggests Uyghurs are closer to Chinese and Siberian populations than to various Caucasoid groups in West Asia or Europe However there is significant genetic distance between the Xinjiang's southern Uyghurs and Chinese population but not between the northern Uyghurs and Chinese
A Study of Uyghur males living in southern Xinjiang used high resolution Y STR loci system high resolution to infer the genetic relationships between the Uyghur population and European and Asian populations The results showed the Uyghur population of southern Xinjiang exhibited a genetic admixture of Eastern Asian and European populations but with slightly closer relationship with European populations than to Eastern Asian populations
An extensive genome study in analyzed samples of Uyghurs from geographical subpopulations in Xinjiang and observed a southwest and northeast differentiation in the population partially caused by the Tianshan Mountains which form a natural barrier with gene flows from the east and west The study identifies four major ancestral components that may have arisen from two earlier admixed groups one West Eurasian component associated with European ancestry one South Asian ancestry component and two East Eurasian components with Siberian and East Asian ancestries In total Uyghurs on average range from to Siberian East Asian European and South Asian Southwest Xinjiang such as Hotan and Kizilsu shows larger proportion of West Eurasian ancestry while Northeast Xinjiang such as Kumul and Turpan shows greater East Asian ancestry It suggests at least two major waves of admixture one years ago coinciding with the age range of the mummies with European feature found in Xinjiang and another occurring around years ago
A study of Uyghur samples from Xinjiang using the ancestry informative SNP AISNP analysis found that the average genetic ancestry of Uyghurs is East Asian related and European related
The history of the Uyghur people as with the ethnic origin of the people is a matter of contention Uyghur historians viewed the Uyghurs as the original inhabitants of Xinjiang with a long history Uyghur politician and historian Muhammad Amin Bughra wrote in his book A History of East Turkestan stressing the Turkic aspects of his people that the Turks have a continuous year old history while historian Turghun Almas incorporated discoveries of Tarim mummies to conclude that Uyghurs have over years of continuous history and the World Uyghur Congress claimed a year history in East Turkestan However the official Chinese view as documented in the white paper History and Development of Xinjiang asserts that the Uyghur ethnic group formed after the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in when the local residents of the Tarim Basin and its surrounding areas were merged with migrants from the khaganate The name Uyghur reappeared after the Soviet Union took the th century ethnonym from the Uyghur Khaganate then reapplied it to all non nomadic Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang Many contemporary Western scholars however do not consider the modern Uyghurs to be of direct linear descent from the old Uyghur Khaganate of Mongolia Rather they consider them to be descendants of a number of peoples one of them the ancient Uyghurs
Discovery of well preserved Tarim mummies of a people European in appearance indicates the migration of a European looking people into the Tarim area at the beginning of the Bronze Age around BCE These people may have been of Tocharian origin and some have suggested them to be the Yuezhi mentioned in ancient Chinese texts Uyghur activist Turgun Almas claimed these mummies were Uyghurs because the earliest Uyghurs practiced shamanism and the buried mummies' orientation suggests that they had been shamanists meanwhile Qurban W li claimed words written in Kharosthi and Sogdian scripts as Uyghur rather than Sogdian words absorbed into Uyghur according to other linguists Later migrations brought peoples from the west and northwest to the Xinjiang region probably speakers of various Iranian languages such as the Saka tribes who may have been present in the Khotan and Kashgar area in the first millennium BC as well as the Sogdians who formed networks of trading communities across the Tarim Basin from the th century AD There may also be an Indian component as the founding legend of Khotan suggests that the city was founded by Indians from ancient Taxila during the reign of Ashoka Other people in the region mentioned in ancient Chinese texts include the Dingling as well as the Xiongnu who fought for supremacy in the region against the Chinese for several hundred years Some Uyghur nationalists also claimed descent from the Xiongnu according to the Chinese historical text the Book of Wei the founder of the Uyghurs was descended from a Xiongnu ruler but the view is contested by modern Chinese scholars
The Yuezhi were driven away by the Xiongnu but founded the Kushan Empire which exerted some influence in the Tarim Basin where Kharosthi texts have been found in Loulan Niya and Khotan Loulan and Khotan were some of the many city states that existed in the Xinjiang region during the Han Dynasty others include Kucha Turfan Karasahr and Kashgar These kingdoms in the Tarim Basin came under the control of China during the Han and Tang dynasties During the Tang dynasty they were conquered and placed under the control of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West and the Indo European cultures of these kingdoms never recovered from Tang rule after thousands of their inhabitants were killed during the conquest The settled population of these cities later merged with the incoming Turkic people including the Uyghurs of Uyghur Khaganate to form the modern Uyghurs The Indo European Tocharian language later disappeared as the urban population switched to a Turkic language such as the Old Uyghur language
The early Turkic peoples descended from agricultural communities in Northeast Asia who moved westwards into Mongolia in the late rd millennium BC where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle By the early st millennium BC these peoples had become equestrian nomads In subsequent centuries the steppe populations of Central Asia appear to have been progressively Turkified by East Asian nomadic Turks moving out of Mongolia
The Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate were part of a Turkic confederation called the Tiele who lived in the valleys south of Lake Baikal and around the Yenisei River They overthrew the First Turkic Khaganate and established the Uyghur Khaganate
The Uyghur Khaganate lasted from to It was administered from the imperial capital Ordu Baliq one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia In following a famine and civil war the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the Yenisei Kirghiz another Turkic people As a result the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control dispersed and moved out of Mongolia
The Uyghurs who founded the Uyghur Khaganate dispersed after the fall of the Khaganate to live among the Karluks and to places such as Jimsar Turpan and Gansu These Uyghurs soon founded two kingdoms and the easternmost state was the Ganzhou Kingdom which ruled parts of Xinjiang with its capital near present day Zhangye Gansu China The modern Yugurs are believed to be descendants of these Uyghurs Ganzhou was absorbed by the Western Xia in
The second Uyghur kingdom the Kingdom of Qocho ruled a larger section of Xinjiang also known as Uyghuristan in its later period was founded in the Turpan area with its capital in Qocho modern Gaochang and Beshbalik The Kingdom of Qocho lasted from the ninth to the fourteenth century and proved to be longer lasting than any power in the region before or since The Uyghurs were originally Tengrists shamanists and Manichaean but converted to Buddhism during this period Qocho accepted the Qara Khitai as its overlord in the s and in submitted voluntarily to the rising Mongol Empire The Uyghurs of Kingdom of Qocho were allowed significant autonomy and played an important role as civil servants to the Mongol Empire but was finally destroyed by the Chagatai Khanate by the end of the th century
In the tenth century the Karluks Yagmas Chigils and other Turkic tribes founded the Kara Khanid Khanate in Semirechye Western Tian Shan and Kashgaria and later conquered Transoxiana The Karakhanid rulers were likely to be Yaghmas who were associated with the Toquz Oghuz and some historians therefore see this as a link between the Karakhanid and the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate although this connection is disputed by others
The Karakhanids converted to Islam in the tenth century beginning with Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan the first Turkic dynasty to do so Modern Uyghurs see the Muslim Karakhanids as an important part of their history however Islamization of the people of the Tarim Basin was a gradual process The Indo Iranian Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was conquered by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanids from Kashgar in the early th century but Uyghur Qocho remained mainly Buddhist until the th century and the conversion of the Uyghur people to Islam was not completed until the th century
The th and th century saw the domination by non Muslim powers first the Kara Khitans in the th century followed by the Mongols in the th century After the death of Genghis Khan in Transoxiana and Kashgar became the domain of his second son Chagatai Khan The Chagatai Khanate split into two in the s and the area of the Chagatai Khanate where the modern Uyghurs live became part of Moghulistan which meant land of the Mongols In the th century a Chagatayid khan Tughluq Tem r converted to Islam Genghisid Mongol nobilities also followed him to convert to Islam His son Khizr Khoja conquered Qocho and Turfan the core of Uyghuristan in the s and the Uyghurs there became largely Muslim by the beginning of the th century After being converted to Islam the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the infidel Kalmuks Dzungars were the ones who built Buddhist structures in their area
From the late th through th centuries the Xinjiang region became further subdivided into Moghulistan in the north Altishahr Kashgar and the Tarim Basin and the Turfan area each often ruled separately by competing Chagatayid descendants the Dughlats and later the Khojas
Islam was also spread by the Sufis and branches of its Naqshbandi order were the Khojas who seized control of political and military affairs in the Tarim Basin and Turfan in the th century The Khojas however split into two rival factions the Aqtaghlik Khojas also called the Afaqiyya and the Qarataghlik Khojas the Ishaqiyya The legacy of the Khojas lasted until the th century The Qarataghlik Khojas seized power in Yarkand where the Chagatai Khans ruled in the Yarkent Khanate forcing the Aqtaghlik Afaqi Khoja into exile
In the th century the Buddhist Dzungar Khanate grew in power in Dzungaria The Dzungar conquest of Altishahr ended the last independent Chagatai Khanate the Yarkent Khanate after the Aqtaghlik Afaq Khoja sought aid from the th Dalai Lama and his Dzungar Buddhist followers to help him in his struggle against the Qarataghlik Khojas The Aqtaghlik Khojas in the Tarim Basin then became vassals to the Dzungars
The expansion of the Dzungars into Khalkha Mongol territory in Mongolia brought them into direct conflict with Qing China in the late th century and in the process also brought Chinese presence back into the region a thousand years after Tang China lost control of the Western Regions
The Dzungar Qing War lasted a decade During the Dzungar conflict two Aqtaghlik brothers the so called Younger Khoja Chinese also known as Khw ja i Jah n and his sibling the Elder Khoja Chinese also known as Burh n al D n after being appointed as vassals in the Tarim Basin by the Dzungars first joined the Qing and rebelled against Dzungar rule until the final Qing victory over the Dzungars then they rebelled against the Qing an action which prompted the invasion and conquest of the Tarim Basin by the Qing in The Uyghurs of Turfan and Hami such as Emin Khoja were allies of the Qing in this conflict and these Uyghurs also helped the Qing rule the Altishahr Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin
The final campaign against the Dzungars in the s ended with the Dzungar genocide The Qing final solution of genocide to solve the problem of the Dzungar Mongols created a land devoid of Dzungars which was followed by the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of other people in Dzungaria In northern Xinjiang the Qing brought in Han Hui Uyghur Xibe Daurs Solons Turkic Muslim Taranchis and Kazakh colonists with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern area while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin In Dzungaria the Qing established new cities like r mqi and Yining The Dzungarian basin itself is now inhabited by many Kazakhs The Qing therefore unified Xinjiang and changed its demographic composition as well The crushing of the Buddhist Dzungars by the Qing led to the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang and increasing Turkic Muslim power with Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing It was therefore argued by Henry Schwarz that the Qing victory was in a certain sense a victory for Islam
In Beijing a community of Uyghurs was clustered around the mosque near the Forbidden City having moved to Beijing in the th century
The Ush rebellion in by Uyghurs against the Manchus occurred after several incidences of misrule and abuse that had caused considerable anger and resentment The Manchu Emperor ordered that the Uyghur rebel town be massacred and the men were executed and the women and children enslaved
During the Dungan Revolt Andijani Uzbeks from the Khanate of Kokand under Buzurg Khan and Yaqub Beg expelled Qing officials from parts of southern Xinjiang and founded an independent Kashgarian kingdom called Yettishar Country of Seven Cities Under the leadership of Yaqub Beg it included Kashgar Yarkand Khotan Aksu Kucha Korla and Turpan Large Qing dynasty forces under Chinese General Zuo Zongtang attacked Yettishar in
After this invasion the two regions of Dzungaria which had been known as the Dzungar region or the Northern marches of the Tian Shan and the Tarim Basin which had been known as Muslim land or southern marches of the Tian Shan were reorganized into a province named Xinjiang meaning New Territory
In the Qing Dynasty was replaced by the Republic of China By Pan Turkic Jadidists had become a challenge to Chinese warlord Yang Zengxin who controlled Xinjiang Uyghurs staged several uprisings against Chinese rule In the Kumul Rebellion erupted leading to the establishment of an independent government in Khotan in which later led to the creation of the First East Turkestan Republic officially known as the Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan Uyghurs joined with Uzbeks Kazakhs and Kyrgyz and successfully declared their independence on November The First East Turkestan Republic was a short lived attempt at independence around the areas encompassing Kashgar Yarkent and Khotan and it was attacked during the Qumul Rebellion by a Chinese Muslim army under General Ma Zhancang and Ma Fuyuan and fell following the Battle of Kashgar The Soviets backed Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai's rule over East Turkestan Xinjiang from to In April remnants of the First East Turkestan Republic launched an uprising known as the Islamic Rebellion in Xinjiang and briefly established an independent government controlling areas from Atush Kashgar Yarkent and even parts of Khotan before it was crushed in October following Soviet intervention Sheng Shicai purged to people mostly Uyghurs following this uprising
The oppressive reign of Sheng Shicai fueled discontent by Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of the region and Sheng expelled Soviet advisors following U S support for the Kuomintang of the Republic of China This led the Soviets to capitalize on the Uyghur and other Turkic people's discontent in the region culminating in their support of the Ili Rebellion in October The Ili Rebellion resulted in the establishment of the Second East Turkestan Republic on November in the three districts of what is now the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture Several pro KMT Uyghurs like Isa Yusuf Alptekin Memet Emin Bugra and Mesut Sabri opposed the Second East Turkestan Republic and supported the Republic of China In the summer of the Soviets purged the thirty top leaders of the Second East Turkestan Republic and its five top officials died in a mysterious plane crash on August On October the People's Liberation Army entered the region and the East Turkestan National Army was merged into the PLA's th Army Corps leading to the official end of the Second East Turkestan Republic on December
Mao declared the founding of the People's Republic of China on October He turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and appointed Saifuddin Azizi as the region's first Communist Party governor Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries The name Xinjiang was changed to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region where Uyghurs are the largest ethnicity mostly concentrated in the south western Xinjiang
The Xinjiang conflict is an ongoing separatist conflict in China's far west province of Xinjiang whose northern region is known as Dzungaria and whose southern region the Tarim Basin is known as East Turkestan Uyghur separatists and independence movements claim that the Second East Turkestan Republic was illegally incorporated by China in and has since been under Chinese occupation
Uyghur identity remains fragmented as some support a Pan Islamic vision exemplified by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement while others support a Pan Turkic vision such as the East Turkestan Liberation Organization A third group would like an East Turkestan state such as the East Turkestan independence movement While the East Turkistan Government in Exile strives for the restoration of East Turkistan's independence as a secular pluralistic Republic that guarantees freedom and civil liberties for all people As a result n o Uyghur or East Turkestan group speaks for all Uyghurs although it might claim to and Uyghurs in each of these camps have committed violence against other Uyghurs who they think are too assimilated to Chinese or Russian society or are not religious enough Mindful not to take sides Uyghur leaders such as Rebiya Kadeer mainly tried to garner international support for the rights and interests of the Uyghurs including the right to demonstrate although the Chinese government has accused her of orchestrating the deadly July r mqi riots
Eric Enno Tamm's book states that Authorities have censored Uyghur writers and 'lavished funds' on official histories that depict Chinese territorial expansion into ethnic borderlands as 'unifications tongyi never as conquests zhengfu or annexations tunbing '
Since Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been affected by extensive controls and restrictions which the Chinese government has imposed upon their religious cultural economic and social lives In Xinjiang the Chinese government has expanded police surveillance to watch for signs of religious extremism that include owning books about Uyghurs growing a beard having a prayer rug or quitting smoking or drinking The government had also installed cameras in the homes of private citizens
Further at least and possibly over million Uyghurs are detained in mass detention camps termed re education camps aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees their identities and their religious beliefs Some of these facilities keep prisoners detained around the clock while others release their inmates at night to return home According to Chinese government operating procedures the main feature of the camps is to ensure adherence to Chinese Communist Party ideology Inmates are continuously held captive in the camps for a minimum of months depending on their performance on Chinese ideology tests The New York Times has reported inmates are required to sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write 'self criticism' essays and that prisoners are also subjected to physical and verbal abuse by prison guards Chinese officials are sometimes assigned to monitor the families of current inmates and women have been detained due to actions by their sons or husbands
In Human Rights Watch released a report saying The Chinese government agents should immediately free people held in unlawful 'political education' centers in Xinjiang and shut them down The internment along with mass surveillance and intelligence officials inserting themselves into Uyghur families led to widespread accusations of cultural genocide against the CCP In particular the size of the operation was found to have doubled over Satellite evidence suggests China destroyed more than two dozen Uyghur Muslim religious sites between and
The government denied the existence of the camps initially but then changed their stance to claim that the camps serve to combat terrorism and give vocational training to the Uyghur people Activists have called for the camps to be opened to visitors to prove their function Media groups have reported that many in the camps were forcibly detained there in rough unhygienic conditions while undergoing political indoctrination The lengthy isolation periods between Uyghur men and women has been interpreted by some analysts as an attempt to inhibit Uyghur procreation in order to change the ethnic demographics of the country
An October expos by the BBC News claimed based on analysis of satellite imagery collected over time that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs were interned in rapidly expanding camps It was also reported in that hundreds of writers artists and academics had been imprisoned in what the magazine qualified as an attempt to punish any form of religious or cultural expression among Uyghurs
Parallel to the forceful detainment of millions of adults in alone at least half a million children were also forcefully separated from their families and placed in pre school camps with prison style surveillance systems and volt electric fences
In a New York Times article reported that human rights groups and Uyghur activists said that the Chinese government was using technology from US companies and researchers to collect DNA from Uyghurs They said China was building a comprehensive DNA database to be able to track down Uyghurs who were resisting the re education campaign Later that year satellite photos confirmed the systematic destruction of Uyghur cemeteries
Despite the Western media's focus on the ongoing repression of the Uyghurs there have been few sustained protests from Islamic countries against the internment and re education of the ethnicity by the Chinese Communist Party In December the Organization of Islamic Cooperation OIC initially acknowledged the disturbing reports from the region but the statement was later retracted and replaced by the comment that the OIC commends the efforts of the People's Republic of China in providing care to its Muslim citizens and looks forward to further cooperation between the OIC and the People's Republic of China Saudi Arabia which hosts a significant number of ethnic Uyghurs have refrained from any official criticism of the Chinese government while Turkey's President Erdogan tacitly supported China saying that It is a fact that the people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang are leading a happy life amid China's development and prosperity while visiting China after its Foreign Ministry denounced China for violating the fundamental human rights of Uyghur Turks Some observers have connected the lack of criticism from the Islamic world to Muslim countries' dependence on Chinese economic aid
