Yavneh Academy of Dallas is a coeducational, college preparatory Jewish private high school in Dallas, Texas
It is guided by the tenets of Modern Orthodox Judaism
With a student body of more than 100 students in grades 9-12 for the 2020-21 academic year, Yavneh has dual curriculum of General and Judaic Studies.
The school first opened in 1993
Yavneh was named after a now-defunct Jewish school in Cologne, Germany that closed during World War II, which itself was named for an ancient city and academy in Israel
Yavneh is Dallas's first Jewish high school, following the closing of Torah High School of Texas
Yavneh Academy opened in 1993 with grades 9 and 10 and phased in the other two grades in subsequent years
Initially classes were held at the Jewish Community Center in Dallas
Rabbi Moshe Englander was the first principal; he was previously the assistant principal of a Jewish high school near Detroit
When the school opened, the yearly tuition was $7,000
The school used donations to cover some of its operating expenses as well
Initially it had about 12 students
Circa 2004 it had 81 students, rising to about 100 in 2005.
Yavneh Academy occupied five temporary locations before settling into its permanent home, The Schultz Rosenberg Campus, named after the donors Howard and Leslie Schultz and Marcus and Ann Rosenberg
The school's current campus is at 12324 Merit Drive, covering 3.8 acres (1.5 ha)
It shares a site with the campus of Akiba Academy, a PK-8 school; both of them opened their doors on the current campus in 2005
The site formerly housed the Olla Podrida Shopping Village, a shopping center which closed in 1996
The Schultzes had acquired the site and transferred it to the Greater Dallas Jewish Community Capital Campaign of the 21st Century as a donation
The demolition of the shopping center was scheduled to occur in 2003, with construction of the new campuses scheduled to begin in January of the following year.
The school, along with Akiba Academy of Dallas, was built with a $19 million bond issued by Colorado Educational and Cultural Facilities Authority (CEFCA) and underwritten by J.P
Morgan Securities Inc
On September 27, 2004, about 36 boxes of Jewish religious books were ceremonially buried at the school site.
Mr
Donald R
O'Quinn served as principal of the school from 1998 to 2012 following a career in the Dallas Independent School District
Dr
David A
Portnoy became Head of School in 2012, after serving as Head of School at Emery/Weiner School in Houston, Texas, and as a teacher and senior administrator at Beth Tfiloh Dahan Community School and Gilman School, both in Baltimore, Maryland
Following Dr
Portnoy's retirement in 2019, the school merged with Akiba Academy of Dallas (preschool through grade 8) to become Akiba Yavneh Academy
Beginning in 2019, the new Head of School is Rabbi Yaakov Green.
Yavneh student-athletes have won numerous national tournaments, and its boys and girls soccer, volleyball, and basketball teams have advanced regularly to Texas state playoffs
 The Yavneh Boys Varsity Basketball Team - The Bulldogs - enjoyed a perfect 31-0 season in 2017-18, when they also won the second of back-to-back championships at the Beth Tfiloh Weiner International Invitational basketball tournament

Its Engineering Team, under the auspices of CIJE, was also awarded top national honors in 2017 and 2018
The school's Math Team has won #1 North Texas individual and team titles since 2016.

Yavneh student leadership is perhaps best exemplified by student-run groups including "Students Against Terrorism," "Students 4 Students," and "Helping Hands for the Homeless," which have together raised more than $900,000 for victims of terror, for building schools in sub-Saharan Africa - together with the Hamels Foundation - and for aiding needy families in the Dallas-Fort Worth region.
Yavneh alumni have attended Yale University, Harvard University, Stanford University, The University of Pennsylvania, and many other colleges, universities, and yeshiva and seminary programs in Israel and around the world.
