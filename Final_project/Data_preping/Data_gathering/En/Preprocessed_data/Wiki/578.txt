in classical mathematics analytic geometry also known as coordinate geometry or cartesian geometry is the study of geometry using a coordinate system
this contrasts with synthetic geometry
analytic geometry is used in physics and engineering and also in aviation rocketry space science and spaceflight
it is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry including algebraic differential discrete and computational geometry
usually the cartesian coordinate system is applied to manipulate equations for planes straight lines and circles often in two and sometimes three dimensions
geometrically one studies the euclidean plane two dimensions and euclidean space
as taught in school books analytic geometry can be explained more simply it is concerned with defining and representing geometric shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes numerical definitions and representations
that the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the cantor dedekind axiom
the greek mathematician menaechmus solved problems and proved theorems by using a method that had a strong resemblance to the use of coordinates and it has sometimes been maintained that he had introduced analytic geometry
apollonius of perga in on determinate section dealt with problems in a manner that may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others
apollonius in the conics further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of descartes by some years
his application of reference lines a diameter and a tangent is essentially no different from our modern use of a coordinate frame where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates
he further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations expressed in words of curves
however although apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon a given curve a posteriori instead of a priori
that is equations were determined by curves but curves were not determined by equations
coordinates variables and equations were subsidiary notions applied to a specific geometric situation
the th century persian mathematician omar khayyam saw a strong relationship between geometry and algebra and was moving in the right direction when he helped close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra with his geometric solution of the general cubic equations but the decisive step came later with descartes
omar khayyam is credited with identifying the foundations of algebraic geometry and his book treatise on demonstrations of problems of algebra which laid down the principles of analytic geometry is part of the body of persian mathematics that was eventually transmitted to europe
because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations khayyam can be considered a precursor to descartes in the invention of analytic geometry
analytic geometry was independently invented by ren descartes and pierre de fermat although descartes is sometimes given sole credit
cartesian geometry the alternative term used for analytic geometry is named after descartes
descartes made significant progress with the methods in an essay titled la g om trie geometry one of the three accompanying essays appendices published in together with his discourse on the method for rightly directing one s reason and searching for truth in the sciences commonly referred to as discourse on method
la geometrie written in his native french tongue and its philosophical principles provided a foundation for calculus in europe
initially the work was not well received due in part to the many gaps in arguments and complicated equations
only after the translation into latin and the addition of commentary by van schooten in and further work thereafter did descartes s masterpiece receive due recognition
pierre de fermat also pioneered the development of analytic geometry
although not published in his lifetime a manuscript form of ad locos planos et solidos isagoge introduction to plane and solid loci was circulating in paris in just prior to the publication of descartes discourse
clearly written and well received the introduction also laid the groundwork for analytical geometry
the key difference between fermat s and descartes treatments is a matter of viewpoint fermat always started with an algebraic equation and then described the geometric curve that satisfied it whereas descartes started with geometric curves and produced their equations as one of several properties of the curves
as a consequence of this approach descartes had to deal with more complicated equations and he had to develop the methods to work with polynomial equations of higher degree
it was leonhard euler who first applied the coordinate method in a systematic study of space curves and surfaces
in analytic geometry the plane is given a coordinate system by which every point has a pair of real number coordinates
similarly euclidean space is given coordinates where every point has three coordinates
the value of the coordinates depends on the choice of the initial point of origin
there are a variety of coordinate systems used but the most common are the following
the most common coordinate system to use is the cartesian coordinate system where each point has an x coordinate representing its horizontal position and a y coordinate representing its vertical position
these are typically written as an ordered pair x y
this system can also be used for three dimensional geometry where every point in euclidean space is represented by an ordered triple of coordinates x y z
in polar coordinates every point of the plane is represented by its distance r from the origin and its angle with normally measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis
using this notation points are typically written as an ordered pair r
one may transform back and forth between two dimensional cartesian and polar coordinates by using these formulae
arctan
displaystyle x r cos theta y r sin theta r sqrt x y theta arctan y x
this system may be generalized to three dimensional space through the use of cylindrical or spherical coordinates
in cylindrical coordinates every point of space is represented by its height z its radius r from the z axis and the angle its projection on the xy plane makes with respect to the horizontal axis
in spherical coordinates every point in space is represented by its distance from the origin the angle its projection on the xy plane makes with respect to the horizontal axis and the angle that it makes with respect to the z axis
the names of the angles are often reversed in physics
in analytic geometry any equation involving the coordinates specifies a subset of the plane namely the solution set for the equation or locus
for example the equation y x corresponds to the set of all the points on the plane whose x coordinate and y coordinate are equal
these points form a line and y x is said to be the equation for this line
in general linear equations involving x and y specify lines quadratic equations specify conic sections and more complicated equations describe more complicated figures
usually a single equation corresponds to a curve on the plane
this is not always the case the trivial equation x x specifies the entire plane and the equation x y specifies only the single point
in three dimensions a single equation usually gives a surface and a curve must be specified as the intersection of two surfaces see below or as a system of parametric equations
the equation x y r is the equation for any circle centered at the origin with a radius of r
lines in a cartesian plane or more generally in affine coordinates can be described algebraically by linear equations
in two dimensions the equation for non vertical lines is often given in the slope intercept form
displaystyle y mx b
where
m is the slope or gradient of the line
b is the y intercept of the line
x is the independent variable of the function y f x in a manner analogous to the way lines in a two dimensional space are described using a point slope form for their equations planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it the normal vector to indicate its inclination
specifically let
displaystyle mathbf r
be the position vector of some point
displaystyle p x y z
and let
displaystyle mathbf n a b c
be a nonzero vector
the plane determined by this point and vector consists of those points
displaystyle p
with position vector
displaystyle mathbf r
such that the vector drawn from
displaystyle p
displaystyle p
is perpendicular to
displaystyle mathbf n
recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points
displaystyle mathbf r
such that
displaystyle mathbf n cdot mathbf r mathbf r
the dot here means a dot product not scalar multiplication
expanded this becomes
displaystyle a x x b y y c z z
which is the point normal form of the equation of a plane
this is just a linear equation
where
displaystyle ax by cz d text where d ax by cz
conversely it is easily shown that if a b c and d are constants and a b and c are not all zero then the graph of the equation
displaystyle ax by cz d
is a plane having the vector
displaystyle mathbf n a b c
as a normal
this familiar equation for a plane is called the general form of the equation of the plane
in three dimensions lines can not be described by a single linear equation so they are frequently described by parametric equations
displaystyle x x at
displaystyle y y bt
displaystyle z z ct
where
x y and z are all functions of the independent variable t which ranges over the real numbers
x y z is any point on the line
a b and c are related to the slope of the line such that the vector a b c is parallel to the line in the cartesian coordinate system the graph of a quadratic equation in two variables is always a conic section though it may be degenerate and all conic sections arise in this way
the equation will be of the form
not all zero
displaystyle ax bxy cy dx ey f text with a b c text not all zero
as scaling all six constants yields the same locus of zeros one can consider conics as points in the five dimensional projective space
displaystyle mathbf p
the conic sections described by this equation can be classified using the discriminant
displaystyle b ac
if the conic is non degenerate then
displaystyle b ac
the equation represents an ellipse
displaystyle a c
displaystyle b
the equation represents a circle which is a special case of an ellipse
displaystyle b ac
the equation represents a parabola
displaystyle b ac
the equation represents a hyperbola
if we also have
displaystyle a c
the equation represents a rectangular hyperbola a quadric or quadric surface is a dimensional surface in dimensional space defined as the locus of zeros of a quadratic polynomial
in coordinates x x x the general quadric is defined by the algebraic equation
displaystyle sum i j x i q ij x j sum i p i x i r
quadric surfaces include ellipsoids including the sphere paraboloids hyperboloids cylinders cones and planes
in analytic geometry geometric notions such as distance and angle measure are defined using formulas
these definitions are designed to be consistent with the underlying euclidean geometry
for example using cartesian coordinates on the plane the distance between two points x y and x y is defined by the formula
displaystyle d sqrt x x y y
which can be viewed as a version of the pythagorean theorem
similarly the angle that a line makes with the horizontal can be defined by the formula
arctan
displaystyle theta arctan m
where m is the slope of the line
in three dimensions distance is given by the generalization of the pythagorean theorem
displaystyle d sqrt x x y y z z
while the angle between two vectors is given by the dot product
the dot product of two euclidean vectors a and b is defined by
displaystyle mathbf a cdot mathbf b stackrel mathrm def left mathbf a right left mathbf b right cos theta
where is the angle between a and b
transformations are applied to a parent function to turn it into a new function with similar characteristics
the graph of
displaystyle r x y
is changed by standard transformations as follows
changing
displaystyle x
displaystyle x h
moves the graph to the right
displaystyle h
units
changing
displaystyle y
displaystyle y k
moves the graph up
displaystyle k
units
changing
displaystyle x
displaystyle x b
stretches the graph horizontally by a factor of
displaystyle b
think of the
displaystyle x
as being dilated
changing
displaystyle y
displaystyle y a
stretches the graph vertically
changing
displaystyle x
displaystyle x cos a y sin a
and changing
displaystyle y
displaystyle x sin a y cos a
rotates the graph by an angle
displaystyle a
there are other standard transformation not typically studied in elementary analytic geometry because the transformations change the shape of objects in ways not usually considered
skewing is an example of a transformation not usually considered
for more information consult the wikipedia article on affine transformations
for example the parent function
displaystyle y x
has a horizontal and a vertical asymptote and occupies the first and third quadrant and all of its transformed forms have one horizontal and vertical asymptote and occupies either the st and rd or nd and th quadrant
in general if
displaystyle y f x
then it can be transformed into
displaystyle y af b x k h
in the new transformed function
displaystyle a
is the factor that vertically stretches the function if it is greater than or vertically compresses the function if it is less than and for negative
displaystyle a
values the function is reflected in the
displaystyle x
displaystyle b
value compresses the graph of the function horizontally if greater than and stretches the function horizontally if less than and like
displaystyle a
reflects the function in the
displaystyle y
axis when it is negative
displaystyle k
displaystyle h
values introduce translations
displaystyle h
vertical and
displaystyle k
horizontal
positive
displaystyle h
displaystyle k
values mean the function is translated to the positive end of its axis and negative meaning translation towards the negative end
transformations can be applied to any geometric equation whether or not the equation represents a function
transformations can be considered as individual transactions or in combinations
suppose that
displaystyle r x y
is a relation in the
displaystyle xy
plane
for example
displaystyle x y
is the relation that describes the unit circle
for two geometric objects p and q represented by the relations
displaystyle p x y
displaystyle q x y
the intersection is the collection of all points
displaystyle x y
which are in both relations
for example
displaystyle p
might be the circle with radius and center
displaystyle
displaystyle p x y x y
displaystyle q
might be the circle with radius and center
displaystyle q x y x y
the intersection of these two circles is the collection of points which make both equations true
does the point
displaystyle
make both equations true using
displaystyle
displaystyle x y
the equation for
displaystyle q
becomes
displaystyle
displaystyle
which is true so
displaystyle
is in the relation
displaystyle q
on the other hand still using
displaystyle
displaystyle x y
the equation for
displaystyle p
becomes
displaystyle
displaystyle
which is false
displaystyle
is not in
displaystyle p
so it is not in the intersection
the intersection of
displaystyle p
displaystyle q
can be found by solving the simultaneous equations
displaystyle x y
displaystyle x y
traditional methods for finding intersections include substitution and elimination
substitution solve the first equation for
displaystyle y
in terms of
displaystyle x
and then substitute the expression for
displaystyle y
into the second equation
displaystyle x y
displaystyle y x
we then substitute this value for
displaystyle y
into the other equation and proceed to solve for
displaystyle x
displaystyle x x
displaystyle x x x
displaystyle x
displaystyle x
next we place this value of
displaystyle x
in either of the original equations and solve for
displaystyle y
displaystyle y
displaystyle y
displaystyle y frac pm sqrt
so our intersection has two points
displaystyle left frac sqrt right text and left frac sqrt right
elimination add or subtract a multiple of one equation to the other equation so that one of the variables is eliminated
for our current example if we subtract the first equation from the second we get
displaystyle x x
displaystyle y
in the first equation is subtracted from the
displaystyle y
in the second equation leaving no
displaystyle y
the variable
displaystyle y
has been eliminated
we then solve the remaining equation for
displaystyle x
in the same way as in the substitution method
displaystyle x x x
displaystyle x
displaystyle x
we then place this value of
displaystyle x
in either of the original equations and solve for
displaystyle y
displaystyle y
displaystyle y
displaystyle y frac pm sqrt
so our intersection has two points
displaystyle left frac sqrt right text and left frac sqrt right
for conic sections as many as points might be in the intersection
one type of intersection which is widely studied is the intersection of a geometric object with the
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
coordinate axes
the intersection of a geometric object and the
displaystyle y
axis is called the
displaystyle y
intercept of the object
the intersection of a geometric object and the
displaystyle x
axis is called the
displaystyle x
intercept of the object
for the line
displaystyle y mx b
the parameter
displaystyle b
specifies the point where the line crosses the
displaystyle y
depending on the context either
displaystyle b
or the point
displaystyle b
is called the
displaystyle y
intercept
in geometry the tangent line or simply tangent to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that just touches the curve at that point
informally it is a line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve
more precisely a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y f x at a point x c on the curve if the line passes through the point c f c on the curve and has slope f c where f is the derivative of f
a similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n dimensional euclidean space
as it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet called the point of tangency the tangent line is going in the same direction as the curve and is thus the best straight line approximation to the curve at that point
similarly the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that just touches the surface at that point
the concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized see tangent space
in geometry a normal is an object such as a line or vector that is perpendicular to a given object
for example in the two dimensional case the normal line to a curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point
in the three dimensional case a surface normal or simply normal to a surface at a point p is a vector that is perpendicular to the tangent plane to that surface at p
the word normal is also used as an adjective a line normal to a plane the normal component of a force the normal vector etc
the concept of normality generalizes to orthogonality
cross product
rotation of axes
translation of axes
