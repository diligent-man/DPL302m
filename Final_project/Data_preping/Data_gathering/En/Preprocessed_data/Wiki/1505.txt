specialization occurred result increasing importance intensive agriculture pastoralism

undomesticated herd chosen become controllable proto-pastoralist nomadic hunter gatherer group taming domesticating them
hunter-gatherers' strategy past diverse contingent upon local environmental condition like mixed farmers
foraging strategy included hunting trapping big game smaller animal fishing collecting shellfish insect gathering wild-plant food fruit seed nuts
diverse strategy survival amongst migratory herd could also provide evolutionary route towards nomadic pastoralism

variation genetic makeup farm animal driven mainly natural human based selection
example pastoralists large part sub saharan africa preferring livestock breed adapted environment able tolerate drought diseases
however animal production system breed discouraged productive exotic one favored
situation could left unaddressed due change market preference climate world could lead change livestock disease occurrence decline forage quality availability
hence pastoralists maintain farm animal genetic resource conserving local livestock breeds
generally conserving farm animal genetic resource pastoralism advantageous term reliability associated cost
