warburg believed aerobic glycolysis wa key metabolic change cancer cell malignancy
warburg effect wa later coined describe metabolic shift
warburg thought change metabolism wa due mitochondrial respiration injury interpretation wa questioned researcher showing intact functional cytochrome detected tumor cell clearly speak general mitochondrial dysfunction
several author provided significant evidence oxidative phosphorylation normal krebs cycle persist vast majority malignant tumor adding growing body evidence cancer exhibit warburg effect maintaining proper mitochondrial respiration
