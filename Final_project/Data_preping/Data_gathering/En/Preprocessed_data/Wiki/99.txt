old english indo-european language generally noun's gender derives morphophonology rather directly semantics word-meaning
word 'thing' determines gender name noun rather particular speech-sounds previously used denote thing's kind gender

kind sort word-ending sound disappeared speech generation noun's gender wa longer immediately clear

however stressed position plural third-person personal pronoun replaced old norse form middle english period yielding their
old english verb divided two group strong verb weak verbs
strong verb form past tense changing vowel weak verb add ending
strong verb use germanic form conjugation known ablaut
verb still exist modern english called irregular verb example sing sang sung strong verb swim swam swum break broke broken
strong verb growing le le common century conjugation complicated weak verb harder predict
mean many verb strong old english time weak
include walk sleep help laugh step sneeze chew wash shine climb let bake lock read drag bark sweep float bow row fart creep flow starve weep grip leap mow slay shove carve gnaw braid flee fare ban wreak quell delve
two even became weak old english period sleep slpan read rdan
also old english time people long since stopped coining new strong verbs
even today almost every strong verb modern language date back old english even proto-germanic
strong verb considered irregular old english belongs one seven major class pattern stem changes
learning often challenge student language though english speaker may see connection old verb class modern forms
class following distinguishing feature infinitive stem corresponding particular stem change within strong-conjugating paradigms
c used represent consonant verb class usually short e lc short eo rc short ncmc g short ie lce one consonant usually l r plus verb brecan 'to break'e one consonant usually stop fricativea one consonantother above
always heavy root syllable either long vowel short two consonant almost always non-umlauted vowel eg nc ea lcrc occ
infinitive distinguishable class weak verb non-umlauted root vowel class weak verb lack suffix ian
infinitive past participle also stemthe first past stem used past first- third-person singular
second past stem used second-person singular person plural well preterite subjunctive
strong verb also exhibit i-mutation stem second- third-person singular present tense
third class went many sound change wa barely recognisable single class
h r another consonant turned ea e eo
also l another consonant happened e remained unchanged except combination lh
e two consonant apart cluster beginning leo r h another consonante l another consonanti nasal another consonantregular strong verb conjugated roughly main difference stem vowel
thus stelan steal represents strong verb conjugation paradigm
weak verb form past tense adding ending d- sometimes t- stem
modern english ending merged ed forming past tense verb love loved look looked
weak verb already make vast majority verb old english
old english period new class weak verb stopped produced many coined proto-germanic still far common kind verb old english
verb often recognizable feature i-umlaut word derived dman judge dm judgment blan bleach blc pale tellan count tl number rman make room rm room
also source alteration modern english feed food fill full breed brood
exact ending depend complex combination factor mostly involving length stem vowel consonant stem end sometimes also history word
many verb ending double consonant conjugated like temman tame ending alternation single double consonants
class weak verb end rian conjugated like styrian move
class ii weak verb easily recognized fact nearly end ian hopian hope wincian wink wandrian wander
old english period wa productive verb class left
newly created verb almost automatically weak class ii
unlike weak class never cause i-umlaut stem usually identical stem word derived lufu love lufian love mynet coin mynetian coin hwelp puppy hwelpian animal give birth
almost weak class ii verb precisely ending completely unaffected makeup stem history word
though wa much larger containing many verb later became class ii four verb still belonged group period written text habban libban live sean say hyan think verb distinctly irregular though share commonalities
preterite-presents verb whose present tense look like past tense strong verbs
resemblance accident descend old proto-indo-european stative verb normally developed past tense germanic languages
example first-person present witan know originally meant seen referring state seen implication know
point well old english verb given past tense tacking weak past ending without intervening vowel
lack intervening vowel led alternation consonant sometimes vowel well
magan sulan shouldmustto owe mtan may urfan need witan know cunnan knowknow emunan remember durran dare gan dugan useful enugan suffice unnan grant
spite heavy irregularity grouped four group similarly conjugated verbs
sulan urfanadditionally group four verb anomalous want go be
especially unusual want go commonly used verb language important meaning sentence used
idiosyncratic pattern inflection much common important item vocabulary rarely used ones
dn 'to do' gn 'to go' conjugated alike willan 'to want' similar outside present tense
verb 'to be' actually composed three different stem one beginning w- one beginning b- one beginning s-
traditionally thought forming two separate word wesan comprising form beginning w- s- bon comprising form beginning b-
wesan wa used circumstance whereas bon wa used future certain kind general statements
preposition like modern english word sometimes follow word govern especially pronoun case called postpositions
preposition may govern accusative genitive dative instrumental cases
old english syntax wa similar many way modern english
simply consequence greater level nominal verbal inflection word order wa generally freer
also difference default word order construction negation question relative clause subordinate clauses
default word order wa verb-second like german modern english
multiple negative could stack sentence intensified negative concord
sentence subordinate clause type x use wh-type word conjunction used th-type correlative conjunction eg x instead x ythere wa flexibility word order old english since heavily inflected nature noun adjective verb often indicated relationship clause arguments
even sometimes scrambling within constituent occurred beowulf line wrum andan
something similar occurs line sele han high hall lit
extraposition constituent larger constituent common even prose well-known tale cynewulf cyneheard begins
hr cynewulf benam sigebryht rces ond westseaxna wiotan unryhtum ddum bton hamtnscre
literally cynewulf deprived sigebryht kingdom west saxons' counselor unright deed except hampshire
translated cynewulf west saxon counselor deprived sigebryht kingdom hampshire unjust actionsthe word ond westseaxna wiotan west saxon counselor lit
counselor west saxon extraposed moved compound subject belong way would impossible modern english
old english case inflection preserve meaning verb beniman deprive appearing sentence form benam deprived need word genitive case show someone something deprived sentence rces kingdom nominative rce kingdom whereas wiotan counselor nominative case therefore serf different role entirely genitive would
old english sentence still theory perfectly unambiguous contains one word genitive westseaxna west saxon nominative westseaxan west saxon form wiotan counselor may also represent accusative case addition nominative thus example creating grammatical possibility interpretation cynewulf also took west saxon away
main clause old english tend verb-second v order finite verb second constituent sentence regardless come first
echo modern english hardly arrive never said went boat ever onward marched weary soldier came loud sound sky above
old english however wa much extensive like word order modern germanic language modern english
subject appears first svo order also yield order ov others
subordinate clause however word order markedly different verb-final construction norm dutch german
beowulf example main clause frequently verb-initial verb-final order subordinate clause often verb-second order
however clause introduced mean either word order crucial telling difference normal word order nearly always followed
linguist work within chomskyan transformational grammar paradigm often believe accurate describe old english germanic language word-order pattern like modern german underlying subject-object-verb sov ordering
according theory sentence initially generated using order main clause verb moved back v position technically verb undergoes v-to-t raising
said explain fact old english allows inversion subject verb general strategy forming question modern english us strategy almost auxiliary verb main verb requiring do-support cases
time word order old english changed asking question svo vso
many purport old english free word order quite true convention positioning subject object verb clause
ic eom becomes eom icold english use form equivalent relative clause man saw subordinate clause got home went sleep
combination two se esubordinate clause tended use correlative conjunction eg
translated went home sleptthe word order usually distinguished subordinate clause verb-final order main clause verb-second word order
equivalent used interrogative pronoun indefinite pronoun ancient greek sanskrit
correlative conjunction occurred often pair identical word eg
x x ythe phonology old english necessarily somewhat speculative since preserved purely written language
