John Henry O'Hara January April was one of America's most prolific writers of short stories credited with helping to invent The New Yorker magazine short story style He became a best selling novelist before the age of with Appointment in Samarra and BUtterfield While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated his champions rank him highly among the under appreciated and unjustly neglected major American writers of the th century Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in have discovered him chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level
O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century but he is the most addictive wrote Lorin Stein editor in chief of the Paris Review in a appreciation of O'Hara's work Stein added You can binge on his collections the way some people binge on Mad Men and for some of the same reasons On the topics of class sex and alcohol—that is the topics that mattered to him—his novels amount to a secret history of American life His work stands out from that of his contemporary authors for its unvarnished realism
O'Hara achieved substantial commercial success in the years after World War II when his fiction repeatedly appeared in Publishers Weekly's annual list of the top ten best selling fiction works in the United States These best sellers included A Rage To Live Ten North Frederick From the Terrace Ourselves to Know Sermons and Soda Water and Elizabeth Appleton Five of his works were adapted into popular films in the s and s
Despite the popularity of these books O'Hara accumulated detractors due to his outsized and easily bruised ego alcoholic crankiness long held resentments and politically conservative views that were unfashionable in literary circles in the s After O'Hara's death John Updike a fan of O'Hara's writing said that the prolific author out produced our capacity for appreciation maybe now we can settle down and marvel at him all over again
O'Hara was born in Pottsville Pennsylvania to an affluent Irish American family Though his family lived among the gentry of eastern Pennsylvania during his childhood O'Hara's Irish Catholic background gave him the perspective of an outsider on the inside of WASP society a theme he returned to in his writing again and again He attended the secondary school Niagara Prep in Lewiston New York where he was named Class Poet for Class of His father died about that time leaving him unable to afford to attend Yale the college of his dreams By all accounts this fall in social status from a privileged life of a well heeled doctor's family including club memberships riding and dance lessons fancy cars in the barn domestic servants in the house to overnight insolvency afflicted O'Hara with status anxiety for the rest of his life honing the cutting social class awareness that characterizes his work
Brendan Gill who worked with O'Hara at The New Yorker claimed that O'Hara was nearly obsessed with a sense of social inferiority due to not having attended Yale People used to make fun of the fact that O'Hara wanted so desperately to have gone to Yale but it was never a joke to O'Hara It seemed that there wasn't anything he didn't know about it in regard to college and prep school matters Hemingway once said someone should start a bloody fund to send up a collection to send John O'Hara to Yale As his literary acclaim grew O'Hara yearned for an honorary degree from Yale so much so that he even asked the university for it According to Gill Yale was unwilling to award the honor because O'Hara asked for it
Initially O'Hara worked as a reporter for various newspapers Moving to New York City he began to write short stories for magazines During the early part of his career he was also a film critic a radio commentator and a press agent In O'Hara published his first novel Appointment in Samarra Endorsing the novel Ernest Hemingway wrote If you want to read a book by a man who knows exactly what he is writing about and has written it marvelously well read Appointment in Samarra O'Hara followed Samarra with BUtterfield his roman à clef based upon the tragic short life of flapper Starr Faithfull whose mysterious death in became a tabloid sensation Over four decades O'Hara published novels novellas plays screenplays and more than short stories the majority of them in The New Yorker During World War II he was a correspondent in the Pacific theater After the war he wrote screenplays and more novels including Ten North Frederick for which he won the National Book Award and From the Terrace which he considered his greatest achievement as a novelist Late in life with his reputation established he became a newspaper columnist In his last decade O'Hara created a body of work of magnificent dimensions wrote the novelist George V Higgins whose own trademark dialogue was influenced heavily by O'Hara's style Between and Higgins noted O'Hara published six novels seven collections of short fiction and some terse and extended stories that all by themselves would supply credentials for a towering reputation in the world of perfect justice that he never did quite find
Many of O'Hara's stories and his later novels written in the s are set in Gibbsville Pennsylvania a barely fictionalized version of his home town of Pottsville a small city in the anthracite region of the northeastern United States He named Gibbsville for his friend and frequent editor at The New Yorker Wolcott Gibbs Most of his other stories were set in New York or Hollywood
O'Hara's short stories earned him his highest critical acclaim He contributed more of them to The New Yorker than any other writer He published seven volumes of stories in the final decade of his career while complaining that they took his time away from writing novels I had an apparently inexhaustible urge to express an unlimited supply of short story ideas No writing has ever come more easily to me he claimed In the Library of America's collection of of O'Hara's best stories editor Charles McGrath praises them for their sketchlike lightness and brevity in which nothing necessarily 'happens' in the old fashioned sense but in which some crucial loss or discovery is revealed just by implication a sense of speed and economy is just what makes the best of these stories so thrilling Gill who worked with O'Hara at The New Yorker ranks him among the greatest short story writers in English or in any other language and credits him with helping to invent what the world came to call The New Yorker short story In the foreword to a collection published four years before his death O'Hara declared No one writes them any better than I do Two more volumes of his stories were published soon after his death
Despite his popular success as a best selling author most of O'Hara's longer work is not held in as high regard by the literary establishment Critic Benjamin Schwarz and writer Christina Schwarz claimed So widespread is the literary world's scorn for John O'Hara that the inclusion of Appointment in Samarra on the Modern Library's list of the best English language novels of the twentieth century was used to ridicule the entire project The endings of some of O'Hara's novels and stories are clumsy hasty conclusions Some of the criticism of O'Hara's writing is attributed to dislike of O'Hara personally because of his abrasive ego and lack of humility in dealing with others his vigorous self promotion his obsession with his social status and the politically conservative columns he wrote late in his career Early and mid th century critics also disparaged his novels for their blunt and non judgmental depictions of loose women and homosexuals yet critics writing after the sexual revolution see in O'Hara a pioneer in depicting female sexuality in frank realistic ways His most biting critics regard his novels to be shallow and overly concerned with sexual desire drinking and surface details at the expense of deeper meaning Many leading characters in O'Hara's novels are alcoholics who live as emotional zombies anesthetized by drinking and unable to ponder the human heart in conflict with itself As his contemporary William Faulkner said of such writers in his Nobel Prize address of He writes not of the heart but of the glands
In O'Hara left The New Yorker bitterly after his colleague Brendan Gill shocked literary circles with a brutally devastating review in The New Yorker of O'Hara's long novel A Rage to Live Gill disparaged O'Hara's book as a formula family novel turned out by writers of the third and fourth magnitude in such disheartening abundance and declared it a catastrophe by an author who plainly intended to write nothing less than a great American novel Literary critics called Gill's review a savage attack and a cruel hatchet job on one of The New Yorker's most popular writers During the preceding two decades O'Hara had been The New Yorker's most prolific contributor of stories no fewer than by one count After the magazine published Gill's review O'Hara quit writing for The New Yorker for more than a decade and when readers complained to Gill for driving O'Hara away Gill deflected blame onto another New Yorker contributor James Thurber for stirring up animosity O'Hara would not resume writing for The New Yorker until the s upon the arrival of a new editor who sought out O'Hara with an olive branch Nearly years after the scandalous review at a forum on O'Hara's legacy held in Gill stood up in the crowd to explain his attack on O'Hara rationalizing his actions by pleading I had to tell the truth about the novel
O'Hara's legacy has many literary heavyweight admirers including authors Updike and Shelby Foote Fans admire O'Hara for his deft ability to depict realistic dialogue his mastery of the telling detail and his sharp eye for the way humans communicate in nonverbal ways—from subtle glances to telling gestures McGrath a former fiction editor of The New Yorker and former editor of The New York Times Book Review has called O'Hara one of the great listeners of American fiction able to write dialogue that sounded the way people really talk and he also learned the eavesdropper's secret—how often people leave unsaid what is really on their minds O'Hara said he learned from reading Ring Lardner that if you wrote down speech as it is spoken truly you produce true characters and added Sometimes I almost feel that I ought to apologize for having the ability to write good dialogue and yet it's the attribute most lacking in American writers and almost totally lacking in the British
According to biographer Frank MacShane O'Hara thought that Hemingway's death made O'Hara the leading candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature O'Hara wrote to his daughter I really think I will get it and I want the Nobel prize so bad I can taste it MacShane says that TS Eliot told O'Hara that he had in fact been nominated twice When John Steinbeck won the prize in O'Hara wired Congratulations I can think of only one other author I'd rather see get it In a letter to Steinbeck two years before that O'Hara placed himself with Steinbeck in the pantheon of great th century American writers Hemingway Fitzgerald and Faulkner singling out Faulkner among them as the one the genius
O'Hara died from cardiovascular disease in Princeton New Jersey and is interred in the Princeton Cemetery A comment he made about himself and which was chosen by his wife for his epitaph reads Better than anyone else he told the truth about his time He was a professional He wrote honestly and well Of this Gill commented From the far side of the grave he remains self defensive and overbearing Better than anyone else Not merely better than any other writer of fiction but better than any dramatist any poet any biographer any historian It is an astonishing claim
After his death O'Hara's study and its contents were reconstructed in for display at Pennsylvania State University where his papers are held His childhood home the John O'Hara House in Pottsville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in
O'Hara's epistolary novel Pal Joey led to the successful Broadway musical with libretto by O'Hara and songs by Rodgers and Hart In Pal Joey was made into a musical film starring Rita Hayworth Frank Sinatra Kim Novak and Barbara Nichols
From the Terrace is a film adapted from O'Hara's novel of the same title The film starred Paul Newman as disenchanted Alfred Eaton son of a wealthy but indifferent father and alcoholic mother as well as Joanne Woodward as his socially ambitious self pitying and unfaithful wife Mary St John
Also in O'Hara's best selling novel BUtterfield was released as a film with the same name Elizabeth Taylor won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Gloria Wandrous Of the film version Taylor famously said I think it stinks
Ten North Frederick is a film based on O'Hara's novel of the same title Gary Cooper starred as Joe Chapin with Diane Varsi Suzy Parker and Geraldine Fitzgerald in supporting roles O'Hara called Cooper's performance sensitive understanding and true
A Rage to Live is a film directed by Walter Grauman and starring Suzanne Pleshette as Grace Caldwell Tate a well mannered uppercrust beauty whose passions wreak havoc on multiple lives The screenplay by John T Kelley is based on O'Hara's best selling novel of the same name
O'Hara's short stories about Gibbsville were used as the basis for the NBC television movie John O'Hara's Gibbsville also known as The Turning Point of Jim Malloy and for the short lived NBC dramatic television series Gibbsville
The television period drama series Mad Men which aired on cable channel AMC from to generated renewed popular interest in O'Hara's work for the window it opens on the same themes in mid th century American life
In the early s O'Hara wrote a weekly book column Sweet and Sour for the Trenton Times Advertiser and a biweekly column Appointment with O'Hara for Collier's magazine MacShane calls them garrulous and outspoken and says neither added much of importance to O'Hara's work Biographer Shelden Grebstein says that O'Hara in these columns was simultaneously embarrassing and infuriating in his vaingloriousness vindictiveness and general bellicosity Biographer Geoffrey Woolf says these earlier columns anticipated his disastrous 'My Turn' in Newsday which endured fifty three weeks beginning in late of his dismissive and contemptuous worst
His first Newsday column opened with the line Let's get off to a really bad start His second complained the same hysteria that afflicted the Prohibitionists is now evident among the anti cigarettists His third column nominally supported the Republican Party nominee Barry Goldwater for US president by identifying his cause with fans of the corny accordionist and band leader Lawrence Welk I think it's time the Lawrence Welk people had their say wrote O'Hara The Lester Lanin and Dizzy Gillespie people have been on too long When the country is in trouble like war kind of trouble man it is the Lawrence Welk people who can be depended upon all the way In his fifth column he argued that Martin Luther King Jr should not have received the Nobel Peace Prize
The syndicated column was not a success published by a continuously decreasing number of newspapers and did not endear him to the politically liberal New York literary establishment
Several of his columns demonstrate his knowledge of trivia about and yearning for association with Ivy League colleges As he noted Through the years I have acquired a vast amount of information about colleges and universities The May column takes as its ostensible topic the fact that Yale owns stock in American Broadcasting Company and thus is a beneficiary of the television program Peyton Place O'Hara writes
Later he notes that James Gould Cozzens is a genuine Harvard alumnus and speculates that Harvard should broker a television serialization of a Cozzens novel
His September column deals entirely with his failure to have received any honorary degrees going into detail about three honorary degrees he was actually offered but for various reasons did not accept In the column he lists the awards he has received
He complains that the colleges write him highly complimentary letters asking him to perform chores such as officiating as writer in residence judging literary contests and give lectures yet do not give him degree citations The five major distinctions he notes were awarded me by other writers not by academia
