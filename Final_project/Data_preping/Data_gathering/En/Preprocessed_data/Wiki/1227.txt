Dachau ˈdɑːxaʊ was the first concentration camp built by Nazi Germany opening on March The camp was initially intended to intern Hitler's political opponents which consisted of communists social democrats and other dissidents It is located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory northeast of the medieval town of Dachau about km mi northwest of Munich in the state of Bavaria in southern Germany After its opening by Heinrich Himmler its purpose was enlarged to include forced labor and eventually the imprisonment of Jews Romani German and Austrian criminals and finally foreign nationals from countries that Germany occupied or invaded The Dachau camp system grew to include nearly sub camps which were mostly work camps or Arbeitskommandos and were located throughout southern Germany and Austria The main camp was liberated by US forces on April
Prisoners lived in constant fear of brutal treatment and terror detention including standing cells floggings the so called tree or pole hanging and standing at attention for extremely long periods There were documented deaths at the camp and thousands that are undocumented Approximately of the prisoners were sick at the time of liberation
In the postwar years the Dachau facility served to hold SS soldiers awaiting trial After it held ethnic Germans who had been expelled from eastern Europe and were awaiting resettlement and also was used for a time as a United States military base during the occupation It was finally closed in
There are several religious memorials within the Memorial Site which is open to the public
Dachau served as a prototype and model for the other German concentration camps that followed Almost every community in Germany had members taken away to these camps Newspapers continually reported the removal of the enemies of the Reich to concentration camps As early as a jingle went around Lieber Herr Gott mach mich stumm Das ich nicht nach Dachau komm' Dear God make me dumb silent That I may not to Dachau come
The camp's layout and building plans were developed by Commandant Theodor Eicke and were applied to all later camps He had a separate secure camp near the command center which consisted of living quarters administration and army camps Eicke became the chief inspector for all concentration camps responsible for organizing others according to his model
The Dachau complex included the prisoners' camp which occupied approximately acres and the much larger area of SS training school including barracks factories plus other facilities of around acres
The entrance gate used by prisoners carries the phrase Arbeit macht frei lit 'Work makes free' or Work makes one free contextual English translation Work shall set you free This phrase was also used in several other concentration camps such as Theresienstadt near Prague and Auschwitz I
Dachau was the concentration camp that was in operation the longest from March to April nearly all twelve years of the Nazi regime Dachau's close proximity to Munich where Hitler came to power and where the Nazi Party had its official headquarters made Dachau a convenient location From to the prisoners were mainly German nationals detained for political reasons After the Reichspogromnacht or Kristallnacht male Jewish citizens were deported to concentration camps More than of them were interned in Dachau alone As the German military occupied other European states citizens from across Europe were sent to concentration camps Subsequently the camp was used for prisoners of all sorts from every nation occupied by the forces of the Third Reich
In the postwar years the camp continued in use From through the camp was used by the Allies as a prison for SS officers awaiting trial After when hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were expelled from eastern Europe it held Germans from Czechoslovakia until they could be resettled It also served as a military base for the United States which maintained forces in the country It was closed in At the insistence of survivors various memorials have been constructed and installed here
Demographic statistics vary but they are in the same general range History will likely never know how many people were interned or murdered there due to periods of disruption One source gives a general estimate of over prisoners from more than countries during Nazi rule of whom two thirds were political prisoners including many Catholic priests and nearly one third were Jews prisoners are believed to have been murdered in the camp and almost another in its subcamps primarily from disease malnutrition and suicide In late a typhus epidemic occurred in the camp caused by poor sanitation and overcrowding which caused more than deaths It was followed by an evacuation in which large numbers of the prisoners died Toward the end of the war death marches to and from the camp caused the deaths of numerous unrecorded prisoners After liberation prisoners weakened beyond recovery by the starvation conditions continued to die Two thousand cases of the dread black typhus had already been identified by May and the US Seventh Army was working day and night to alleviate the appalling conditions at the camp Prisoners with typhus a louse borne disease with an incubation period from to days were treated by the th Evacuation Hospital while the th would be the general hospital for the other illnesses There were documented deaths among the patients cared for by the th
Over the years of use as a concentration camp the Dachau administration recorded the intake of prisoners and deaths of Crematoria were constructed to dispose of the deceased Visitors may now walk through the buildings and view the ovens used to cremate bodies which hid the evidence of many deaths It is claimed that in more than prisoners in weakened condition were transported to Hartheim Castle near Linz and were executed by poison gas because they were deemed unfit Between January and April detainees died at KZ Dachau according to a US Army report of though the Dachau administration registered deaths from typhus at the camp over the same period
Dachau was the third concentration camp to be liberated by British or American Allied forces
After the takeover of Bavaria on March Heinrich Himmler then Chief of Police in Munich began to speak with the administration of an unused gunpowder and munitions factory He toured the site to see if it could be used for quartering protective custody prisoners The Concentration Camp at Dachau was opened March with the arrival of about prisoners from Stadelheim Prison in Munich and the Landsberg fortress where Hitler had written Mein Kampf during his imprisonment Himmler announced in the Münchner Neuesten Nachrichten newspaper that the camp could hold up to people and described it as the first concentration camp for political prisoners to be used to restore calm to Germany It became the first regular concentration camp established by the coalition government of the National Socialist German Worker's Party Nazi Party and the German National People's Party dissolved on July
Jehovah's Witnesses homosexuals and emigrants were sent to Dachau after the passage of the Nuremberg Laws which institutionalized racial discrimination In early the SS using prisoner labor initiated construction of a large complex capable of holding prisoners The construction was officially completed in mid August More political opponents and over German and Austrian Jews were sent to the camp after the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland in Sinti and Roma in the hundreds were sent to the camp in and over prisoners were sent to the camp from Poland in Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross inspected the camp in and and documented the harsh conditions
Shortly after the SS was commissioned to supplement the Bavarian police overseeing the Dachau camp the first reports of prisoner deaths at Dachau began to emerge In April Josef Hartinger an official from the Bavarian Justice Ministry and physician Moritz Flamm part time medical examiner arrived at the camp to investigate the deaths in accordance with the Bavarian penal code They noted many inconsistencies between the injuries on the corpses and the camp guards' accounts of the deaths Over a number of months Hartinger and Flamm uncovered clear evidence of murder and compiled a dossier of charges against Hilmar Wäckerle the SS commandant of Dachau Werner Nürnbergk the camp doctor and Josef Mutzbauer the camp's chief administrator Kanzleiobersekretär
In June Hartinger presented the case to his superior Bavarian State Prosecutor Karl Wintersberger Initially supportive of the investigation Wintersberger became reluctant to submit the resulting indictment to the Justice Ministry increasingly under the influence of the SS Hartinger reduced the scope of the dossier to the four clearest cases and Wintersberger signed it after first notifying Himmler as a courtesy
The killings at Dachau suddenly stopped temporarily Wäckerle was transferred to Stuttgart and replaced by Theodor Eicke The indictment and related evidence reached the office of Hans Frank the Bavarian Justice Minister but was intercepted by Gauleiter Adolf Wagner and locked away in a desk only to be discovered by the US Army
In both Hartinger and Wintersberger were transferred to provincial positions Dr Flamm was no longer employed as a medical examiner and was to survive two attempts on his life before his suspicious death in the same year Flamm's thoroughly gathered and documented evidence within Hartiger's indictment ensured that it achieved convictions of senior Nazis at the Nuremberg trials in Wintersberger's complicit behaviour is documented in his own evidence to the Pohl Trial
The prisoners of Dachau concentration camp originally were to serve as forced labor for a munition factory and to expand the camp It was used as a training center for the SS Totenkopfverbände guards and was a model for other concentration camps The camp was about m × m ft × ft in rectangular shape The prisoners' entrance was secured by an iron gate with the motto Arbeit macht frei Work will make you free This reflected Nazi propaganda which had concentration camps as labor and re education camps This was their original purpose but the focus was soon shifted to using forced labor as a method of torture and murder The original slogan was left on the gates
As of the procedure for new arrivals occurred at the Schubraum where prisoners were to hand over their clothing and possessions One former Luxembourgian prisoner Albert Theis reflected about the room There we were stripped of all our clothes Everything had to be handed over money rings watches One was now stark naked
The camp included an administration building that contained offices for the Gestapo trial commissioner SS authorities the camp leader and his deputies These administration offices consisted of large storage rooms for the personal belongings of prisoners the bunker roll call square where guards would also inflict punishment on prisoners especially those who tried to escape the canteen where prisoners served SS men with cigarettes and food the museum containing plaster images of prisoners who suffered from bodily defects the camp office the library the barracks and the infirmary which was staffed by prisoners who had previously held occupations such as physicians or army surgeons
Over Soviet prisoners of war were murdered by the Dachau commandant's guard at the SS shooting range located at Hebertshausen two kilometers from the main camp in the years These murders were a clear violation of the provisions laid down in the Geneva Convention for prisoners of war The SS used the cynical term Sonderbehandlung special treatment for these criminal executions The first executions of the Soviet prisoners of war at the Hebertshausen shooting range took place on November
After the number of prisoners being held at the camp continued to exceed Dachau originally held communists leading socialists and other enemies of the state in but over time the Nazis began to send German Jews to the camp In the early years of imprisonment Jews were offered permission to emigrate overseas if they voluntarily gave their property to enhance Hitler's public treasury Once Austria was annexed and Czechoslovakia was dissolved the citizens of both countries became the next prisoners at Dachau In Dachau became filled with Polish prisoners who continued to be the majority of the prisoner population until Dachau was officially liberated
The prisoner enclosure at the camp was heavily guarded to ensure that no prisoners escaped A metre wide ft no man's land was the first marker of confinement for prisoners an area which upon entry would elicit lethal gunfire from guard towers Guards are known to have tossed inmates' caps into this area resulting in the death of the prisoners when they attempted to retrieve the caps Despondent prisoners committed suicide by entering the zone A four foot deep and eight foot broad × m creek connected with the river Amper lay on the west side between the neutral zone and the electrically charged and barbed wire fence which surrounded the entire prisoner enclosure
In August a women's camp opened inside Dachau In the last months of the war the conditions at Dachau deteriorated As Allied forces advanced toward Germany the Germans began to move prisoners from concentration camps near the front to more centrally located camps They hoped to prevent the liberation of large numbers of prisoners Transports from the evacuated camps arrived continuously at Dachau After days of travel with little or no food or water the prisoners arrived weak and exhausted often near death Typhus epidemics became a serious problem as a result of overcrowding poor sanitary conditions insufficient provisions and the weakened state of the prisoners
Owing to repeated transports from the front the camp was constantly overcrowded and the hygiene conditions were beneath human dignity Starting from the end of up to the day of liberation people died about half of all the prisoners held at KZ Dachau Five hundred Soviet POWs were executed by firing squad The first shipment of women came from Auschwitz Birkenau
As late as April prisoners were sent to KZ Dachau on that date a freight train from Buchenwald with nearly was diverted to Nammering SS troops and police confiscated food and water that local townspeople tried to give to the prisoners Nearly three hundred dead bodies were ordered removed from the train and carried to a ravine over metres ⁄ mi away The prisoners who had been forced to carry the dead to this site were then shot by the guards and buried along with those who had died on the train Nearly bodies went into this mass grave The train continued on to KZ Dachau
During April as US troops drove deeper into Bavaria the commander of KZ Dachau suggested to Himmler that the camp be turned over to the Allies Himmler in signed correspondence prohibited such a move adding that No prisoners shall be allowed to fall into the hands of the enemy alive
On April just days before the US troops arrived at the camp the commandant and a strong guard forced between and surviving inmates on a death march from Dachau south to Eurasburg then eastwards towards the Tegernsee liberated two days after Hitler's death by a Nisei ethnicity US Army artillery battalion Any prisoners who could not keep up on the six day march were shot Many others died of exhaustion hunger and exposure Months later a mass grave containing prisoners was found along the route
Though at the time of liberation the death rate had peaked at per day after the liberation by US forces the rate eventually fell to between and deaths per day In addition to the direct abuse of the SS and the harsh conditions people died from typhus epidemics and starvation The number of inmates had peaked in with transports from evacuated camps in the east such as Auschwitz and the resulting overcrowding led to an increase in the death rate
Dachau was opened in March The press statement given at the opening stated
On Wednesday the first concentration camp is to be opened in Dachau with an accommodation for people 'All Communists and—where necessary—Reichsbanner and Social Democratic functionaries who endanger state security are to be concentrated here as in the long run it is not possible to keep individual functionaries in the state prisons without overburdening these prisons and on the other hand these people cannot be released because attempts have shown that they persist in their efforts to agitate and organize as soon as they are releasedWhatever the publicly stated purpose of the camp the SS men who arrived there on May were left in no illusion as to its real purpose by the speech given on that day by Johann Erasmus Freiherr von Malsen Ponickau
Comrades of the SS You all know what the Fuehrer has called us to do We have not come here for human encounters with those pigs in there We do not consider them human beings as we are but as second class people For years they have been able to continue their criminal existence But now we are in power If those pigs had come to power they would have cut off all our heads Therefore we have no room for sentimentalism If anyone here cannot bear to see the blood of comrades he does not belong and had better leave The more of these pig dogs we strike down the fewer we need to feedBetween the years and more than million Germans were imprisoned in such concentration camps or prison for political reasons Approximately Germans were killed for one or another form of resistance by Special Courts courts martial and the civil justice system Many of these Germans had served in government the military or in civil positions which were considered to enable them to engage in subversion and conspiracy against the Nazis
The camp was divided into two sections the camp area and the crematorium The camp area consisted of barracks including one for clergy imprisoned for opposing the Nazi regime and one reserved for medical experiments The courtyard between the prison and the central kitchen was used for the summary execution of prisoners The camp was surrounded by an electrified barbed wire fence a ditch and a wall with seven guard towers
In early the SS using prisoner labor initiated construction of a large complex of buildings on the grounds of the original camp The construction was officially completed in mid August and the camp remained essentially unchanged and in operation until A crematorium that was next to but not directly accessible from within the camp was erected in KZ Dachau was therefore the longest running concentration camp of the Third Reich The Dachau complex included other SS facilities beside the concentration camp—a leader school of the economic and civil service the medical school of the SS etc The camp at that time was called a protective custody camp and occupied less than half of the area of the entire complex
Hundreds of prisoners suffered and died or were executed in medical experiments conducted at KZ Dachau of which Sigmund Rascher was in charge Hypothermia experiments involved exposure to vats of icy water or being strapped down naked outdoors in freezing temperatures Attempts at reviving the subjects included scalding baths and forcing naked women to have sex with the unconscious victim Nearly prisoners died during these experiments The original records of the experiments were destroyed in an attempt to conceal the atrocities
Extensive communication between the investigators and Heinrich Himmler head of the SS documents the experiments
During high altitude experiments were conducted Victims were subjected to rapid decompression to pressures found at metres ft and experienced spasmodic convulsions agonal breathing and eventual death
The camp was originally designed for holding German and Austrian political prisoners and Jews but in it began to be used also for ordinary criminals Inside the camp there was a sharp division between the two groups of prisoners those who were there for political reasons and therefore wore a red tag and the criminals who wore a green tag The political prisoners who were there because they disagreed with Nazi Party policies or with Hitler naturally did not consider themselves criminals Dachau was used as the chief camp for Christian mainly Catholic clergy who were imprisoned for not conforming with the Nazi Party line
During the war other nationals were transferred to it including French in Poles in people from the Balkans Czechs Yugoslavs and in Russians
Prisoners were divided into categories At first they were classified by the nature of the crime for which they were accused but eventually were classified by the specific authority type under whose command a person was sent to camp Political prisoners who had been arrested by the Gestapo wore a red badge professional criminals sent by the Criminal Courts wore a green badge Cri Po prisoners arrested by the criminal police wore a brown badge work shy and asocial people sent by the welfare authorities or the Gestapo wore a black badge Jehovah's Witnesses arrested by the Gestapo wore a violet badge homosexuals sent by the criminal courts wore a pink badge emigrants arrested by the Gestapo wore a blue badge race polluters arrested by the criminal court or Gestapo wore badges with a black outline second termers arrested by the Gestapo wore a bar matching the color of their badge idiots wore a white armband with the label Blöd Stupid Romani wore a black triangle and Jews whose incarceration in the Dachau concentration camp dramatically increased after Kristallnacht wore a yellow badge combined with another color
The average number of Germans in the camp during the war was Just before the liberation many German prisoners were evacuated but of these Germans died during the evacuation transport Evacuated prisoners included such prominent political and religious figures as Martin Niemöller Kurt von Schuschnigg Édouard Daladier Léon Blum Franz Halder and Hjalmar Schacht
In an effort to counter the strength and influence of spiritual resistance Nazi security services monitored clergy very closely Priests were frequently denounced arrested and sent to concentration camps often simply on the basis of being suspected of activities hostile to the State or that there was reason to suppose that his dealings might harm society Despite SS hostility to religious observance the Vatican and German bishops successfully lobbied the regime to concentrate clergy at one camp and obtained permission to build a chapel for the priests to live communally and for time to be allotted to them for their religious and intellectual activity Priests Barracks at Dachau were established in Blocks and though only temporarily became the international block and was reserved for Poles the most numerous group
Of a total of clergy recorded as imprisoned at Dachau the overwhelming majority some or were Catholic Among the other denominations there were Protestants Greek Orthodox Old Catholics and Mariavites and Muslims In his Dachau The Official History Paul Berben noted that R Schnabel's investigation Die Frommen in der Hölle The Pious Ones in Hell found an alternative total of and included the fate all the clergy listed with noted as deceased and sent out on invalid trainloads and therefore presumed dead Over German priests were sent to Dachau Total numbers incarcerated are nonetheless difficult to assert for some clergy were not recognised as such by the camp authorities and some—particularly Poles—did not wish to be identified as such fearing they would be mistreated
The Nazis introduced a racial hierarchy—keeping Poles in harsh conditions while favoring German priests Poles arrived in December and a further of mainly elderly clergy arrived in October the following year Inadequately clothed for the bitter cold of this group only survived A large number of Polish priests were chosen for Nazi medical experiments In November were given phlegmons were used by Dr Schilling for malaria experiments between July and May Several Poles met their deaths with the invalid trains sent out from the camp others were liquidated in the camp and given bogus death certificates Some died of cruel punishment for misdemeanors—beaten to death or run to exhaustion
The camp staff consisted mostly of male SS although female guards served at Dachau as well most of them until liberation Sixteen have been identified including Fanny Baur Leopoldine Bittermann Ernestine Brenner Anna Buck Rosa Dolaschko Maria Eder Rosa Grassmann Betty Hanneschaleger Ruth Elfriede Hildner Josefa Keller Berta Kimplinger Lieselotte Klaudat Theresia Kopp Rosalie Leimboeck and Thea Miesl Female guards were also assigned to the Augsburg Michelwerke Burgau Kaufering Mühldorf and Munich Agfa Camera Werke subcamps In mid April female subcamps at Kaufering Augsburg and Munich were closed and the SS stationed the women at Dachau Several Norwegians worked as guards at the Dachau camp
In the major Dachau war crimes case United States of America v Martin Gottfried Weiss etal forty two officials of Dachau were tried from November to December All were found guilty thirty six of the defendants were sentenced to death on December of whom were hanged on May including the commandant SS Obersturmbannführer Martin Gottfried Weiss SS Obersturmführer Freidrich Wilhelm Ruppert and camp doctors Karl Schilling and Fritz Hintermeyer Camp commandant Weiss admitted in affidavit testimony that most of the deaths at Dachau during his administration were due to typhus TB dysentery pneumonia pleurisy and body weakness brought about by lack of food His testimony also admitted to deaths by shootings hangings and medical experiments Ruppert ordered and supervised the deaths of innumerable prisoners at Dachau main and subcamps according to the War Crimes Commission official trial transcript He testified about hangings shootings and lethal injections but did not admit to direct responsibility for any individual deaths An anonymous Dutch prisoner contended that British Special Operations Executive SOE agent Noor Inayat Khan was cruelly beaten by SS officer Wilhelm Ruppert before being shot from behind the beating may have been the actual cause of her death
Satellite camps under the authority of Dachau were established in the summer and autumn of near armaments factories throughout southern Germany to increase war production Dachau alone had more than large subcamps and hundreds of smaller ones in which over prisoners worked almost exclusively on armaments
Overall the Dachau concentration camp system included sub camps and Kommandos which were set up in when factories were built near the main camp to make use of forced labor of the Dachau prisoners Out of the sub camps eleven of them were called Kaufering distinguished by a number at the end of each All Kaufering sub camps were set up to specifically build three underground factories Allied bombing raids made it necessary for them to be underground for a project called Ringeltaube wood pigeon which planned to be the location in which the German jet fighter plane Messerschmitt Me was to be built In the last days of war in April the Kaufering camps were evacuated and around prisoners were sent up to the main Dachau camp Typhus alone was estimated to have caused deaths between December and April Within the first month after the arrival of the American troops prisoners were treated for malnutrition and kindred diseases In spite of this one hundred prisoners died each day during the first month from typhus dysentery or general weakness
As US Army troops neared the Dachau sub camp at Landsberg on April the SS officer in charge ordered that prisoners be murdered Windows and doors of their huts were nailed shut The buildings were then doused with gasoline and set afire Prisoners who were naked or nearly so were burned to death while some managed to crawl out of the buildings before dying Earlier that day as Wehrmacht troops withdrew from Landsberg am Lech towns people hung white sheets from their windows Infuriated SS troops dragged German civilians from their homes and hanged them from trees
As the Allies began to advance on Nazi Germany the SS began to evacuate the first concentration camps in summer Thousands of prisoners were killed before the evacuation due to being ill or unable to walk At the end of the overcrowding of camps began to take its toll on the prisoners The unhygienic conditions and the supplies of food rations became disastrous In November a typhus fever epidemic broke out that took thousands of lives
In the second phase of the evacuation in April Himmler gave direct evacuation routes for remaining camps Prisoners who were from the northern part of Germany were to be directed to the Baltic and North Sea coasts to be drowned The prisoners from the southern part were to be gathered in the Alps which was the location in which the SS wanted to resist the Allies On April an armed revolt took place in the town of Dachau Both former and escaped concentration camp prisoners and a renegade Volkssturm civilian militia company took part At about am the rebels occupied the Town Hall The SS gruesomely suppressed the revolt within a few hours
Being fully aware that Germany was about to be defeated in World War II the SS invested its time in removing evidence of the crimes it committed in the concentration camps They began destroying incriminating evidence in April and planned on murdering the prisoners using codenames Wolke A I Cloud A and Wolkenbrand Cloud fire However these plans were not carried out In mid April plans to evacuate the camp started by sending prisoners toward Tyrol On April over prisoners were forced to leave the Dachau concentration camp on foot in trains or in trucks The largest group of some prisoners was driven southward on a foot march lasting several days More than prisoners did not survive this march The evacuation transports cost many thousands of prisoners their lives
On April prisoner Karl Riemer fled the Dachau concentration camp to get help from American troops and on April Victor Maurer a representative of the International Red Cross negotiated an agreement to surrender the camp to US troops That night a secretly formed International Prisoners Committee took over the control of the camp Units of rd Battalion th Infantry Regiment th Infantry Division commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Felix L Sparks were ordered to secure the camp On April Sparks led part of his battalion as they entered the camp over a side wall At about the same time Brigadier General Henning Linden led the nd Infantry Regiment of the nd Rainbow Infantry Division soldiers including his aide Lieutenant William Cowling to accept the formal surrender of the camp from German Lieutenant Heinrich Wicker at an entrance between the camp and the compound for the SS garrison Linden was traveling with Marguerite Higgins and other reporters as a result Linden's detachment generated international headlines by accepting the surrender of the camp More than Jews and political prisoners were freed and since adherents of the nd and th Division versions of events have argued over which unit was the first to liberate Dachau
The first Dachau subcamp discovered by advancing Allied forces was Kaufering IV by the th Armored Division on April Subcamps liberated by the th Armored Division included Erpting Schrobenhausen Schwabing Langerringen Türkheim Lauingen Schwabach Germering
During the liberation of the sub camps surrounding Dachau advance scouts of the US Army's nd Field Artillery Battalion a segregated battalion consisting of Nisei nd generation Japanese Americans liberated the prisoners of the Kaufering IV Hurlach slave labor camp Perisco describes an Office of Strategic Services OSS team code name LUXE leading Army Intelligence to a Camp IV on April They found the camp afire and a stack of some four hundred bodies burning American soldiers then went into Landsberg and rounded up all the male civilians they could find and marched them out to the camp The former commandant was forced to lie amidst a pile of corpses The male population of Landsberg was then ordered to walk by and ordered to spit on the commandant as they passed The commandant was then turned over to a group of liberated camp survivors The nd's personnel later discovered the survivors of a death march headed generally southwards from the Dachau main camp to Eurasburg then eastwards towards the Austrian border on May just west of the town of Waakirchen
Weather at the time of liberation was unseasonably cool and temperatures trended down through the first two days of May on May the area received a snowstorm with centimetres in of snow at nearby Munich Proper clothing was still scarce and film footage from the time as seen in The World at War shows naked gaunt people either wandering on snow or dead under it
Due to the number of sub camps over a large area that comprised the Dachau concentration camp complex many Allied units have been officially recognized by the United States Army Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as liberating units of Dachau including

American troops killed some of the camp guards after they had surrendered The number is disputed as some were killed in combat some while attempting to surrender and others after their surrender was accepted In Brigadier General Felix L Sparks the Colonel in command of a battalion that was present stated
An Inspector General report resulting from a US Army investigation conducted between and May and titled American Army Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau found that plus a number of presumed SS men were killed with others being wounded after their surrender had been accepted In addition to SS guards were estimated to have been killed by the liberated prisoners Lee Miller visited the camp just after liberation and photographed several guards who were killed by soldiers or prisoners
According to Sparks court martial charges were drawn up against him and several other men under his command but General George S Patton who had recently been appointed military governor of Bavaria chose to dismiss the charges
Colonel Charles L Decker an acting deputy judge advocate concluded in late that while war crimes had been committed at Dachau by Germany Certainly there was no such systematic criminality among United States forces as pervaded the Nazi groups in Germany
American troops also forced local citizens to the camp to see for themselves the conditions there and to help bury the dead Many local residents were shocked about the experience and claimed no knowledge of the activities at the camp
May April on the Orthodox calendar was the day of Pascha Orthodox Easter In a cell block used by Catholic priests to say daily Mass several Greek Serbian and Russian priests and one Serbian deacon wearing makeshift vestments made from towels of the SS guard gathered with several hundred Greek Serbian and Russian prisoners to celebrate the Paschal Vigil A prisoner named Rahr described the scene
There is a Russian Orthodox chapel at the camp today and it is well known for its icon of Christ leading the prisoners out of the camp gates
Authorities worked night and day to alleviate conditions at the camp immediately following the liberation as an epidemic of black typhus swept through the prisoner population Two thousand cases had already been reported by May
By October of the same year the camp was being used by the US Army as a place of confinement for war criminals the SS and important witnesses It was also the site of the Dachau Trials for German war criminals a site chosen for its symbolism In the Bavarian government established housing for refugees on the site and this remained for many years Among those held in the Dachau internment camp set up under the US Army were Elsa Ehrich Maria Mandl and Elisabeth Ruppert
The Kaserne quarters and other buildings used by the guards and trainee guards were converted and served as the Eastman Barracks an American military post After the closure of the Eastman Barracks in these areas are now occupied by the Bavarian Bereitschaftspolizei rapid response police unit
By January members of the SS were being confined at the camp along with an additional persons including deserters from the Russian army and had number who had been captured in German Army uniform The occupants of two barracks rioted as of the Russian deserters were to be loaded onto trains that would return them to Russian controlled lands as agreed at the Yalta Conference Inmates barricaded themselves inside two barracks While the first was able to be cleared without too much trouble those in the second building set fire to it tore off their clothing in an effort to frustrate the guards and linked arms to resist being removed from the building Tear gas was used by the American soldiers before rushing the barrack only for them to find that many had committed suicide
The American services newspaper Stars and Stripes reported
The GIs quickly cut down most of those who had hanged themselves from the rafters Those still conscious were screaming in Russian pointing first at the guns of the guards then at themselves begging to us to shootTen of the soldiers were successful in their bid to commit suicide during the riot while another attempted suicide apparently with razor blades Many had cracked heads inflicted by American guards in the attempt to bring the situation under control
