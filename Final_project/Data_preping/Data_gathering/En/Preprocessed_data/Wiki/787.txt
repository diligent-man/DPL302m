the elite ice hockey league eihl sometimes referred to as the british elite league or for sponsorship reasons the premier sports elite league is an ice hockey league in the united kingdom
formed in following the demise of the ice hockey superleague it is the highest level of ice hockey competition in the united kingdom
the league operate three competitions for members the play offs determine the national champion following a regular season league competition for which separate champions are also crowned
finally a stand alone cup competition the challenge cup is also held annually beginning with the group stages followed by a knock out format
the league currently consists of one division of ten teams with representation from all four nations of the united kingdom the only league in any sport to do so
in fourteen completed seasons the league championship has been won by five different teams
the day to day operation of the league is overseen by chairman tony smith director of hockey andy french and a board of directors
disciplinary matters are handled by director of discipline and former referee simon kirkham
the level below the elite league is the national ice hockey league
a system of promotion and relegation is not operated by the elite league teams enter the league on the basis of a decision by the board of directors
british ice hockey s structure underwent a major reorganisation in
the british hockey league the highest senior competition since featuring the top two divisions of the sport was disbanded and replaced by the ice hockey superleague top tier and british national league second tier
the loss of the cardiff devils and the newcastle jesters in reduced the membership of the superleague to seven and when the manchester storm and the scottish eagles folded within a week of one another at the beginning of the season there were just five remaining teams
in december the bracknell bees announced their intention to resign from the league to join the bnl at the end of the season and uncertainty surrounded the future of the london knights and their london arena home which ultimately led to the knights folding in
owing a large debt to ice hockey uk and facing the prospect of having only three members the league placed itself into liquidation on april
the three remaining clubs belfast giants nottingham panthers and sheffield steelers began considering the formation of a new league with a lower wage cap and larger commitment to british players to attract other clubs into joining them
in the weeks that followed they were joined by the basingstoke bison cardiff devils and coventry blaze of the british national league and two new organisations from london and manchester
a team based in glasgow was also planned but did not come to fruition
the new league met considerable opposition from the british national league and the governing body ice hockey uk
the ihuk wished for the remaining superleague clubs to integrate themselves into the bnl and initially refused to grant the new league affiliation
the superleague clubs were reluctant to join the predominantly british trained league after several years of playing in an import dominated league where british players were seldom able to step up to the standard of their north american and european counterparts
the elite league instead preferred a twelve import limit with the rest of the team being british trained players
the refusal to grant affiliation caused a bitter row that showed little sign of being resolved
despite not having the support of the governing body the new league continued their plans
no affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches
the row also threatened the future of the nottingham panthers as the national ice centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league to hire their arena
the issue was resolved in august when the panthers and the nic announced an icetime agreement
the eihl finally gained affiliation in august with only weeks to go before the beginning of the new season
the new league began on september when the sheffield steelers who went on to become the inaugural league champions defeated the newly formed london racers at alexandra palace
charles prince of wales dropped the first puck after unveiling a plaque
the racers endured a difficult first season moving to a different rink only weeks into the season and having to wait games to record a win a victory over the cardiff devils
the racers finished the season with points points behind second to last basingstoke
the other new team the manchester phoenix fared slightly better qualifying for the playoff finals after finishing sixth in the league where they were defeated by nottingham in the semifinal
the club played at the capacity men arena which had been home to the manchester storm but phoenix crowds averaged well below the break even mark of
late in the season the phoenix choose to play a game at icesheffield rather than pay the considerable cost of hiring the arena for a mid week game which usually had lower attendances
in the close season they allowed fans to vote on the option of either suspending playing operations while a new rink was constructed or playing in exile away from manchester while a new rink was built
supporters opted to suspend playing operations pending the construction of a new facility
the second season of the eihl saw a series of games between the eihl clubs and the members of the bnl
in addition to three home games and three away games against their elite opponents each club also played one home game and one away game against the bnl clubs in crossover match ups
results in these crossover games counted towards a team s points tally
the nhl lock out also saw a number of nhl players join british clubs
coventry won all three titles winning the championship with an overtime victory over the nottingham panthers
the crossover games with the bnl clubs were seen by many to be the first stage towards an amalgamation of the two organizations into one league essentially reforming the original bhl
however early in the season it was revealed that two teams from the bnl the edinburgh capitals and newcastle vipers were seeking to resign from the bnl and join the eihl preferring the standard of hockey that the eihl had to offer
a withdrawal of these clubs would leave the bnl with only five remaining participating teams
this situation led to the resigning teams temporarily withdrawing their elite league applications and entering into collective discussions on the entire bnl joining the eihl instead
the elite league offered the bnl clubs invitations to join the eihl structure which were declined by the remaining teams due to unfavourable terms
subsequently the capitals and vipers both resubmitted individual applications to the elite league both of which were accepted
this ultimately led to the dissolution of the bnl with the five remaining teams joining the next tier of british hockey which consisted of the english premier ice hockey league in england and the scottish national league in scotland
with the edinburgh capitals and newcastle vipers becoming the ninth and tenth members of the league the season began with nine clubs manchester had opted to take another season out with no rink yet constructed
however in november the london racers withdrew their team from competition and immediately ceased operations
from their formation the racers had suffered problems finding a rink with comparable facilities to those of their rivals and they had maintained only a very small fan base
the club had made the lee valley ice centre their home after playing only a small number of games at the alexandra palace in their first season
the facilities were very basic seating only people with an overall capacity of barely
in november during a game against the nottingham panthers panthers player bla emer i suffered a serious facial injury after colliding with a protruding object in the boards
further concerns were raised when a game against the sheffield steelers was abandoned after a piece of plexiglas shattered in an irregular manner injuring a spectator
when a similar event took place during practice a few days later the racers management began to question seriously the safety of the rink
with the ice centre unable to ensure the safety of players and spectators at elite league games the racers were forced to suspend team operations effective immediately
in january the manchester phoenix were granted planning permission to construct a new rink in altrincham
a few weeks later the cardiff devils also received planning permission for the construction of a new rink
the wales national ice rink was earmarked for demolition and a campaign for the council to provide a new facility proved successful
with both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season speculation began about the possible inclusion of a tenth team to replace the london racers
after the season was over rumours about the possible admission of either hull or dundee became more and more widespread
on june the hull stingrays were formally elected into the elite ice hockey league as the tenth active member
in june the eihl announced the adoption of the zero tolerance interpretation of the rules with regard to holding hooking and interference implemented in the national hockey league during the season
these rules had proved highly successful in the nhl increasing the pace of the game and leading to a rise in spectator numbers
on august the elite league announced a sponsorship deal with the low cost airline bmibaby
the agreement saw the company s name incorporated into the league s title and the airline s branding at each of the league s ten arenas
the deal was intended to last for seven seasons but ended prematurely during the season
on april the manchester phoenix announced that they would withdraw from the league and play instead in the english premier ice hockey league due to cost issues
this news followed the announcement that the basingstoke bison were also leaving to play in the epl for the season

the braehead clan were announced as the ninth team for the season
on april the dundee stars were unanimously accepted into the league by the eihl board as the tenth team

however after a takeover from the coventry blaze on august the hull stingrays confirmed that they would indeed be participating in the league for the season
the stingrays again withdrew on june as the club announced on its official website that it has been placed into liquidation
from the season onwards the league has consisted of two conferences each consisting of five teams
these are the erhardt conference and the gardiner conference
these can roughly be split into north and south with the erhardt featuring the teams from belfast cardiff coventry nottingham and sheffield and the gardiner featuring the teams from dundee edinburgh fife and glasgow along with hull stingrays until and their replacements manchester storm from onwards
on april it was announced that the milton keynes lightning and guildford flames were joining for the start of the season and that the league schedule would be increased to games in the regular season with three new conferences of four teams
conference would consist of the braehead clan dundee stars edinburgh capitals and fife flyers known as the scottish conference
conference would consist of the coventry blaze guildford flames manchester storm and milton keynes lightning known as the southern conference
conference would consist of the belfast giants cardiff devils nottingham panthers and sheffield steelers known as the arena teams
this meant that teams would play teams in their own conference eight times four home and four away totaling games and play the other conference s teams four times two home and two away totaling games giving the league a total of games
in april when the murrayfield ice rink asked for bidders for the ice time at the arena the edinburgh capitals and murrayfield racers a newly formed team bid for the rights with the racers winning the opportunity
the racers asked for permission to join the eihl but on april the league refused their application and they subsequently joined the scottish national league snl
on may the eihl released a statement explaining that they would have to move forward without the edinburgh capitals with a board meeting on may to discuss the league future format and decide on any clubs wishing to participate in place of edinburgh

the three conference format was also scrapped
the eihl season was cancelled in march due to the covid pandemic
only the challenge cup won by sheffield steelers was awarded with both the league and play offs cancelled
the eihl season originally scheduled for a september start was suspended indefinitely on september due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions and continuing social distancing which made the league season a non starter
while there were tentative plans for a shortened league season featuring a handful of sides to potentially begin play in january this idea and the prospect of a season were shelved by the league in february due to concerns around funding
then in march the elite league announced that four of the english teams coventry manchester nottingham and sheffield would take part in the elite series between april may a total of games to be played at nottingham s motorpoint arena culminating in a best of three play off final series
nottingham claimed the trophy by virtue of a series win over the sheffield steelers in the final winning game one and game two

wayne scholes owner of the telford tigers currently in the english premier league has stated that his organisation does not have any immediate plans to make the step up but has not ruled out the possibility of joining the eihl in the future saying that we have had conversations with the elite league before but they have to invite you
you can t approach them
it is one of those things where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success
they want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard and then they will reach out
at that point it s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are
elite league teams rely heavily on players from outside the united kingdom termed imports
the majority of these players are from north america and typically played in the minor north american leagues such as the echl and ahl before coming to britain
for example of the players to play for champions belfast giants in the season were canadian were british and were american
the league restricts the number of import players which can be dressed for a game with a current limit of imports
player turnover is high with a large proportion of players spending a single season at a team before moving on and multi year contracts are uncommon
as would be expected in a league dominated by north american players the style of ice hockey in britain is similar to that played in north america and has a more physical style than that played in other technically natured european countries
this was demonstrated during the nhl lock out
of the nhl players to join elite league teams the majority were players noted for physical play rather than puck handling skills such as wade belak and eric cairns
while british players account for a minority of elite league players the league supplies the majority of players for the great britain team
all players in the great britain squad for the world championships played for elite league teams in the preceding season
in the s and s sky sports and the bbc s grandstand programme covered the british hockey league and superleague and their important games and competitions regularly
however in the superleague sold its broadcasting rights to premium tv ltd who planned to set up a new sports channel which never materialised
british ice hockey was left without coverage from any television network
this situation continued through the final seasons of the superleague and into the first seasons of the elite league
in elite league officials concluded an agreement with the north american sports network to provide a weekly highlights and news programme
these usually provide highlights from a game recorded the previous weekend and are an hour in length
in september the elite league announced a deal with sky sports for a weekly show of elite league highlights
in sky sports showed the playoff final between the belfast giants and cardiff devils live the first time sky had shown a live game for several years
sky sports have recently announced plans to show live games along with a weekly highlight show during the season
in the season premier sports acquired the rights to film and broadcast games from the elite league with a live game shown every saturday night from november onwards
on december it was announced that a new tv show called facing off would be broadcast on a uk free to air channel called front runner tv every thursday friday and saturday to show the highlights of the week s eihl games
the deal ran to the end of eihl season
then on july the eihl agreed a two year deal with freesports to broadcast one live eihl game every two weeks alongside a pre season preview show highlights package and live coverage of the end of season play off final
the coverage which is available via freeview sky virgin freesat talktalk bt vision and online via the tvplayer will be fronted by aaron murphy who previously commentated on the league for premier sports
in january the league announced that premier sports would show live coverage of the challenge cup final and elite league play off final
in september the league confirmed that premier sports had become headline sponsors and the eihl s exclusive television partners for three seasons beginning from the season
coverage would again be fronted by aaron murphy with analysis from paul adey and consist of live matches including league games the challenge cup final and the end of season play off final weekend
during this time the league will be known as the premier sports elite league
ice hockey receives little national media coverage in the united kingdom
some national newspapers list results and provide short summaries of the league s news but more extensive coverage remains minimal
there was a small surge in interest during the season when newspapers such as the times reported on the nhl players playing the elite league as a result of the lock out but since the lock out ended coverage has returned to its previous levels
of the national newspapers only the daily star has a regular ice hockey column which appears on tuesday and sunday
coverage in the towns and cities where elite league clubs are based is more extensive and local newspapers have dedicated ice hockey reporters who cover the local team
local radio stations such as bbc coventry warwickshire bbc radio nottingham and bbc radio sheffield all provide programming on the sport
radio sheffield also provides a weekly ice hockey programme iceline while radio nottingham has broadcast a similar programme powerplay since the later stages of the season and has a minute weekly preview of games on saturday evenings during the ice hockey season after the station s coverage of the local football teams is completed
bbc coventry warwickshire have also followed suit with faceoff a programme broadcast on the first thursday of the month during the season
the cardiff devils are given weekly highlights coverage on local tv station made in cardiff which is available on freeview ch sky guide ch and virgin ch
most of the teams also provide webcasts on match nights
in attendance the eihl ranks seventh among the european top leagues with a average
three teams are among the top of the continent challenge cup champions nottingham panthers at th average the league champions sheffield steelers at th and the league champions belfast giants at th
previously the eihl champions were invited to play in the continental cup europe s second level club competition
for the tournament the eihl s entrants began the tournament in the penultimate third group stage
however with the introduction of the champions hockey league this has changed
from the season the top two teams in the eihl participate in the chl with either the team that wins the post season playoffs or the team finishing third if the playoffs winner is one of the top two entering the continental cup
during the nhl lockout several nhl players plied their trade in the elite league including matt beleskey paul bissonnette drew miller tom sestito and anthony stewart
the league has had a reputation for attracting ex nhl players including dustin kohn who played for the sheffield steelers kevin westgarth who played for the belfast giants cam janssen formerly of the nottingham panthers ex braehead clan captain matt keith and stefan della rovere ryan o marra of the coventry blaze and brian mcgrattan who played for the nottingham panthers
elsewhere jared staal brother of nhlers eric marc and jordan played a season for the edinburgh capitals while patrick bordeleau played a season with the cardiff devils
other recent ex nhl players in the league include jason williams ric jackman jay rosehill jim vandermeer pavel vorobyev michael garnett tim wallace aaron johnson dylan olsen patrick dwyer and chris stewart
meanwhile in being drafted by the arizona coyotes in sheffield steelers forward liam kirk became the first english born and trained player to be drafted by an nhl side
kirk signed a three year entry level contract with arizona in june
the main criticism levelled at the eihl is that the league is too expensive an accusation given credence by the collapse of the london racers mid season in and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs most notably the basingstoke bison and manchester phoenix in
both the edinburgh capitals and newcastle vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations casting further doubt over both their own and the league s sustained viability
this perceived problem with expenditure was given further credence when the hull stingrays announced on august that they were ceasing operations immediately due to insufficient funds from sponsorships to guarantee completing the season
they were however taken over on august by the coventry blaze and therefore the hull stingrays continued to operate
however hull did fold in
in the newcastle vipers announced that they would not be able to compete in the season due to financial difficulties and lack of a permanent home stadium
newcastle had up to this point been playing their home games at whitley bay ice rink
a proposed new stadium in the newcastle area did not materialise
despite there being a limited number of suitable venues for league expansion there have been various attempts during the eihl s lifespan to expand the league
after the successful addition of the braehead clan and the dundee stars for the season the eihl reported that it had entered discussions with the fife flyers formerly of the defunct bnl and then resident in the snl
on june it was confirmed that the fife flyers had been admitted to the eihl in time for the commencement of the season
further to this neil black owner of the nottingham panthers and glasgow clan has expressed the desire to see a manchester team back in the eihl by along with teams in dublin and london subject to there being suitable venues available
in mid stories began to circulate that the eihl had approached aeg with the intention of placing a london based franchise into wembley arena
league chairman tony smith confirmed that a franchise had been awarded to a london based group for a franchise located within the capital
on march it was announced that the milton keynes lightning playing in the second tier english premier league would be joining the elite league for the season
they remained in the league for two seasons
