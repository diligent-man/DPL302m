The Elite Ice Hockey League EIHL sometimes referred to as the British Elite League or for sponsorship reasons the Premier Sports Elite League is an ice hockey league in the United Kingdom Formed in following the demise of the Ice Hockey Superleague it is the highest level of ice hockey competition in the United Kingdom The league operate three competitions for members the play offs determine the national champion following a regular season league competition for which separate champions are also crowned Finally a stand alone cup competition the Challenge Cup is also held annually beginning with the group stages followed by a knock out format
The league currently consists of one division of ten teams with representation from all four nations of the United Kingdom the only league in any sport to do so In fourteen completed seasons the league championship has been won by five different teams
The day to day operation of the league is overseen by chairman Tony Smith director of hockey Andy French and a board of directors Disciplinary matters are handled by director of discipline and former referee Simon Kirkham The level below the Elite League is the National Ice Hockey League A system of promotion and relegation is not operated by the Elite League teams enter the league on the basis of a decision by the board of directors
British ice hockey's structure underwent a major reorganisation in The British Hockey League the highest senior competition since featuring the top two divisions of the sport was disbanded and replaced by the Ice Hockey Superleague top tier and British National League second tier
The loss of the Cardiff Devils and the Newcastle Jesters in reduced the membership of the Superleague to seven and when the Manchester Storm and the Scottish Eagles folded within a week of one another at the beginning of the season there were just five remaining teams In December the Bracknell Bees announced their intention to resign from the league to join the BNL at the end of the season and uncertainty surrounded the future of the London Knights and their London Arena home which ultimately led to the Knights folding in Owing a large debt to Ice Hockey UK and facing the prospect of having only three members the league placed itself into liquidation on April
The three remaining clubs Belfast Giants Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers began considering the formation of a new league with a lower wage cap and larger commitment to British players to attract other clubs into joining them In the weeks that followed they were joined by the Basingstoke Bison Cardiff Devils and Coventry Blaze of the British National League and two new organisations from London and Manchester A team based in Glasgow was also planned but did not come to fruition The new league met considerable opposition from the British National League and the governing body Ice Hockey UK The IHUK wished for the remaining Superleague clubs to integrate themselves into the BNL and initially refused to grant the new league affiliation The Superleague clubs were reluctant to join the predominantly British trained league after several years of playing in an import dominated league where British players were seldom able to step up to the standard of their North American and European counterparts The Elite League instead preferred a twelve import limit with the rest of the team being British trained players
The refusal to grant affiliation caused a bitter row that showed little sign of being resolved Despite not having the support of the governing body the new league continued their plans No affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league to hire their arena The issue was resolved in August when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement The EIHL finally gained affiliation in August with only weeks to go before the beginning of the new season
The new league began on September when the Sheffield Steelers who went on to become the inaugural league champions defeated the newly formed London Racers at Alexandra Palace Charles Prince of Wales dropped the first puck after unveiling a plaque The Racers endured a difficult first season moving to a different rink only weeks into the season and having to wait games to record a win a victory over the Cardiff Devils The Racers finished the season with points points behind second to last Basingstoke The other new team the Manchester Phoenix fared slightly better qualifying for the playoff finals after finishing sixth in the league where they were defeated by Nottingham in the semifinal The club played at the capacity MEN Arena which had been home to the Manchester Storm but Phoenix crowds averaged well below the break even mark of Late in the season the Phoenix choose to play a game at IceSheffield rather than pay the considerable cost of hiring the arena for a mid week game which usually had lower attendances In the close season they allowed fans to vote on the option of either suspending playing operations while a new rink was constructed or playing in exile away from Manchester while a new rink was built Supporters opted to suspend playing operations pending the construction of a new facility
The second season of the EIHL saw a series of games between the EIHL clubs and the members of the BNL In addition to three home games and three away games against their Elite opponents each club also played one home game and one away game against the BNL clubs in crossover match ups Results in these crossover games counted towards a team's points tally The NHL lock out also saw a number of NHL players join British clubs Coventry won all three titles winning the championship with an overtime victory over the Nottingham Panthers
The crossover games with the BNL clubs were seen by many to be the first stage towards an amalgamation of the two organizations into one league essentially reforming the original BHL However early in the season it was revealed that two teams from the BNL the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers were seeking to resign from the BNL and join the EIHL preferring the standard of hockey that the EIHL had to offer A withdrawal of these clubs would leave the BNL with only five remaining participating teams This situation led to the resigning teams temporarily withdrawing their Elite League applications and entering into collective discussions on the entire BNL joining the EIHL instead The Elite League offered the BNL clubs invitations to join the EIHL structure which were declined by the remaining teams due to unfavourable terms Subsequently the Capitals and Vipers both resubmitted individual applications to the Elite League both of which were accepted This ultimately led to the dissolution of the BNL with the five remaining teams joining the next tier of British hockey which consisted of the English Premier Ice Hockey League in England and the Scottish National League in Scotland
With the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers becoming the ninth and tenth members of the league the season began with nine clubs Manchester had opted to take another season out with no rink yet constructed However in November the London Racers withdrew their team from competition and immediately ceased operations From their formation the Racers had suffered problems finding a rink with comparable facilities to those of their rivals and they had maintained only a very small fan base The club had made the Lee Valley Ice Centre their home after playing only a small number of games at the Alexandra Palace in their first season The facilities were very basic seating only people with an overall capacity of barely In November during a game against the Nottingham Panthers Panthers player Blaž Emeršič suffered a serious facial injury after colliding with a protruding object in the boards Further concerns were raised when a game against the Sheffield Steelers was abandoned after a piece of plexiglas shattered in an irregular manner injuring a spectator When a similar event took place during practice a few days later the Racers management began to question seriously the safety of the rink With the Ice Centre unable to ensure the safety of players and spectators at Elite League games the Racers were forced to suspend team operations effective immediately
In January the Manchester Phoenix were granted planning permission to construct a new rink in Altrincham A few weeks later the Cardiff Devils also received planning permission for the construction of a new rink The Wales National Ice Rink was earmarked for demolition and a campaign for the council to provide a new facility proved successful With both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season speculation began about the possible inclusion of a tenth team to replace the London Racers After the season was over rumours about the possible admission of either Hull or Dundee became more and more widespread On June the Hull Stingrays were formally elected into the Elite Ice Hockey League as the tenth active member
In June the EIHL announced the adoption of the zero tolerance interpretation of the rules with regard to holding hooking and interference implemented in the National Hockey League during the season These rules had proved highly successful in the NHL increasing the pace of the game and leading to a rise in spectator numbers
On August the Elite League announced a sponsorship deal with the low cost airline bmibaby The agreement saw the company's name incorporated into the league's title and the airline's branding at each of the league's ten arenas The deal was intended to last for seven seasons but ended prematurely during the season
On April the Manchester Phoenix announced that they would withdraw from the league and play instead in the English Premier Ice Hockey League due to cost issues This news followed the announcement that the Basingstoke Bison were also leaving to play in the EPL for the season
After losing two teams at the end of the season the Elite League was boosted by a new franchise joining the league The Braehead Clan were announced as the ninth team for the season On April the Dundee Stars were unanimously accepted into the League by the EIHL board as the tenth team
The Hull Stingrays withdrew from the League on August announced via the club's official website and later confirmed on the BBC's site However after a takeover from the Coventry Blaze on August the Hull Stingrays confirmed that they would indeed be participating in the league for the season The Stingrays again withdrew on June as the club announced on its official website that it has been placed into liquidation
From the season onwards the league has consisted of two conferences each consisting of five teams These are the Erhardt Conference and the Gardiner Conference These can roughly be split into north and south with the Erhardt featuring the teams from Belfast Cardiff Coventry Nottingham and Sheffield and the Gardiner featuring the teams from Dundee Edinburgh Fife and Glasgow along with Hull Stingrays until and their replacements Manchester Storm from onwards
On April it was announced that the Milton Keynes Lightning and Guildford Flames were joining for the start of the season and that the league schedule would be increased to games in the regular season with three new conferences of four teams

In April when the Murrayfield Ice Rink asked for bidders for the ice time at the arena the Edinburgh Capitals and Murrayfield Racers a newly formed team bid for the rights with the Racers winning the opportunity The Racers asked for permission to join the EIHL but on April the league refused their application and they subsequently joined the Scottish National League SNL

While there were tentative plans for a shortened league season featuring a handful of sides to potentially begin play in January this idea and the prospect of a season were shelved by the league in February due to concerns around funding
Then in March the Elite League announced that four of the English teams Coventry Manchester Nottingham and Sheffield would take part in the 'Elite Series' between April May a total of games to be played at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena culminating in a best of three play off final series Nottingham claimed the trophy by virtue of a series win over the Sheffield Steelers in the final winning game one and game two

Elite League teams rely heavily on players from outside the United Kingdom termed imports The majority of these players are from North America and typically played in the minor North American leagues such as the ECHL and AHL before coming to Britain For example of the players to play for champions Belfast Giants in the season were Canadian were British and were American The league restricts the number of import players which can be dressed for a game with a current limit of imports Player turnover is high with a large proportion of players spending a single season at a team before moving on and multi year contracts are uncommon
As would be expected in a league dominated by North American players the style of ice hockey in Britain is similar to that played in North America and has a more physical style than that played in other technically natured European countries This was demonstrated during the NHL lock out Of the NHL players to join Elite League teams the majority were players noted for physical play rather than puck handling skills such as Wade Belak and Eric Cairns
While British players account for a minority of Elite League players the league supplies the majority of players for the Great Britain team All players in the Great Britain squad for the World Championships played for Elite League teams in the preceding season
In the s and s Sky Sports and the BBC's Grandstand programme covered the British Hockey League and Superleague and their important games and competitions regularly

Ice hockey receives little national media coverage in the United Kingdom Some national newspapers list results and provide short summaries of the league's news but more extensive coverage remains minimal There was a small surge in interest during the season when newspapers such as The Times reported on the NHL players playing the Elite League as a result of the lock out but since the lock out ended coverage has returned to its previous levels
Of the national newspapers only the Daily Star has a regular ice hockey column which appears on Tuesday and Sunday
Coverage in the towns and cities where Elite League clubs are based is more extensive and local newspapers have dedicated ice hockey reporters who cover the local team Local radio stations such as BBC Coventry Warwickshire BBC Radio Nottingham and BBC Radio Sheffield all provide programming on the sport Radio Sheffield also provides a weekly ice hockey programme Iceline while Radio Nottingham has broadcast a similar programme Powerplay since the later stages of the season and has a minute weekly preview of games on Saturday evenings during the ice hockey season after the station's coverage of the local football teams is completed BBC Coventry Warwickshire have also followed suit with Faceoff a programme broadcast on the first Thursday of the month during the season

In attendance the EIHL ranks seventh among the European top leagues with a average Three teams are among the top of the continent Challenge Cup champions Nottingham Panthers at th average the league champions Sheffield Steelers at th and the league champions Belfast Giants at th
Previously the EIHL champions were invited to play in the Continental Cup Europe's second level club competition For the tournament the EIHL's entrants began the tournament in the penultimate third group stage However with the introduction of the Champions Hockey League this has changed From the season the top two teams in the EIHL participate in the CHL with either the team that wins the post season playoffs or the team finishing third if the playoffs winner is one of the top two entering the Continental Cup
During the NHL Lockout several NHL players plied their trade in the Elite League including Matt Beleskey Paul Bissonnette Drew Miller Tom Sestito and Anthony Stewart
The league has had a reputation for attracting ex NHL players including Dustin Kohn who played for the Sheffield Steelers Kevin Westgarth who played for the Belfast Giants Cam Janssen formerly of the Nottingham Panthers ex Braehead Clan captain Matt Keith and Stefan Della Rovere Ryan O'Marra of the Coventry Blaze and Brian McGrattan who played for the Nottingham Panthers

Meanwhile in being drafted by the Arizona Coyotes in Sheffield Steelers forward Liam Kirk became the first English born and trained player to be drafted by an NHL side Kirk signed a three year entry level contract with Arizona in June
The main criticism levelled at the EIHL is that the league is too expensive an accusation given credence by the collapse of the London Racers mid season in and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs most notably the Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in
Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations casting further doubt over both their own and the league's sustained viability
This perceived problem with expenditure was given further credence when the Hull Stingrays announced on August that they were ceasing operations immediately due to insufficient funds from sponsorships to guarantee completing the season They were however taken over on August by the Coventry Blaze and therefore the Hull Stingrays continued to operate However Hull did fold in
In the Newcastle Vipers announced that they would not be able to compete in the season due to financial difficulties and lack of a permanent home stadium Newcastle had up to this point been playing their home games at Whitley Bay ice rink A proposed new stadium in the Newcastle area did not materialise
Despite there being a limited number of suitable venues for league expansion there have been various attempts during the EIHL's lifespan to expand the league After the successful addition of the Braehead Clan and the Dundee Stars for the season the EIHL reported that it had entered discussions with the Fife Flyers formerly of the defunct BNL and then resident in the SNL
On June it was confirmed that the Fife Flyers had been admitted to the EIHL in time for the commencement of the season
