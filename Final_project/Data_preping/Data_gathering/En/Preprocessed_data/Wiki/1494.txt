"Nobody's Home" is third single released from Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne's second studio album, Under My Skin (2004)
The track was written by Lavigne and former Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody, who also plays guitar on the song
"Nobody's Home", produced by Don Gilmore, is generally slower-paced than Lavigne's previous singles from Under My Skin.
The song was well-received critically and commercially, reaching number 41 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and charting within the top 40 on the charts of Australia and nine European countries, including Austria, Greece, Ireland, and the United Kingdom
One of the song's B-sides, "I Always Get What I Want", was released as a single on iTunes on 31 October 2004.
Riff magazine described the song as having influences of post-grunge
In an AOL Radio listener's poll, "Nobody's Home" was voted Lavigne's seventh best song
PopMatters implied that because of song's title "should tell you that the dominate mood is one of anger and defensiveness."
"Nobody's Home" peaked lower in most countries than some of Lavigne's previous singles but managed to gain some respectable chart positions
The song was very close to reaching the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, but it only managed to peak at number 41
It charted better in the UK and Australia, reaching number 24 in both countries; it was her lowest-charting UK single before "Hot" charted in 2007 and peaked only at number 30.
The music video was filmed on 29 and 30 July 2004 in Los Angeles, California, directed by Diane Martel
The video of "Nobody's Home" premiered on 20 October on MTV's Total Request Live.
In the music video for "Nobody's Home", Lavigne plays a homeless teenager who appears to live street-to-street with a friend
Lavigne, who said it was a fun video to make, wore a black wig and acid-wash jeans when playing the homeless teenager
The video shifts to a more glamorous Lavigne who wears a dress with long, curled hair, singing the song with an orchestra behind her.
"Nobody's Home" showed the outcast, homeless Lavigne trying to get off the streets
She also tries to call her mother, but hangs up
As the video progresses, a store manager kicks her out of his store, but the outcast girl ends up going back into the store and is shown washing herself in a convenience store bathroom
She also tries playing the guitar on the street to try to earn money
Towards the end of the video, the runaway is seen trying to get inside parked cars, eventually finding an unlocked one, during heavy rain
 At the end of the video, the girl, with dirty clothes and messy hair, is shown with a tear rolling down her cheek
She then turns around and walks away as the camera fades out.
During the video Avril was wearing the T-shirt with logo of Moscow
Russian word "Москва" was printed on Avril's T-shirt.
At the beginning of the video, one can see "A+D", for Lavigne's then-boyfriend, now ex-husband, Deryck Whibley
Next, in the bathroom scene where Lavigne is using the hand dryer, "A+D" can be seen inside a heart that is written on the bathroom wall
The other outcast runaway is real-life friend Monique, who also appeared as one of the young women in the "My Happy Ending" video.
