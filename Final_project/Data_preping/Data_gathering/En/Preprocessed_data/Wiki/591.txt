Timothy Drew better known as Noble Drew Ali January July was an American who founded the Moorish Science Temple of America Considered a prophet by his followers in he founded the Canaanite Temple in Newark New Jersey before relocating to Chicago where he gained a following of thousands of converts Following the murder of a rival Moorish Science Temple leader Drew Ali was arrested but never charged and sent to jail he died in shortly after being released
Several details of Drew Ali's early life are uncertain as true information became mixed with that of legend by his devout followers He is believed to have been born Timothy Drew on January in North Carolina Sources differ as to his background and upbringing one reports he was the orphaned son of two former slaves born in a Cherokee tribe while another describes him as the son of John A Drew Quitman military and political leader of the Cherokee Coharie Nation and Eliza Turner Quitman full blooded Washitaw Tunica mother
One version of his life common among members of the Moorish Science Temple holds that Drew was raised by an abusive aunt who once threw him into a furnace This version holds that he left home at and joined a band of Romani people who took him overseas to Egypt and the Middle East Drew Ali also reportedly worked as a circus magician or a merchant seaman before purportedly traveling to Egypt He never received a formal education but at some point came into contact with Eastern philosophy
In a completely different understanding of Drew Ali's early life was presented with the publication of an article in the online Journal of Race Ethnicity and Religion The article presented newly compiled evidence including census records newspaper ads newspaper articles a World War I draft card and street directory records to link Noble Drew Ali to one Thomas Drew who was born on the same date as Timothy Drew but originated from Virginia instead
Drew Ali reported that during his travels in Egypt he met a high priest of Egyptian magic In one version of Drew Ali's biography the leader saw him as a reincarnation of the founder In others he claims that the priest considered him a reincarnation of Jesus the Buddha Muhammad and other religious prophets According to the biography the high priest trained Ali in mysticism and gave him a lost section of the Quran
This text came to be known as the Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America not to be confused with the Islamic Quran It is also known as the Circle Seven Koran because of its cover which features a red surrounded by a blue circle The first chapters are from The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ published in by esoteric Ohio preacher Levi Dowling In The Aquarian Gospel Dowling described Jesus's supposed travels in India Egypt and Palestine during the years of his life which are not accounted for by the New Testament
Chapters through are borrowed from the Rosicrucian work Unto Thee I Grant with minor changes in style and wording They are instructions on how to live and the education and duties of adherents
Drew Ali wrote the last four chapters of the Circle Seven Koran himself In these he wrote
Drew Ali used this material to claim Jesus and his followers were Asiatic Asiatic was the term Drew Ali used for all dark or olive colored people he labeled whites as European although he labeled whites who became a part of the MSTA as Persians or Celts He suggested that all Asiatics should be allied
Drew Ali believed that African Americans were all Moors who he claimed were descended from the ancient Moabites describing them as belonging to Northwest Africa as opposed to Moab as the name suggests He claimed that Islam and its teachings are more beneficial to their earthly salvation and that their 'true nature' had been 'withheld' from them Male members of the Temple wear a fez or turban as head covering women wear a turban
As Drew Ali began urging the Moorish Americans to become better citizens he made speeches like A Divine Warning By the Prophet for the Nations in which he urged them to reject derogatory labels such as Black colored and Negro He urged Americans of all races to reject hate and embrace love He believed that Chicago would become a second Mecca
Drew Ali crafted Moorish Science ideology from a variety of sources a network of alternative spiritualities that focused on the power of the individual to bring about personal transformation through mystical knowledge of the divine within In the interwar period in Chicago and other major cities he used these concepts to preach Moorish pride His approach appealed to thousands of African Americans who had left severely oppressive conditions in the South through the Great Migration and faced struggles adapting in new urban environments
It is possible that Drew Ali did actually travel to Egypt and Morocco but historians believe that after leaving North Carolina he moved to Newark New Jersey where he worked as a train expressman In Drew Ali formed the Canaanite Temple in Newark Drew Ali and his followers migrated while planting congregations in Philadelphia Washington DC and Detroit Finally Drew Ali settled in Chicago in saying the Midwest was closer to Islam The following year he officially registered Temple No
There he instructed followers not to be confrontational but to build up their people to be respected In this way they might take their place in the United States of America by developing a cultural identity that was congruent with Drew Ali's beliefs on personhood In the late s journalists estimated the Moorish Science Temple had members in temples in cities across the Midwest and upper South
The ushers of the Temple wore black fezzes The leader of a particular temple was known as a Grand Sheik or Governor Noble Drew Ali was known to have had several wives According to The Chicago Defender he claimed the power to marry and divorce at will The Moorish Science movement was reportedly studied and watched by the Chicago police
Drew Ali attended the inauguration of Illinois Governor Louis Lincoln Emmerson The Chicago Defender stated that his trip included interviews with many distinguished citizens from Chicago who greeted him on every hand With the growth in its population and membership Chicago was established as the center of the Moorish Science movement
In early following a conflict over funds Claude Green Bey the business manager of Chicago Temple No split from the Moorish Science Temple of America He declared himself Grand Sheik and took a number of members with him On March Green Bey was stabbed to death at the Unity Hall of the Moorish Science Temple on Indiana Avenue in Chicago
Drew Ali was out of town at the time as he was dealing with former Supreme Grand Governor Lomax Bey professor Ezaldine Muhammad who had supported Green Bey's attempted coup When Drew Ali returned to Chicago the police arrested him and other members of the community on suspicion of having instigated the killing No indictment was sworn for Drew Ali at that time
Shortly after his release by the police Drew Ali died at age at his home in Chicago on July Although the exact circumstances of his death are unknown the Certificate of Death stated that Noble Drew Ali died from tuberculosis broncho pneumonia Despite the official report many of his followers speculated that his death was caused by injuries from the police or from other members of the faith
Others thought it was due to pneumonia One Moor told The Chicago Defender that The Prophet was not ill his work was done and he laid his head upon the lap of one of his followers and passed out His funeral took place on July with hundreds attending The services were held at the Pythian Temple in Chicago followed by the burial at Burr Oak Cemetery in nearby Alsip
The death of Drew Ali brought out a number of candidates who vied to succeed him Edward Mealy El stated that he had been declared Drew Ali's successor by Drew Ali himself while John Givens El Drew Ali's chauffeur declared that he was Drew Ali reincarnated However the governors of the Moorish Science Temple of America declared Charles Kirkman Bey to be the successor to Drew Ali and named him Grand Advisor
Wallace Fard Muhammad the founder of Nation of Islam was previously a prominent member of the Moorish Science Temple of America where he was known as David Ford El After Drew Ali's death he claimed to be the Prophet reincarnated
When his leadership was largely rejected he broke away from the Moorish Science Temple moved to Detroit and founded the Nation of Islam Nation of Islam leaders denied any historical connection to the Moorish Science Temple of America until February when Louis Farrakhan acknowledged Noble Drew Ali's contribution to the Nation of Islam
In the Moroccan Ambassador to the United States officially recognized the Moorish Science Temple's Islamic linkage to Morocco through Drew Ali
