on spirals greek is a treatise by archimedes written around bc
notably archimedes employed the archimedean spiral in this book to square the circle and trisect an angle
archimedes begins on spirals with a message to dositheus of pelusium mentioning the death of conon as a loss to mathematics
he then goes on to summarize the results of on the sphere and cylinder and on conoids and spheroids
he continues to state his results of on spirals
the archimedean spiral was first studied by conon and was later studied by archimedes in on spirals
archimedes was able to find various tangents to the spiral
he defines the spiral as
the construction as to how archimedes trisected the angle is as follows
suppose the angle abc is to be trisected
trisect the segment bc and find bd to be one third of bc
draw a circle with center b and radius bd
suppose the circle with center b intersects the spiral at point e
angle abe is one third angle abc to square the circle archimedes gave the following construction
let p be the point on the spiral when it has completed one turn
let the tangent at p cut the line perpendicular to op at t
ot is the length of the circumference of the circle with radius op archimedes had already proved as the first proposition of measurement of a circle that the area of a circle is equal to a right angled triangle having the legs lengths equal to the radius of the circle and the circumference of the circle
so the area of the circle with radius op is equal to the area of the triangle opt
