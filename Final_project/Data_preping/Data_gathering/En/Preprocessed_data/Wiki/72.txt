geologist scientist study solid liquid gaseous matter constitutes earth terrestrial planet well process shape them
geologist usually study geology although background physic chemistry biology science also useful
field research field work important component geology although many subdisciplines incorporate laboratory digitalised work
geologist work energy mining sector searching natural resource petroleum natural gas precious base metals
also forefront preventing mitigating damage natural hazard disaster earthquake volcano tsunami landslides
presented paper entitled theory earth royal society edinburgh
paper explained theory earth must much older previously supposed allow enough time mountain eroded sediment form new rock bottom sea turn raised become dry land
follower hutton known plutonists believed rock formed vulcanism deposition lava volcano opposed neptunists led abraham werner believed rock settled large ocean whose level gradually dropped time
first geological map united state wa produced william maclure
maclure commenced self-imposed task making geological survey united states
almost every state union wa traversed mapped allegheny mountain crossed recrossed times
result unaided labor submitted american philosophical society memoir entitled observation geology united state explanatory geological map published society's transaction together nation's first geological map
antedates william smith's geological map england six year although wa constructed using different classification rocks
sir charles lyell first published famous book principle geology in
book influenced thought charles darwin successfully promoted doctrine uniformitarianism
theory state slow geological process occurred throughout earth's history still occurring today
contrast catastrophism theory earth's feature formed single catastrophic event remained unchanged thereafter
though hutton believed uniformitarianism idea wa widely accepted time
aspiring geologist training typically includes significant coursework physic mathematics chemistry addition class offered geology department historical physical geology igneous metamorphic petrology petrography hydrogeology sedimentology stratigraphy mineralogy palaeontology physical geography structural geology among many required area study
geology student often spend portion year especially summer though sometimes january term living working field condition faculty member often referred field camp
many non-geologists often take geology course expertise geology find valuable field common field geography engineering chemistry urban planning environmental study among others
geologist may concentrate study research one following disciplines
economic geology study ore genesis mechanism ore creation geostatistics
engineering geology application geologic science engineering practice purpose assuring geologic factor affecting location design construction operation maintenance engineering work recognized adequately provided for
geophysics applied branch deal application physical method gravity seismicity electricity magnetic property study earth
geochemistry applied branch deal study chemical makeup behaviour rock study behaviour minerals
geochronology study isotope geology specifically toward determining date within past rock formation metamorphism mineralization geological event notably meteorite impacts
hydrogeology study origin occurrence movement groundwater water subsurface geological system
igneous petrology study igneous process igneous differentiation fractional crystallization intrusive volcanological phenomena
isotope geology case isotopic composition rock determine process rock planetary formation
marine geology study seafloor involves geophysical geochemical sedimentological paleontological investigation ocean floor coastal margins
marine geology ha strong tie physical oceanography plate tectonics
palaeoclimatology application geological science determine climatic condition present earth's atmosphere within earth's history
palaeontology classification taxonomy fossil within geological record construction palaeontological history earth
petroleum geology study sedimentary basin applied search hydrocarbon oil exploration
planetary geology study geology relates celestial body namely planet moons
includes subdiscipline lunar geology selenology martian geology areology
sedimentology study sedimentary rock stratum formation eustasy process modern-day sedimentary erosive systems
structural geology study fold fault foliation rock microstructure determine deformational history rock regions
volcanology study volcano eruption lava magma process hazardsprofessional geologist work wide range government agency private firm non-profit academic institutions
usually hired contract basis hold permanent position within private firm official agency united state geologic survey
local state national government hire geologist work geological project interest public community
investigation country's natural resource often key role working government institution work geologist field made publicly available help community make informed decision related exploitation resource management environment safety critical infrastructure expected bring greater wellbeing country
'wellbeing' often form greater tax revenue new extended mining project better infrastructure andor natural disaster planning
engineering geologist employed investigate geologic hazard geologic constraint planning design construction public private engineering project forensic post-mortem study environmental impact analysis
exploration geologist use aspect geology geophysics locate study natural resources
state without specialized environmental remediation licensure program environmental remediation field often dominated professional geologist particularly hydrogeologists professional concentration aspect field
petroleum mining company use mudloggers large-scale land developer use skill geologist engineering geologist help locate oil mineral adapt local feature karst topography earthquake risk comply environmental regulations
geologist academia usually hold advanced degree specialized area within geological discipline employed universities
