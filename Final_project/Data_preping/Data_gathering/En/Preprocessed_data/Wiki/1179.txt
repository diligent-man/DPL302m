archaeology and geology continue to reveal the secrets of prehistoric scotland uncovering a complex past before the romans brought scotland into the scope of recorded history
successive human cultures tended to be spread across europe or further afield but focusing on this particular geographical area sheds light on the origin of the widespread remains and monuments in scotland and on the background to the history of scotland
the extent of open countryside untouched by intensive farming together with past availability of stone rather than timber has given scotland a wealth of accessible sites where the ancient past can be seen
scotland is geologically alien to europe comprising a sliver of the ancient continent of laurentia which later formed the bulk of north america
during the cambrian period the crustal region which became scotland formed part of the continental shelf of laurentia then still south of the equator
laurentia was separated from the continent of baltica which later became scandinavia and the baltic region by the diminishing iapetus ocean
the two ancient continents moved toward one another through the cambrian and ordovician periods with tectonic folding during the silurian pushing the first scottish land above water
the final collision occurred during the devonian period with the scottish segment of the laurentian plate smashing into avalonia which contained what is now most of england and wales a motile subcontinent which had previously joined with baltica
this impact threw up a massive chain of mountains at least as tall as the present day alps and saw the formation of the granitic west highland and grampian mountain chains and through the carboniferous a period of volcanic activity in central and eastern scotland
during the permian and triassic periods with the iapetus ocean entirely closed scotland lay near the centre of the pangaean supercontinent
at the start of the tertiary a constructive plate boundary at which tectonic plates move apart became active between laurentia and eurasia pushing the two apart and parting scotland from laurentia
this recession opened the atlantic ocean for the first time and the consequent subduction zone at the western plate margin led to a renewed period of volcanism this time on scotland s west coast producing fresh mountains on skye jura mull r m and arran
this tectonic activity produced the basis of scotland s topography ancient mountains in the north and south of the country partially eroded by million years of water and ice with a wide fertile valley between them and a newer wilder western terrain
with scotland now in the northern temperate zone it was subjected to numerous glaciations in the neogene and quaternary periods the ice sheets and their attendant glaciers carving the landscape into a typical postglacial one overdeepening river valleys into the characteristic u shape and leaving the upland areas covered with glacial corries and dramatic pyramidal peaks
in lowland areas the ice deposited rich fields of fertile glacial till and eroded the softer material surrounding the extinct volcanoes particularly the older carboniferous ones leaving many crags
during the last interglacial around bc there were times when the climate in europe was warmer than it is today and after the neanderthals came to prominence there was another mild spell around bc
neanderthal sites have been found in the south of england from this era though no traces of early modern humans have been found
glaciers then scoured their way across most of britain and it was only after the ice retreated about years ago that scotland again became habitable
as the climate improved mesolithic hunter gatherers extended their range into scotland
the earliest evidence to date is the flint artefacts found at howburn farm near elsrickle in
this is the first and so far the only evidence of upper paleolithic human habitation in scotland around bc which appears to fall between the younger dryas and lomond stadial periods when cold conditions returned relatively briefly
an early settlement at cramond near what is today edinburgh has been dated to around bc
pits and stakeholes suggest a hunter gatherer encampment and microlith stone tools made at the site predate finds of similar style in england
although no bones or shells had survived in the acidic soils numerous carbonised hazelnut shells indicate cooking in a similar way to finds at other mesolithic period sites including the slightly earlier star carr and the howick house in northumberland dated to bc britain s oldest house where post holes indicate a very substantial construction interpreted as a permanent residence for hunting people
this suggests that hunter gatherers could also have settled down in scotland
other sites on the east coast and at lochs and rivers and large numbers of rock shelters and shell middens around the west coast and islands build up a picture of highly mobile people often using sites seasonally and having boats for fishing and for transporting stone tools from sites where suitable materials were found
finds of flint tools on ben lawers and at glen dee a mountain pass through the cairngorms show that these people were capable of travelling well inland across the hills
at a rock shelter and shell midden at sand applecross in wester ross facing skye excavations have shown that around bc people had tools of bone stone and antlers were living off shellfish fish and deer using pot boiler stones as a cooking method were making beads from seashells and had ochre pigment and used shellfish which can produce purple dye
neolithic farming brought permanent settlements
at balbridie in aberdeenshire crop markings were investigated and ditches and post holes found revealing a massive timber framed building dating to about bc
an almost identical building with evidence of pottery was excavated at claish near stirling
on the islet of eilean domhnuill in loch olabhat on north uist unstan ware pottery suggests a date of bc for what may be the earliest crannog
the remainder of this section focuses mainly on the orkney islands where there is a neolithic landscape rich in sites amazingly preserved by prevalent use of the local stone which appears on the shore ready split into convenient building slabs
there are many other examples across the country many under the care of historic scotland
at the wonderfully well preserved stone house at knap of howar on the orkney island of papa westray occupied from bc to bc the walls stand to a low eaves height and the stone furniture is intact
evidence from middens shows that the inhabitants kept cattle sheep and pigs farmed barley and wheat and gathered shellfish as well as fishing for species which must be caught from boats using lines
finely made and decorated unstan ware pottery links the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield including balbrindi and eilean domhnuill
the houses at skara brae on the mainland of the orkney islands are very similar but are grouped into a village linked by low passageways
this settlement was occupied from about bc to bc
pottery found here is of the grooved ware style which is found across britain as far away as wessex
about miles km from skara brae grooved ware pottery was found at the standing stones of stenness originally a circle which lie centrally in a close group of three major monuments
maeshowe the finest example of the passage grave type of chambered cairn radiocarbon dated to before bc lies just to the east
the ring of brodgar circle of standing stones is across a bridge immediately to the north
this circle was one of the first to be analysed by professor alexander thom to establish the likely use of standing stones as astronomical observatories
another neolithic village has been found nearby at barnhouse settlement and the inference is that these farming people were the builders and users of these mysterious structures
like the standing stones at callanish on lewis and other standing stones across scotland these monuments form part of the europe wide megalithic culture which also produced stonehenge in wiltshire and the stone rows at carnac in brittany
further evidence can be found in kilmartin glen with its stone circles standing stones and rock art
the widespread connections of these people are shown by offerings imported from cumbria and wales and left on the sacred hilltop at cairnpapple hill west lothian as early as bc
the cairns and megalithic monuments continued into the bronze age though there was a decline in both the building of large new structures and the total area under cultivation
the clava cairns and standing stones near inverness show complex geometries and astronomical alignments with smaller perhaps individual tombs instead of the communal neolithic tombs
mummies dating from to bc have been discovered at cladh hallan on south uist
hill forts were introduced such as eildon hill near melrose in the scottish borders which goes back to around bc and which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop
excavation at edinburgh castle found late bronze age material from about bc
from around bc and extending into roman times the iron age was an age of forts and defended farmsteads which support the image of quarrelsome tribes and petty kingdoms recorded by the romans
evidence that at times occupants neglected the defences might suggest that symbolic power was as significant as warfare
brythonic or pritennic celtic culture and language spread into southern scotland at some time after the th century bc possibly through cultural contact rather than mass invasion and systems of kingdoms developed
larger fortified settlements expanded such as the votadini stronghold of traprain law east lothian which was the size of a town
huge numbers of small duns hill forts and ring forts were built on any suitable crag or hillock
the spectacular brochs were built most impressively the nearly complete mousa broch shetland
many souterrain underground passageways were constructed though their purpose is obscure
island settlements linked with land by a causeway the crannogs became common it is thought that their function was defensive
