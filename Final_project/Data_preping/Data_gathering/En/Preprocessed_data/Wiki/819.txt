a utility knife is any type of knife used for general manual work purposes
such knives were originally fixed blade knives with durable cutting edges suitable for rough work such as cutting cordage cutting scraping hides butchering animals cleaning fish scales reshaping timber and other tasks
craft knives are small utility knives used as precision oriented tools for finer more delicate tasks such as carving and papercutting
today the term utility knife also includes small folding retractable and or replaceable razor blade knives suited for use in the general workplace or in the construction industry
the latter type is sometimes generically called a stanley knife after a prominent brand
there is also a utility knife for kitchen use which is sized between a chef s knife and paring knife
the fixed blade utility knife was developed some years ago when human ancestors began to make stone knives
these knives were general purpose tools designed for cutting and shaping wooden implements scraping hides preparing food and for other utilitarian purposes
by the th century the fixed blade utility knife had evolved into a steel bladed outdoors field knife capable of butchering game cutting wood and preparing campfires and meals
with the invention of the backspring pocket size utility knives were introduced with folding blades and other folding tools designed to increase the utility of the overall design
the folding pocketknife and utility tool is typified by the camper or boy scout pocketknife the u s
folding utility knife the swiss army knife and by multi tools fitted with knife blades
the development of stronger locking blade mechanisms for folding knives as with the spanish navaja the opinel and the buck folding hunter significantly increased the utility of such knives when employed for heavy duty tasks such as preparing game or cutting through dense or tough materials
the fixed or folding blade utility knife is popular for both indoor and outdoor use
one of the most popular types of workplace utility knife is the retractable or folding utility knife also known as a stanley knife box cutter or by various other names
these types of utility knives are designed as multi purpose cutting tools for use in a variety of trades and crafts
designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use utility knives are commonly used in factories warehouses construction projects and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to mark cut lines trim plastic or wood materials or to cut tape cord strapping cardboard or other packaging material

utility knives may use fixed folding or retractable or replaceable blades and come in a wide variety of lengths and styles suited to the particular set of tasks they are designed to perform
thus an outdoors utility knife suited for camping or hunting might use a broad to millimetres in fixed blade while a utility knife designed for the construction industry might feature a replaceable utility or razor blade for cutting packaging cutting shingles marking cut lines or scraping paint
large fixed blade utility knives are most often employed in an outdoors context such as fishing camping or hunting
outdoor utility knives typically feature sturdy blades from to millimetres in in length with edge geometry designed to resist chipping and breakage
the term utility knife may also refer to small fixed blade knives used for crafts model making and other artisanal projects
these small knives feature light duty blades best suited for cutting thin lightweight materials
the small thin blade and specialized handle permit cuts requiring a high degree of precision and control
the largest construction or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades made of either die cast metal or molded plastic
some use standard razor blades others specialized double ended utility blades
the user can adjust how far the blade extends from the handle so that for example the knife can be used to cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package
when the blade becomes dull it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one
spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle
other models feature a quick change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools as well as a flip out blade storage tray
the blades for this type of utility knife come in both double and single ended versions and are interchangeable with many but not all of the later copies
specialized blades also exist for cutting string linoleum and other materials
another style is a snap off utility knife that contains a long segmented blade that slides out from it
as the endmost edge becomes dull it can be broken off the remaining blade exposing the next section which is sharp and ready for use
the snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built in or a pair of pliers and the break occurs at the score lines where the metal is thinnest
when all of the individual segments are used the knife may be thrown away or more often refilled with a replacement blade
this design was introduced by japanese manufacturer olfa corporation in as the world s first snap off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments
the sharp cutting edge on these knives is not on the edge where the blade is snapped off rather one long edge of the whole blade is sharpened and there are scored diagonal breakoff lines at intervals down the blade
thus each snapped off piece is roughly a parallelogram with each long edge being a breaking edge and one or both of the short ends being a sharpened edge
another utility knife often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which single edge utility blades can be inserted
the sleeve slides up and down on the handle holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use
the blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle much like a folding blade pocketknife
the blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of corrugated fibreboard to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes
most utility knives are not well suited to use as offensive weapons with the exception of some outdoor type utility knives employing longer blades
however even small razor blade type utility knives may sometimes find use as slashing weapons
