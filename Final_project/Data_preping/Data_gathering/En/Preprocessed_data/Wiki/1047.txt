the united states presidential election was the th quadrennial presidential election
it was held on tuesday november
the election took place during world war ii
incumbent democratic president franklin d
roosevelt defeated republican thomas e
dewey to win an unprecedented fourth term
until this would be the last time in which an incumbent democratic president would win re election after serving a full term in office and the last time until in which the incumbent president won re election with fewer electoral votes and a smaller popular vote margin that had been won in the previous election
roosevelt had become the first president to win a third term with his victory in the presidential election with little doubt that he would seek a fourth term
unlike in roosevelt faced little opposition within his own party and he easily won the presidential nomination of the democratic national convention
concerned that roosevelt s ill health would mean the vice president would likely become president the convention dropped roosevelt s vice president henry a
wallace in favor of senator harry s
truman of missouri
governor dewey of new york emerged as the front runner for the republican nomination after his victory in the wisconsin primary and he defeated conservative governor john w
bricker at the republican national convention
as world war ii was going well for the united states and its allies roosevelt remained popular despite his long tenure
dewey campaigned against the new deal and for a smaller government but was ultimately unsuccessful in convincing the country to change course
the election was closer than roosevelt s other presidential campaigns but roosevelt still won by a comfortable margin in the popular vote and by a wide margin in the electoral college
rumors of roosevelt s ill health although somewhat dispelled by his vigorous campaigning proved to be prescient roosevelt died less than three months into his fourth term and was succeeded by truman
as of this was the most recent presidential election in which a democratic ticket has won every state of the former confederacy as well as the entire southern region
in all southern states except oklahoma and virginia voted for democratic nominee jimmy carter who was from georgia
roosevelt is the only president to serve for more than two terms in the twenty second amendment was ratified limiting the number of terms a person may be president
democratic candidates president roosevelt was the popular wartime incumbent and faced little formal opposition
although many southern democrats mistrusted roosevelt s racial policies he brought enormous war activities to the region and the end of its marginal status was in sight
no major figure opposed roosevelt publicly and he was re nominated easily when the democratic convention met in chicago
some pro segregationist delegates tried to unite behind virginia senator harry f
byrd but he refused to campaign actively against roosevelt and did not get enough delegates to seriously threaten the president s chances
the obvious physical decline in the president s appearance as well as rumors of secret health problems led many delegates and party leaders to strongly oppose vice president henry a
wallace for a second term
opposition to wallace came especially from catholic leaders in big cities and moderate democrats
wallace who had been roosevelt s vice president since january was regarded by most conservatives as being too left wing and personally eccentric to be next in line for the presidency
he had performed so poorly as economic coordinator that roosevelt had to remove him from that post
numerous moderate party leaders privately sent word to roosevelt that they would fight wallace s re nomination as vice president and proposed instead senator harry s
truman a moderate from missouri
truman was highly visible as the chairman of a senate wartime committee investigating fraud and inefficiency in the war program
roosevelt who personally liked wallace and knew little about truman agreed reluctantly to accept truman as his running mate to preserve party unity
even so many delegates on the left refused to abandon wallace and they voted for him on the first ballot
however enough large northern midwestern and southern states supported truman to give him victory on the second ballot
the fight over the vice presidential nomination proved to be consequential the ticket won and roosevelt died in april and truman instead of wallace became the nation s thirty third president
republican candidates as began the frontrunners for the republican nomination appeared to be wendell willkie the party s nominee senator robert a
taft from ohio the leader of the party s conservatives new york governor thomas e
dewey the leader of the party s moderate eastern establishment general douglas macarthur then serving as an allied commander in the pacific theater of the war and former minnesota governor harold stassen then serving as a u s
naval officer in the pacific
taft surprised many by declining to run for president as he wanted to remain in the senate instead he voiced his support for a fellow ohio conservative governor john w
bricker
with taft out of the race some republican conservatives favored general macarthur
however macarthur s chances were limited by the fact that he was leading allied forces against japan and thus could not campaign for the nomination
his supporters entered his name in the wisconsin primary nonetheless
the wisconsin primary proved to be the key contest as dewey won by a surprisingly wide margin
he took fourteen delegates to four for harold stassen while macarthur won the three remaining delegates
willkie was shut out in the wisconsin primary he did not win a single delegate
his unexpectedly poor showing in wisconsin forced him to withdraw as a candidate for the nomination
however at the time of his sudden death in early october willkie had endorsed neither dewey nor roosevelt
at the republican national convention in chicago dewey easily overcame bricker and was nominated for president on the first ballot
dewey a moderate to liberal republican chose the conservative bricker as his running mate
dewey originally preferred fellow liberal california governor earl warren but agreed on bricker to preserve party unity warren would go on to run with dewey in the election
bricker was nominated for vice president by acclamation
the republicans campaigned against the new deal seeking a smaller government and less regulated economy as the end of the war seemed in sight
nonetheless roosevelt s continuing popularity was the main theme of the campaign
to quiet rumors of his poor health roosevelt insisted on making a vigorous campaign swing in october and rode in an open car through city streets
a high point of the campaign occurred when roosevelt speaking to a meeting of labor union leaders gave a speech carried on national radio in which he ridiculed republican claims that his administration was corrupt and wasteful with tax money
he particularly derided a republican claim that he had sent a us navy warship to pick up his scottish terrier fala in alaska noting that fala was furious at such rumors
the speech was met with loud laughter and applause from the labor leaders
in response governor dewey gave a blistering partisan speech in oklahoma city a few days later on national radio in which he accused roosevelt of being indispensable to corrupt big city democratic organizations and american communists he also referred to members of roosevelt s cabinet as a motley crew
however american battlefield successes in europe and the pacific during the campaign such as the liberation of paris in august and the successful battle of leyte gulf in the philippines in october made president roosevelt unbeatable
throughout the campaign roosevelt led dewey in all the polls by varying margins
on election day the democratic incumbent scored a fairly comfortable victory over his republican challenger
roosevelt took states for electoral votes were needed to win while dewey won twelve states and electoral votes
in the popular vote roosevelt won votes to dewey s
dewey conceded in a radio address the following morning but declined personally calling or sending a telegram to president roosevelt
roosevelt sent dewey a telegram reading i thank you for your statement which i heard over the air a few minutes ago roosevelt s victory made him the only person ever to win the presidential popular vote four times and neither party would win the popular vote four consecutive times until the democrats did so in all four elections from to
the important question had been which leader roosevelt or dewey should be chosen for the critical days of peacemaking and reconstruction following the war s conclusion
most american voters concluded that they should retain the governing party and particularly the president who represented it
they also felt it unsafe to do so in wartime in view of ever increasing domestic disagreements
dewey did better against roosevelt than any of roosevelt s previous three republican opponents roosevelt s percentage and margin of the total vote were both less than in
dewey flipped the states of wyoming wisconsin and ohio from the previous election while roosevelt flipped michigan
dewey also gained the personal satisfaction of finishing ahead of roosevelt in his hometown of hyde park new york and ahead of truman in his hometown of independence missouri
dewey would again become the republican presidential nominee in challenging president truman who had assumed that office on fdr s death and would again lose though by somewhat smaller popular and electoral vote margins
roosevelt s net vote totals in the twelve largest cities increased from votes in the election to votes
of the counties independent cities making returns roosevelt won the most popular votes in while dewey carried
the texas regular ticket carried one county
in new york only the combined support of the american labor and liberal parties pledged to roosevelt but otherwise independent of the democrats to maintain their identities enabled roosevelt to win the electoral votes of his home state
in the constantly growing southern protest against roosevelt s leadership became clearest in texas where people voted against roosevelt but not for the republican ticket
the texas regular ticket resulted from a split in the democratic party in its two state conventions may and september
this ticket which represented the democratic element opposing the re election of president roosevelt called for the restoration of states rights which have been destroyed by the communist new deal and restoration of the supremacy of the white race
its electors were uninstructed
as he had in roosevelt won re election with a lower percentage of both the electoral vote and the popular vote than he had received in the prior elections the second of only three american presidents to do so preceded by james madison in and followed by barack obama in
andrew jackson in and grover cleveland in had received more electoral votes but fewer popular votes while woodrow wilson in had received more popular votes but fewer electoral votes
this is the last election in which new hampshire and oregon voted democratic until and the last in which connecticut delaware maryland michigan new jersey new york and pennsylvania did so until
this is
one of three elections since which the eventual winner did not carry ohio
the other two elections
are and
the electoral votes received by roosevelt added to the electoral votes he received in and the electoral votes he received in and the electoral votes he received in gave him the most total electoral votes received by any candidate who was elected to the office of president since he is the only president to serve more than two terms
