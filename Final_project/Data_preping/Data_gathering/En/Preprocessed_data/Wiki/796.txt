Cochrane and Jules Brulatour Universal is the oldest surviving film studio in the United States the world's fifth oldest after Gaumont Path Titanus and Nordisk Film and the oldest member of Hollywood's Big Five studios in terms of the overall film market
Its studios are located in Universal City California and its corporate offices are located in New York City
In the studio was acquired by MCA which was re-launched as NBCUniversal in
Universal Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association MPA and was one of the Little Three majors during Hollywood's golden age
Universal Studios was founded by Carl Laemmle Mark Dintenfass Charles O
Baumann Adam Kessel Pat Powers William Swanson David Horsley Robert H
One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours counting patrons and calculating the day's takings
Within weeks of his Chicago trip Laemmle gave up dry goods to buy the first several nickelodeons
For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs the creation in of the Edison-backed Motion Picture Patents Company or the Edison Trust meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed
Based on the Latham Loop used in cameras and projectors along with other patents the Trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution
Soon Laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying Edison by producing their own pictures
In June Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners Abe Stern and Julius Stern
That company quickly evolved into the Independent Moving Pictures Company IMP with studios in Fort Lee New Jersey where many early films in America's first motion picture industry were produced in the early th century
Laemmle broke with Edison's custom of refusing to give billing and screen credits to performers
By naming the movie stars he attracted many of the leading players of the time contributing to the creation of the star system
In he promoted Florence Lawrence formerly known as The Biograph Girl and actor King Baggot in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing
The Universal Film Manufacturing Company was incorporated in New York City on April
Laemmle who emerged as president in July was the primary figure in the partnership with Dintenfass Baumann Kessel Powers Swanson Horsley and Brulatour
The company was established on June formed in a merger of Independent Moving Pictures IMP the Powers Motion Picture Company Rex Motion Picture Manufacturing Company Champion Film Company Nestor Film Company and the New York Motion Picture Company
Eventually all would be bought out by Laemmle
The new Universal studio was a vertically integrated company with movie production distribution and exhibition venues all linked in the same corporate entity the central element of the Studio system era
Following the westward trend of the industry by the end of the company was focusing its production efforts in the Hollywood area
On March Laemmle opened the world's largest motion picture production facility Universal City Studios on a -acre -km converted farm just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood
Studio management became the third facet of Universal's operations with the studio incorporated as a distinct subsidiary organization
Unlike other movie moguls Laemmle opened his studio to tourists
Universal became the largest studio in Hollywood and remained so for a decade
However it sought an audience mostly in small towns producing mostly inexpensive melodramas westerns and serials
In Universal formed a three-tier branding system for their releases
Universal unlike the top-tier studios did not own any theaters to market its feature films
By branding their product Universal gave theater owners and audiences a quick reference guide
Branding would help theater owners make judgments for films they were about to lease and help fans decide which movies they wanted to see
Universal released three different types of feature motion pictures
Bluebird Photoplays mainstream feature release and more ambitious productions
Jewel prestige motion pictures featuring high budgets using prominent actorsDirectors included Jack Conway John Ford Rex Ingram Robert Z
Leonard George Marshall and Lois Weber one of the few women directing films in Hollywood
Despite Laemmle's role as an innovator he was an extremely cautious studio chief
Unlike rivals Adolph Zukor William Fox and Marcus Loew Laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain
He also financed all of his own films refusing to take on debt
This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director Erich von Stroheim insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films Blind Husbands and Foolish Wives but Universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational ad campaign that attracted moviegoers
Character actor Lon Chaney became a drawing card for Universal in the s appearing steadily in dramas
His two biggest hits for Universal were The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Phantom of the Opera
During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to Irving Thalberg
Thalberg had been Laemmle's personal secretary and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated
Promoted to studio chief Thalberg was giving Universal's product a touch of class but MGM's head of production Louis B
Mayer lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay
Without his guidance Universal became a second-tier studio and would remain so for several decades
In Universal opened a production unit in Germany Deutsche Universal-Film AG under the direction of Joe Pasternak
This unit produced three to four films per year until migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler's increasing domination of central Europe
With the advent of sound these productions were made in the German language or occasionally Hungarian or Polish
In the US Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films but at least some of them were exhibited through other independent foreign-language film distributors based in New York City without the benefit of English subtitles
Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary
In the early years Universal had a clean picture policy
However by April Carl Laemmle considered this to be a mistake as unclean pictures from other studios were generating more profit while Universal was losing money
In early Universal had been negotiating deals with cartoon producers since they wanted to get back into producing them
On March Charles Mintz signed a contract with Universal in the presence of its vice president R
Mintz's company Winkler Pictures was to produce Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons for Universal
Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created the character and the Walt Disney Studio provided the animation for the cartoons under Winkler's supervision
The films enjoyed a successful theatrical run and Mintz would sign a contract with Universal ensuring three more years of Oswald cartoons
However after Mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the films Mintz took most of Walt's animators to work at his own studio
Disney and Iwerks would create Mickey Mouse in secret while they finished the remaining Oswald films they were contractually obligated to finish
Universal subsequently severed its link to Mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by Walter Lantz
In February NBCUniversal sold all the Disney-animated Oswald cartoons along with the rights to the character himself to The Walt Disney Company
In return Disney released ABC sportscaster Al Michaels from his contract so he could work on NBC's recently acquired Sunday night NFL football package
Universal retained ownership of the remaining Oswald cartoons
head of Universal Pictures as a st birthday present
Universal already had a reputation for nepotismâ€”at one time of Carl Sr's relatives were supposedly on the payroll
Many of them were nephews resulting in Carl Sr
being known around the studios as Uncle Carl
Ogden Nash famously quipped in rhyme Uncle Carl LaemmleHas a very large faemmle
Among these relatives was future Academy Award-winning directorproducer William Wyler
Junior Laemmle persuaded his father to bring Universal up to date
He bought and built theaters converted the studio to sound production and made several forays into high-quality production
His early efforts included the critically panned part-talkie version of Edna Ferber's novel Show Boat the lavish musical Broadway which included Technicolor sequences and the first all-color musical feature for Universal King of Jazz
The more serious All Quiet on the Western Front won its year's Best Picture Oscar
created a niche for the studio beginning a series of horror films which extended into the s affectionately dubbed Universal Horror
Among them are Dracula Frankenstein The Mummy and The Invisible Man
Other Laemmle productions of this period include Imitation of Life and My Man Godfrey
Universal's forays into high-quality production spelled the end of the Laemmle era at the studio
Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky and for a time Universal slipped into receivership
The theater chain was scrapped but Carl Jr
held fast to distribution studio and production operations
The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish version of Show Boat a remake of its earlier part-talkie production and produced as a high-quality big-budget film rather than as a B-picture
The new film featured several stars from the Broadway stage version which began production in late and unlike the film was based on the Broadway musical rather than the novel
Carl Jr's spending habits alarmed company stockholders
They would not allow production to start on Show Boat unless the Laemmles obtained a loan
Universal was forced to seek a production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation pledging the Laemmle family's controlling interest in Universal as collateral
It was the first time Universal had borrowed money for a production in its -year history
The production went over budget Standard called in the loan cash-strapped Universal could not pay and Standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on April
Although Universal's Show Boat released a little over a month later became a critical and financial success it was not enough to save the Laemmles' involvement with the studio
They were unceremoniously removed from the company they had founded
Because the Laemmles personally oversaw production Show Boat was released despite the takeover with Carl Laemmle and Carl Laemmle Jr's names on the credits and in the advertising campaign of the film
Cheever Cowdin had taken over as president and chairman of the board of directors and instituted severe cuts in production budgets
Arthur Rank who bought a significant stake in the studio
Gone were the big ambitions and though Universal had a few big names under contract those it had been cultivating like William Wyler and Margaret Sullavan left
Meanwhile producer Joe Pasternak who had been successfully producing light musicals with young sopranos for Universal's German subsidiary repeated his formula in the United States
Teenage singer Deanna Durbin starred in Pasternak's first American film Three Smart Girls
The film was a box-office hit and reputedly resolved the studio's financial problems
The success of the film led Universal to offer her a contract which for the first five years of her career produced her most successful pictures
When Pasternak stopped producing Durbin's pictures and she outgrew her screen persona and pursued more dramatic roles the studio signed -year-old Gloria Jean for her own series of Pasternak musicals from she went on to star with Bing Crosby W
A popular Universal film of the late s was Destry Rides Again starring James Stewart as Destry and Marlene Dietrich in her comeback role after leaving Paramount
By the early s the company was concentrating on lower-budget productions that were the company's main staple westerns melodramas serials and sequels to the studio's horror pictures the latter now solely B pictures
The studio fostered many series The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys action features and serials the comic adventures of infant Baby Sandy comedies with Hugh Herbert and The Ritz Brothers musicals with Robert Paige Jane Frazee The Andrews Sisters and The Merry Macs and westerns with Tom Mix Buck Jones Bob Baker Johnny Mack Brown Rod Cameron and Kirby Grant
Universal could seldom afford its own stable of stars and often borrowed talent from other studios or hired freelance actors
In addition to Stewart and Dietrich Margaret Sullavan and Bing Crosby were two of the major names that made a couple of pictures for Universal during this period
Some stars came from radio including Edgar Bergen W
Fields and the comedy team of Abbott and Costello Bud Abbott and Lou Costello
Abbott and Costello's military comedy Buck Privates gave the former burlesque comedians a national and international profile
During the war years Universal did have a co-production arrangement with producer Walter Wanger and his partner director Fritz Lang lending the studio some amount of prestige productions
Universal's core audience base was still found in the neighborhood movie theaters and the studio continued to please the public with low- to medium-budget films
Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in new Sherlock Holmes mysteries teenage musicals with Gloria Jean Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan and screen adaptations of radio's Inner Sanctum Mysteries with Lon Chaney Jr
Alfred Hitchcock was also borrowed for two films from Selznick International Pictures Saboteur and Shadow of a Doubt
As Universal's main product had always been lower-budgeted films it was one of the last major studios to have a contract with Technicolor
The studio did not make use of the three-strip Technicolor process until Arabian Nights starring Jon Hall and Maria Montez
Technicolor was also utilized for the studio's remake of their horror melodrama Phantom of the Opera with Claude Rains and Nelson Eddy
With the success of their first two pictures a regular schedule of high-budget Technicolor films followed
Arthur Rank who had already owned a stake in the studio almost a decade before hoping to expand his American presence bought into a four-way merger with Universal the independent company International Pictures and producer Kenneth Young
The new combine United World Pictures was a failure and was dissolved within one year
Rank and International remained interested in Universal however culminating in the studio's reorganization as Universal-International the merger was announced on July
William Goetz a founder of International along with Leo Spitz was made head of production at the renamed Universal-International Pictures a subsidiary of Universal Pictures Company Inc
which also served as an import-export subsidiary and copyright holder for the production arm's films
Mayer decided to bring prestige to the new company
He stopped the studio's low-budget production of B movies serials and curtailed Universal's horror and Arabian Nights cycles
He also reduced the studio's output from its wartime average of fifty films per year which was near twice the major studio's output to thirty-five films a year
Distribution and copyright control remained under the name of Universal Pictures Company Inc
Universal-International became responsible for the American distribution of Rank's British productions including such classics as David Lean's Great Expectations and Laurence Olivier's Hamlet
Broadening its scope further Universal-International branched out into the lucrative non-theatrical field buying a majority stake in home-movie dealer Castle Films in and taking the company over entirely in
For three decades Castle would offer highlights reels from the Universal film library to home-movie enthusiasts and collectors
Goetz licensed Universal's preUniversal-International film library to Jack Broeder's Realart Pictures for cinema re-release but Realart was not allowed to show the films on television
The production arm of the studio still struggled
While there were to be a few hits like The Killers and The Naked City Universal-International's new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office
By the late s Goetz was out and the studio returned to low-budget and series films such as Ma and Pa Kettle a spin-off of the studio's hit The Egg and I and The inexpensive Francis the first film of a series about a talking mule became mainstays of the company
Once again the films of Abbott and Costello including Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein were among the studio's top-grossing productions
But at this point Rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor Milton Rackmil whose Decca Records would take full control of Universal in
Besides Abbott and Costello the studio retained the Walter Lantz cartoon studio whose product was released with Universal-International's films
In the s Universal-International resumed their series of Arabian Nights films many starring Tony Curtis
The studio also had a success with monster and science fiction films produced by William Alland with many directed by Jack Arnold and starring John Agar
Other successes were the melodramas directed by Douglas Sirk and produced by Ross Hunter although for film critics they were not so well thought of on the first release as they have since become
Among Universal-International's stable of stars were Rock Hudson Tony Curtis Jeff Chandler Audie Murphy and John Gavin
Although Decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the US
Leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose and in MCA agent Lew Wasserman made a deal with Universal for his client James Stewart that would change the rules of the business
Wasserman's deal gave Stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary
When one of those films Winchester ' proved to be a hit the arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at Universal and eventually at other studios as well
In the early s Universal set up its own distribution company in France and in the late s the company also started a production company in Paris Universal Productions France SA although sometimes credited by the name of the distribution company Universal Pictures France
Except for the two first films it produced Claude Chabrol's Le scandale English title The Champagne Murders and Romain Gary's Les oiseaux vont mourir au Prou English title Birds in Peru it was only involved in French or other European co-productions including Louis Malle's Lacombe Lucien Bertrand Blier's Les Valseuses English title Going Places and Fred Zinnemann's The Day of the Jackal
It was only involved in approximately French film productions
In the early s the unit was incorporated into the French Cinema International Corporation arm
By the late s the motion picture business was again changing
The combination of the studiotheater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the reduced audience size for cinema productions
The Music Corporation of America MCA the world's largest talent agency had also become a powerful television producer renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Productions subsidiary
After a period of complete shutdown a moribund Universal agreed to sell its -acre km studio lot to MCA in for million renamed Revue Studios
MCA owned the studio lot but not Universal Pictures yet was increasingly influential on Universal's products
The studio lot was upgraded and modernized while MCA clients like Doris Day Lana Turner Cary Grant and director Alfred Hitchcock were signed to Universal contracts
The long-awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA Inc
happened in mid- as part of the MCA-Decca Records merger
The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures from Universal-International
As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract
In MCA formed Universal City Studios Inc merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions officially renamed as Universal Television in
And so with MCA in charge Universal became a full-blown A-film movie studio with leading actors and directors under contract offering slick commercial films and a studio tour subsidiary launched in
Television production made up much of the studio's output with Universal heavily committed in particular to deals with NBC which much later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal see below providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons
An innovation during this period championed by Universal was the made-for-television movie
In Universal became the studio base for many shows that were produced by Norman Lear's Tandem ProductionsEmbassy Television including Diff'rent Strokes One Day at a Time The Jeffersons The Facts of Life and Silver Spoons which premiered on NBC that same fall
Wallis who had recently worked as a major producer at Paramount moved over to Universal where he produced several films among them a lavish version of Maxwell Anderson's Anne of the Thousand Days and the equally lavish Mary Queen of Scots
Although neither could claim to be a big financial hit both films received Academy Award nominations and Anne was nominated for Best Picture Best Actor Richard Burton Best Actress Genevive Bujold and Best Supporting Actor Anthony Quayle
Wallis retired from Universal after making the film Rooster Cogburn a sequel to True Grit which Wallis had produced at Paramount
Rooster Cogburn co-starred John Wayne reprising his Oscar-winning role from the earlier film and Katharine Hepburn their only film together
The film was only a moderate success
In Universal Pictures launched an independent film arm designed to release specialty films Universal Classics and the division has sights on separation
In both Universal Pictures along with MGMUA Communications Co
and Paramount Pictures teamed up in order to market feature film and television product to China and the consumer reach is measured in terms of the -billion admission tickets that were clocked in China in and Worldwide Media Sales a division of the New York-based Worldwide Media Group had been placed in charge of the undertaking
In the early s the company had its own pay television arm Universal Pay Television aka
Universal Pay TV Programming Inc which spawned in an -picture cable television agreement with then-independent film studio New Line Cinema
In the early s Universal teamed up with Paramount to form Cinema International Corporation which distributed films by Paramount and Universal outside of the US and Canada
Although Universal did produce occasional hits among them Airport The Sting American Graffiti also Earthquake and a big box-office success which restored the company's fortunes Jaws Universal during the decade was primarily a television studio
When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased United Artists in MGM could not drop out of the CIC venture to merge with United Artists overseas operations
However with future film productions from both names being released through the MGMUA Entertainment plate CIC decided to merge UA's international units with MGM and reformed as United International Pictures

Anxious to expand the company's broadcast and cable presence longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner
He located Japanese electronics manufacturer Matsushita Electric now known as Panasonic which agreed to acquire MCA for billion in
Matsushita provided a cash infusion but the clash of cultures was too great to overcome and five years later Matsushita sold an stake in MCAUniversal to Canadian drinks distributor Seagram for billion
Seagram sold off its stake in DuPont to fund this expansion into the entertainment industry
Hoping to build an entertainment empire around Universal Seagram bought PolyGram in and other entertainment properties but the fluctuating profits characteristic of Hollywood were no substitute for the reliable income stream gained from the previously held shares in DuPont
To raise money Seagram head Edgar Bronfman Jr

In June Seagram was sold to French water utility and media company Vivendi which owned StudioCanal the conglomerate then became known as Vivendi Universal
