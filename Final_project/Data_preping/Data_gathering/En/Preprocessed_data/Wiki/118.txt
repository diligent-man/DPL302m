In 2014, a series of groundbreaking diplomatic meetings was held between Wang Yu-chi, in his official capacity as the Minister of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of the Republic of China (ROC), and Zhang Zhijun, the Minister of the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
The first meeting took place in Nanjing on 11 February 2014 when Wang visited mainland China, the very first official contact between the two governments across the Taiwan Strait after the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949
The tour of Wang and his delegates lasted from 11 to 14 February in Nanjing and Shanghai.
On 25–28 June 2014, Zhang paid a retrospective visit to Taiwan in order to rebuild ties in the aftermath of the Sunflower Movement

Both of them called on the establishment of a regular dialogue mechanism between their two agencies to enhance mutual understanding and facilitate cross-strait engagement
Wang was also invited by Zhang to visit mainland China.
Prior to the first official meeting between Wang Yu-chi and Zhang Zhijun in Nanjing, Wang was not expected to sign any paper agreement with the Chinese mainland government as requested by the Legislative Yuan earlier on 11 January.
On 12 June 2014, the MAC confirmed in a press conference of the four-day visit of Zhang Zhijun to Taiwan in end of June 2014
The TAO staff reportedly said that this trip would be conducted in the spirit of equality and dignity after Wang's visit to mainland China earlier on
It was reportedly that Zhang wishes to better understand the general perception of the Taiwanese people so that misunderstanding about mainland China can be reduced
Two days prior to Zhang's arrival in Taiwan, the MAC said that both sides would not discuss any highly sensitive political issues and would not sign any agreement or release any joint statement
The opposition Democratic Progressive Party demanded that the meeting to be conducted without any discussion about one China, one China framework and one country, two areas concepts or military mutual trust mechanism and peace treaties issues.
Speaking at Taoyuan International Airport in Taiwan before departure to Nanjing with a delegation of 20 people, Wang said that he hoped that this trip would be smooth and help to promote mutual understanding between the two sides
Upon arrival at Nanjing Lukou International Airport in Nanjing, Wang and his delegates were welcomed by Chen Yuanfeng, deputy director of Taiwan Affairs Office.
At the Purple Palace Nanjing (Chinese: 南京紫金山庄) before shaking hand, Wang referred Zhang as "TAO Director Zhang Zhijun" and Zhang referred Wang as "Minister Wang Yu-chi" without mentioning the name Mainland Affairs Council
However, mainland China's Xinhua News Agency referred Wang as the "Responsible Official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council" (Chinese: 台湾方面大陆委员会负责人; pinyin: Táiwān Fāngmiàn Dàlù Wěiyuánhuì Fùzé Rén) in its Chinese-language news or as the "Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Chief" in its English-language news.
Upon meeting with Zhang which began at 2 p.m., both of them agreed on establishing a direct and regular communication channel between the two sides for future engagement under the 1992 Consensus

He called on people on both sides of the strait to keep carrying on Chinese traditional culture
He noted that there are still many differences between Taiwan and mainland China in terms of culture, society and education

He also tactfully spoke about democracy.
After arriving in Shanghai by Maglev from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Wang and delegates joined a think tank on cross-strait relations with 14 scholars including the President of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences
Wang was referred as the head of an agency of Taiwan area

After the meeting, Wang continued his trip to visit Shanghai Media Group and Shanghai Television
At Shanghai Television, Wang urged the Chinese mainland government to lift bans against certain Taiwanese websites to allow Chinese mainland people to see more shows, especially regarding Taiwanese films, TV programs and pop music

Speaking in a forum at a school for children of Taiwanese businessmen in Shanghai, Wang said that his visit to Nanjing was aimed to build mutual understanding between both sides of the Taiwan Strait
He said that from his experience studying abroad, misunderstanding between people can caused by cultural differences, such that accepting differences and respecting other is something easy to understand but difficult to put into practice.
ROC President Ma Ying-jeou hailed the meeting to be extraordinary significant.
United States Department of State Spokesperson Jen Psaki welcomed the meeting and the steps taken by both sides to reduce tension and improve relations.Upon arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City) on an Air China flight, Zhang was welcomed by Chang Hsien-yao, Special Deputy Minister of Mainland Affairs Council

During the press conference following the meeting, the spokesperson of TAO conveyed a remark saying that both sides should be committed to develop and further consolidate the political foundation to continue cross-strait exchanges in various fields despite the recent twists and turns
On the MAC side, Wang made a remark saying that Zhang had responded positively to MAC proposal to reopen negotiations on certain controversial items in the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement signed last year provided that the agreement is first put into effect.
Opposition parties accused the National Security Bureau and the police of reportedly breaking into a room of the Novotel Hotel without a search warrant to expel people they suspected would protest against Zhang, saying the act was a serious violation of human rights and an abuse of power.
In the evening, Zhang held a closed-door meeting with mostly pro-reunification activists, including New Revolutionary Alliance (Chinese: 新同盟會) President Hsu Li-nong and Shih Hsin University Professor Wang Hsiao-po.
Zhang started the day by visiting a group of veterans, mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwanese nationals and residents in Xizhi District, New Taipei City

Around ten people wrapped in iron chains and ropes were arrested for trying to blockade the car of Zhang Zhijun.
Zhang visited Kaohsiung by Taiwan High Speed Rail on Friday morning and met with Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu at Grand Hi-lai Hotel
While not mentioning the word "democracy" explicitly, Zhang made a statement saying that Chinese mainland leaders know that Taiwanese people value their own system and that the mainland respects their choices of social system, values and way of life
Responding to Zhang's statement, Chen said that Zhang should regard all of the protests he encountered in Taiwan as "normal", as they are part of Taiwan's democratic system and that she appreciated Zhang's understanding of the situation
She also told Zhang about the anger of Taiwanese over the recent statement made by TAO spokesperson Fan Liqing that the future of Taiwan must be decided by all Chinese people, not only the Taiwanese.
At I-Shou University, Zhang, accompanied by officials from TAO and MAC, had a meeting with the chairperson of E United Group
The meeting was then followed by a gathering of 20 Taiwanese and Chinese mainland students from the university for 20 minutes followed by a lunch
Media was not allowed in the meeting
Zhang later remarked that he hopes Taiwanese students would have the opportunity to visit mainland China and see how the two sides are deeply rooted in common ancestry
He said that the mainland would like to share its economic achievements with Taiwan, rather than to swallow Taiwan's economy.
Zhang continued his trip to visit Fo Guang Shan, a famous Buddhist temple in Dashu District
Practitioners lined up from the entrance and waved flags to welcome him
The visit to this venue was the only visit in which Zhang did not encounter protesters.
When Zhang arrived at a casual meeting with Wang Yu-chi at Sizihwan Sunset Beach Resort in Xiziwan, Gushan District in the evening around 8:10 pm, protesters organized by Taiwan Solidarity Union and Black Island National Youth Front greeted the motorcade by spraying white paint and throwing ghost money, shouting slogans such as "One Country on Each Side" and "Zhang Zhijun get out of here"
The white paint did not hit Zhang but instead his body guards
There were at least 400 policemen and 66 special officers deployed to the site at that time.
After Zhang had entered the building safely to meet Wang, MAC Deputy Minister Chang Hsien-yao appeared outside the venue in apparent anger
He criticized the council staff and demanded to speak with the police officer in charge in the insufficiency of police personnel at the site
Chang then started to order the police and SWAT to be standby the door.
Zhang responded to the protest by saying such protest was normal and saying that Taiwanese society is plural with many diversity views, and that he believed that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should adhere to the path of peaceful development in cross-trait relations
Wang then told Zhang that people protesting to make their voice heard is part of the Taiwanese life, and that since he is the head of TAO, he must get used to it and understand Taiwan more, because the ROC government has been experiencing such protests everyday in life.
In his last day trip to Taiwan, Zhang visited the Hui-ming Elementary School for the Blind in Taichung at noon where he had a chat with Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
Zhang also delivered a short speech at the school saying that he had made a wish during his visit to Fo Guang Shan at Kaohsiung hoping that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can resolve long-term issues gradually with wisdom and familial affection and jointly make contribution to revive the Chinese nation.
