Russian Turkestan Russian romanized Russkiy Turkestan was the western part of Turkestan within the Russian Empire s Central Asian territories and was administered as a Krai or Governor Generalship It comprised the oasis region to the south of the Kazakh Steppe but not the protectorates of the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Khiva
Although Russia had been pushing south into the steppes from Astrakhan and Orenburg since the failed Khivan expedition of Peter the Great in the beginning of the Russian conquest of Turkestan is normally dated to That year the Russian forces took the city of Tashkent under the leadership of General Mikhail Chernyayev expanding the territories of Turkestan Oblast part of Orenburg Governorate General Chernyayev had exceeded his orders he only had men under his command at the time but Saint Petersburg recognized the annexation in any case This was swiftly followed by the conquest of Khodzhent Dzhizak and Ura Tyube culminating in the annexation of Samarkand and the surrounding region on the Zeravshan River from the Emirate of Bukhara in forming the Zeravsh Special Okrug of Turkestan
An account of the Russian conquest of Tashkent was written in Urus leshkerining T rkistanda tarikh senelarda qilghan futuhlari by Mullah Khalibay Mambetov
In Turkestan was made a separate Governor Generalship under its first Governor General Konstantin Petrovich Von Kaufman Its capital was Tashkent and it consisted initially of three oblasts provinces Syr Darya Semirechye Oblast and the Zeravshan Okrug later Samarkand Oblast To these were added in the Amu Darya Division Russian otdel annexed from the Khanate of Khiva and in the Fergana Oblast formed from the remaining rump of the Kokand Khanate that was dissolved after an uprising in In the Transcaspian Region which had been conquered in by military generals Mikhail Skobelev and Mikhail Annenkov was added to the Governor Generalship
The administration of the region had an almost purely military character throughout Von Kaufman died in and a committee under Fedor Karlovich Giers or Girs brother of the Russian Foreign Minister Nikolay Karlovich Giers toured the Krai and drew up proposals for reform which were implemented after In the new Trans Caspian railway begun at Uzun Ada on the shores of the Caspian Sea in reached Samarkand Nevertheless Turkestan remained an isolated colonial outpost with an administration that preserved many distinctive features from the previous Islamic regimes including Qadis' courts and a 'native' administration that devolved much power to local 'Aksakals' Elders or Headmen It was quite unlike European Russia In Count Konstantin Konstantinovich Pahlen led another reform commission to Turkestan which produced in a monumental report documenting administrative corruption and inefficiency The Jadid educational reform movement which originated among Tatars spread among Muslims of Central Asia under Russian rule
A policy of deliberately enforcing anti modern traditional ancient conservative Islamic education in schools and Islamic ideology was enforced by the Russians in order to deliberately hamper and destroy opposition to their rule by keeping them in a state of torpor to and prevent foreign ideologies from penetrating in
The Russians implemented Turkification upon the Ferghana and Sarmakand Tajiks replacing the Tajik language with Uzbek resulting in an Uzbek dominant speaking Samarkand whereas decades before Tajik was the dominant language in Samarkand
In the railway reached Tashkent and finally in a direct rail link with European Russia was opened across the steppe from Orenburg to Tashkent This led to much larger numbers of ethnic Russian settlers flowing into Turkestan than had hitherto been the case and their settlement was overseen by a specially created Migration Department in Saint Petersburg This caused considerable discontent amongst the local population as these settlers took scarce land and water resources away from them In discontent boiled over in the Basmachi Revolt sparked by a decree conscripting the natives into labour battalions they had previously been exempt from military service Thousands of settlers were killed and this was matched by Russian reprisals particularly against the nomadic population To escape Russians slaughtering them in Uzbeks Kazakhs and Kyrgyz escaped to China Xinjiang became a sanctuary for fleeing Kazakhs escaping the Russians after the Muslims faced conscription by the Russian government The Turkmen Kyrgyz and Kazakhs were all impacted by the insurrection caused by the conscription decreed by the Russian government The corv e conscription issued on June Order had not really been restored by the time the February Revolution took place in This would usher in a still bloodier chapter in Turkestan's history as the Bolsheviks of the Tashkent Soviet launched an attack on the autonomous Jadid government in Kokand early in which left dead Resistance to the Bolsheviks by the local population dismissed as 'Basmachi' or 'Banditry' by Soviet historians continued well into the beginning of the s
