tamazgha berber tamaz a is a toponym in berber languages denoting the lands traditionally inhabited by berbers and which can also mean lands of the imazi en in northern africa
the region encompasses the geographical area between the mediterranean sea and the niger river a large swathe of territory spanning morocco algeria tunisia libya mauritania mali niger egypt the western sahara the canary islands burkina faso and senegal
although the berber linguistic root m z or z is ancient tamaz a as a toponym is derived from various berber languages coined in the context of berber nationalism
it appeared for the first time in algeria and morocco in the s
the most densely populated areas of the tamazgha are the coastal fertile regions of northern libya northern and eastern tunisia northern algeria northern morocco and the atlantic coast of morocco
tamazgha corresponds roughly to herodotus ancient libya and to the medieval barbary coast
the term is used by the berbers because there was not originally a common word that refers to all the geographical territory inhabited by the mazices since the berber people live in several berber countries and they are not united politically with many scattered around the world by the berber diaspora
so the name has been created to define an berber nation and unify the people of the tamazgha with their original culture
the term has been translated into spanish as mazigia abbreviated as mzg and used as an alternative international license plate code for some people
