the series declined considerably in popularity during its final two seasons and it was ultimately cancelled in the spring of after nine seasons and episodes
a two part miniseries dynasty the reunion aired in october
a reboot series with a new cast premiered on the cw in october

aaron spelling already well known for his successful abc series including starsky and hutch charlie s angels the love boat fantasy island vega and hart to hart took on richard and esther shapiro s vision of a rich and powerful family who lived and sinned in a room denver mansion
esther shapiro said that an inspiration for the show was i claudius a fictionalized depiction of the julio claudian dynasty of roman emperors
shapiro said in we wanted to do something that would be fun an american fantasy
we thought people had seen enough stories where families fell apart
we wanted a strong nineteenth century sort of family where people were in conflict but loved each other in spite of everything
intended by abc to be a competitor for cbs s dallas the working title for dynasty was oil
in early drafts of the pilot script the two main families featured in the series were known as the parkhursts and corbys by the time production began they had been renamed the carringtons and colbys
george peppard was cast as series patriarch blake carrington but ultimately had difficulties dealing with the somewhat unsympathetic role and was quickly replaced with john forsythe
filmed in the pilot was among many delayed due to a strike precipitated by animosity between the television networks and the partnership of the screen actors guild and the american federation of television and radio artists
dynasty finally premiered on abc as a three hour event on january
during its run dynasty explored issues such as rape homosexuality and racial integration and put middle aged women in the forefront
acknowledging that the show is however primarily entertaining producer douglas s
cramer said we walk a fine line just this side of camp
careful calculations are made
we sense that while it might be wonderful for krystle and alexis to have a catfight in a koi pond it would be inappropriate for joan to smack linda with a koi
as dynasty begins powerful oil tycoon blake carrington john forsythe is about to marry the younger krystle jennings linda evans his former secretary
beautiful earnest and new to blake s world krystle finds a hostile reception in the carrington household the staff patronizes her and blake s headstrong and promiscuous daughter fallon pamela sue martin resents her
though devoted to krystle blake himself is too preoccupied with his company denver carrington and blind to krystle s predicament
her only ally is her stepson steven al corley whose complicated relationship with blake stems from their fundamental political differences and steven s reluctance to step into his role as future leader of the carrington empire
meanwhile fallon better suited to follow in blake s footsteps is as a woman underestimated by and considered little more than a trophy to her father
she channels her energies into toying with various male suitors including the carrington chauffeur michael culhane wayne northrop
at the end of the three hour premiere episode oil steven finally confronts his father criticizing blake s capitalistic values and seemingly amoral business practices

returning from an extended assignment in the middle east matthew quits and goes into business with wildcatter walter lankershim dale robertson and as blake s behavior begins pushing krystle toward matthew the men are set as both business and romantic rivals
blake is further enraged when steven goes to work for longtime friend matthew in whom steven sees qualities lacking in blake
though previously in a relationship with another man steven finds himself drawn to claudia who is putting her life back together after spending time in a psychiatric hospital
esther shapiro later said in the dvd commentary of the first season the audience told us almost immediately all they wanted to do was be in the mansion
they couldn t care less about the oil fields
they didn t want to see grubby rooms
fallon makes a secret business deal with blake s old friend and more powerful business rival cecil colby lloyd bochner marrying his nephew jeff john james to secure cecil s financial assistance for her father

abc reran season one in summer at pm on wednesdays the new time slot for season two and initiated a media blitz to promote the series
in the first episode of the second season titled enter alexis the mysterious witness removes her sunglasses to reveal british actress joan collins as a new arrival to the series
collins s alexis carrington blazed a trail across the show and its story lines the additions of collins and the formidable writing team of eileen and robert mason pollock are generally credited with dynasty s subsequent rise in the nielsen ratings
the pollocks soft pedaled the business angle of the show and bombarded viewers with every soap opera staple in the book presented at such a fast clip that a new tragedy seemed to befall the carrington family every five minutes alexis s testimony notwithstanding krystle is immediately put off by the former mrs
carrington s condescending attitude and manipulations krystle s subsequent discovery that alexis had caused her miscarriage by intentionally startling her horse with a gunshot settles alexis as krystle s implacable nemesis
other new characters of the season are the psychiatrist nick toscanni james farentino who tries to seduce krystle while bedding fallon and plotting against blake and krystle s greedy niece sammy jo dean heather locklear who marries steven for his money
the season finale sees blake left for dead on a mountain after a fight with nick
by that time dynasty had entered the top
esther shapiro lamented in the season one dvd commentary had the series been left to us and been a less huge hit i think we would have seen these characters realized pretty much the way they are in season one
when alexis came into it it changed the tenor and that s the way they are now on television you have your traditional villain and i think that plays to a different denominator
in the third season ranked fifth in the ratings alexis marries cecil on his deathbed and acquires his company colbyco
in the meantime adam carrington gordon thomson the long lost son of alexis and blake who had been kidnapped in infancy reappears in denver and almost starts an affair with fallon before they discover they are siblings

with the show s popularity soaring in the fourth season now the third most watched program of former president gerald ford guest starred as himself in along with his wife betty and former secretary of state henry kissinger
new characters included the charming and ambitious farnsworth dex dexter michael nader the scheming public relations assistant tracy kendall deborah adair the unscrupulous playboy peter de vilbis helmut berger and blake s illegitimate african american half sister dominique deveraux diahann carroll
the main story lines included a custody battle between steven and blake over steven and sammy jo s son danny and a false accusation of illegal weapons dealings orchestrated by alexis to ruin blake s financial empire
in the season finale fallon disappears just before her second wedding to jeff now divorced of kirby as her car seemingly collides with a truck on a stormy night to accommodate the departure of pamela sue martin from the series while alexis is arrested for the murder of mark jennings
driven by the new head writer and producer camille marchetta who had devised the wildly successful who shot j r scenario on dallas five years earlier dynasty hit no
in the fifth season
in the story alexis is exonerated and her secret daughter amanda bedford catherine oxenberg comes to denver and discovers that blake is her father
steven has married claudia but leaves her for a man and claudia starts an affair with adam
the marriage of blake and krystle is in crisis after the birth of their daughter krystina dominique struggles to be accepted as a carrington and loses her husband brady lloyd billy dee williams in the process and sammy jo discovers she is the heiress to a huge fortune
at the end of the season an amnesiac fallon now portrayed by actress emma samms reappears while the rest of the family go to europe for the wedding of amanda and prince michael of moldavia michael praed
during the season dynasty attracted controversy when rock hudson s real life hiv positive status was revealed after a romantic storyline between his character daniel reece and evans s krystle
hudson s scenes required him to kiss evans and as news that he had contracted aids broke there was speculation evans would be at risk
the event led to a screen actors guild rule requiring the notification of performers in advance of any scenes that require open mouth kissing
over the run of the series the rivalry between alexis and krystle is a primary driver for the melodrama
alexis resents krystle s role as blake s wife and mistress of the carrington household and tries to undermine her at every opportunity while krystle makes increasingly bold efforts to keep alexis from interfering in the lives of their mutual loved ones
the pair have numerous verbal spats that sometimes lead to physical altercations
unfortunately the thing people remember about this show is the catfights noted collins in
entertainment columnist sue cameron said in that the catfights became so popular that the press were invited to watch the filming of them
krystle and alexis famously brawl for the first time in alexis s studio and then later in a lily pond
they also hurl mud at each other at a beauty salon and slide down a ravine together into a puddle of mud before having their final showdown brawl in a fashion studio in the miniseries dynasty the reunion
later in the series alexis also has a catfight with blake s half sister dominque diahann carroll and then her own cousin sable stephanie beacham
she even has a brawl with her on again off again lover and one time husband dex michael nader
krystle s niece sammy jo heather locklear also has her fair share of catfights as she first engages in a slap fight with claudia pamela bellwood before taking on amanda catherine oxenberg in a brawl in a swimming pool
sammy jo later fights fallon emma samms in a horse trough and the mud around it
evans even battles with herself at the climax of a storyline in which krystle is imprisoned and replaced by a lookalike named rita also played by evans krystle ends up battling rita in order to escape
in entertainment weekly termed alexis and krystle s catfights the gold standard of scratching and clawing
undoubtedly the most famous dynasty cliffhanger is the so called moldavian massacre which occurs during the may fifth season finale
amanda and prince michael s royal wedding is interrupted by terrorists during a military coup in moldavia riddling the chapel with bullets and leaving all of the major characters lying seemingly lifeless
esther shapiro later said it was a fairy tale terrorist attack

john james stated in the episode of e the true hollywood story featuring dynasty that the moldavian massacre was when the show maxed out and overdosed on outrageousness
creator esther shapiro stated in that she thought the cliffhanger was well produced but that they could ve done something else
joan collins was conspicuously absent from the season six opener she was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show seeking an increased salary
as a result the first episode had to be rewritten to explain her absence and many of alexis s scenes were given to krystle
collins s demands were met she reportedly signed a per episode contract and she returned to the series in the season s second episode
despite collins s absence the first episode of season six garnered a rating becoming the most watched episode of the series as viewers wanted to see who survived the season five cliffhanger
