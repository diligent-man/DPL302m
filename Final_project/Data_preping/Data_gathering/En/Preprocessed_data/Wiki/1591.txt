Aaron Spelling already well known for his successful ABC series including Starsky and Hutch Charlie's Angels The Love Boat Fantasy Island Vega and Hart to Hart took on Richard and Esther Shapiro's vision of a rich and powerful family who lived and sinned in a room Denver mansion Esther Shapiro said that an inspiration for the show was I Claudius a fictionalized depiction of the Julio Claudian dynasty of Roman emperors Shapiro said in We wanted to do something that would be fun an American fantasy We thought people had seen enough stories where families fell apart We wanted a strong nineteenth century sort of family where people were in conflict but loved each other in spite of everything
Intended by ABC to be a competitor for CBS's Dallas the working title for Dynasty was Oil In early drafts of the pilot script the two main families featured in the series were known as the Parkhursts and Corbys by the time production began they had been renamed the Carringtons and Colbys George Peppard was cast as series patriarch Blake Carrington but ultimately had difficulties dealing with the somewhat unsympathetic role and was quickly replaced with John Forsythe Filmed in the pilot was among many delayed due to a strike precipitated by animosity between the television networks and the partnership of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists Dynasty finally premiered on ABC as a three hour event on January
During its run Dynasty explored issues such as rape homosexuality and racial integration and put middle aged women in the forefront Acknowledging that the show is however primarily entertaining producer Douglas S Cramer said We walk a fine line just this side of camp Careful calculations are made We sense that while it might be wonderful for Krystle and Alexis to have a catfight in a koi pond it would be inappropriate for Joan to smack Linda with a koi
As Dynasty begins powerful oil tycoon Blake Carrington John Forsythe is about to marry the younger Krystle Jennings Linda Evans his former secretary Beautiful earnest and new to Blake's world Krystle finds a hostile reception in the Carrington household—the staff patronizes her and Blake's headstrong and promiscuous daughter Fallon Pamela Sue Martin resents her Though devoted to Krystle Blake himself is too preoccupied with his company Denver Carrington and blind to Krystle's predicament Her only ally is her stepson Steven Al Corley whose complicated relationship with Blake stems from their fundamental political differences and Steven's reluctance to step into his role as future leader of the Carrington empire Meanwhile Fallon better suited to follow in Blake's footsteps is as a woman underestimated by and considered little more than a trophy to her father She channels her energies into toying with various male suitors including the Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane Wayne Northrop At the end of the three hour premiere episode Oil Steven finally confronts his father criticizing Blake's capitalistic values and seemingly amoral business practices Blake explodes revealing the secret of which Steven thought his father was unaware Blake is disgusted by Steven's homosexuality and his refusal to conform sets father and son at odds for some time
In counterpoint to the Carringtons are the Blaisdels Denver Carrington geologist Matthew Bo Hopkins—unhappily married to the emotionally fragile Claudia Pamela Bellwood—is Krystle's ex lover Returning from an extended assignment in the Middle East Matthew quits and goes into business with wildcatter Walter Lankershim Dale Robertson and as Blake's behavior begins pushing Krystle toward Matthew the men are set as both business and romantic rivals Blake is further enraged when Steven goes to work for longtime friend Matthew in whom Steven sees qualities lacking in Blake Though previously in a relationship with another man Steven finds himself drawn to Claudia who is putting her life back together after spending time in a psychiatric hospital Esther Shapiro later said in the DVD commentary of the first season The audience told us almost immediately All they wanted to do was be in the mansion They couldn't care less about the oil fields They didn't want to see grubby rooms
Fallon makes a secret business deal with Blake's old friend and more powerful business rival Cecil Colby Lloyd Bochner marrying his nephew Jeff John James to secure Cecil's financial assistance for her father When Blake stumbles upon Steven in an innocent goodbye embrace with his former lover Ted Dinard Mark Withers Blake angrily pushes the two men apart Ted falls backward and hits his head the injury proving fatal Blake is arrested and charged with murder and an angry Steven testifies that Ted's death had been the result of malicious intent A veiled surprise witness for the prosecution appears in the season finale The Testimony and Fallon gasps in recognition Oh my God that's my mother
The first season of Dynasty was modestly popular among viewers ranking with a Nielsen rating while series Dallas achieved a rating that season ABC reran season one in summer at PM on Wednesdays the new time slot for season two and initiated a media blitz to promote the series
In the first episode of the second season titled Enter Alexis the mysterious witness removes her sunglasses to reveal British actress Joan Collins as a new arrival to the series Collins's Alexis Carrington blazed a trail across the show and its story lines the additions of Collins and the formidable writing team of Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock are generally credited with Dynasty's subsequent rise in the Nielsen ratings The Pollocks soft pedaled the business angle of the show and bombarded viewers with every soap opera staple in the book presented at such a fast clip that a new tragedy seemed to befall the Carrington family every five minutes Alexis's testimony notwithstanding Krystle is immediately put off by the former Mrs Carrington's condescending attitude and manipulations Krystle's subsequent discovery that Alexis had caused her miscarriage by intentionally startling her horse with a gunshot settles Alexis as Krystle's implacable nemesis Other new characters of the season are the psychiatrist Nick Toscanni James Farentino who tries to seduce Krystle while bedding Fallon and plotting against Blake and Krystle's greedy niece Sammy Jo Dean Heather Locklear who marries Steven for his money The season finale sees Blake left for dead on a mountain after a fight with Nick By that time Dynasty had entered the Top Esther Shapiro lamented in the season one DVD commentary Had the series been left to us and been a less huge hit I think we would have seen these characters realized pretty much the way they are in season one When Alexis came into it it changed the tenorAnd that's the way they are now on television you have your traditional villain and I think that plays to a different denominator
In the third season ranked fifth in the ratings Alexis marries Cecil on his deathbed and acquires his company ColbyCo In the meantime Adam Carrington Gordon Thomson the long lost son of Alexis and Blake who had been kidnapped in infancy reappears in Denver and almost starts an affair with Fallon before they discover they are siblings Also introduced are Krystle's ex husband tennis pro Mark Jennings Geoffrey Scott and Kirby Anders Kathleen Beller the daughter of longtime Carrington majordomo Joseph Lee Bergere Kirby catches Adam's eye but weds Jeff after his divorce from Fallon In the middle of the season news that Steven has been killed in an accident in Indonesia comes to the Carringtons he survives but undergoes plastic surgery and returns to Denver portrayed by Jack Coleman In the third season cliffhanger Alexis lures Krystle to Steven's cabin and the two are locked inside while the cabin is set ablaze by an unseen arsonist later revealed to be Joseph who had meant for the fire to kill only Alexis and not Krystle
With the show's popularity soaring in the fourth season now the third most watched program of former President Gerald Ford guest starred as himself in along with his wife Betty and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger New characters included the charming and ambitious Farnsworth Dex Dexter Michael Nader the scheming public relations assistant Tracy Kendall Deborah Adair the unscrupulous playboy Peter De Vilbis Helmut Berger and Blake's illegitimate African American half sister Dominique Deveraux Diahann Carroll The main story lines included a custody battle between Steven and Blake over Steven and Sammy Jo's son Danny and a false accusation of illegal weapons dealings orchestrated by Alexis to ruin Blake's financial empire In the season finale Fallon disappears just before her second wedding to Jeff now divorced of Kirby as her car seemingly collides with a truck on a stormy night to accommodate the departure of Pamela Sue Martin from the series while Alexis is arrested for the murder of Mark Jennings
Driven by the new head writer and producer Camille Marchetta who had devised the wildly successful Who Shot JR scenario on Dallas five years earlier Dynasty hit No in the fifth season In the story Alexis is exonerated and her secret daughter Amanda Bedford Catherine Oxenberg comes to Denver and discovers that Blake is her father Steven has married Claudia but leaves her for a man and Claudia starts an affair with Adam The marriage of Blake and Krystle is in crisis after the birth of their daughter Krystina Dominique struggles to be accepted as a Carrington and loses her husband Brady Lloyd Billy Dee Williams in the process and Sammy Jo discovers she is the heiress to a huge fortune At the end of the season an amnesiac Fallon now portrayed by actress Emma Samms reappears while the rest of the family go to Europe for the wedding of Amanda and Prince Michael of Moldavia Michael Praed
During the season Dynasty attracted controversy when Rock Hudson's real life HIV positive status was revealed after a romantic storyline between his character Daniel Reece and Evans's Krystle Hudson's scenes required him to kiss Evans and as news that he had contracted AIDS broke there was speculation Evans would be at risk The event led to a Screen Actors Guild rule requiring the notification of performers in advance of any scenes that require open mouth kissing
Over the run of the series the rivalry between Alexis and Krystle is a primary driver for the melodrama Alexis resents Krystle's role as Blake's wife and mistress of the Carrington household and tries to undermine her at every opportunity while Krystle makes increasingly bold efforts to keep Alexis from interfering in the lives of their mutual loved ones The pair have numerous verbal spats that sometimes lead to physical altercations Unfortunately the thing people remember about this show is the catfights noted Collins in Entertainment columnist Sue Cameron said in that the catfights became so popular that the press were invited to watch the filming of them Krystle and Alexis famously brawl for the first time in Alexis's studio and then later in a lily pond They also hurl mud at each other at a beauty salon and slide down a ravine together into a puddle of mud before having their final showdown brawl in a fashion studio in the miniseries Dynasty The Reunion Later in the series Alexis also has a catfight with Blake's half sister Dominque Diahann Carroll and then her own cousin Sable Stephanie Beacham She even has a brawl with her on again off again lover and one time husband Dex Michael Nader Krystle's niece Sammy Jo Heather Locklear also has her fair share of catfights as she first engages in a slap fight with Claudia Pamela Bellwood before taking on Amanda Catherine Oxenberg in a brawl in a swimming pool Sammy Jo later fights Fallon Emma Samms in a horse trough and the mud around it Evans even battles with herself at the climax of a storyline in which Krystle is imprisoned and replaced by a lookalike named Rita also played by Evans Krystle ends up battling Rita in order to escape In Entertainment Weekly termed Alexis and Krystle's catfights the gold standard of scratching and clawing
Undoubtedly the most famous Dynasty cliffhanger is the so called Moldavian Massacre which occurs during the May fifth season finale Amanda and Prince Michael's royal wedding is interrupted by terrorists during a military coup in Moldavia riddling the chapel with bullets and leaving all of the major characters lying seemingly lifeless Esther Shapiro later said It was a fairy tale terrorist attack It was beautifully shot like a Goya painting It became the most talked about episode of any TV series during the calendar year of with a viewership of million In Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly named it one of the seven Unforgettable Cliff Hangers of prime time dramatic television
When the series resumed on September viewers quickly learned that only two minor characters of the series had died Steven's boyfriend Luke Fuller Billy Campbell who was mortally wounded saving Claudia's life and Jeff's love interest Lady Ashley Mitchell Ali MacGraw In the CBS special Dynasty Reunion Catfights Caviar Gordon Thomson stated that it was the follow up that was the letdown not the cliffhanger itself John James stated in the episode of E The True Hollywood Story featuring Dynasty that the Moldavian Massacre was when the show maxed out and overdosed on outrageousness Creator Esther Shapiro stated in that she thought the cliffhanger was well produced but that they could've done something else
Joan Collins was conspicuously absent from the season six opener she was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show seeking an increased salary As a result the first episode had to be rewritten to explain her absence and many of Alexis's scenes were given to Krystle Collins's demands were met she reportedly signed a per episode contract and she returned to the series in the season's second episode Despite Collins's absence the first episode of season six garnered a rating becoming the most watched episode of the series as viewers wanted to see who survived the season five cliffhanger
Although still a top ten series Dynasty dropped from first to seventh place in the ratings for its sixth season which featured a look alike woman named Rita who poses as Krystle with both roles played by Linda Evans introduced Alexis's sister Caress Kate O'Mara and launched the spin off series The Colbys Spurned by Blake Alexis finds his estranged brother Ben Christopher Cazenove and the duo successfully plot to strip Blake of his fortune Steven's budding relationship with the closeted Bart Fallmont Kevin Conroy is ruined by Adam's business motivated public revelation that Bart is gay Amanda who has divorced Prince Michael fights with Sammy Jo for the favors of Clay Fallmont Ted McGinley The May season finale finds Blake strangling Alexis while the rest of the cast is in peril at the La Mirage hotel which has been accidentally set afire by Claudia
