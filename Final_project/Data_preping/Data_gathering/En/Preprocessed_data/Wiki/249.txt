insurance is a means of protection from financial loss
it is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss
an entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer an insurance company an insurance carrier or an underwriter
a person or entity who buys insurance is known as a policyholder while a person or entity covered under the policy is called an insured
policyholder and insured are often used as but are not necessarily synonyms as coverage can sometimes extend to additional insureds who did not buy the insurance
the insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed known and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer a premium in exchange for the insurer s promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss
the loss may or may not be financial but it must be reducible to financial terms
furthermore it usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership possession or pre existing relationship
the insured receives a contract called the insurance policy which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured or their designated beneficiary or assignee
the amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium
if the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster
a mandatory out of pocket expense required by an insurance policy before an insurer will pay a claim is called a deductible or if required by a health insurance policy a copayment
the insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry
methods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced by babylonian chinese and indian traders as long ago as the rd and nd millennia bc respectively
chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel capsizing
codex hammurabi law c
bc stipulated that a sea captain ship manager or ship charterer that saved a ship from total loss was only required to pay one half the value of the ship to the ship owner
in the digesta seu pandectae the second volume of the codification of laws ordered by justinian i of the eastern roman empire a legal opinion written by the roman jurist paulus at the beginning of the crisis of the third century in ad was included about the lex rhodia rhodian law that articulates the general average principle of marine insurance established on the island of rhodes in approximately to bc as a member of the doric hexapolis plausibly by the phoenicians during the proposed dorian invasion and emergence of the purported sea peoples during the greek dark ages c
that led to the proliferation of the doric greek dialect
the law of general average constitutes the fundamental principle that underlies all insurance
in an archeological excavation in minya egypt under an eyalet of the ottoman empire produced a nerva antonine dynasty era tablet from the ruins of the temple of antinous in antino polis aegyptus that prescribed the rules and membership dues of a burial society collegium established in lanuvium italia in approximately ad during the reign of hadrian of the roman empire
in ad future u s
supreme court associate justice joseph p
bradley ad once employed as an actuary for the mutual benefit life insurance company submitted an article to the journal of the institute of actuaries detailing an historical account of a severan dynasty era life table compiled by the roman jurist ulpian in approximately ad during the reign of elagabalus that was also included in the digesta
concepts of insurance has been also found in rd century bc hindu scriptures such as dharmasastra arthashastra and manusmriti
the ancient greeks had marine loans
money was advanced on a ship or cargo to be repaid with large interest if the voyage prospers
however the money would not be repaid at all if the ship were lost thus making the rate of interest high enough to pay for not only for the use of the capital but also for the risk of losing it fully described by demosthenes
loans of this character have ever since been common in maritime lands under the name of bottomry and respondentia bonds
the direct insurance of sea risks for a premium paid independently of loans began in belgium about ad
separate insurance contracts i e insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts were invented in genoa in the th century as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates
the first known insurance contract dates from genoa in
furthermore in the next century maritime insurance developed widely and premiums were intuitively varied with risks
these new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment a separation of roles that first proved useful in marine insurance
the earliest known policy of life insurance was made in the royal exchange london on the th of june for s
for twelve months on the life of william gibbons
insurance became far more sophisticated in enlightenment era europe where specialized varieties developed
property insurance as we know it today can be traced to the great fire of london which in devoured more than houses
the devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance from a matter of convenience into one of urgency a change of opinion reflected in sir christopher wren s inclusion of a site for the insurance office in his new plan for london in a number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing but in economist nicholas barbon and eleven associates established the first fire insurance company the insurance office for houses at the back of the royal exchange to insure brick and frame homes
initially homes were insured by his insurance office
at the same time the first insurance schemes for the underwriting of business ventures became available
by the end of the seventeenth century london s growth as a centre for trade was increasing due to the demand for marine insurance
in the late s edward lloyd opened a coffee house which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships including those willing to underwrite such ventures
these informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance market lloyd s of london and several related shipping and insurance businesses
the first life insurance policies were taken out in the early th century
the first company to offer life insurance was the amicable society for a perpetual assurance office founded in london in by william talbot and sir thomas allen
upon the same principle edward rowe mores established the society for equitable assurances on lives and survivorship in
it was the world s first mutual insurer and it pioneered age based premiums based on mortality rate laying the framework for scientific insurance practice and development and the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently based
in the late th century accident insurance began to become available
the first company to offer accident insurance was the railway passengers assurance company formed in in england to insure against the rising number of fatalities on the nascent railway system
the first international insurance rule was the york antwerp rules yar for the distribution of costs between ship and cargo in the event of general average
in the association for the reform and codification of the law of nations the forerunner of the international law association ila was founded in brussels
it published the first yar in before switching to the present title of the international law association in
by the late th century governments began to initiate national insurance programs against sickness and old age
germany built on a tradition of welfare programs in prussia and saxony that began as early as in the s
in the s chancellor otto von bismarck introduced old age pensions accident insurance and medical care that formed the basis for germany s welfare state
in britain more extensive legislation was introduced by the liberal government in the national insurance act
this gave the british working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment
this system was greatly expanded after the second world war under the influence of the beveridge report to form the first modern welfare state
in the international network of insurance associations inia then an informal network became active and it have succeeded by the global federation of insurance associations gfia which was formally founded in to aim to increase insurance industry effectiveness in providing input to international regulatory bodies and to contribute more effectively to the international dialogue on issues of common interest
it consists of its member associations and observer association in countries which companies account for around of total insurance premiums worldwide
insurance involves pooling funds from many insured entities known as exposures to pay for the losses that only some insureds may incur
the insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring
in order to be an insurable risk the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics
insurance as a financial intermediary is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry but individual entities can also self insure through saving money for possible future losses
risk which can be insured by private companies typically share seven common characteristics
large number of similar exposure units since insurance operates through pooling resources the majority of insurance policies cover individual members of large classes allowing insurers to benefit from the law of large numbers in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses
exceptions include lloyd s of london which is famous for insuring the life or health of actors sports figures and other famous individuals
however all exposures will have particular differences which may lead to different premium rates
definite loss this type of loss takes place at a known time and place from a known cause
the classic example involves the death of an insured person on a life insurance policy
fire automobile accidents and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion
other types of losses may only be definite in theory
occupational disease for instance may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time place or cause is identifiable
ideally the time place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person with sufficient information could objectively verify all three elements
accidental loss the event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance
the loss should be pure in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost
events that contain speculative elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a lottery ticket are generally not considered insurable
large loss the size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured
insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy adjusting losses and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims
for small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses
there is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer
affordable premium if the likelihood of an insured event is so high or the cost of the event so large that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered then it is not likely that insurance will be purchased even if on offer
furthermore as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer
if there is no such chance of loss then the transaction may have the form of insurance but not the substance see the u s
financial accounting standards board pronouncement number accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts
calculable loss there are two elements that must be at least estimable if not formally calculable the probability of loss and the attendant cost
probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim
limited risk of catastrophically large losses insurable losses are ideally independent and non catastrophic meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and that individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base
capital constrains insurers ability to sell earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones
in the united states the federal government insures flood risk in specifically identified areas
in commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer s capital constraint
such properties are generally shared among several insurers or are insured by a single insurer which syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market when a company insures an individual entity there are basic legal requirements and regulations
several commonly cited legal principles of insurance include
indemnity the insurance company indemnifies or compensates the insured in the case of certain losses only up to the insured s interest
benefit insurance as it is stated in the study books of the chartered insurance institute the insurance company does not have the right of recovery from the party who caused the injury and must compensate the insured regardless of the fact that insured had already sued the negligent party for the damages for example personal accident insurance
insurable interest the insured typically must directly suffer from the loss
insurable interest must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved
the concept requires that the insured have a stake in the loss or damage to the life or property insured
what that stake is will be determined by the kind of insurance involved and the nature of the property ownership or relationship between the persons
the requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes insurance from gambling
utmost good faith uberrima fides the insured and the insurer are bound by a good faith bond of honesty and fairness
material facts must be disclosed
contribution insurers which have similar obligations to the insured contribute in the indemnification according to some method
subrogation the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue recoveries on behalf of the insured for example the insurer may sue those liable for the insured s loss
the insurers can waive their subrogation rights by using the special clauses
causa proxima or proximate cause the cause of loss the peril must be covered under the insuring agreement of the policy and the dominant cause must not be excluded
mitigation in case of any loss or casualty the asset owner must attempt to keep loss to a minimum as if the asset was not insured to indemnify means to make whole again or to be reinstated to the position that one was in to the extent possible prior to the happening of a specified event or peril
accordingly life insurance is generally not considered to be indemnity insurance but rather contingent insurance i e a claim arises on the occurrence of a specified event
there are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured
a reimbursement policy
a pay on behalf or on behalf of policy
an indemnification policyfrom an insured s standpoint the result is usually the same the insurer pays the loss and claims expenses
if the insured has a reimbursement policy the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be reimbursed by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including with the permission of the insurer claim expenses
under a pay on behalf policy the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything
most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of pay on behalf language which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim
under an indemnification policy the insurance carrier can generally either reimburse or pay on behalf of whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling process
an entity seeking to transfer risk an individual corporation or association of any type etc becomes the insured party once risk is assumed by an insurer the insuring party by means of a contract called an insurance policy
generally an insurance contract includes at a minimum the following elements identification of participating parties the insurer the insured the beneficiaries the premium the period of coverage the particular loss event covered the amount of coverage i e the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss and exclusions events not covered
an insured is thus said to be indemnified against the loss covered in the policy
when insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy
the fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium
insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims in theory for a relatively few claimants and for overhead costs
so long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses called reserves the remaining margin is an insurer s profit
policies typically include a number of exclusions for example
nuclear exclusion clause excluding damage caused by nuclear and radiation accidents
war exclusion clause excluding damage from acts of war or terrorism insurers may prohibit certain activities which are considered dangerous and therefore excluded from coverage
one system for classifying activities according to whether they are authorised by insurers refers to green light approved activities and events yellow light activities and events which require insurer consultation and or waivers of liability and red light activities and events which are prohibited and outside the scope of insurance cover
insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage
on one hand it can increase fraud on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies
insurance can influence the probability of losses through moral hazard insurance fraud and preventive steps by the insurance company
insurance scholars have typically used moral hazard to refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference
insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts
while in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles
however since about insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation such as through building codes
according to the study books of the chartered insurance institute there are variant methods of insurance as follows
co insurance risks shared between insurers
dual insurance having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk both the individual policies would not pay separately under a concept named contribution they would contribute together to make up the policyholder s losses
however in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance dual payment is allowed
self insurance situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselves
reinsurance situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another insurer called the reinsurerinsurers may use the subscription business model collecting premium payments periodically in return for on going and or compounding benefits offered to policyholders
insurers business model aims to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept
profit can be reduced to a simple equation
profit earned premium investment income incurred loss underwriting expenses insurers make money in two ways
through underwriting the process by which insurers select the risks to insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those risks and taking the brunt of the risk should it come to fruition
by investing the premiums they collect from insured partiesthe most complicated aspect of insuring is the actuarial science of ratemaking price setting of policies which uses statistics and probability to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk
after producing rates the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process
at the most basic level initial rate making involves looking at the frequency and severity of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils
thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss data bring the loss data to present value and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy
loss ratios and expense loads are also used
rating for different risk characteristics involves at the most basic level comparing the losses with loss relativities a policy with twice as many losses would therefore be charged twice as much
more complex multivariate analyses are sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results
other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses
upon termination of a given policy the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurer s underwriting profit on that policy
underwriting performance is measured by something called the combined ratio which is the ratio of expenses losses to premiums
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit while anything over indicates an underwriting loss
a company with a combined ratio over may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings
insurance companies earn investment profits on float
float or available reserve is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims
insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them until claims are paid out
the association of british insurers grouping together insurance companies and of uk insurance services has almost of the investments in the london stock exchange
in u s
industry profits from float totaled billion
in a letter to investors warren buffett wrote we were paid billion to hold our float in
in the united states the underwriting loss of property and casualty insurance companies was billion in the five years ending
but overall profit for the same period was billion as the result of float
some insurance industry insiders most notably hank greenberg do not believe that it is possible to sustain a profit from float forever without an underwriting profit as well but this opinion is not universally held
reliance on float for profit has led some industry experts to call insurance companies investment companies that raise the money for their investments by selling insurance
naturally the float method is difficult to carry out in an economically depressed period
bear markets do cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards so a poor economy generally means high insurance premiums
this tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known as the underwriting or insurance cycle
claims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance it is the actual product paid for
claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or through brokers or agents
the insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms or may accept claims on a standard industry form such as those produced by acord
insurance company claims departments employ a large number of claims adjusters supported by a staff of records management and data entry clerks
incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience
the adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim usually in close cooperation with the insured determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract and if so the reasonable monetary value of the claim and authorizes payment
the policyholder may hire their own public adjuster to negotiate the settlement with the insurance company on their behalf
for policies that are complicated where claims may be complex the insured may take out a separate insurance policy add on called loss recovery insurance which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claim
adjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is a third party involved the plaintiff who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as a deep pocket
the adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured either inside house counsel or outside panel counsel monitor litigation that may take years to complete and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judge
if a claims adjuster suspects under insurance the condition of average may come into play to limit the insurance company s exposure
in managing the claims handling function insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction administrative handling expenses and claims overpayment leakages
as part of this balancing act fraudulent insurance practices are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome
disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation see insurance bad faith
insurers will often use insurance agents to initially market or underwrite their customers
agents can be captive meaning they write only for one company or independent meaning that they can issue policies from several companies
the existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to the availability of improved and personalised services
companies also use broking firms banks and other corporate entities like self help groups microfinance institutions ngos etc to market their products
any risk that can be quantified can potentially be insured
specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils
an insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not
below are non exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that exist
a single policy may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below
for example vehicle insurance would typically cover both the property risk theft or damage to the vehicle and the liability risk legal claims arising from an accident
a home insurance policy in the united states typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner s belongings certain legal claims against the owner and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner s property
business insurance can take a number of different forms such as the various kinds of professional liability insurance also called professional indemnity pi which are discussed below under that name and the business owner s policy bop which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs in a way analogous to how homeowners insurance packages the coverages that a homeowner needs
vehicle insurance protects the policyholder against financial loss in the event of an incident involving a vehicle they own such as in a traffic collision
coverage typically includes
property coverage for damage to or theft of the car
liability coverage for the legal responsibility to others for bodily injury or property damage
medical coverage for the cost of treating injuries rehabilitation and sometimes lost wages and funeral expensesgap insurance covers the excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where your insurance company does not cover the entire loan
depending on the company s specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well
this coverage is marketed for those who put low down payments have high interest rates on their loans and those with month or longer terms
gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well
health insurance policies cover the cost of medical treatments
dental insurance like medical insurance protects policyholders for dental costs
in most developed countries all citizens receive some health coverage from their governments paid through taxation
in most countries health insurance is often part of an employer s benefits
disability insurance policies provide financial support in the event of the policyholder becoming unable to work because of disabling illness or injury
it provides monthly support to help pay such obligations as mortgage loans and credit cards
short term and long term disability policies are available to individuals but considering the expense long term policies are generally obtained only by those with at least six figure incomes such as doctors lawyers etc
short term disability insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months paying a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities
long term disability insurance covers an individual s expenses for the long term up until such time as they are considered permanently disabled and thereafter insurance companies will often try to encourage the person back into employment in preference to and before declaring them unable to work at all and therefore totally disabled
disability overhead insurance allows business owners to cover the overhead expenses of their business while they are unable to work
total permanent disability insurance provides benefits when a person is permanently disabled and can no longer work in their profession often taken as an adjunct to life insurance
workers compensation insurance replaces all or part of a worker s wages lost and accompanying medical expenses incurred because of a job related injury casualty insurance insures against accidents not necessarily tied to any specific property
it is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified such as auto workers compensation and some liability insurances
crime insurance is a form of casualty insurance that covers the policyholder against losses arising from the criminal acts of third parties
for example a company can obtain crime insurance to cover losses arising from theft or embezzlement
terrorism insurance provides protection against any loss or damage caused by terrorist activities
in the united states in the wake of the terrorism risk insurance act tria set up a federal program providing a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism
the program was extended until the end of by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra
kidnap and ransom insurance is designed to protect individuals and corporations operating in high risk areas around the world against the perils of kidnap extortion wrongful detention and hijacking
political risk insurance is a form of casualty insurance that can be taken out by businesses with operations in countries in which there is a risk that revolution or other political conditions could result in a loss life insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent s family or other designated beneficiary and may specifically provide for income to an insured person s family burial funeral and other final expenses
life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or an annuity
in most states a person cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge
annuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies are regulated as insurance and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires
annuities and pensions that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a retiree will outlive his or her financial resources
in that sense they are the complement of life insurance and from an underwriting perspective are the mirror image of life insurance
certain life insurance contracts accumulate cash values which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against
some policies such as annuities and endowment policies are financial instruments to accumulate or liquidate wealth when it is needed
in many countries such as the united states and the uk the tax law provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances
this leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax efficient method of saving as well as protection in the event of early death
in the united states the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred
however in some cases the benefit derived from tax deferral may be offset by a low return
this depends upon the insuring company the type of policy and other variables mortality market return etc
moreover other income tax saving vehicles e g iras k plans roth iras may be better alternatives for value accumulation
burial insurance is an old type of life insurance which is paid out upon death to cover final expenses such as the cost of a funeral
the greeks and romans introduced burial insurance c ce when they organized guilds called benevolent societies which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral expenses of members upon death
guilds in the middle ages served a similar purpose as did friendly societies during victorian times
property insurance provides protection against risks to property such as fire theft or weather damage
this may include specialized forms of insurance such as fire insurance flood insurance earthquake insurance home insurance inland marine insurance or boiler insurance
the term property insurance may like casualty insurance be used as a broad category of various subtypes of insurance some of which are listed below
aviation insurance protects aircraft hulls and spares and associated liability risks such as passenger and third party liability
airports may also appear under this subcategory including air traffic control and refuelling operations for international airports through to smaller domestic exposures
boiler insurance also known as boiler and machinery insurance or equipment breakdown insurance insures against accidental physical damage to boilers equipment or machinery
builder s risk insurance insures against the risk of physical loss or damage to property during construction
builder s risk insurance is typically written on an all risk basis covering damage arising from any cause including the negligence of the insured not otherwise expressly excluded
builder s risk insurance is coverage that protects a person s or organization s insurable interest in materials fixtures or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an insured peril
crop insurance may be purchased by farmers to reduce or manage various risks associated with growing crops
such risks include crop loss or damage caused by weather hail drought frost damage pests including especially insects or disease some of these being termed named perils
index based insurance uses models of how climate extremes affect crop production to define certain climate triggers that if surpassed have high probabilities of causing substantial crop loss
when harvest losses occur associated with exceeding the climate trigger threshold the index insured farmer is entitled to a compensation payment
earthquake insurance is a form of property insurance that pays the policyholder in the event of an earthquake that causes damage to the property
most ordinary home insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage
earthquake insurance policies generally feature a high deductible
rates depend on location and hence the likelihood of an earthquake as well as the construction of the home
fidelity bond is a form of casualty insurance that covers policyholders for losses incurred as a result of fraudulent acts by specified individuals
it usually insures a business for losses caused by the dishonest acts of its employees flood insurance protects against property loss due to flooding
many u s
insurers do not provide flood insurance in some parts of the country
in response to this the federal government created the national flood insurance program which serves as the insurer of last resort
home insurance also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowners insurance often abbreviated in the real estate industry as hoi provides coverage for damage or destruction of the policyholder s home
in some geographical areas the policy may exclude certain types of risks such as flood or earthquake that require additional coverage
maintenance related issues are typically the homeowner s responsibility
the policy may include inventory or this can be bought as a separate policy especially for people who rent housing
in some countries insurers offer a package which may include liability and legal responsibility for injuries and property damage caused by members of the household including pets
landlord insurance covers residential or commercial property that is rented to tenants
it also covers the landlord s liability for the occupants at the property
most homeowners insurance meanwhile cover only owner occupied homes and not liability or damages related to tenants
marine insurance and marine cargo insurance cover the loss or damage of vessels at sea or on inland waterways and of cargo in transit regardless of the method of transit
when the owner of the cargo and the carrier are separate corporations marine cargo insurance typically compensates the owner of cargo for losses sustained from fire shipwreck etc but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier or the carrier s insurance
many marine insurance underwriters will include time element coverage in such policies which extends the indemnity to cover loss of profit and other business expenses attributable to the delay caused by a covered loss
renters insurance often called tenants insurance is an insurance policy that provides some of the benefits of homeowners insurance but does not include coverage for the dwelling or structure with the exception of small alterations that a tenant makes to the structure
supplemental natural disaster insurance covers specified expenses after a natural disaster renders the policyholder s home uninhabitable
periodic payments are made directly to the insured until the home is rebuilt or a specified time period has elapsed
surety bond insurance is a three party insurance guaranteeing the performance of the principal volcano insurance is a specialized insurance protecting against damage arising specifically from volcanic eruptions
windstorm insurance is an insurance covering the damage that can be caused by wind events such as hurricanes liability insurance is a broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured
many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage
for example a homeowner s insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others lives health or property
the protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification payment on behalf of the insured with respect to a settlement or court verdict
liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured
public liability insurance or general liability insurance covers a business or organization against claims should its operations injure a member of the public or damage their property in some way
directors and officers liability insurance d o protects an organization usually a corporation from costs associated with litigation resulting from errors made by directors and officers for which they are liable
environmental liability or environmental impairment insurance protects the insured from bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs as a result of the dispersal release or escape of pollutants
errors and omissions insurance e o is business liability insurance for professionals such as insurance agents real estate agents and brokers architects third party administrators tpas and other business professionals
prize indemnity insurance protects the insured from giving away a large prize at a specific event
examples would include offering prizes to contestants who can make a half court shot at a basketball game or a hole in one at a golf tournament
professional liability insurance also called professional indemnity insurance pi protects insured professionals such as architectural corporations and medical practitioners against potential negligence claims made by their patients clients
professional liability insurance may take on different names depending on the profession
for example professional liability insurance in reference to the medical profession may be called medical malpractice insurance often a commercial insured s liability insurance program consists of several layers
the first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements up to the limits of liability of the primary policy
generally primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insured to defend the insured against lawsuits which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured
in many instances a commercial insured may elect to self insure
above the primary insurance or self insured retention the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection
there are a variety of types of excess insurance including stand alone excess policies policies that contain their own terms conditions and exclusions follow form excess insurance policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided and umbrella insurance policies excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance
credit insurance repays some or all of a loan when the borrower is insolvent
mortgage insurance insures the lender against default by the borrower
mortgage insurance is a form of credit insurance although the name credit insurance more often is used to refer to policies that cover other kinds of debt

protected self insurance is an alternative risk financing mechanism in which an organization retains the mathematically calculated cost of risk within the organization and transfers the catastrophic risk with specific and aggregate limits to an insurer so the maximum total cost of the program is known
a properly designed and underwritten protected self insurance program reduces and stabilizes the cost of insurance and provides valuable risk management information
retrospectively rated insurance is a method of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts
the final premium is based on the insured s actual loss experience during the policy term sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium with the final premium determined by a formula
under this plan the current year s premium is based partially or wholly on the current year s losses although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year s expiration date
the rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract
formula retrospective premium converted loss basic premium tax multiplier
numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use
formal self insurance active risk retention is the deliberate decision to pay for otherwise insurable losses out of one s own money
this can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out of pocket
self insurance is usually used to pay for high frequency low severity losses
such losses if covered by conventional insurance mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company s general expenses cost of putting the policy on the books acquisition expenses premium taxes and contingencies
while this is true for all insurance for small frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords

financial reinsurance is a form of reinsurance that is primarily used for capital management rather than to transfer insurance risk
social insurance can be many things to many people in many countries

stop loss insurance provides protection against catastrophic or unpredictable losses
it is purchased by organizations who do not want to assume of the liability for losses arising from the plans
under a stop loss policy the insurance company becomes liable for losses that exceed certain limits called deductibles some communities prefer to create virtual insurance among themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer which assigns explicit numerical values to risk
a number of religious groups including the amish and some muslim groups depend on support provided by their communities when disasters strike
the risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind
in supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders this tacit form of insurance can work
in this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members
some further justification is also provided by invoking the moral hazard of explicit insurance contracts
in the united kingdom the crown which for practical purposes meant the civil service did not insure property such as government buildings
if a government building was damaged the cost of repair would be met from public funds because in the long run this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums
since many uk government buildings have been sold to property companies and rented back this arrangement is now less common
in the united states the most prevalent form of self insurance is governmental risk management pools
they are self funded cooperatives operating as carriers of coverage for the majority of governmental entities today such as county governments municipalities and school districts
rather than these entities independently self insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss such governmental entities form a risk pool
such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance
coverage such as general liability auto liability professional liability workers compensation and property is offered by the pool to its members similar to coverage offered by insurance companies
however self insured pools offer members lower rates due to not needing insurance brokers increased benefits such as loss prevention services and subject matter expertise
of approximately distinct governmental entities operating in the united states are members of self insured pools in various lines of coverage forming approximately pools
although a relatively small corner of the insurance market the annual contributions self insured premiums to such pools have been estimated up to billion dollars annually
insurance companies may provide any combination of insurance types but are often classified into three groups
life insurance companies that provide life insurance annuities and pensions products and bear similarities to asset management businesses
non life or property casualty insurance companies which provides other types of insurance
health insurance companies which sometimes provide life insurance or employee benefits as wellgeneral insurance companies can be further divided into these sub categories
standard lines
excess linesin most countries life and non life insurers are subject to different regulatory regimes and different tax and accounting rules
the main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life annuity and pension business is long term in nature coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many decades
by contrast non life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period such as one year
insurance companies are commonly classified as either mutual or proprietary companies
mutual companies are owned by the policyholders while shareholders who may or may not own policies own proprietary insurance companies
demutualization of mutual insurers to form stock companies as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company became common in some countries such as the united states in the late th century
however not all states permit mutual holding companies
reinsurance companies are insurance companies that provide policies to other insurance companies allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from substantial losses
the reinsurance market is dominated by a few large companies with huge reserves
a reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well
captive insurance companies can be defined as limited purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups
this definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company s customers
in short it is an in house self insurance vehicle
captives may take the form of a pure entity which is a subsidiary of the self insured parent company of a mutual captive which insures the collective risks of members of an industr and of an association captive which self insures individual risks of the members of a professional commercial or industrial association
captives represent commercial economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate
additionally they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices
the types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage public and product liability professional indemnity employee benefits employers liability motor and medical aid expenses
the captive s exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance
captives are becoming an increasingly important component of the risk management and risk financing strategy of their parent
this can be understood against the following background
heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage
difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk
differential coverage standards in various parts of the world
rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience
insufficient credit for deductibles or loss control effortsother possible forms for an insurance company include reciprocals in which policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks and lloyd s organizations
admitted insurance companies are those in the united states that have been admitted or licensed by the state licensing agency
the insurance they provide is called admitted insurance
non admitted companies have not been approved by the state licensing agency but are allowed to provide insurance under special circumstances when they meet an insurance need that admitted companies cannot or will not meet
there are also companies known as insurance consultants
like a mortgage broker these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy among many companies
similar to an insurance consultant an insurance broker also shops around for the best insurance policy among many companies
however with insurance brokers the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client
neither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions
third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies
these companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have
the financial stability and strength of an insurance company is a consideration when buying an insurance contract
an insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future
for that reason a more financially stable insurance carrier reduces the risk of the insurance company becoming insolvent leaving their policyholders with no coverage or coverage only from a government backed insurance pool or other arrangements with less attractive payouts for losses
a number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies
insurance companies are rated by various agencies such as am best
the ratings include the company s financial strength which measures its ability to pay claims
it also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company such as bonds notes and securitization products
advanced economies account for the bulk of the global insurance industry
according to swiss re the global insurance market wrote trillion in direct premiums in
direct premiums means premiums written directly by insurers before accounting for ceding of risk to reinsurers as usual the united states was the country with the largest insurance market with trillion of direct premiums written with the people s republic of china coming in second at only billion japan coming in third at billion and the united kingdom coming in fourth at billion
however the european union s single market is the actual second largest market with percent market share
in the united states insurance is regulated by the states under the mccarran ferguson act with periodic proposals for federal intervention and a nonprofit coalition of state insurance agencies called the national association of insurance commissioners works to harmonize the country s different laws and regulations
the national conference of insurance legislators ncoil also works to harmonize the different state laws
in the european union the third non life directive and the third life directive both passed in and effective created a single insurance market in europe and allowed insurance companies to offer insurance anywhere in the eu subject to permission from authority in the head office and allowed insurance consumers to purchase insurance from any insurer in the eu
as far as insurance in the united kingdom the financial services authority took over insurance regulation from the general insurance standards council in laws passed include the insurance companies act and another in and reforms to warranty and other aspects under discussion as of
the insurance industry in china was nationalized in and thereafter offered by only a single state owned company the people s insurance company of china which was eventually suspended as demand declined in a communist environment
in market reforms led to an increase in the market and by a comprehensive insurance law of the people s republic of china was passed followed in by the formation of china insurance regulatory commission circ which has broad regulatory authority over the insurance market of china
in india irda is insurance regulatory authority
as per the section of irda act insurance regulatory and development authority irda which was constituted by an act of parliament
national insurance academy pune is apex insurance capacity builder institute promoted with support from ministry of finance and by lic life general insurance companies
in within the framework of the joint project of the bank of russia and yandex a special check mark a green circle with a tick and unified state register of insurance entities text box appeared in the search for yandex system informing the consumer that the company s financial services are offered on the marked website which has the status of an insurance company a broker or a mutual insurance association
insurance is just a risk transfer mechanism wherein the financial burden which may arise due to some fortuitous event is transferred to a bigger entity called an insurance company by way of paying premiums
this only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event
insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured
the insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a risk assessment when writing the policy
as a result the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim
however premiums might reduce if the policyholder commits to a risk management program as recommended by the insurer
it s therefore important that insurers view risk management as a joint initiative between policyholder and insurer since a robust risk management plan minimizes the possibility of a large claim for the insurer while stabilizing or reducing premiums for the policyholder
if a person is financially stable and plans for life s unexpected events they may be able to go without insurance
however they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions
some states will accept a surety bond a government bond or even making a cash deposit with the state
an insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk averse as they might otherwise be since by definition the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer a concept known as moral hazard
this insulates many from the
true costs of living with risk negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentially maladaptive
insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy
as a result people may buy policies on unfavorable terms
in response to these issues many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may be advertised and sold
for example most insurance policies in the english language today have been carefully drafted in plain english the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying
typically courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy
many institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker
while on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer not the insurance company and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations in the vast majority of cases a broker s compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium creating a conflict of interest in that the broker s financial interest is tilted toward encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price
a broker generally holds contracts with many insurers thereby allowing the broker to shop the market for the best rates and coverage possible
insurance may also be purchased through an agent
a tied agent working exclusively with one insurer represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies
just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker an agent has a different type of conflict
because agents work directly for the insurance company if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company
agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker
an independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee for service retainer similar to an attorney and thus offers completely independent advice free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents
however such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients
in the united states economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low probability catastrophic losses but not for high probability small losses
because of this consumers are advised to select high deductibles and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life
however consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high probability small losses over low probability perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low probability risk
this is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low probability losses and may result in increased inefficiencies from moral hazard
redlining is the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination
racial profiling or redlining has a long history in the property insurance industry in the united states
from a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials court documents and research by government agencies industry and community groups and academics it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry
in july the us federal trade commission ftc released a report presenting the results of a study concerning credit based insurance scores in automobile insurance
the study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk
it also showed that african americans and hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores and substantially underrepresented in the highest while caucasians and asians are more evenly spread across the scores
the credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups leading the ftc to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining
the ftc indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers
the report was disputed by representatives of the consumer federation of america the national fair housing alliance the national consumer law center and the center for economic justice for relying on data provided by the insurance industry
all states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination often called redlining in setting rates and making insurance available
in determining premiums and premium rate structures insurers consider quantifiable factors including location credit scores gender occupation marital status and education level
however the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully discriminatory and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used
an insurance underwriter s job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur
any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate
this basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent
thus discrimination against i e negative differential treatment of potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium setting process is a necessary by product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting
for instance insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance
older people are thus treated differently from younger people i e a distinction is made discrimination occurs
the rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes older people are likely to die sooner than young people so the risk of loss the insured s death is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk
however treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination
new assurance products can now be protected from copying with a business method patent in the united states
a recent example of a new insurance product that is patented is usage based auto insurance
early versions were independently invented and patented by a major us auto insurance company progressive auto insurance u s
patent and a spanish independent inventor salvador minguijon perez
many independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market
independent inventors account for of the new u s
patent applications in this area
many insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them
the hartford insurance company for example recently had to pay million to an independent inventor bancorp services in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by bancorp
there are currently about new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the united states
the rate at which patents have been issued has steadily risen from in to in
the first insurance patent to be granted was including another example of an application posted was
it was posted on march
this patent application describes a method for increasing the ease of changing insurance companies
insurance on demand also iod is an insurance service that provides clients with insurance protection when they need i e
only episodic rather than on basis as typically provided by traditional insurers e g
clients can purchase an insurance for one single flight rather than a longer lasting travel insurance plan
certain insurance products and practices have been described as rent seeking by critics
that is some insurance products or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits such as reducing taxes as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events
under united states tax law for example most owners of variable annuities and variable life insurance can invest their premium payments in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made
sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products
another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax
muslim scholars have varying opinions about life insurance
life insurance policies that earn interest or guaranteed bonus nav are generally considered to be a form of riba usury and some consider even policies that do not earn interest to be a form of gharar speculation
some argue that gharar is not present due to the actuarial science behind the underwriting
jewish rabbinical scholars also have expressed reservations regarding insurance as an avoidance of god s will but most find it acceptable in moderation
some christians believe insurance represents a lack of faith and there is a long history of resistance to commercial insurance in anabaptist communities mennonites amish hutterites brethren in christ but many participate in community based self insurance programs that spread risk within their communities
