a market town is a settlement most common in europe that obtained by custom or royal charter in the middle ages a market right which allowed it to host a regular market this distinguished it from a village or city
in britain small rural towns with a hinterland of villages are still commonly called market towns as sometimes reflected in their names e g
downham market market rasen or market drayton
modern markets are often in special halls but this is a recent development and the rise of permanent retail establishments has reduced the need for periodic markets
historically the markets were open air held in what is usually called regardless of its actual shape the market square or market place etc and centred on a market cross mercat cross in scotland
they were and are typically open one or two days a week
the primary purpose of a market town is the provision of goods and services to the surrounding locality
although market towns were known in antiquity their number increased rapidly from the th century
market towns across europe flourished with an improved economy a more urbanised society and the widespread introduction of a cash based economy
domesday book of lists markets in england
some new markets were established between and
the burgeoning of market towns occurred across europe around the same time
initially market towns most often grew up close to fortified places such as castles or monasteries not only to enjoy their protection but also because large manorial households and monasteries generated demand for goods and services
historians term these early market towns prescriptive market towns in that they may not have enjoyed any official sanction such as a charter but were accorded market town status through custom and practice if they had been in existence prior to
from an early stage kings and administrators understood that a successful market town attracted people generated revenue and would pay for the town s defences
in around the th century european kings began granting charters to villages allowing them to hold markets on specific days
framlingham in suffolk is a notable example of a market situated near a fortified building
additionally markets were located where transport was easiest such as at a crossroads or close to a river ford for example cowbridge in the vale of glamorgan
when local railway lines were first built market towns were given priority to ease the transport of goods
for instance in calderdale west yorkshire several market towns close together were designated to take advantage of the new trains
the designation of halifax sowerby bridge hebden bridge and todmorden is an example of this
a number of studies have pointed to the prevalence of the periodic market in medieval towns and rural areas due to the localised nature of the economy
the marketplace was the commonly accepted location for trade social interaction transfer of information and gossip
a broad range of retailers congregated in market towns peddlers retailers hucksters stallholders merchants and other types of trader
some were professional traders who occupied a local shopfront such as a bakery or alehouse while others were casual traders who set up a stall or carried their wares around in baskets on market days
market trade supplied for the needs of local consumers whether they were visitors or local residents
braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of european market towns between the th and th century
their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities
over time permanent shops began opening daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets while peddlers or itinerant sellers continued to fill in any gaps in distribution
the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and bartering systems were commonplace
shops had higher overhead costs but were able to offer regular trading hours and a relationship with customers and may have offered added value services such as credit terms to reliable customers
the economy was characterised by local trading in which goods were traded across relatively short distances
braudel reports that in grain moved just miles km cattle miles km wool and woollen cloth miles km
however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and south east asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world
the importance of local markets began to decline in the mid th century
permanent shops which provided more stable trading hours began to supplant the periodic market
in addition the rise of a merchant class led to the import and exports of a broad range of goods contributing to a reduced reliance on local produce
at the centre of this new global mercantile trade was antwerp which by the mid th century was the largest market town in europe
a good number of local histories of individual market towns can be found
however more general histories of the rise of market towns across europe are much more difficult to locate
clark points out that while a good deal is known about the economic value of markets in local economies the cultural role of market towns has received scant scholarly attention
in denmark the concept of the market town danish k bstad has existed since the iron age
it is not known which was the first danish market town but hedeby part of modern day schleswig holstein and ribe were among the first
per there were market towns in denmark see the full list here
the last town to gain market rights danish k bstadsprivilegier was skjern in

the medieval right to hold markets german marktrecht is reflected in the prefix markt of the names of many towns in austria and germany for example markt berolzheim or marktbergel
other terms used for market towns were flecken in northern germany or freiheit and wigbold in westphalia
market rights were designated as long ago as during the carolingian empire
around charlemagne granted the title of a market town to esslingen am neckar
conrad created a number of market towns in saxony throughout the th century and did much to develop peaceful markets by granting a special peace to merchants and a special and permanent peace to market places
with the rise of the territories the ability to designate market towns was passed to the princes and dukes as the basis of german town law
the local ordinance status of a market town marktgemeinde or markt is perpetuated through the law of austria the german state of bavaria and the italian province of south tyrol
nevertheless the title has no further legal significance as it does not grant any privileges
in hungarian the word for market town mez v ros means literally pasture town and implies that it was unfortified town they were architecturally distinguishable from other towns by the lack of town walls
most market towns were chartered in the th and th centuries and typically developed around th century villages that had preceded them
a boom in the raising of livestock may have been a trigger for the upsurge in the number of market towns during that period
archaeological studies suggest that the ground plans of such market towns had multiple streets and could also emerge from a group of villages or an earlier urban settlement in decline or be created as a new urban centre
while iceland was under danish rule danish merchants held a monopoly on trade with iceland until
with the abolishment of the trading monopoly six market town icelandic kaupsta ur were founded around the country
all of them except for reykjav k would lose their market rights in
new market towns would be designated by acts from al ingi in the th and th century
in the latter half of the th century the special rights granted to market towns mostly involved a greater autonomy in fiscal matters and control over town planning schooling and social care
unlike rural municipalities the market towns were not considered part of the counties
the last town to be granted market rights was lafsv k in and from that point there were market towns until a municipal reform in essentially abolished the concept
many of the existing market towns would continue to be named kaupsta ur even after the term lost any administrative meaning
in norway the medieval market town norwegian kj pstad and kaupstad from the old norse kaupsta r was a town which had been granted commerce privileges by the king or other authorities
the citizens in the town had a monopoly over the purchase and sale of wares and operation of other businesses both in the town and in the surrounding district
norway developed market towns at a much later period than other parts of europe
the reasons for this late development are complex but include the sparse population lack of urbanisation no real manufacturing industries and no cash economy
the first market town was created in th century norway to encourage businesses to concentrate around specific towns
king olaf established a market town at bergen in the th century and it soon became the residence of many wealthy families
import and export was to be conducted only through market towns to allow oversight of commerce and to simplify the imposition of excise taxes and customs duties
this practice served to encourage growth in areas which had strategic significance providing a local economic base for the construction of fortifications and sufficient population to defend the area
it also served to restrict hanseatic league merchants from trading in areas other than those designated
norway included a subordinate category to the market town the small seaport norwegian lossested or ladested which was a port or harbor with a monopoly to import and export goods and materials in both the port and a surrounding outlying district
typically these were locations for exporting timber and importing grain and goods
local farm goods and timber sales were all required to pass through merchants at either a small seaport or a market town prior to export
this encouraged local merchants to ensure trading went through them which was so effective in limiting unsupervised sales smuggling that customs revenues increased from less than of the total tax revenues in to more than of the total taxes by
norwegian market towns died out and were replaced by free markets during the th century
after both the small seaport and the market town were relegated to simple town status
miasteczko lit small town was a historical type of urban settlement similar to a market town in the former polish lithuanian commonwealth
after the partitions of polish lithuanian commonwealth at the end of the th century these settlements became widespread in the austrian german and russian empires
the vast majority of miasteczkos had significant or even predominant jewish populations these are known in english under the yiddish term shtetl
miasteczkos had a special administrative status other than that of town or city
from the time of the norman conquest the right to award a charter was generally seen to be a royal prerogative
however the granting of charters was not systematically recorded until
once a charter was granted it gave local lords the right to take tolls and also afforded the town some protection from rival markets
when a chartered market was granted for specific market days a nearby rival market could not open on the same days
across the boroughs of england a network of chartered markets sprang up between the th and th centuries giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise
until about markets were often held on sundays the day when the community congregated in town to attend church
some of the more ancient markets appear to have been held in churchyards
at the time of the norman conquest the majority of the population made their living through agriculture and livestock farming
most lived on their farms situated outside towns and the town itself supported a relatively small population of permanent residents
farmers and their families brought their surplus produce to informal markets held on the grounds of their church after worship
by the th century however a movement against sunday markets gathered momentum and the market gradually moved to a site in town s centre and was held on a weekday
by the th century towns were legally prohibited from holding markets in church yards
archaeological evidence suggests that colchester is england s oldest recorded market town dating to at least the time of the roman occupation of britain s southern regions

market towns grew up at centres of local activity and were an important feature of rural life and also became important centres of social life as some place names suggest market drayton market harborough market rasen market deeping market weighton chipping norton chipping ongar and chipping sodbury chipping was derived from a saxon verb meaning to buy
a major study carried out by the university of london found evidence for least markets in english towns by
the english system of charters established that a new market town could not be created within a certain travelling distance of an existing one
this limit was usually a day s worth of travelling approximately kilometres mi to and from the market
if the travel time exceeded this standard a new market town could be established in that locale
as a result of the limit official market towns often petitioned the monarch to close down illegal markets in other towns
these distances are still law in england today
other markets can be held provided they are licensed by the holder of the royal charter which tends currently to be the local town council
failing that the crown can grant a licence
as the number of charters granted increased competition between market towns also increased
in response to competitive pressures towns invested in a reputation for quality produce efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors such as covered accommodation
by the thirteenth century counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built market halls for the sale of cloth
specific market towns cultivated a reputation for high quality local goods
for example london s blackwell hall became a centre for cloth bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as bristol red stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth the town of worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn banbury and essex were strongly associated with cheeses
a study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval england suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning
purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers perceptions of the range quality and price of goods
this informed decisions about where to make their purchases
as traditional market towns developed they featured a wide main street or central market square
these provided room for people to set up stalls and booths on market days
often the town erected a market cross in the centre of the town to obtain god s blessing on the trade
notable examples of market crosses in england are the chichester cross malmesbury market cross and devizes wiltshire
market towns often featured a market hall as well with administrative or civic quarters on the upper floor above a covered trading area
market towns with smaller status include minchinhampton nailsworth and painswick near stroud gloucestershire
a market town may or may not have rights concerning self government that are usually the legal basis for defining a town
for instance newport shropshire is in the borough of telford and wrekin but is separate from telford
in england towns with such rights are usually distinguished with the additional status of borough
it is generally accepted that in these cases when a town was granted a market it gained the additional autonomy conferred to separate towns
many of the early market towns have continued operations into recent times
for instance northampton market received its first charter in and markets are still held in the square to this day
the national market traders federation situated in barnsley south yorkshire has around members and close links with market traders federations throughout europe
according to the uk national archives there is no single register of modern entitlements to hold markets and fairs although historical charters up to are listed in the gazetteer of markets and fairs in england and wales

in scotland borough markets were held weekly from an early stage
a king s market was held at roxburgh on a specific day from about the year a thursday market was held at glasgow a saturday market at arbroath and a sunday market at brechin
in scotland market towns were often distinguished by their mercat cross a place where the right to hold a regular market or fair was granted by a ruling authority either royal noble or ecclesiastical
as in the rest of the uk the area in which the cross was situated was almost always central either in a square or in a broad main street
towns which still have regular markets include inverurie st andrews selkirk wigtown kelso and cupar
not all still possess their mercat cross market cross
dutch painters of antwerp took great interest in market places and market towns as subject matter from the th century
pieter aertsen was known as the great painter of the market painters interest in markets was due at least in part to the changing nature of the market system at that time
with the rise of the merchant guilds the public began to distinguish between two types of merchant the meerseniers which referred to local merchants including bakers grocers sellers of dairy products and stall holders and the koopman which described a new emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale
