the aegean army or fourth army is one of the four main formations of the turkish army
it covers the entire west coast of the anatolia peninsula and has its headquarters in i zmir
it was organised in the s in response to political tensions with greece the ongoing aegean dispute
its stated mission is to protect turkey s territory on its western coast
this is directed against the perceived threat posed by greece s armament of the aegean sea islands
greece on the other hand perceives the presence of the aegean army as a threat to its islands citing strong offensive capabilities ascribed to the aegean army as well as the exposed and isolated geographical position of the islands the most populous of which are several hundred kilometres distant from the greek mainland yet sit only km from turkey s as reasons of concern
greek sources particularly point to the strong amphibian forces maintained by the aegean army as an indicator of its offensive nature
turkey has countered such concerns by stating that besides being of a fundamentally defensive nature it is basically a training army
it was established on july independently from nato when the situation became more tense and the possibility of war increased with the cyprus operation which was made in a period when the tension increased after the coup in greece on april against the threat posed by the armament of greece in the aegean islands
