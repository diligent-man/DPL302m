Early in Greek history th th centuries BC free born citizens would gather in the agora for military duty or to hear statements of the ruling king or council Later the agora also served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods amid colonnades This attracted artisans who built workshops nearby
From these twin functions of the agora as a political and a commercial spot came the two Greek verbs agor z I shop and agore I speak in public
