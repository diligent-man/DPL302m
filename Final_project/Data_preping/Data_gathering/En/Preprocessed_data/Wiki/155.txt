the agora r ancient greek agor was a central public space in ancient greek city states
it is the best representation of a city state s response to accommodate the social and political order of the polis
the literal meaning of the word agora is gathering place or assembly
the agora was the center of the athletic artistic business social spiritual and political life in the city
the ancient agora of athens is the best known example
early in greek history th th centuries bc free born citizens would gather in the agora for military duty or to hear statements of the ruling king or council
later the agora also served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods amid colonnades
this attracted artisans who built workshops nearby
from these twin functions of the agora as a political and a commercial spot came the two greek verbs agor z i shop and agore i speak in public
the ancient agora of athens was situated beneath the northern slope of the acropolis
the ancient agora was the primary meeting ground for athenians where members of democracy congregated affairs of the state where business was conducted a place to hang out and watch performers and listen to famous philosophers
the importance of the athenian agora revolved around religion
the agora was a very sacred place in which holiness is laid out in the architecture of the ground in which it lay upon
the layout of the agora was centered around the panathenaic way a road that ran through the middle of athens and to the main gate of the city dipylon
this road was considered tremendously sacred serving as a travel route for the panathenaic festival which was held in the honor of the goddess athena every four years
the agora was also famously known for housing the temple of hephaestus the greek god of metalworking and craftsmen
this temple is still in great condition to this day
other temples priorly standing in the agora include honor for zeus athena apollo and ares
the agora was usually located in the middle of a city or near the harbor
agoras were built of colonnades or rows of long columns and contained stoae also known as a long open walk way below the colonnades
they were beautifully decorated with fountains trees and statues
when the athenian agora was rebuilt after the greco persian wars colonnades and stoae were not incorporated
the term agoraphobia denotes a phobic condition in which the sufferer becomes anxious in environments that are unfamiliar for instance places where they perceive that they have little control
such anxiety may be triggered by wide open spaces by crowds or by some public situations and the psychological term derives from the agora as a large and open gathering place
