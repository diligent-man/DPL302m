The ʼPhags-pa script is an alphabet designed by the Tibetan monk and State Preceptor later Imperial Preceptor Drogön Chögyal Phagpa for Kublai Khan the founder of the Yuan dynasty as a unified script for the written languages within the Yuan
The actual use of this script was limited to about a hundred years during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and it fell out of use with the advent of the Ming dynasty
It was used to write and transcribe varieties of Chinese the Tibetic languages Mongolian the Uyghur language Sanskrit Persian and other neighboring languages during the Yuan era
For historical linguists the documentation of its use provides clues about the changes in these languages
Its descendant systems include Horizontal square script used to write Tibetan and Sanskrit
There is a theory that the Korean Hangul alphabet had a limited influence from ʼPhags-pa see Origin of Hangul
During the Pax Mongolica the script has even made numerous appearances in western medieval art

In English it is also written as Phaspa Paspa Baschpah and Pa-sse-pa
During the Mongol Empire the Mongol rulers wanted a universal script to write down the languages of the people they subjugated
The Uyghur-based Mongolian alphabet is not a perfect fit for the Middle Mongol language and it would be impractical to extend it to a language with a very different phonology like Chinese
Kublai Khan asked the Tibetan monk ʼPhags-pa to design a new alphabet for use by the whole empire
ʼPhags-pa extended his native Tibetan alphabet to encompass Mongol and Chinese evidently Central Plains Mandarin
The resulting letters have been known by several descriptive names such as square script based on their shape but today are primarily known as the ʼPhags-pa alphabet
Descending from Tibetan script it is part of the Brahmic family of scripts which includes Devanagari and scripts used throughout Southeast Asia and Central Asia
It is unique among Brahmic scripts in that it is written top bottom like how classical Chinese used to be written and like the Manchu alphabet or later Mongolian alphabet
Despite its origin the script was written vertically top to bottom like the previous Mongolian scripts
It did not receive wide acceptance and was not a popular script even among the elite Mongols themselves although it was used as an official script of the Yuan dynasty until the early s when the Red Turban Rebellion started
After this it was mainly used as a phonetic gloss for Mongols learning Chinese characters
It was also used as one of the scripts on Tibetan currency in the twentieth century as script for Tibetan seal inscriptions from the Middle Ages up to the th century and for inscriptions on the entrance doors of Tibetan monasteries
Although it is an alphabet phagspa is written like a syllabary or abugida with letters forming a single syllable glued or 'ligated' togetherUnlike the ancestral Tibetan script all ʼPhags-pa letters are written in temporal order that is CV is written in the order CV for all vowels and in-line that is the vowels are not diacritics
However vowel letters retain distinct initial forms and short a is not written except initially making ʼPhags-pa transitional between an abugida a syllabary and a full alphabet
The letters of a ʼPhags-pa syllable are linked together so that they form syllabic blocks
ʼPhags-pa was written in a variety of graphic forms
The standard form top at right was blocky but a Tibetan form bottom was even more so consisting almost entirely of straight orthogonal lines and right angles
A seal script form Chinese pinyin měngg zhunz Mongolian Seal Script used for imperial seals and the like was more elaborate with squared sinusoidal lines and spirals
This 'Phags-pa script is different from the 'Phags-pa script or in Chinese that shares the same name but its earliest usage can be traced back to the late th century the early reign of Wanli Emperor
According to Professor Junast of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences the later 'Phags-pa script is actually a seal script of Tibetan
Korean records state that hangul was based on an Old Seal Script which may be ʼPhags-pa and a reference to its Chinese name měngg zhunz see origin of hangul
However it is the simpler standard form of ʼPhags-pa that is the closer graphic match to hangul
The following are the basic ʼPhags-pa letters
Letters - and - are base consonants
The order of Letters - is the same as the traditional order of the thirty basic letters of the Tibetan script to which they correspond
Letters - represent sounds that do not occur in Tibetan and are either derived from an existing Tibetan base consonant eg
Letters and are both derived from the simple Tibetan letter KHA but are graphically distinct from each other or from a combination of an existing Tibetan base consonant and the semi-vowel subjoined letter WA eg
Letter is derived from the complex Tibetan letter KHWA
As is the case with Tibetan these letters have an inherent a vowel sound attached to them in non-final positions when no other vowel sign is present eg
the letter KA with no attached vowel represents the syllable ka but with an appended vowel i represents the syllable ki
Letters - follow the traditional order of the corresponding Tibetan vowels
Letter represents a vowel quality that does not occur in Tibetan and may be derived from the Tibetan double-E vowel sign
Unlike Tibetan in which vowels signs may not occur in isolation but must always be attached to a base consonant to form a valid syllable in the ʼPhags-pa script initial vowels other than a may occur without a base consonant when they are not the first element in a diphthong eg
Thus in Chinese ʼPhags-pa texts the syllables u w on wn and o occur and in Mongolian ʼPhags-pa texts the words ong qo chas boats u su nu gen water e du -ee now and i hee -een protection occur
These are all examples of where 'o 'u 'e 'i etc
would be expected if the Tibetan model had been followed exactly
An exception to this rule is the Mongolian word 'er di nis jewels where a single vowel sign is attached to a null base consonant
Note that the letter EE is never found in an initial position in any language written in the ʼPhags-pa script for example in Tao Zongyi's description of the Old Uighur script he glosses all instances of Uighur e with the ʼPhags-pa letter EE except for when it is found in the initial position when he glosses it with the ʼPhags-pa letter E instead
However initial semi-vowels diphthongs and digraphs must be attached to the null base consonant 'A Letter
So in Chinese ʼPhags-pa texts the syllables 'wen yun 'ue wēi and 'eeu y occur and in Mongolian ʼPhags-pa texts the words 'eeu lu not and 'eeog beee gave occur
As there is no sign for the vowel a which is implicit in an initial base consonant with no attached vowel sign then words that start with an a vowel must also use the null base consonant letter 'A eg
In Chinese and rarely Mongolian another null base consonant -A Letter may be found before initial vowels see Letter below
Following are the initials of the ʼPhags-pa script as presented in Menggu Ziyun
They are ordered according to the Chinese philological tradition of the initials
The Shilin Guangji used Phagspa to annotate Chinese text serving as a precursor to modern pinyin
The following are the Phagspa transcriptions of a section of the Hundred Family Surnames in the Shilin Guangji
For example the name Jin meaning gold is written as ꡂꡞꡏor Gim similar to how it is transliterated in Korean Kim
ʼPhags-pa script was added to the Unicode Standard in July with the release of version
The Unicode block for ʼPhags-pa is U+AU+A
U+A ꡖ PHAGS-PA LETTER SMALL A is transliterated using U+AF ꞏ LATIN LETTER SINOLOGICAL DOT from the Latin Extended-D Unicode block
