The Norwegian School of Economics Norwegian Norges Handelsh yskole or NHH is a business school situated in Bergen Norway It was founded in as Norway's first business school and has since its establishment been a leading teaching and research institution in the fields of economics and business administration
Admission to NHH is the most selective in the field of business administration in Norway and among the most selective of all study programs offered in Norway The sole NHH undergraduate program consistently ranks among the most popular first choice for students applying to undergraduate study in Norway and was the most popular first choice of all undergraduate programs offered in Norway with more than first choice applications and more than in total for places
The school participates in exchange programs with more than foreign business schools and universities in over countries and around percent of the school's students spend at least one semester on exchange The school is member of CEMS The Global Alliance for Management Education and the Partnership in International Management PIM network and is accredited by EQUIS AMBA and AACSB
Traditionally economics as an academic discipline was only taught at the universities in Norway mainly the University of Oslo where it was first conceived as a sub discipline of law in the th century whereas business administration was not regarded as an academic discipline with no formal education program being available NHH was founded to offer the first formal training in business studies in the form of a more vocational two year degree called handelskandidat candidate of commerce In the handelskandidat degree was renamed sivil konom and it later evolved into a four year degree The school today offers degrees at the master's and doctoral levels
The business communities in Oslo and Bergen began discussing the establishment of a Norwegian business school at the end of the th century A number of schools had been opened across Europe and during the early th century several business schools were established in Scandinavia based on the German handelshochschule business school model Amongst them the Stockholm School of Economics was established in In Norway's parliament the Storting passed a resolution to establish a Norwegian business school
After much lobbying and hard work especially by Kristoffer Lehmkuhl NHH was finally opened by King Haakon VII on Monday the September This was years before the University of Bergen was established The strong involvement of the business community in Bergen had ensured that not only was the school established but that it was established in Bergen and was closely linked to business community from the very start
When NHH first opened the academic staff consisted of fewer than ten people and sixty students were enrolled each year The first degree course offered was the Handelsdiplom business diploma and graduates received the title Handelskandidat business graduate This was initially a two year course and starting in a one year additional course was offered to candidates who wanted to become teachers In the Handelsdiplom course was extended to three years
After the Second World War American influence became more important and also started to influence NHH to a greater extent Graduates and staff began to go to the US to continue their studies and work for a period a trend that greatly increased in the s and s By the early s the need for a doctoral programme at NHH had grown In NHH received permission from the Norwegian government to award doctorates and in the first doctoral candidate graduated from NHH
By the late s NHH had outgrown its original premises and work began on developing a new campus for the school at Sandviken just outside Bergen city centre In the school moved to its new campus an event which in many ways marked the transition to a new period characterised by a rapid increase in the number of students as well as teachers The new campus provided a large increase in capacity and the annual intake of students increased from to over
An important feature of this period was the growth and development of the faculty The new facilities made it possible to employ many new talented people and the importance of research as well as teaching was strengthened Many successful graduates went to the US to study for doctorates and came back to NHH with international experience and a more research based focus Many faculty members took advantage of sabbaticals to study and continue their research overseas many textbooks were published and the volume of publications in international journals increased significantly A driving force behind this expansion and internationalisation of research was Professor Karl Borch
During this time Professor Jan Mossin's seminal paper Equilibrium in a Capital Asset Market was published in Econometrica contributing significantly to the development of the capital asset pricing model CAPM About the same time as Mossin returned to NHH from Carnegie Mellon with his doctorate future Nobel laureate Finn E Kydland went to the same university for his doctoral studies Most of the US educated doctoral graduates came back to NHH to teach and continue their research but some stayed in the US and a few like Kydland returned to NHH only to later go back to the US to continue their work
As the faculty grew and developed so did the academic offerings with several advanced level courses established In the name of the Handelsdiplom degree was changed to sivil konom with graduate receiving the same title A master level programme h yere avdelingstudium HAS was introduced in as a preparation for sivil konom students wishing to continue on to doctoral studies and in Professor Dag Coward established a master level programme for students wishing to specialise in auditing accounting and the financial management of firms the h yere revisorstudium HRS In the sivil konom degree course was extended to a four year programme
In the early s it was realised that the doctoral programme required updating and a new structured PhD programme was introduced involving taught courses in addition to the research and writing of a thesis This new PhD programme continued the focus on research at NHH rather than just teaching The first candidate to graduate from the new PhD programme did so in and the annual number of graduates rose from in to in
The focus on expansion and internationalisation of research was recognised in as NHH was ranked th globally and rd in Europe in the American Economic Review amongst economics schools or departments in non English speaking countries by publications in leading journals
During this period close relations with international research environments were also established The international activities at the school have increased considerably and the international focus has become stronger over the years In NHH established their first international exchange agreement with the Stockholm School of Economics and in NHH became the first institution in Norway to offer a master's degree programme taught entirely in English the Master of International Business MIB Following this greater emphasis has been placed on exchange arrangements for students and the school joined the prestigious Community of European Management Schools CEMS and the Erasmus programme in and the global Partnership in International Management PIM network in
