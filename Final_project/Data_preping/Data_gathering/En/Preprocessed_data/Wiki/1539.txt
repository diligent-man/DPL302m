WSYX channel is a television station in Columbus Ohio United States affiliated with ABC MyNetworkTV and Fox
It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group which provides certain services to TBD station WTTE channel owned by Cunningham Broadcasting under a local marketing agreement LMA and Chillicothe-licensed CW affiliate WWHO channel owned by Manhan Media under a separate shared services agreement SSA
However Sinclair effectively owns WTTE as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith
The stations share studios on Dublin Road in Grandview Heights with a Columbus mailing address while WSYX's transmitter is located in the Franklinton section of Columbus
The station began operations on September as WTVN Columbus' second television station
At its launch the station was owned by Picture Waves Inc a company controlled by Toledo-based attorney and investor Edward Lamb Lamb also owned WICU-TV in Erie Pennsylvania which went on the air six months earlier
WTVN was an affiliate of the DuMont Television Network at its inception and was one of only three primary affiliates of that network it also carried a secondary affiliation with ABC
Channel became a full-time ABC affiliate in after DuMont closed down its operations
During the late s the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network
The station was first housed within the Lincoln-LeVeque Tower in Downtown Columbus until when it moved into a new facility on Harmon Avenue in Franklinton
Channel 's present home on Dublin Road near the ColumbusGrandview Heights border has been in operation since
In March Picture Waves sold WTVN to Radio Cincinnati Inc the broadcasting interests of the Taft family of Cincinnati
The following year Radio Cincinnati purchased WHKC radio AM in Columbus from the publishers of the Cleveland Plain Dealer renaming that station WTVN AM and subsequently adding a -TV suffix to channel 's call sign
Radio Cincinnati would later become the Taft Broadcasting Company and Taft would launch a second radio station in Columbus WTVN-FM FM now WLVQ in April
In the early s Taft's common ownership of WTVN-TV and WKRC-TV channel in Cincinnati was given protection under a grandfather clause by the Federal Communications Commission FCC from its newly enacted one-to-a-market rule
The ordinance prohibited television stations with overlapping signals from sharing common ownership while protecting existing instances
WKRC-TV's signal provided at least secondary coverage to much of the southern portion of the Columbus market
One of WTVN-TV's competitors CrosleyAvco-owned WLWC channel now WCMH-TV was given grandfathered protection through a similar situation with sister stations in Dayton and Cincinnati
In Cincinnati financier and future Cincinnati Reds owner Carl Lindner acquired a majority of Taft's shares in a hostile takeover renaming the company Great American Broadcasting a subsidiary of his Great American Insurance Company
The manner in which the takeover was structured led the FCC to deem it to be an ownership change
As a result WTVN-TV lost its grandfathered protection and could not be retained by Great American
A group of former Taft Broadcasting shareholders led by Texas millionaire Robert Bass who also participated in the hostile takeover purchased WTVN-TV for their new company called Anchor Media
The sale closed on August and the new owners renamed the station WSYX that same day
The change was required as FCC rules at the time prohibited TV and radio stations with separate ownership in the same market from retaining the same base callsign
WTVN and WLVQ-FM remained owned by Great American for several years
Anchor Media who also purchased ABC affiliates WLOS in Asheville North Carolina in April and KOVR in Stockton California in January now a CBS OO was purchased by River City Broadcasting in
River City was merged into the Sinclair Broadcast Group in
Sinclair owned Columbus' Fox affiliate WTTE but could not keep both stations since the FCC did not allow common ownership of two stations in a single market
Sinclair kept the longer-established WSYX and sold WTTE to Glencairn Ltd owned by former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards
However the Smith family Sinclair's founding owners controlled nearly all of Glencairn's stock
In effect Sinclair now had a duopoly in Columbus in violation of FCC rules
Sinclair and Glenciarn further circumvented the rules by merging WTTE's operations with those of WSYX under a local marketing agreement with WSYX as the senior partner
In after the FCC allowed duopolies Sinclair tried to acquire Glencairn outright
However the FCC would not allow Sinclair to repurchase WTTE for two major reasons
First the FCC does not allow duopolies between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market
Also the Columbus market despite its relatively large size has only seven full-power stations—too few to legally permit a duopoly
Glencairn was renamed Cunningham Broadcasting but is still effectively owned by Sinclair because nearly all of its stock is owned by trusts controlled by the Smith family
This situation is one of many that has led to allegations that Cunningham is simply a shell corporation used by Sinclair to circumvent FCC ownership rules
Sinclair would later acquire WKRC-TV in reuniting the station with WSYX
In WSYX along with other ABC affiliates owned by Sinclair including sister stations WKEF in Dayton which had recently switched back to ABC from NBC as well as WCHS-TV which includes parts of Southern Ohio in its viewing area preempted the special showing of Saving Private Ryan in late due to concerns that the FCC would impose a fine on them if they had aired the World War II-set movie due to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy earlier that year
As ABC affiliates owned by the E
Scripps Company also preempted the film including WEWS-TV in Cleveland and WCPO-TV in Cincinnati only viewers in the far eastern WYTV and northwestern then-ABC OO WTVG in Toledo parts of Ohio were able to view the film
It was later determined that the movie's broadcast was not a violation of FCC regulations
At one point WTVN-TVWSYX was one of five ABC affiliates owned by Taft owing to a longtime friendship between Taft's chairman Hulbert Taft Jr and then-ABC president Leonard Goldenson
WSYX is the only one of these stations still affiliated with ABC the only former Taft station whose ABC affiliation survives that friendship
Following the sale of WCMH-TV by NBC to Media General in as well as its subsequent merger with Nexstar Media Group in as well as WBNS-TV's sale to Tegna Inc WSYX currently has the longest active ownership history with one owner among Columbus's Big Three affiliates
On January Sinclair quietly sent a letter to cable and satellite providers saying that it had consolidated the Fox affiliations of stations in markets where it had been on a sister Cunningham or Deerfield-owned station onto Sinclair owned stations putting those affiliations directly in Sinclair's control
While most markets transitioned on that day the transition of WTTE-DT's programming schedule onto WSYX's spectrum would be held off until January as that would be the day WWHO would convert to being the market's ATSC lighthouse station and it would easier for the transition of all the channels being moved or launched to occur then
On that day Sinclair began simulcasting Fox programming on WSYX-DT while moving Antenna TV to the newly created
WTTE's main signal would eventually carry Sinclair-owned TBD full-time
The simulcast continued until February at am when the Fox schedule was now only available over-the-air through WSYX-DT WTTE would also become the host of WWHO's main CW schedule in ATSC format
With the move of the Fox schedule to WSYX-DT it became the largest-market subchannel-only Fox affiliate surpassing Albuquerque New Mexico's KRQE-DT for that distinction along with the largest station by market size holding two affiliations with the Big Four networks also ahead of KRQE
WSYX-DT continues to identify as Fox outside of the change of the call letters for their station identification though in technicality as WSYX uses physical channel it still properly identifies its channel position
The switch was contractually proper for cable and satellite providers who continue to carry Fox programming on all of Fox 's existing low-number channel positions while WTTE-DT's carriage now depends on provider some carry it as a low-number channel while others no longer carry any of WTTE's channels
In April Antenna TV and Stadium swapped channels with Stadium moving to and Antenna TV moving to WTTE-DT
In August WSYX launched a new second digital subchannel to carry programming from MyNetworkTV
This channel added programming from This TV in the daytime and overnight hours on November as of it takes up a bulk of the schedule outside of MyNetworkTV programming
For a long time WSYX-DT had been the largest-market subchannel-only MyNetworkTV affiliate but that all changed on November when KMOV-DT MyTV St
However WSYX-DT remained the largest-market MyNetworkTV affiliate to be paired with another multicast digital network until January when the Cleveland market's MyNetworkTV affiliation was transferred from WUAB which relaunched as a CW-affiliated station to a late-night offering with MeTV on WOIO-DT
WSYX presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week with six hours each weekday and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays on its main signal as well as ½ hours on WSYX-DT for a total of ½ hours of locally produced newscasts in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming it is the highest local newscast output among the Columbus market's television stations though WCMH-TV has the largest output airing on one channel
Historically WSYX has been third among Columbus's television news operations with WBNS the longtime market leader and WCMH having NBC's strength in the s into the s and NBC ownership in-between to keep up with WBNS
WSYX has begun to challenge WBNS as Sinclair's ownership has become steady with WCMH ending up a low-priority station under several new ownerships and WBNS's local ownership ending in when the Wolfe family sold off the WBNS stations to Tegna itself troubled by cost-cutting and shareholder turbulence and forced corporate-wide news imaging that discounted WBNS's local legacy
While WCMH-TV generally carries a straight newscast as is common among Nexstar stations and WBNS-TV has been more lifestyle-oriented under Tegna ownership WSYX has traditionally had more of a watchdog journalism style long carrying the slogan On YOUR Side
During the era WTVN-TV often passed WCMH for second place behind WBNS and during WSYX and WBNS traded second place ratings both behind then-number one WCMH
Over the years the station has featured high-profile Columbus anchors including Tom Ryan who moved from WBNS to WTVN in Pat Lalama IJ
Hudson Michelle Gailiun Lou Forrest known as Louis de la Foret on CNN Headline News Deborah Countiss Bob Hetherington Charlene Brown and Liz Claman now an anchor on Fox Business Network and Carol Costello former CNN news anchor were also one time anchorreporters on WSYX
Prior to Sinclair's acquisition of WSYX channel used the Action News branding for its newscasts
Following its acquisition WSYX began to produce newscasts for new sister station WTTE and used the unified branding of News Center
This would be dropped in with the two stations now using their individual station branding for newscasts though outside the branding it was established that they were sister stations and used the same on-air talent and reporters
WSYX and WTTE did not participate in the wider implementation of Sinclair's now-defunct controversial News Central format for its newscasts but did air The Point a one-minute conservative political commentary that was also controversial and a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations with newscasts until the series was discontinued in December
WSYX does provides weather forecasts to sister St
Louis ABC affiliate KDNL-TV for their Good Morning America cut-ins KDNL sub-contracts their newspublic affairs programming to an outside provider
WSYX launched their newscasts in high definition on May making them the last Columbus station to make the upgrade
The WTTE newscasts were included in the switch
In addition this was the second Sinclair-owned station to launch local newscasts in HD
WSYX was one of Sinclair's first stations it acquired with an established news department with the company having only dabbled with local news at WPTT in Pittsburgh now WPNT and flagship station WBFF in Baltimore prior to buying River City Broadcasting though it had just launched a PM newscast for its other Pittsburgh broadcast property WPGH-TV around the time it took over WSYX
Those newscasts are now produced by Cox Media Group-owned NBC affiliate WPXI in that market As a result aside from the branding changes WSYX's newscasts were largely left alone this is in stark contrast to later acquisitions including WKRC-TV that lined up the newscasts with Sinclair's conservative Republican ideologies and to this day rarely carry Sinclair's must-run programming
Like most local stations during the Golden Era of television WTVN-TV produced a wide range of live local news and entertainment programs
Earl Green better known as Channel 's news anchor and director in the s began his career at the station as a movie host Gene Fullen and Sally Flowers also hosted shows during their careers
WTVN-TV also hosted various live bowling shows including Bowling for Dollars and Spare Time hosted by Gene Fullen and Sandy Hare from its in-studio bowling lanes at the Harmon Avenue studios
The bowling lanes were not relocated when WTVN-TV moved to its current studio facility at Dublin Road in
For a short time in WSYX-TV aired the first-ever locally-produced am
live morning talk-entertainment show in Columbus appropriately called Good Morning Columbus
The half-hour show was hosted by Calvin Sneed the station's Six On Your Side consumer reporter and Dawn Meadows formerly of WEWS-TV Cleveland
Through both its affiliations with ABC and Fox and their Big Ten Conference rights WSYX airs the majority of Ohio State Buckeyes football games which are a huge ratings draw in Ohio in general and specifically Columbus home of Ohio State University
WSYX airs pre-game and post-game shows throughout football season on both and
Despite that WBNS-TV is considered the official home station due to its longstanding relationship with Ohio State and WBNS-TV instead of WSYX airs coach's shows for the Buckeyes
Since Sinclair's purchase of the former Fox Sports Networks and subsequent conversion into Bally Sports WSYX has actively promoted now-sister network Bally Sports Ohio as the home of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Columbus Crew SC mentioning to viewers during its newscasts when their respective games air on Bally Sports Ohio
In three television stations owned by Taft Broadcasting Company and Cox Communications formed the short-lived Tri-State Network to compete with entertainment programming produced by Crosley Broadcasting Corporation on Crosley television stations in the Cincinnati Columbus and Dayton Ohio broadcast markets
On January a new The Wendy Barrie Show premiered from the studios of WHIO-TV in Dayton simulcast on Taft Broadcasting's WKRC-TV in Cincinnati and WTVN-TV now WSYX in Columbus
Wendy Barrie's contract was terminated in October
WSYX shut down its analog signal over VHF channel on June at pm as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television
The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel using PSIP to display WSYX's virtual channel as on digital television receivers
On December the FCC issued a Report Order granting WSYX's petition to move from VHF channel to UHF channel to improve signal strength and to be consistent with other Columbus stations on the UHF dial
On August WSYX began broadcasting on UHF channel
Like all stations broadcasting on channel prior to the digital switchover WSYX's audio signal could be heard on MHz on the FM band in Columbus and the surrounding areas
As part of the SAFER Act WSYX kept its analog signal on the air until June to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters
WSYX moved its digital signal from channel to channel on October as part of the FCC's spectrum reallocation process
At times WTVN-TVWSYX has served as the default ABC affiliate in several markets
This has included the Zanesville Ohio market as a whole which only has NBC affiliate WHIZ-TV the Lima Ohio market as a whole served by NBC affiliate WLIO the Ohio portion of the Marietta OhioParkersburg West Virginia market served by NBC affiliate WTAP-TV and the western parts of the WheelingSteubenville market served by WTRF-TV and WTOV-TV
Over-the-air ABC coverage in MariettaParkersburg remains absent even as WTAP-TV owners Gray Television have signed on low-powered stations that air the other networks Fox affiliate WOVA-LD and CBS affiliate WIYE-LD so WSYX and sister station WCHS-TV in Charleston West Virginia both serve as default affiliates with WSYX serving the Ohio side of the market
In WheelingSteubenville WSYX covered areas that couldn't receive WTAE-TV from Pittsburgh which served as the de facto affiliate in most of that market since it had to short-space its analog signal to protect WCMH-TV some viewers in the market are also able to receive WYTV in Youngstown
This gave viewers in the WheelingSteubenville market an option to watch ABC programming in pattern since the only stations in the market WTRF-TV and WSTV-TVWTOV-TV aired ABC programming only in the off-hours and largely dropped them altogether by the s
WTOV-TV is now a sister station to WSYX That market finally received its own full-time ABC affiliate in when WTRF-TV launched one on its third digital subchannel although WSYX remains available on cable in the western parts of the market
Until channel was the closest VHF-signaled ABC affiliate to Lima as the UHF-signaled WKEF in Dayton and WDHO-TV in Toledo now WNWO-TV were both too weak to reach Lima
Both are now sister stations to WSYX However that year WDTN swapped affiliations with WKEF due to WKEF's weak signal even in Dayton as well as multiple preemptions by that station
Both stations would reverse the swap in WDTN's affiliation with ABC lessened the need for channel to air in Lima as the channel signal traveled greater distances in the analog era
Channel 's importance lessened even more when WTVG swapped affiliations with WNWO-TV in as part of the United States broadcast television realignment which didn't impact Columbus at all
Today Lima has its own ABC affiliate on low-powered WOHL-CD owned and operated by WLIO parent Block Communications
Unlike the other three markets WHIZ-TV has not signed on low-powered stations or made use of its subchannels to launch other network affiliates Cozi TV is the only subchannel WHIZ-TV uses outside its main signal
As a result WSYX continues to serve as the ABC affiliate of record for the Zanesville market adding Fox to its responsibilities in
