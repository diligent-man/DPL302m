An almanac also spelled almanack and almanach is an annual publication listing a set of current information about one or multiple subjects It includes information like weather forecasts farmers' planting dates tide tables and other tabular data often arranged according to the calendar Celestial figures and various statistics are found in almanacs such as the rising and setting times of the Sun and Moon dates of eclipses hours of high and low tides and religious festivals The set of events noted in an almanac may be tailored for a specific group of readers such as farmers sailors or astronomers
The etymology of the word is unclear The earliest documented use of the word in any language is in Latin in by Roger Bacon where it meant a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the Moon
It has been suggested that the word almanac derives from a Greek word meaning calendar However that word appears only once in antiquity by Eusebius who quotes Porphyry as to the Coptic Egyptian use of astrological charts almenichiaká The earliest almanacs were calendars that included agricultural astronomical or meteorological data But it is highly unlikely Roger Bacon received the word from this etymology Notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word of which however the real form is very uncertain the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the Spanish Arabic manākh or with Medieval Latin almanach without Arabic intermediation seem insurmountable
One etymology report says The ultimate source of the word is obscure Its first syllable al and its general relevance to medieval science and technology strongly suggest an Arabic origin but no convincing candidate has been found Ernest Weekley similarly states of almanac First seen in Roger Bacon Apparently from Spanish Arabic al manakh but this is not an Arabic wordThe word remains a puzzle Walter William Skeat concludes that the construction of an Arabic origin is not satisfactory The Oxford English Dictionary similarly says the word has no etymon in Arabic but indirect circumstantial evidence points to a Spanish Arabic al manākh
The reason why the proposed Arabic word is speculatively spelled al manākh is that the spelling occurred as almanach as well as almanac and Roger Bacon used both spellings The earliest use of the word was in the context of astronomy calendars
The prestige of the Tables of Toledo and other medieval Arabic astronomy works at the time of the word's emergence in the West together with the absence of the word in Arabic suggest it may have been invented in the West and is pseudo Arabic At that time in the West it would have been prestigious to attach an Arabic appellation to a set of astronomical tables Also around that time prompted by that motive the Latin writer Pseudo Geber wrote under an Arabic pseudonym The later alchemical word alkahest is known to be pseudo Arabic
The earlier texts considered to be almanacs have been found in the Near East dating back to the middle of the second millennium BC They have been called generally hemerologies from the Greek hēmerā meaning day Among them is the so called Babylonian Almanac which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them Successive variants and versions aimed at different readership have been found Egyptian lists of good and bad moments three times each day have also been found Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events The flooding of the Nile valley a most important event in ancient Egypt was expected to occur at the summer solstice but as the civil calendar had exactly days over the centuries the date was drifting in the calendar The first heliacal rising of Sirius was used for its prediction and this practice the observation of some star and its connecting to some event apparently spread
The Greek almanac known as parapegma has existed in the form of an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes hence the name There were also written texts and according to Diogenes Laërtius Parapegma was the title of a book by Democritus Ptolemy the Alexandrian astronomer nd century wrote a treatise Phaseis—phases of fixed stars and collection of weather changes is the translation of its full title—the core of which is a parapegma a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes first appearances and last appearances of stars or constellations at sunrise or sunset and solar events such as solstices all organized according to the solar year With the astronomical computations were expected weather phenomena composed as a digest of observations made by various authorities of the past Parapegmata had been composed for centuries
Ptolemy believed that astronomical phenomena caused the changes in seasonal weather his explanation of why there was not an exact correlation of these events was that the physical influences of other heavenly bodies also came into play Hence for him weather prediction was a special division of astrology
The origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient Babylonian astronomy when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena Similar treatises called Zij were later composed in medieval Islamic astronomy
The modern almanac differs from Babylonian Ptolemaic and Zij tables in the sense that the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation in contrast to the more common auxiliary astronomical tables based on Ptolemy's Almagest The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the Almanac of Azarqueil written in by Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al Zarqālī Latinized as Arzachel in Toledo al Andalus The work provided the true daily positions of the sun moon and planets for four years from to as well as many other related tables A Latin translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the Tables of Toledo in the th century and the Alfonsine tables in the th century
After almanacs were devised people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides and predicting the future in the divination sense Early almanacs therefore contained general horoscopes as well as natural information In Solomon Jarchus created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern examples Copies of th century almanacs are found in the British Museum and in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge In Petrus de Dacia created an almanac Savilian Library Oxford the same year Roger Bacon OFM produced his own In Walter de Elvendene created an almanac and later on John Somers of Oxford in In Nicholas de Lynne Oxford produced an almanac In the first printed almanac was published at Mainz by Gutenberg eight years before the famous Bible Regio Montanus produced an almanac in Nuremberg which continued in print for several centuries In the Sheapheard’s Kalendar translated from French Richard Pynson became the first almanac to be printed in English
By the second half of the th century yearly almanacs were being produced in England by authors such as Anthony Askham Thomas Buckminster John Dade and Gabriel Frende In the th century English almanacs were bestsellers second only to the Bible by the middle of the century almanacs were being produced annually a complete listing can be found in the English Short Title Catalogue Until its deregulation in the Stationers' Company maintained a lucrative monopoly over almanac publication in England Richard Allestree who is not the same as this Richard Allestree wrote one of the more popular English almanacs producing yearly volumes from to but his is by no means the earliest or the longest running almanac

The GPS almanac as part of the data transmitted by each GPS satellite contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation an ionospheric model and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time UTC Hence the GPS almanac provides a similar goal as the ancient Babylonian almanac to find celestial bodies
