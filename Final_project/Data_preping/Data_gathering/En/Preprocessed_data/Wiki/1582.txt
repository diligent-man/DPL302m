Lady Justice Latin Iustitia is an allegorical personification of the moral force in judicial systems Her attributes are scales a sword and sometimes a blindfold She often appears as a pair with Prudentia
Lady Justice originates from the personification of Justice in Ancient Roman art known as Iustitia or Justitia who is equivalent to the Greek goddess Dike
The origin of Lady Justice was Justitia the goddess of Justice within Roman mythology Justitia was introduced by emperor Augustus and was thus not a very old deity in the Roman pantheon
Justice was one of the virtues celebrated by emperor Augustus in his clipeus virtutis and a temple of Iustitia was established in Rome by emperor Tiberius Iustitia became a symbol for the virtue of justice with which every emperor wished to associate his regime emperor Vespasian minted coins with the image of the goddess seated on a throne called Iustitia Augusta and many emperors after him used the image of the goddess to proclaim themselves protectors of justice
Though formally called a goddess with her own temple and cult shrine in Rome it appears that she was from the onset viewed more as an artistic symbolic personification rather than as an actual deity with religious significance
The personification of justice balancing the scales dates back to the goddess Maat and later Isis of ancient Egypt The Hellenic deities Themis and Dike were later goddesses of justice Themis was the embodiment of divine order law and custom in her aspect as the personification of the divine rightness of law
Lady Justice is most often depicted with a set of scales typically suspended from one hand upon which she measures the strengths of a case's support and opposition
The Greek goddess Dike is depicted holding a set of scales

If some god had been holding level the balance of Dike JusticeThe scales represent the weighing of evidence and the scales lack a foundation in order to signify that evidence should stand on its own
Since the th century Lady Justice has often been depicted wearing a blindfold The blindfold was originally a satirical addition intended to show justice as blind to the injustice carried on before her but it has been reinterpreted over time and is now understood to represent impartiality the ideal that justice should be applied without regard to wealth power or other status The earliest Roman coins depicted Justitia with the sword in one hand and the scale in the other but with her eyes uncovered Justitia was only commonly represented as blind since the middle of the th century The first known representation of blind Justice is Hans Gieng's statue on the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen Fountain of Justice in Bern
Instead of using the Janus approach many sculptures simply leave out the blindfold altogether For example atop the Old Bailey courthouse in London a statue of Lady Justice stands without a blindfold the courthouse brochures explain that this is because Lady Justice was originally not blindfolded and because her maidenly form is supposed to guarantee her impartiality which renders the blindfold redundant Another variation is to depict a blindfolded Lady Justice as a human scale weighing competing claims in each hand An example of this can be seen at the Shelby County Courthouse in Memphis Tennessee
The sword represented authority in ancient times and conveys the idea that justice can be swift and final
The Greco Roman garment symbolizes the status of the philosophical attitude that embodies justice
Unicode version implemented a scales symbol at code point U+ that may be used to represent the scales of justice
Lady Justice and her symbols are used in heraldry especially in the arms and seals of legal government agencies
