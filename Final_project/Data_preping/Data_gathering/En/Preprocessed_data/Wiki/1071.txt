Shriver founded the Special Olympics in 1968
That year, the Joseph P

Foundation helped to plan and fund the First International Special Olympics Summer Games, held in Chicago, Illinois
In her speech at the opening ceremony, Shriver said, "'The Chicago Special Olympics prove a very fundamental fact, the fact that exceptional children — children with mental retardation — can be exceptional athletes, the fact that through sports they can realize their potential for growth.'" Special Olympics Inc
was established as a nonprofit charity in 1968; since that time, nearly three million athletes have participated.
In 1969, Shriver moved to France and pursued her interest in intellectual disability there
