jewish culture is the culture of the jewish people from its formation in ancient times until the current age
judaism itself is not a faith based religion but an orthoprax and ethnoreligion pertaining to deed practice and identity
jewish culture covers many aspects including religion and worldviews literature media and cinema art and architecture cuisine and traditional dress attitudes to gender marriage and family social customs and lifestyles music and dance
some elements of jewish culture come from within judaism others from the interaction of jews with host populations and others still from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community
before the th century religion dominated virtually all aspects of jewish life and infused culture
since the advent of secularization wholly secular jewish culture emerged likewise
there has not been a political unity of jewish society since the united monarchy
since then israelite populations were always geographically dispersed see jewish diaspora so that by the th century the ashkenazi jews were mainly located in eastern and central europe the sephardi jews were largely spread among various communities which lived in the mediterranean region mizrahi jews were primarily spread throughout western asia and other populations of jews lived in central asia ethiopia the caucasus and india
see jewish ethnic divisions
although there was a high degree of communication and traffic between these jewish communities many sephardic exiles blended into the ashkenazi communities which existed in central europe following the spanish inquisition many ashkenazim migrated to the ottoman empire giving rise to the characteristic syrian jewish family name ashkenazi iraqi jewish traders formed a distinct jewish community in india to some degree many of these jewish populations were cut off from the cultures which surrounded them by ghettoization muslim laws of dhimma and the traditional discouragement of contact between jews and members of polytheistic populations by their religious leaders
medieval jewish communities in eastern europe continued to display distinct cultural traits over the centuries
despite the universalist leanings of the enlightenment and its echo within judaism in the haskalah movement many yiddish speaking jews in eastern europe continued to see themselves as forming a distinct national group am yehudi from the biblical hebrew but adapting this idea to enlightenment values they assimilated the concept as that of an ethnic group whose identity did not depend on religion which under enlightenment thinking fell under a separate category
constantin m ciuc writes of the existence of a differentiated but not isolated jewish spirit permeating the culture of yiddish speaking jews
this was only intensified as the rise of romanticism amplified the sense of national identity across europe generally
thus for example members of the general jewish labour bund in the late th and early th centuries were generally non religious and one of the historical leaders of the bund was the child of converts to christianity though not a practicing or believing christian himself
the haskalah combined with the jewish emancipation movement under way in central and western europe to create an opportunity for jews to enter secular society
at the same time pogroms in eastern europe provoked a surge of migration in large part to the united states where some million jewish immigrants resettled between and
by shortly before the holocaust of the world s jewish population was ashkenazi in origin
secularism originated in europe as series of movements that militated for a new heretofore unheard of concept called secular judaism
for these reasons much of what is thought of by english speakers and to a lesser extent by non english speaking europeans as secular jewish culture is in essence the jewish cultural movement that evolved in central and eastern europe and subsequently brought to north america by immigrants
during the s the holocaust uprooted and destroyed most of the jewish communities living in much of europe
this in combination with the creation of the state of israel and the consequent jewish exodus from arab lands resulted in a further geographic shift
defining secular culture among those who practice traditional judaism is difficult because the entire culture is by definition entwined with religious traditions the idea of separate ethnic and religious identity is foreign to the hebrew tradition of an am yisrael
this is particularly true for orthodox judaism gary tobin head of the institute for jewish and community research said of traditional jewish culture
the dichotomy between religion and culture doesn t really exist
every religious attribute is filled with culture every cultural act filled with religiosity
synagogues themselves are great centers of jewish culture
after all what is life really about food relationships enrichment so is jewish life
so many of our traditions inherently contain aspects of culture
look at the passover seder it s essentially great theater
jewish education and religiosity bereft of culture is not as interesting yaakov malkin professor of aesthetics and rhetoric at tel aviv university and the founder and academic director of meitar college for judaism as culture in jerusalem writes
today very many secular jews take part in jewish cultural activities such as celebrating jewish holidays as historical and nature festivals imbued with new content and form or marking life cycle events such as birth bar bat mitzvah marriage and mourning in a secular fashion
they come together to study topics pertaining to jewish culture and its relation to other cultures in havurot cultural associations and secular synagogues and they participate in public and political action coordinated by secular jewish movements such as the former movement to free soviet jews and movements to combat pogroms discrimination and religious coercion
jewish secular humanistic education inculcates universal moral values through classic jewish and world literature and through organizations for social change that aspire to ideals of justice and charity in north america the secular and cultural jewish movements are divided into three umbrella organizations the society for humanistic judaism shj the congress of secular jewish organizations csjo and workmen s circle
jewish philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by jews or in relation to the religion of judaism
the jewish philosophy is extended over several main eras in jewish history including the ancient and biblical era medieval era and modern era see haskalah
the ancient jewish philosophy is expressed in the bible
according to prof
israel efros the principles of the jewish philosophy start in the bible where the foundations of the jewish monotheistic beliefs can be found such as the belief in one god the separation of god and the world and nature as opposed to pantheism and the creation of the world
other biblical writings that associated with philosophy are psalms that contains invitations to admire the wisdom of god through his works from this some scholars suggest judaism harbors a philosophical under current and ecclesiastes that is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the hebrew bible its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life s meaning
other writings related to philosophy can be found in the deuterocanonical books such as sirach and book of wisdom
during the hellenistic era hellenistic judaism aspired to combine jewish religious tradition with elements of greek culture and philosophy
the philosopher philo used philosophical allegory to attempt to fuse and harmonize greek philosophy with jewish philosophy
his work attempts to combine plato and moses into one philosophical system
he developed an allegoric approach of interpreting holy scriptures the bible in contrast to old fashioned literally interpretation approaches
his allegorical exegesis was important for several christian church fathers and some scholars hold that his concept of the logos as god s creative principle influenced early christology
other scholars however deny direct influence but say both philo and early christianity borrow from a common source
between the ancient era and the middle ages most of the jewish philosophy concentrated around the rabbinic literature that is expressed in the talmud and midrash
in the th century saadia gaon wrote the text emunoth ve deoth which is the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of judaism
the golden age of jewish culture in spain included many influential jewish philosophers such as moses ibn ezra abraham ibn ezra solomon ibn gabirol yehuda halevi isaac abravanel nahmanides joseph albo abraham ibn daud nissim of gerona bahya ibn paquda abraham bar hiyya joseph ibn tzaddik hasdai crescas and isaac ben moses arama
the most notable is maimonides who is considered beside the jewish world to be a prominent philosopher and polymath in the islamic and western worlds
outside of spain other philosophers are natan el al fayyumi elia del medigo jedaiah ben abraham bedersi and gersonides
philosophy by jews in modern era was expressed by philosophers mainly in europe such as baruch spinoza founder of spinozism whose work included modern rationalism and biblical criticism and laying the groundwork for the th century enlightenment
his work has earned him recognition as one of western philosophy s most important thinkers others are isaac orobio de castro tzvi ashkenazi david nieto isaac cardoso jacob abendana uriel da costa francisco sanches and moses almosnino
a new era began in the th century with the thought of moses mendelssohn
mendelssohn has been described as the third moses with whom begins a new era in judaism just as new eras began with moses the prophet and with moses maimonides
mendelssohn was a german jewish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of european jews haskalah the jewish enlightenment is indebted
he has been referred to as the father of reform judaism though reform spokesmen have been resistant to claim him as their spiritual father
mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both germans and jews
the jewish enlightenment philosophy included menachem mendel lefin salomon maimon and isaac satanow
the next th century comprised both secular and religious philosophy and included philosophers such as elijah benamozegh hermann cohen moses hess samson raphael hirsch samuel hirsch nachman krochmal samuel david luzzatto and nachman of breslov founder of breslov
the th century included the notable philosophers jacques derrida karl popper emmanuel levinas claude l vi strauss hilary putnam alfred tarski ludwig wittgenstein a
ayer walter benjamin raymond aron theodor w
adorno isaiah berlin and henri bergson
a range of moral and political views is evident early in the history of judaism that serves to partially explain the diversity that is apparent among secular jews who are often influenced by moral beliefs that can be found in jewish scripture and traditions
in recent centuries secular jews in europe and the americas have tended towards the liberal political left and played key roles in the birth of the th century s labor movement and socialism
while diaspora jews have also been represented in the conservative side of the political spectrum even politically conservative jews have tended to support pluralism more consistently than many other elements of the political right
some scholars attribute this to the fact that jews are not expected to proselytize derived from halakha
this lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most jews live as minorities in diaspora countries and that no central jewish religious authority has existed since ce
jews value education and the value of education is strongly embedded in jewish culture
in the middle ages european laws prevented jews from owning land and gave them powerful incentive to go into other professions that the indigenous europeans were not willing to follow
during the medieval period there was a very strong social stigma against lending money and charging interest among the christian majority
in most of europe until the late th century and in some places to an even later date jews were prohibited by roman catholic governments and others from owning land
on the other hand the church because of a number of bible verses e g leviticus forbidding usury declared that charging any interest was against the divine law and this prevented any mercantile use of capital by pious christians
as the canon law did not apply to jews they were not liable to the ecclesiastical punishments which were placed upon usurers by the popes
christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having a class of men like the jews who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication and so the money trade of western europe by this means fell into the hands of the jews
however in almost every instance where large amounts were acquired by jews through banking transactions the property thus acquired fell either during their life or upon their death into the hands of the king
this happened to aaron of lincoln in england ezmel de ablitas in navarre heliot de vesoul in provence benveniste de porta in aragon etc
it was often for this reason that kings supported the jews and even objected to them becoming christians because in that case they could not be forced to give up money won by usury
thus both in england and in france the kings demanded to be compensated for every jew converted
this type of royal trickery was one factor in creating the stereotypical jewish role of banker and or merchant
as a modern system of capital began to develop loans became necessary for commerce and industry
jews were able to gain a foothold in the new field of finance by providing these services as non catholics they were not bound by the ecclesiastical prohibition against usury and in terms of judaism itself hillel had long ago re interpreted the torah s ban on charging interest allowing interest when it s needed to make a living
the strong jewish tradition of religious scholarship often left jews well prepared for secular scholarship
in some times and places this was countered by banning jews from studying at universities or admitting them only in limited numbers see jewish quota
over the centuries jews have been poorly represented among land holding classes but far better represented in academia professions finance commerce and many scientific fields
the strong representation of jews in science and academia is evidenced by the fact that persons known to be jews or of jewish ancestry have been awarded the nobel prize accounting for of all individual recipients worldwide between and
of whom in physics in chemistry and in physiology or medicine
in the fields of mathematics and computer science of turing award recipients and of fields medal in mathematics were or are jewish
the early jewish activity in science can be found in the hebrew bible where some of the books contain descriptions of the physical world
biblical cosmology provides sporadic glimpses that may be stitched together to form a biblical impression of the physical universe
there have been comparisons between the bible with passages such as from the genesis creation narrative and the astronomy of classical antiquity more generally
the old testament also contains various cleansing rituals
one suggested ritual for example deals with the proper procedure for cleansing a leper leviticus
it is a fairly elaborate process which is to be performed after a leper was already healed of leprosy leviticus involving extensive cleansing and personal hygiene but also includes sacrificing a bird and lambs with the addition of using their blood to symbolize that the afflicted has been cleansed
the torah proscribes intercropping lev
deut a practice often associated with sustainable agriculture and organic farming in modern agricultural science
the mosaic code has provisions concerning the conservation of natural resources such as trees deuteronomy and birds deuteronomy
during medieval era astronomy was a primary field among jewish scholars and was widely studied and practiced
prominent astronomers included abraham zacuto who published in his hebrew book ha hibbur ha gadol where he wrote about the solar system charting the positions of the sun moon and five planets
his work served portugal s exploration journeys and was used by vasco da gama and also by christopher columbus
the lunar crater zagut is named after zacuto s name
the mathematician and astronomer abraham bar hiyya ha nasi authored the first european book to include the full solution to the quadratic equation x ax b and influenced the work of leonardo fibonacci
bar hiyya proved by the method of indivisibles the following equation for any circle s lxr where s is the surface area l is the circumference length and r is radius
garcia de orta portuguese renaissance jewish physician was a pioneer of tropical medicine
he published his work col quios dos simples e drogas da india in which deals with a series of substances many of them unknown or the subject of confusion and misinformation in europe at this period
he was the first european to describe asiatic tropical diseases notably cholera he performed an autopsy on a cholera victim the first recorded autopsy in india
bonet de lattes known chiefly as the inventor of an astronomical ring dial by means of which solar and stellar altitudes can be measured and the time determined with great precision by night as well as by day
other related personalities are abraham ibn ezra whose the moon crater abenezra named after david gans judah ibn verga mashallah ibn athari an astronomer the crater messala on the moon is named after him
albert einstein was a german born theoretical physicist and is considered one of the most prominent scientists in history often regarded as the father of modern physics
his revolutionary work on the relativity theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the th century
when first published relativity superseded a year old theory of mechanics created primarily by isaac newton
in the field of physics relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions along with ushering in the nuclear age
with relativity cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars black holes and gravitational waves
einstein formulated the well known mass energy equivalence e mc and explained the photoelectric effect
his work also effected and influenced a large variety of fields of physics including the big bang theory einstein s general relativity influenced georges lema tre quantum mechanics and nuclear energy
the manhattan project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during world war ii and many jewish scientists had a significant role in the project
the theoretical physicist robert oppenheimer often considered the father of the atomic bomb was chosen to direct the manhattan project at los alamos national laboratory in
the physicist le szil rd that conceived the nuclear chain reaction edward teller the father of the hydrogen bomb and stanislaw ulam eugene wigner contributed to theory of atomic nucleus and elementary particle hans bethe whose work included stellar nucleosynthesis and was head of the theoretical division at the secret los alamos laboratory richard feynman niels bohr victor weisskopf and joseph rotblat
the mathematician and physicist alexander friedmann pioneered the theory that universe was expanding governed by a set of equations he developed now known as the friedmann equations
arno allan penzias the physicist and radio astronomer co discoverer of the cosmic microwave background radiation which helped establish the big bang theory the scientists robert herman and ralph alpher had also worked on that field
in quantum mechanics jewish role was significant as well and many of most influential figures and pioneers of the theory were jewish niels bohr and his work on the atom structure max born schr dinger equation wolfgang pauli richard feynman quantum chromodynamics fritz london work on london dispersion force and london equations walter heitler and julian schwinger work on quantum electrodynamics asher peres a pioneer in quantum information david bohm quantum potential
sigmund freud known as the father of psychoanalysis is one of the most influential scientists of the th century
in creating psychoanalysis a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference establishing its central role in the analytic process
freud s redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory
his analysis of dreams as wish fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious as an agency disruptive of conscious states of mind
freud postulated the existence of libido an energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments and a death drive the source of repetition hate aggression and neurotic guilt
john von neumann a mathematician and physicist made major contributions to a number of fields including foundations of mathematics functional analysis ergodic theory geometry topology numerical analysis quantum mechanics hydrodynamics and game theory
in made also a major work with computing and the development of the computer he suggested and described a computer architecture called von neumann architecture and worked on linear programming self replicating machines stochastic computing and statistics
emmy noether was an influential mathematician known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics
described by many prominent scientists as the most important woman in the history of mathematics she revolutionized the theories of rings fields and algebras
in physics noether s theorem explains the fundamental connection between symmetry and conservation laws
more remarkable contributors include heinrich hertz and steven weinberg in electromagnetism carl sagan his contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of venus and known for his contributions to the scientific research of extraterrestrial life georg cantor creator of set theory felix hausdorff founder of topology edward witten m theory vitaly ginzburg and lev landau ginzburg landau theory yakir aharonov aharonov bohm effect boris podolsky and nathan rosen epr paradox moshe carmeli gauge theory

in some places where there have been relatively high concentrations of jews distinct secular jewish subcultures have arisen
for example ethnic jews formed an enormous proportion of the literary and artistic life of vienna austria at the end of the th century or of new york city years later and los angeles in the mid late th century
many of these creative jews were not particularly religious people
in general jewish artistic culture in various periods reflected the culture in which they lived
literary and theatrical expressions of secular jewish culture may be in specifically jewish languages such as hebrew yiddish judeo tat or ladino or it may be in the language of the surrounding cultures such as english or german
secular literature and theater in yiddish largely began in the th century and was in decline by the middle of the th century
the revival of hebrew beyond its use in the liturgy is largely an early th century phenomenon and is closely associated with zionism
apart from the use of hebrew in israel whether a jewish community will speak a jewish or non jewish language as its main vehicle of discourse is generally dependent on how isolated or assimilated that community is
for example the jews in the shtetls of poland and the lower east side of new york city during the early th century spoke yiddish at most times while assimilated jews in th and early th century germany spoke german and american born jews in the united states speak english
jewish authors have both created a unique jewish literature and contributed to the national literature of many of the countries in which they live
though not strictly secular the yiddish works of authors like sholem aleichem whose collected works amounted to volumes and isaac bashevis singer winner of the nobel prize form their own canon focusing on the jewish experience in both eastern europe and in america
in the united states jewish writers like philip roth saul bellow and many others are considered among the greatest american authors and incorporate a distinctly secular jewish view into many of their works
the poetry of allen ginsberg often touches on jewish themes notably the early autobiographical works such as howl and kaddish
other famous jewish authors that made contributions to world literature include heinrich heine german poet mordecai richler canadian author isaac babel russian author franz kafka of prague and harry mulisch whose novel the discovery of heaven was revealed by a poll as the best dutch book ever
in modern judaism an oxford guide yaakov malkin professor of aesthetics and rhetoric at tel aviv university and the founder and academic director of meitar college for judaism as culture in jerusalem writes
secular jewish culture embraces literary works that have stood the test of time as sources of aesthetic pleasure and ideas shared by jews and non jews works that live on beyond the immediate socio cultural context within which they were created
they include the writings of such jewish authors as sholem aleichem itzik manger isaac bashevis singer philip roth saul bellow s y

yehoshua and david grossman
it boasts masterpieces that have had a considerable influence on all of western culture jewish culture included works such as those of heinrich heine gustav mahler leonard bernstein marc chagall jacob epstein ben shahn amedeo modigliani franz kafka max reinhardt goldman ernst lubitsch and woody allen other notable contributors are isaac asimov author of the foundation series and others such as i robot nightfall and the gods themselves joseph heller catch r l

another aspect of jewish literature is the ethical called musar literature
among recipient of nobel prize in literature were or are jewish
hebrew poetry is expressed by various of poets in different eras of jewish history
biblical poetry is related to the poetry in biblical times as it expressed in the hebrew bible and jewish sacred texts
in medieval times the jewish poetry was mainly expressed by piyyutim and several poets such as yehuda halevi samuel ibn naghrillah solomon ibn gabirol moses ibn ezra abraham ibn ezra and dunash ben labrat
modern hebrew poetry is mostly related to the era of and after the revival of the hebrew language pioneered by moshe chaim luzzatto in the haskalah era and succeeded by poets such as hayim nahman bialik nathan alterman and shaul tchernichovsky
the ukrainian jew abraham goldfaden founded the first professional yiddish language theatre troupe in ia i romania in
the next year his troupe achieved enormous success in
bucharest
within a decade goldfaden and others brought yiddish theater to ukraine russia poland germany new york city and other cities with significant ashkenazic populations
between and over a dozen yiddish theatre groups existed in new york city alone in the yiddish theater district performing original plays musicals and yiddish translations of theatrical works and opera
perhaps the most famous of yiddish language plays is the dybbuk by s
ansky
yiddish theater in new york in the early th century rivalled english language theater in quantity and often surpassed it in quality
a new york times article remarks yiddish theater is now a stable american institution and no longer dependent on immigration from eastern europe
people who can neither speak nor write yiddish attend yiddish stage performances and pay broadway prices on second avenue this article also mentions other aspects of a new york jewish cultural life in full flower at that time among them the fact that the extensive new york yiddish language press of the time included seven daily newspapers
in fact however the next generation of american jews spoke mainly english to the exclusion of yiddish they brought the artistic energy of yiddish theater into the american theatrical mainstream but usually in a less specifically jewish form
yiddish theater most notably moscow state jewish theater directed by solomon mikhoels also played a prominent role in the arts scene of the soviet union until stalin s reversal in government policy toward the jews
see rootless cosmopolitan night of the murdered poets
montreal s dora wasserman yiddish theatre continues to thrive after years of performance
from their emancipation to world war ii jews were very active and sometimes even dominant in certain forms of european theatre and after the holocaust many jews continued to that cultural form
for example in pre nazi germany where nietzsche asked what good actor of today is not jewish acting directing and writing positions were often filled by jews
both macdonald and jewish tribal review would generally be counted as anti semitic sources but reasonably careful in their factual claims
in imperial berlin jewish artists could be found in the forefront of the performing arts from high drama to more popular forms like cabaret and revue and eventually film
jewish audiences patronized innovative theater regardless of whether they approved of what they saw the british historian paul johnson commenting on jewish contributions to european culture at the fin de si cle writes that
the area where jewish influence was strongest was the theatre especially in berlin
playwrights like carl sternheim arthur schnitzler ernst toller erwin piscator walter hasenclever ferenc moln r and carl zuckmayer and influential producers like max reinhardt appeared at times to dominate the stage which tended to be modishly left wing pro republican experimental and sexually daring
but it was certainly not revolutionary and it was cosmopolitan rather than jewish jews also made similar if not as massive contributions to theatre and drama in austria britain france and russia in the national languages of those countries
jews in vienna paris and german cities found cabaret both a popular and effective means of expression as german cabaret in the weimar republic was mostly a jewish art form
the involvement of jews in central european theatre was halted during the rise of the nazis and the purging of jews from cultural posts though many emigrated to western europe or the united states and continued working there
in the early th century the traditions of new york s vibrant yiddish theatre district both rivaled and fed into broadway
in the english speaking theatre jewish migr s brought novel theatrical ideas from europe such as the theatrical realist movement and the philosophy of konstantin stanislavski whose teachings would influence many jewish american acting teachers such as the yiddish theatre trained acting theorist stella adler
jewish immigrants were instrumental in the creation and development of the genre of musical theatre and earlier forms of theatrical entertainment in america and would innovate the new distinctly american art form the broadway musical
brandeis university professor stephen j
whitfield has commented that more so than behind the screen the talent behind the stage was for over half a century virtually the monopoly of one ethnic group
that is
a feature which locates broadway at the center of jewish culture
new york university professor laurence maslon says that there would be no american musical without jews their influence is corollary to the influence of black musicians on jazz there were as many jews involved in the form
other writers such as jerome caryn have noted that musical theatre and other forms of american entertainment are uniquely indebted to the contributions of jewish americans since there might not have been a modern broadway without the asiatic horde of comedians gossip columnists songwriters and singers that grew out of the ghetto whether it was on the lower east side harlem a jewish ghetto before it was a black one newark or washington d c likewise in the analysis of aaron kula director of the klezmer company
the jewish experience has always been best expressed by music and broadway has always been an integral part of the jewish american experience the difference is that one can expand the definition of jewish broadway to include an interdisciplinary roadway with a wide range of artistic activities packed onto one avenue theatre opera symphony ballet publishing companies choirs synagogues and more
this vibrant landscape reflects the life times and creative output of the jewish american artist in the th and early th centuries the european operetta a precursor the musical often featured the work of jewish composers such as paul abraham leo ascher edmund eysler leo fall bruno granichstaedten jacques offenbach emmerich kalman sigmund romberg oscar straus and rudolf friml the latter four eventually moved to the united states and produced their works on the new york stage
one of the librettists for bizet s carmen not an operetta proper but rather a work of the earlier op ra comique form was the jewish ludovic hal vy niece of composer fromental hal vy bizet himself was not jewish but he married the elder halevy s daughter many have suspected that he was the descendant of jewish converts to christianity and others have noticed jewish sounding intervals in his music
the viennese librettist victor leon summarized the connection of jewish composers and writers with the form of operetta the audience for operetta wants to laugh beneath tears and that is exactly what jews have been doing for the last two thousand years since the destruction of jerusalem
another factor in the evolution of musical theatre was vaudeville and during the early th century the form was explored and expanded by jewish comedians and actors such as jack benny fanny brice eddie cantor the marx brothers anna held al jolson molly picon sophie tucker and ed wynn
during the period when broadway was monopolized by revues and similar entertainments jewish producer florenz ziegfeld dominated the theatrical scene with his follies
by jews the vast majority of them immigrants from eastern europe already composed a quarter of the population of new york city and almost immediately jewish artists and intellectuals began to show their influence on the cultural life of that city and through time the country as a whole
likewise while the modern musical can best be described as a fusion of operetta earlier american entertainment and african american culture and music as well as jewish culture and music the actual authors of the first book musicals were the jewish jerome kern oscar hammerstein ii george and ira gershwin george s
kaufman and morrie ryskind
from that time until the s a vast majority of successful musical theatre composers lyricists and book writers were jewish a notable exception is the protestant cole porter who acknowledged that the reason he was so successful on broadway was that he wrote what he called jewish music
rodgers and hammerstein frank loesser lerner and loewe stephen sondheim leonard bernstein stephen schwartz kander and ebb and dozens of others during the golden age of musical theatre were jewish
since the tony award for best original score was instituted in approximately of nominated scores and of winning scores were by jewish composers
of successful british and french musical writers both in the west end and broadway claude michel sch nberg and lionel bart are jewish among others
one explanation of the affinity of jewish composers and playwrights to the musical is that traditional jewish religious music was most often led by a single singer a cantor while christians emphasize choral singing
many of these writers used the musical to explore issues relating to assimilation the acceptance of the outsider in society the racial situation in the united states the overcoming of obstacles through perseverance and other topics pertinent to jewish americans and western jews in general often using subtle and disguised stories to get this point across
for example kern rodgers hammerstein the gershwins harold arlen and yip harburg wrote musicals and operas aiming to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urging racial harmony these works included show boat porgy and bess finian s rainbow south pacific and the king and i
towards the end of golden age writers also began to openly and overtly tackle jewish subjects and issues such as fiddler on the roof and rags bart s blitz also tackles relations between jews and gentiles
jason robert brown and alfred uhry s parade is a sensitive exploration of both anti semitism and historical american racism
the original concept that became west side story was set in the lower east side during easter passover celebrations the rival gangs were to be jewish and italian catholic
the ranks of prominent jewish producers directors designers and performers include boris aronson david belasco joel grey the minskoff family zero mostel joseph papp mandy patinkin the nederlander family harold prince max reinhardt jerome robbins the shubert family and julie taymor
jewish playwrights have also contributed to non musical drama and theatre both broadway and regional
edna ferber moss hart lillian hellman arthur miller and neil simon are only some of the prominent jewish playwrights in american theatrical history
approximately of the plays and musicals that have won the pulitzer prize for drama were written and composed by jewish americans
the association for jewish theater is a contemporary organization that includes both american and international theaters that focus on theater with jewish content
it has also expanded to include jewish playwrights
the earliest known hebrew language drama was written around by a jewish italian writer from mantua
a few works were written by rabbis and kabbalists in th century amsterdam where jews were relatively free from persecution and had both flourishing religious and secular jewish cultures
all of these early hebrew plays were about biblical or mystical subjects often in the form of talmudic parables
during the post emancipation period in th century europe many jews translated great european plays such as those by shakespeare moli re and schiller giving the characters jewish names and transplanting the plot and setting to within a jewish context
modern hebrew theatre and drama however began with the development of modern hebrew in europe the first hebrew theatrical professional performance was in moscow in and was closely linked with the jewish national renaissance movement of the twentieth century
the historical awareness and the sense of primacy which accompanied the hebrew theatre in its early years dictated the course of its artistic and aesthetic development
these traditions were soon transplanted to israel
playwrights such as natan alterman hayyim nahman bialik leah goldberg ephraim kishon hanoch levin aharon megged moshe shamir avraham shlonsky yehoshua sobol and a
yehoshua have written hebrew language plays
themes that are obviously common in these works are the holocaust the arab israeli conflict the meaning of jewishness and contemporary secular religious tensions within jewish israel
the most well known hebrew theatre company and israel s national theatre is the habima meaning the stage in hebrew which was formed in in lithuania and re established in in russia another prominent israeli theatre company is the cameri theatre which is israel s first and leading repertory theatre

initially in the circle men played the female roles
later women began to take part in the theatre
in the judeo tat theatre was the winner of the festival of theatres in dagestan
during world war ii most of the actors were drafted into the army
many theatre actors died in the war

the official reason was its unprofitability
in the s the theatre resumed its activities and experienced its second heyday
the actress akhso ilyaguevna shalumova honored artist of the dagestan assr returned to the theatre
she played the role of juhuri shimi derbendi s wife shahnugor based on the stories of writer hizgil avshalumov
in the s the people s judeo tat theatre was organized

in lev yakovlevich manakhimov honored artist of the republic of dagestan became the artistic director of the theatre

in the era when yiddish theatre was still a major force in the world of theatre over films were made in yiddish
many are now lost
prominent films included shulamith the first yiddish musical on film his wife s lover a daughter of her people the anti nazi film the wandering jew the yiddish king lear shir hashirim the biggest yiddish film hit of all time yidl mitn fidl where is my child green fields dybuk the singing blacksmith tevya mirele efros lang ist der weg and god man and devil
the roster of jewish entrepreneurs in the english language american film industry is legendary samuel goldwyn louis b
mayer the warner brothers david o
selznick marcus loew and adolph zukor fox to name just a few and continuing into recent times with such industry giants as super agent michael ovitz michael eisner lew wasserman jeffrey katzenberg steven spielberg and david geffen
however few of these brought a specifically jewish sensibility either to the art of film or with the sometime exception of spielberg to their choice of subject matter
the historian eric hobsbawm described the situation as follows
a more specifically jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the marx brothers mel brooks or woody allen other examples of specifically jewish films from the hollywood film industry are the barbra streisand vehicle yentl or john frankenheimer s the fixer
more recently call me by your name can be given as an example of a movie with jewish sensibility
jewish film festivals are nowadays conducted in many major cities around the world as vehicles of introducing such films to wider audiences including among others the boston jff san francisco jff jerusalem jff etc
the first radio chains the radio corporation of america and the columbia broadcasting system were created by the jewish american david sarnoff and william s
paley respectively
these jewish innovators were also among the first producers of televisions both black and white and color
among the jewish immigrant communities of america there was also a thriving yiddish language radio with its golden age from the s to the s
although there is little specifically jewish television in the united states national jewish television largely religious broadcasts only three hours a week jews have been involved in american television from its earliest days
from sid caesar and milton berle to joan rivers gilda radner and andy kaufman to billy crystal to jerry seinfeld jewish stand up comedians have been icons of american television
other jews that held a prominent role in early radio and television were eddie cantor al jolson jack benny walter winchell and david susskind
more figures are larry king michael savage and howard stern
in the analysis of paul johnson the broadway musical radio and tv were all examples of a fundamental principle in jewish diaspora history jews opening up a completely new field in business and culture a tabula rasa on which to set their mark before other interests had a chance to take possession erect guild or professional fortifications and deny them entry
one of the first televised situation comedies the goldbergs was set in a specifically jewish milieu in the bronx
while the overt jewish milieu of the goldbergs was unusual for an american television series there were a few other examples such as brooklyn bridge and bridget loves bernie
jews have also played an enormous role among the creators and writers of television comedies woody allen mel brooks selma diamond larry gelbart carl reiner and neil simon all wrote for sid caesar reiner s son rob reiner worked with norman lear on all in the family which often engaged anti semitism and other issues of prejudice larry david and jerry seinfeld created the hit sitcom seinfeld lorne michaels al franken rosie shuster and alan zweibel of saturday night live breathed new life into the variety show in the s
more recently american jews have been instrumental to novelistic television series such as the wire and the sopranos
variously acclaimed as one of the greatest television series of all time the wire was created by david simon
simon also served as executive producer head writer and show runner
matthew weiner produced the fifth and sixth seasons of the sopranos and later created mad men
more remarkable contributors are david benioff and d
weiss creators of game of thrones tv series ron leavitt co creator of married
with children damon lindelof and j
abrams co creators of lost david crane and marta kauffman creators of friends tim kring creator of heroes sydney newman co creator of doctor who darren star creator sex and the city and melrose place aaron spelling co creator of beverly hills chuck lorre co creator of the big bang theory and two and a half men gideon raff creator of prisoners of war which homeland is based on aaron ruben and sheldon leonard co creators of the andy griffith show don hewitt creator of minutes garry shandling co creator of the larry sanders show ed
weinberger co creator of the cosby show david milch creator of deadwood steven levitan co creator of modern family dick wolf creator of law order david shore creator house max mutchnick and david kohan creators of will grace
there is also a significant role of jews in acting by actors such as sarah jessica parker william shatner leonard nimoy mila kunis zac efron hank azaria david duchovny fred savage zach braff noah wyle adam brody katey sagal sarah michelle gellar alyson hannigan michelle trachtenberg david schwimmer lisa kudrow and mayim bialik
jewish musical contributions also tend to reflect the cultures of the countries in which jews live the most notable examples being classical and popular music in the united states and europe
some music however is unique to particular jewish communities such as israeli music israeli folk music klezmer sephardic and ladino music and mizrahi music
before emancipation virtually all jewish music in europe was sacred music with the exception of the performances of klezmorim during weddings and other occasions
the result was a lack of a jewish presence in european classical music until the th century with a very few exceptions normally enabled by specific aristocratic protection such as salamone rossi and claude daquin the work of the former is considered the beginning of jewish art music
after jews were admitted to mainstream society in england gradually after their return in the th century france austria hungary the german empire and russia in that order the jewish contribution to the european music scene steadily increased but in the form of mainstream european music not specifically jewish music
notable examples of jewish romantic composers by country are charles valentin alkan paul dukas and fromental halevy from france josef dessauer karl goldmark and gustav mahler from bohemia most austrian jews during this time were native not to what is today austria but the outer provinces of the empire felix mendelssohn and giacomo meyerbeer from germany and anton and nikolai rubinstein from russia
singers included john braham and giuditta pasta
there were very many notable jewish violin and pianist virtuosi including joseph joachim ferdinand david carl tausig henri herz leopold auer jascha heifetz and ignaz moscheles
during the th century the number of jewish composers and notable instrumentalists increased as did their geographical distribution
sample jewish th century composers include arnold schoenberg and alexander von zemlinsky from austria hanns eisler and kurt weill from germany viktor ullmann and jarom r weinberger from bohemia and later the czech republic the former perished at the auschwitz extermination camps george gershwin and aaron copland from the united states darius milhaud and alexandre tansman from france alfred schnittke and lera auerbach from russia lalo schifrin and mario davidovsky from argentina and paul ben haim and shulamit ran from israel
there are some genres and forms of classical music that jewish composers have been associated with including notably during the romantic period french grand opera
the most prolific composers of this genre included giacomo meyerbeer fromental hal vy and the later jacques offenbach halevy s la juive was based on scribe s libretto very loosely connected to the jewish experience
while orchestral and operatic music works by jewish composers would in general be considered secular many jewish as well as non jewish composers have incorporated jewish themes and motives into their music
sometimes this is done covertly such as the klezmer band music that many critics and observers believe lies in the third movement of mahler s symphony no
and this type of jewish reference was most common during the th century when openly displaying one s jewishness would most likely hamper a jew s chances at assimilation
during the th century however many jewish composers wrote music with direct jewish references and themes e g
david amram symphony songs of the soul leonard bernstein kaddish symphony chichester psalms ernest bloch schelomo arnold schoenberg mario castelnuovo tedesco violin concerto no
kurt weill the eternal road and hugo weisgall psalm of the instant dove
in the late twentieth century prominent composers like morton feldman gyorgy ligeti or alfred schnittke gave significant contributions to the history of contemporary music
the great songwriters and lyricists of american traditional popular music and jazz standards were predominantly jewish including harold arlen jerome kern george gershwin frank loesser richard rodgers and irving berlin
deriving from biblical traditions jewish dance has long been used by jews as a medium for the expression of joy and other communal emotions
each jewish diasporic community developed its own dance traditions for wedding celebrations and other distinguished events
for ashkenazi jews in eastern europe for example dances whose names corresponded to the different forms of klezmer music that were played were an obvious staple of the wedding ceremony of the shtetl
jewish dances both were influenced by surrounding gentile traditions and jewish sources preserved over time
nevertheless the jews practiced a corporeal expressive language that was highly differentiated from that of the non jewish peoples of their neighborhood mainly through motions of the hands and arms with more intricate legwork by the younger men in general however in most religiously traditional communities members of the opposite sex dancing together or dancing at times other than at these events was frowned upon
jewish humor is the long tradition of humor in judaism dating back to the torah and the midrash but generally refers to the more recent stream of verbal frequently self deprecating and often anecdotal humor originating in europe
jewish humor took root in the united states over the last hundred years beginning with vaudeville and continuing through radio stand up film and television
a significant number of american comedians have been or are jewish
compared to music or theater there is less of a specifically jewish tradition in the visual arts
the most likely and accepted reason is that as has been previously shown with jewish music and literature before emancipation jewish culture was dominated by the religious tradition of aniconism
as most rabbinical authorities believed that the second commandment prohibited much visual art that would qualify as graven images jewish artists were relatively rare until they lived in assimilated european communities beginning in the late th century
despite fears by early religious communities of art being used for idolatrous purposes jewish sacred art is recorded in the tanakh and extends throughout jewish antiquity and the middle ages
the tabernacle and the two temples in jerusalem form the first known examples of jewish art
during the first centuries of the common era jewish religious art also was created in regions surrounding the mediterranean such as syria and greece including frescoes on the walls of synagogues of which the dura europas synagogue was the only survivor prior to its destruction by isil in as well as the jewish catacombs in rome
a jewish tradition of illuminated manuscripts in at least late antiquity has left no survivors but can be deduced from borrowings in early medieval christian art
a number of luxury pieces of gold glass from the later roman period have jewish motifs
several hellenistic style floor mosaics have also been excavated in synagogues from late antiquity in israel and palestine especially of the signs of the zodiac which was apparently acceptable in a low status position on the floor
some such as that at naaran show evidence of a reaction against images of living creatures around ce
the decoration of sarcophagi and walls at the cave cemetery at beit she arim shows a mixture of jewish and hellenistic motifs
however for a period of several centuries between about and ce there are scarcely any survivals of identifiably jewish art
middle age rabbinical and kabbalistic literature also contain textual and graphic art most famously illuminated haggadahs such as the sarajevo haggadah and other manuscripts like the nuremberg mahzor
some of these were illustrated by jewish artists and some by christians equally some jewish artists and craftsmen in various media worked on christian commissions
outside of europe yemenite jewish silversmiths developed a distinctive style of finely wrought silver that is admired for its artistry
johnson again summarizes this sudden change from a limited participation by jews in visual art as in many other arts to a large movement by them into this branch of european cultural life
again the arrival of the jewish artist was a strange phenomenon
it is true that over the centuries there had been many animals though few humans depicted in jewish art lions on torah curtains owls on judaic coins animals on the capernaum capitals birds on the rim of the fountain basis in the th century naro synagogue in tunis there were carved animals too on timber synagogues in eastern europe indeed the jewish wood carver was the prototype of the modern jewish plastic artist
a book of yiddish folk ornament printed at vitebsk in was similar to chagall s own bestiary
but the resistance of pious jews to portraying the living human image was still strong at the beginning of the th century there were few jewish secular artists in europe prior to the emancipation that spread throughout europe with the napoleonic conquests
there were exceptions and salomon adler was a prominent portrait painter in th century milan
the delay in participation in the visual arts parallels the lack of jewish participation in european classical music until the nineteenth century and which was progressively overcome with the rise of modernism in the th century
there were many jewish artists in the th century but jewish artistic activity boomed during the end of world war i
the jewish artistic renaissance has its roots in the fifth zionist congress which included an art exhibition featuring jewish artists e m
lilien and hermann struck
the exhibition helped legitimize art as an expression of jewish culture
according to nadine nieszawer until jews were always plunged into their books but from the first russian revolution they became emancipated committed themselves in politics and became artists
a real jewish cultural rebirth
individual jews figured in the modern artistic movements of europe with the exception of those living in isolated jewish communities most jews listed here as contributing to secular jewish culture also participated in the cultures of the peoples they lived with and nations they lived in
in most cases however the work and lives of these people did not exist in two distinct cultural spheres but rather in one that incorporated elements of both
during the early th century jews figured particularly prominently in the montparnasse movement and after world war ii among the abstract expressionists alexander bogen helen frankenthaler adolph gottlieb philip guston al held lee krasner barnett newman milton resnick jack tworkov mark rothko and louis schanker as well as among contemporary artists modernists and postmodernists
many russian jews were prominent in the art of scenic design particularly the aforementioned chagall and aronson as well as the revolutionary l on bakst who like the other two also painted
one mexican jewish artist was pedro friedeberg historians disagree as to whether frida kahlo s father was jewish or lutheran
gustav klimt was not jewish but nearly all of his patrons and several of his models were
among major artists chagall may be the most specifically jewish in his themes
but as art fades into graphic design jewish names and themes become more prominent leonard baskin al hirschfeld peter max ben shahn art spiegelman and saul steinberg
jews have also played a very important role in medias other than painting in photography some notable figures are andr kert sz robert frank helmut newton garry winogrand cindy sherman steve lehman and adi nes in installation art and street art some notable figures are sigalit landau dede and michal rovner
graphic art as expressed in the art of comics has been a key field for jewish artists as well
in the golden and silver ages of american comic books the jewish role was overwhelming and a large number of the medium s foremost creators have been jewish
max gaines was a pioneering figure in the creation of the modern comic book when in he published the first one called famous funnies
in he founded with jack liebowitz and harry donenfeld all american publications the aa group
the publication is known for the creation of several superheroes such as the original atom flash green lantern hawkman and wonder woman
donenfeld and liebowitz were also the owners of national allied publications which distributed detective comics and action comics
that company was also a precursor of dc comics
in the pulp magazine publisher martin goodman formed timely publications a company to be known since the s as marvel comics
at marvel artists such as stan lee jack kirby larry lieber and joe simon created a large variety of characters and cultural icons including spider man hulk captain america iron man thor daredevil and the teams fantastic four avengers x men including many of its characters and s h i e l d
stan lee attributed the jewish role in comics to the jewish culture
at dc comics jewish role was significant as well the character of superman which was created by the jewish artists joe shuster and jerry siegel is partly based on the biblical figure of samson
it was also suggested the superman is partly influenced by moses and other jewish elements
more at dc comics are bob kane bill finger and martin nodell creators of green lantern batman and many related characters as robin the joker riddler scarecrow and catwoman gil kane co creator of atom and iron fist
many of those involved in the later ages of comics are also jewish such as julius schwartz joe kubert jenette kahn len wein peter david neil gaiman chris claremont and brian michael bendis
there is also a large number of jewish characters among comics superheroes such as magneto quicksilver kitty pryde the thing sasquatch sabra ragman legion and moon knight of whom were and are influenced by events in jewish history and elements of jewish life
in max gaines founded ec comics
the company is known for specializing in horror fiction crime fiction satire military fiction and science fiction from the s through the mid s notably the tales from the crypt series the haunt of fear the vault of horror crime suspenstories and shock suspenstories
jewish artists that are associated with the publisher include al feldstein dave berg and jack kamen
will eisner was an american cartoonist and was known as one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the american comic book industry
he is the creator of the spirit comics series and the graphic novel a contract with god
the eisner award was named in his honor and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium
in william gaines and harvey kurtzman founded mad an american humor magazine
it was widely imitated and influential affecting satirical media as well as the cultural landscape of the th century with editor al feldstein increasing readership to more than two million during its s circulation peak
other known cartoonists are lee falk creator of the phantom and mandrake the magician the hebrew comics of michael netzer creator of uri on and uri fink creator of zbeng william steig creator of shrek daniel clowes creator of eightball art spiegelman creator of graphic novel maus and raw with fran oise mouly
in animation jewish animators role is expressed by many genndy tartakovsky is the creator of several animation tv series such as dexter s laboratory and samurai jack matt stone co creator of south park david hilberman who helped animate bambi and snow white and the seven dwarfs friz freleng looney tunes ralph bakshi fritz the cat mighty mouse the new adventures wizards the lord of the rings heavy traffic coonskin hey good lookin fire and ice and cool world alex hirsch creator of gravity falls dave fleischer and lou fleischer founders of fleischer studios max fleischer animation of betty boop popeye and superman rebecca sugar creator of steven universe
several companies producing animation were founded by jews such as dreamworks which its products include shrek madagascar kung fu panda and the prince of egypt warner bros whose animation division is known for cartoons such as looney tunes tiny toon adventures animaniacs pinky and the brain and freakazoid
jewish cooking combines the food of many cultures in which jews have settled including middle eastern mediterranean spanish german and eastern european styles of cooking all influenced by the need for food to be kosher
thus jewish foods like bagels hummus stuffed cabbage and blintzes all come from various other cultures
the amalgam of these foods plus uniquely jewish contributions like tzimmis cholent gefilte fish and matzah balls make up jewish cuisine
philo semitism also spelled philosemitism or judeophilia is an interest in respect for and an appreciation of jewish people their history and their culture and the influence of judaism particularly on the part of a gentile
within the jewish community philo semitism includes an interest in jewish culture and a love of things that are considered jewish
very few jews live in east asian countries but jews are viewed in an especially positive light in some of them partly owing to their shared wartime experiences during the second world war
examples include south korea and china
in general jews are positively stereotyped as intelligent business savvy and committed to family values and responsibility while in the western world the first of the two aforementioned stereotypes more often have the negatively interpreted equivalents of guile and greed
