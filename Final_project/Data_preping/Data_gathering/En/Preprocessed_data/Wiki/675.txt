Jewish culture is the culture of the Jewish people from its formation in ancient times until the current age Judaism itself is not a faith based religion but an orthoprax and ethnoreligion pertaining to deed practice and identity Jewish culture covers many aspects including religion and worldviews literature media and cinema art and architecture cuisine and traditional dress attitudes to gender marriage and family social customs and lifestyles music and dance Some elements of Jewish culture come from within Judaism others from the interaction of Jews with host populations and others still from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community Before the th century religion dominated virtually all aspects of Jewish life and infused culture Since the advent of secularization wholly secular Jewish culture emerged likewise
There has not been a political unity of Jewish society since the united monarchy Since then Israelite populations were always geographically dispersed see Jewish diaspora so that by the th century the Ashkenazi Jews were mainly located in Eastern and Central Europe the Sephardi Jews were largely spread among various communities which lived in the Mediterranean region Mizrahi Jews were primarily spread throughout Western Asia and other populations of Jews lived in Central Asia Ethiopia the Caucasus and India See Jewish ethnic divisions
Although there was a high degree of communication and traffic between these Jewish communities many Sephardic exiles blended into the Ashkenazi communities which existed in Central Europe following the Spanish Inquisition many Ashkenazim migrated to the Ottoman Empire giving rise to the characteristic Syrian Jewish family name Ashkenazi Iraqi Jewish traders formed a distinct Jewish community in India to some degree many of these Jewish populations were cut off from the cultures which surrounded them by ghettoization Muslim laws of dhimma and the traditional discouragement of contact between Jews and members of polytheistic populations by their religious leaders
Medieval Jewish communities in Eastern Europe continued to display distinct cultural traits over the centuries Despite the universalist leanings of the Enlightenment and its echo within Judaism in the Haskalah movement many Yiddish speaking Jews in Eastern Europe continued to see themselves as forming a distinct national group — 'am yehudi from the Biblical Hebrew but adapting this idea to Enlightenment values they assimilated the concept as that of an ethnic group whose identity did not depend on religion which under Enlightenment thinking fell under a separate category
Constantin Măciucă writes of the existence of a differentiated but not isolated Jewish spirit permeating the culture of Yiddish speaking Jews This was only intensified as the rise of Romanticism amplified the sense of national identity across Europe generally Thus for example members of the General Jewish Labour Bund in the late th and early th centuries were generally non religious and one of the historical leaders of the Bund was the child of converts to Christianity though not a practicing or believing Christian himself
The Haskalah combined with the Jewish Emancipation movement under way in Central and Western Europe to create an opportunity for Jews to enter secular society At the same time pogroms in Eastern Europe provoked a surge of migration in large part to the United States where some million Jewish immigrants resettled between and
By shortly before The Holocaust of the World's Jewish population was Ashkenazi in origin Secularism originated in Europe as series of movements that militated for a new heretofore unheard of concept called secular Judaism For these reasons much of what is thought of by English speakers and to a lesser extent by non English speaking Europeans as secular Jewish culture is in essence the Jewish cultural movement that evolved in Central and Eastern Europe and subsequently brought to North America by immigrants
During the s the Holocaust uprooted and destroyed most of the Jewish communities living in much of Europe This in combination with the creation of the State of Israel and the consequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands resulted in a further geographic shift
Defining secular culture among those who practice traditional Judaism is difficult because the entire culture is by definition entwined with religious traditions the idea of separate ethnic and religious identity is foreign to the Hebrew tradition of an 'am yisrael This is particularly true for Orthodox Judaism Gary Tobin head of the Institute for Jewish and Community Research said of traditional Jewish culture
The dichotomy between religion and culture doesn't really exist Every religious attribute is filled with culture every cultural act filled with religiosity Synagogues themselves are great centers of Jewish culture After all what is life really about Food relationships enrichment … So is Jewish life So many of our traditions inherently contain aspects of culture Look at the Passover Seder — it's essentially great theater Jewish education and religiosity bereft of culture is not as interestingYaakov Malkin Professor of Aesthetics and Rhetoric at Tel Aviv University and the founder and academic director of Meitar College for Judaism as Culture in Jerusalem writes
Today very many secular Jews take part in Jewish cultural activities such as celebrating Jewish holidays as historical and nature festivals imbued with new content and form or marking life cycle events such as birth barbat mitzvah marriage and mourning in a secular fashion They come together to study topics pertaining to Jewish culture and its relation to other cultures in havurot cultural associations and secular synagogues and they participate in public and political action coordinated by secular Jewish movements such as the former movement to free Soviet Jews and movements to combat pogroms discrimination and religious coercion Jewish secular humanistic education inculcates universal moral values through classic Jewish and world literature and through organizations for social change that aspire to ideals of justice and charityIn North America the secular and cultural Jewish movements are divided into three umbrella organizations the Society for Humanistic Judaism SHJ the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations CSJO and Workmen's Circle
Jewish philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Jews or in relation to the religion of Judaism The Jewish philosophy is extended over several main eras in Jewish history including the ancient and biblical era medieval era and modern era see Haskalah
The ancient Jewish philosophy is expressed in the bible According to Prof Israel Efros the principles of the Jewish philosophy start in the bible where the foundations of the Jewish monotheistic beliefs can be found such as the belief in one god the separation of god and the world and nature as opposed to Pantheism and the creation of the world Other biblical writings that associated with philosophy are Psalms that contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works from this some scholars suggest Judaism harbors a Philosophical under current and Ecclesiastes that is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the Hebrew Bible its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning Other writings related to philosophy can be found in the Deuterocanonical books such as Sirach and Book of Wisdom
During the Hellenistic era Hellenistic Judaism aspired to combine Jewish religious tradition with elements of Greek culture and philosophy The philosopher Philo used philosophical allegory to attempt to fuse and harmonize Greek philosophy with Jewish philosophy His work attempts to combine Plato and Moses into one philosophical system He developed an allegoric approach of interpreting holy scriptures the bible in contrast to old fashioned literally interpretation approaches His allegorical exegesis was important for several Christian Church Fathers and some scholars hold that his concept of the Logos as God's creative principle influenced early Christology Other scholars however deny direct influence but say both Philo and Early Christianity borrow from a common source
Between the Ancient era and the Middle Ages most of the Jewish philosophy concentrated around the Rabbinic literature that is expressed in the Talmud and Midrash In the th century Saadia Gaon wrote the text Emunoth ve Deoth which is the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism The Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain included many influential Jewish philosophers such as Moses ibn Ezra Abraham ibn Ezra Solomon ibn Gabirol Yehuda Halevi Isaac Abravanel Nahmanides Joseph Albo Abraham ibn Daud Nissim of Gerona Bahya ibn Paquda Abraham bar Hiyya Joseph ibn Tzaddik Hasdai Crescas and Isaac ben Moses Arama The most notable is Maimonides who is considered beside the Jewish world to be a prominent philosopher and polymath in the Islamic and Western worlds Outside of Spain other philosophers are Natan'el al Fayyumi Elia del Medigo Jedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi and Gersonides
Philosophy by Jews in Modern era was expressed by philosophers mainly in Europe such as Baruch Spinoza founder of Spinozism whose work included modern Rationalism and Biblical criticism and laying the groundwork for the th century Enlightenment His work has earned him recognition as one of Western philosophy's most important thinkers Others are Isaac Orobio de Castro Tzvi Ashkenazi David Nieto Isaac Cardoso Jacob Abendana Uriel da Costa Francisco Sanches and Moses Almosnino A new era began in the th century with the thought of Moses Mendelssohn Mendelssohn has been described as the 'third Moses' with whom begins a new era in Judaism just as new eras began with Moses the prophet and with Moses Maimonides Mendelssohn was a German Jewish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews Haskalah the Jewish Enlightenment is indebted He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism though Reform spokesmen have been resistant to claim him as their spiritual father Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Germans and Jews The Jewish Enlightenment philosophy included Menachem Mendel Lefin Salomon Maimon and Isaac Satanow The next th century comprised both secular and religious philosophy and included philosophers such as Elijah Benamozegh Hermann Cohen Moses Hess Samson Raphael Hirsch Samuel Hirsch Nachman Krochmal Samuel David Luzzatto and Nachman of Breslov founder of Breslov The th century included the notable philosophers Jacques Derrida Karl Popper Emmanuel Levinas Claude Lévi Strauss Hilary Putnam Alfred Tarski Ludwig Wittgenstein A J Ayer Walter Benjamin Raymond Aron Theodor W Adorno Isaiah Berlin and Henri Bergson
A range of moral and political views is evident early in the history of Judaism that serves to partially explain the diversity that is apparent among secular Jews who are often influenced by moral beliefs that can be found in Jewish scripture and traditions In recent centuries secular Jews in Europe and the Americas have tended towards the liberal political left and played key roles in the birth of the th century's labor movement and socialism While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the conservative side of the political spectrum even politically conservative Jews have tended to support pluralism more consistently than many other elements of the political right Some scholars attribute this to the fact that Jews are not expected to proselytize derived from Halakha This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in diaspora countries and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed since CE Jews value education and the value of education is strongly embedded in Jewish culture
In the Middle Ages European laws prevented Jews from owning land and gave them powerful incentive to go into other professions that the indigenous Europeans were not willing to follow During the medieval period there was a very strong social stigma against lending money and charging interest among the Christian majority In most of Europe until the late th century and in some places to an even later date Jews were prohibited by Roman Catholic governments and others from owning land On the other hand the Church because of a number of Bible verses eg Leviticus forbidding usury declared that charging any interest was against the divine law and this prevented any mercantile use of capital by pious Christians As the Canon law did not apply to Jews they were not liable to the ecclesiastical punishments which were placed upon usurers by the popes Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having a class of men like the Jews who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication and so the money trade of western Europe by this means fell into the hands of the Jews
However in almost every instance where large amounts were acquired by Jews through banking transactions the property thus acquired fell either during their life or upon their death into the hands of the king This happened to Aaron of Lincoln in England Ezmel de Ablitas in Navarre Heliot de Vesoul in Provence Benveniste de Porta in Aragon etc It was often for this reason that kings supported the Jews and even objected to them becoming Christians because in that case they could not be forced to give up money won by usury Thus both in England and in France the kings demanded to be compensated for every Jew converted This type of royal trickery was one factor in creating the stereotypical Jewish role of banker andor merchant
As a modern system of capital began to develop loans became necessary for commerce and industry Jews were able to gain a foothold in the new field of finance by providing these services as non Catholics they were not bound by the ecclesiastical prohibition against usury and in terms of Judaism itself Hillel had long ago re interpreted the Torah's ban on charging interest allowing interest when it's needed to make a living
The strong Jewish tradition of religious scholarship often left Jews well prepared for secular scholarship In some times and places this was countered by banning Jews from studying at universities or admitting them only in limited numbers see Jewish quota Over the centuries Jews have been poorly represented among land holding classes but far better represented in academia professions finance commerce and many scientific fields The strong representation of Jews in science and academia is evidenced by the fact that persons known to be Jews or of Jewish ancestry have been awarded the Nobel Prize accounting for of all individual recipients worldwide between and Of whom in physics in chemistry and in Physiology or Medicine In the fields of mathematics and computer science of Turing Award recipients and of Fields Medal in mathematics were or are Jewish
The early Jewish activity in science can be found in the Hebrew Bible where some of the books contain descriptions of the physical world Biblical cosmology provides sporadic glimpses that may be stitched together to form a Biblical impression of the physical universe There have been comparisons between the Bible with passages such as from the Genesis creation narrative and the astronomy of classical antiquity more generally The Old Testament also contains various cleansing rituals One suggested ritual for example deals with the proper procedure for cleansing a leper Leviticus It is a fairly elaborate process which is to be performed after a leper was already healed of leprosy Leviticus involving extensive cleansing and personal hygiene but also includes sacrificing a bird and lambs with the addition of using their blood to symbolize that the afflicted has been cleansed
The Torah proscribes Intercropping Lev Deut a practice often associated with sustainable agriculture and organic farming in modern agricultural science The Mosaic code has provisions concerning the conservation of natural resources such as trees Deuteronomy and birds Deuteronomy
During Medieval era astronomy was a primary field among Jewish scholars and was widely studied and practiced Prominent astronomers included Abraham Zacuto who published in his Hebrew book Ha hibbur ha gadol where he wrote about the Solar System charting the positions of the Sun Moon and five planets His work served Portugal's exploration journeys and was used by Vasco da Gama and also by Christopher Columbus The lunar crater Zagut is named after Zacuto's name The mathematician and astronomer Abraham bar Hiyya Ha Nasi authored the first European book to include the full solution to the quadratic equation x ax + b = and influenced the work of Leonardo Fibonacci Bar Hiyya proved by the method of indivisibles the following equation for any circle S = LxR where S is the surface area L is the circumference length and R is radius
Garcia de Orta Portuguese Renaissance Jewish physician was a pioneer of Tropical medicine He published his work Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India in which deals with a series of substances many of them unknown or the subject of confusion and misinformation in Europe at this period He was the first European to describe Asiatic tropical diseases notably cholera he performed an autopsy on a cholera victim the first recorded autopsy in India Bonet de Lattes known chiefly as the inventor of an astronomical ring dial by means of which solar and stellar altitudes can be measured and the time determined with great precision by night as well as by day Other related personalities are Abraham ibn Ezra whose the Moon crater Abenezra named after David Gans Judah ibn Verga Mashallah ibn Athari an astronomer The crater Messala on the Moon is named after him
Albert Einstein was a German born theoretical physicist and is considered one of the most prominent scientists in history often regarded as the father of modern physics His revolutionary work on the relativity theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the th century When first published relativity superseded a year old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton In the field of physics relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions along with ushering in the nuclear age With relativity cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars black holes and gravitational waves
Einstein formulated the well known Mass energy equivalence E = mc and explained the photoelectric effect His work also effected and influenced a large variety of fields of physics including the Big Bang theory Einstein's General relativity influenced Georges Lemaître Quantum mechanics and nuclear energy
The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II and many Jewish scientists had a significant role in the project The theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer often considered the father of the atomic bomb was chosen to direct the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory in The physicist Leó Szilárd that conceived the nuclear chain reaction Edward Teller the father of the hydrogen bomb and Stanislaw Ulam Eugene Wigner contributed to theory of Atomic nucleus and Elementary particle Hans Bethe whose work included Stellar nucleosynthesis and was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret Los Alamos laboratory Richard Feynman Niels Bohr Victor Weisskopf and Joseph Rotblat
The mathematician and physicist Alexander Friedmann pioneered the theory that universe was expanding governed by a set of equations he developed now known as the Friedmann equations Arno Allan Penzias the physicist and radio astronomer co discoverer of the cosmic microwave background radiation which helped establish the Big Bang theory the scientists Robert Herman and Ralph Alpher had also worked on that field In quantum mechanics Jewish role was significant as well and many of most influential figures and pioneers of the theory were Jewish Niels Bohr and his work on the atom structure Max Born Schrödinger equation Wolfgang Pauli Richard Feynman Quantum chromodynamics Fritz London work on London dispersion force and London equations Walter Heitler and Julian Schwinger work on Quantum electrodynamics Asher Peres a pioneer in Quantum information David Bohm Quantum potential
Sigmund Freud known as the father of psychoanalysis is one of the most influential scientists of the th century In creating psychoanalysis a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference establishing its central role in the analytic process Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory His analysis of dreams as wish fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious as an agency disruptive of conscious states of mind Freud postulated the existence of libido an energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments and a death drive the source of repetition hate aggression and neurotic guilt
John von Neumann a mathematician and physicist made major contributions to a number of fields including foundations of mathematics functional analysis ergodic theory geometry topology numerical analysis quantum mechanics hydrodynamics and game theory In made also a major work with computing and the development of the computer he suggested and described a computer architecture called Von Neumann architecture and worked on linear programming self replicating machines stochastic computing and statistics Emmy Noether was an influential mathematician known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics Described by many prominent scientists as the most important woman in the history of mathematics she revolutionized the theories of rings fields and algebras In physics Noether's theorem explains the fundamental connection between symmetry and conservation laws
More remarkable contributors include Heinrich Hertz and Steven Weinberg in Electromagnetism Carl Sagan his contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of Venus and known for his contributions to the scientific research of extraterrestrial life Georg Cantor creator of set theory Felix Hausdorff founder of topology Edward Witten M theory Vitaly Ginzburg and Lev Landau Ginzburg Landau theory Yakir Aharonov Aharonov Bohm effect Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen EPR paradoxMoshe Carmeli Gauge theory Rudolf Lipschitz Lipschitz continuity Paul Cohen Continuum hypothesis Axiom of choice Laurent Schwartz theory of distribution Grigory Margulis Lie group Richard M Karp Theory of computation Adi Shamir RSA cryptography Judea Pearl Artificial intelligence Bayesian network Max Newman Colossus computer Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi Jacobi elliptic functions Jacobian matrix and determinant Jacobi symbol Sidney Altman Molecular biology RNA Melvin Calvin Calvin Cycle Otto Wallach Alicyclic compound Paul Berg biochemistry of nucleic acids Ada Yonath Crystallography structure of the ribosome Dan Shechtman Quasicrystal Julius Axelrod and Bernard Katz Neurotransmitter Elie Metchnikoff discovery of Macrophage Selman Waksman discovery of Streptomycin Rosalind Franklin DNA Carl Djerassi the pill Stephen Jay Gould Evolutionary biology Baruch Samuel Blumberg Hepatitis B virus Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developers of the Polio vaccines Paul Ehrlich discovery of the Blood brain barrier In fields such as psychology and neurology Otto Rank Viktor Frankl Stanley Milgram and Solomon Asch linguistics Noam Chomsky Franz Boas Roman Jakobson Edward Sapir Joseph Greenberg and sociology Theodor Adorno Nathan Glazer Erving Goffman Georg Simmel

In some places where there have been relatively high concentrations of Jews distinct secular Jewish subcultures have arisen For example ethnic Jews formed an enormous proportion of the literary and artistic life of Vienna Austria at the end of the th century or of New York City years later and Los Angeles in the mid late th century Many of these creative Jews were not particularly religious people In general Jewish artistic culture in various periods reflected the culture in which they lived
Literary and theatrical expressions of secular Jewish culture may be in specifically Jewish languages such as Hebrew Yiddish Judeo Tat or Ladino or it may be in the language of the surrounding cultures such as English or German Secular literature and theater in Yiddish largely began in the th century and was in decline by the middle of the th century The revival of Hebrew beyond its use in the liturgy is largely an early th century phenomenon and is closely associated with Zionism Apart from the use of Hebrew in Israel whether a Jewish community will speak a Jewish or non Jewish language as its main vehicle of discourse is generally dependent on how isolated or assimilated that community is For example the Jews in the shtetls of Poland and the Lower East Side of New York City during the early th century spoke Yiddish at most times while assimilated Jews in th and early th century Germany spoke German and American born Jews in the United States speak English
Jewish authors have both created a unique Jewish literature and contributed to the national literature of many of the countries in which they live Though not strictly secular the Yiddish works of authors like Sholem Aleichem whose collected works amounted to volumes and Isaac Bashevis Singer winner of the Nobel Prize form their own canon focusing on the Jewish experience in both Eastern Europe and in America In the United States Jewish writers like Philip Roth Saul Bellow and many others are considered among the greatest American authors and incorporate a distinctly secular Jewish view into many of their works The poetry of Allen Ginsberg often touches on Jewish themes notably the early autobiographical works such as Howl and Kaddish Other famous Jewish authors that made contributions to world literature include Heinrich Heine German poet Mordecai Richler Canadian author Isaac Babel Russian author Franz Kafka of Prague and Harry Mulisch whose novel The Discovery of Heaven was revealed by a poll as the Best Dutch Book Ever
In Modern Judaism An Oxford Guide Yaakov Malkin Professor of Aesthetics and Rhetoric at Tel Aviv University and the founder and academic director of Meitar College for Judaism as Culture in Jerusalem writes
Secular Jewish culture embraces literary works that have stood the test of time as sources of aesthetic pleasure and ideas shared by Jews and non Jews works that live on beyond the immediate socio cultural context within which they were created They include the writings of such Jewish authors as Sholem Aleichem Itzik Manger Isaac Bashevis Singer Philip Roth Saul Bellow SY Agnon Isaac Babel Martin Buber Isaiah Berlin Haim Nahman Bialik Yehuda Amichai Amos Oz AB Yehoshua and David Grossman It boasts masterpieces that have had a considerable influence on all of western culture Jewish culture included works such as those of Heinrich Heine Gustav Mahler Leonard Bernstein Marc Chagall Jacob Epstein Ben Shahn Amedeo Modigliani Franz Kafka Max Reinhardt Goldman Ernst Lubitsch and Woody AllenOther notable contributors are Isaac Asimov author of the Foundation series and others such as I robot Nightfall and The Gods Themselves Joseph Heller Catch RL Stine Goosebumps series J D Salinger The Catcher in the Rye Michael Chabon The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier Clay The Yiddish Policemen's Union Marcel Proust In Search of Lost Time Arthur Miller Death of a Salesman and The Crucible Will Eisner A Contract with God Shel Silverstein The Giving Tree Arthur Koestler Darkness at Noon The Thirteenth Tribe Saul Bellow Herzog The historical novel series The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon is an inspiration for George R R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels
Another aspect of Jewish literature is the ethical called Musar literature Among recipient of Nobel Prize in Literature were or are Jewish
Hebrew poetry is expressed by various of poets in different eras of Jewish history Biblical poetry is related to the poetry in biblical times as it expressed in the Hebrew Bible and Jewish sacred texts In medieval times the Jewish poetry was mainly expressed by piyyutim and several poets such as Yehuda Halevi Samuel ibn Naghrillah Solomon ibn Gabirol Moses ibn Ezra Abraham ibn Ezra and Dunash ben Labrat Modern Hebrew poetry is mostly related to the era of and after the revival of the Hebrew language pioneered by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in the Haskalah era and succeeded by poets such as Hayim Nahman Bialik Nathan Alterman and Shaul Tchernichovsky
The Ukrainian Jew Abraham Goldfaden founded the first professional Yiddish language theatre troupe in Iași Romania in The next year his troupe achieved enormous success in
Bucharest Within a decade Goldfaden and others brought Yiddish theater to Ukraine Russia Poland Germany New York City and other cities with significant Ashkenazic populations Between and over a dozen Yiddish theatre groups existed in New York City alone in the Yiddish Theater District performing original plays musicals and Yiddish translations of theatrical works and opera Perhaps the most famous of Yiddish language plays is The Dybbuk by S Ansky
Yiddish theater in New York in the early th century rivalled English language theater in quantity and often surpassed it in quality A New York Times article remarks …Yiddish theater… is now a stable American institution and no longer dependent on immigration from Eastern Europe People who can neither speak nor write Yiddish attend Yiddish stage performances and pay Broadway prices on Second Avenue This article also mentions other aspects of a New York Jewish cultural life in full flower at that time among them the fact that the extensive New York Yiddish language press of the time included seven daily newspapers
In fact however the next generation of American Jews spoke mainly English to the exclusion of Yiddish they brought the artistic energy of Yiddish theater into the American theatrical mainstream but usually in a less specifically Jewish form
Yiddish theater most notably Moscow State Jewish Theater directed by Solomon Mikhoels also played a prominent role in the arts scene of the Soviet Union until Stalin's reversal in government policy toward the Jews See Rootless cosmopolitan Night of the Murdered Poets
Montreal's Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre continues to thrive after years of performance
From their Emancipation to World War II Jews were very active and sometimes even dominant in certain forms of European theatre and after the Holocaust many Jews continued to that cultural form For example in pre Nazi Germany where Nietzsche asked What good actor of today is not Jewish acting directing and writing positions were often filled by Jews Both MacDonald and Jewish Tribal Review would generally be counted as anti Semitic sources but reasonably careful in their factual claims In Imperial Berlin Jewish artists could be found in the forefront of the performing arts from high drama to more popular forms like cabaret and revue and eventually film Jewish audiences patronized innovative theater regardless of whether they approved of what they saw The British historian Paul Johnson commenting on Jewish contributions to European culture at the Fin de siècle writes that
The area where Jewish influence was strongest was the theatre especially in Berlin Playwrights like Carl Sternheim Arthur Schnitzler Ernst Toller Erwin Piscator Walter Hasenclever Ferenc Molnár and Carl Zuckmayer and influential producers like Max Reinhardt appeared at times to dominate the stage which tended to be modishly left wing pro republican experimental and sexually daring But it was certainly not revolutionary and it was cosmopolitan rather than JewishJews also made similar if not as massive contributions to theatre and drama in Austria Britain France and Russia in the national languages of those countries Jews in Vienna Paris and German cities found cabaret both a popular and effective means of expression as German cabaret in the Weimar Republic was mostly a Jewish art form The involvement of Jews in Central European theatre was halted during the rise of the Nazis and the purging of Jews from cultural posts though many emigrated to Western Europe or the United States and continued working there
In the early th century the traditions of New York's vibrant Yiddish Theatre District both rivaled and fed into Broadway In the English speaking theatre Jewish émigrés brought novel theatrical ideas from Europe such as the theatrical realist movement and the philosophy of Konstantin Stanislavski whose teachings would influence many Jewish American acting teachers such as the Yiddish theatre trained acting theorist Stella Adler Jewish immigrants were instrumental in the creation and development of the genre of musical theatre and earlier forms of theatrical entertainment in America and would innovate the new distinctly American art form the Broadway musical
Brandeis University Professor Stephen J Whitfield has commented that More so than behind the screen the talent behind the stage was for over half a century virtually the monopoly of one ethnic group That is a feature which locates Broadway at the center of Jewish culture New York University Professor Laurence Maslon says that There would be no American musical without Jews… Their influence is corollary to the influence of black musicians on jazz there were as many Jews involved in the form Other writers such as Jerome Caryn have noted that musical theatre and other forms of American entertainment are uniquely indebted to the contributions of Jewish Americans since there might not have been a modern Broadway without the Asiatic horde of comedians gossip columnists songwriters and singers that grew out of the ghetto whether it was on the Lower East Side Harlem a Jewish ghetto before it was a black one Newark or Washington DC Likewise in the analysis of Aaron Kula director of The Klezmer Company
…the Jewish experience has always been best expressed by music and Broadway has always been an integral part of the Jewish American experience… The difference is that one can expand the definition of Jewish Broadway to include an interdisciplinary roadway with a wide range of artistic activities packed onto one avenue—theatre opera symphony ballet publishing companies choirs synagogues and more This vibrant landscape reflects the life times and creative output of the Jewish American artistIn the th and early th centuries the European operetta a precursor the musical often featured the work of Jewish composers such as Paul Abraham Leo Ascher Edmund Eysler Leo Fall Bruno Granichstaedten Jacques Offenbach Emmerich Kalman Sigmund Romberg Oscar Straus and Rudolf Friml the latter four eventually moved to the United States and produced their works on the New York stage One of the librettists for Bizet's Carmen not an operetta proper but rather a work of the earlier Opéra comique form was the Jewish Ludovic Halévy niece of composer Fromental Halévy Bizet himself was not Jewish but he married the elder Halevy's daughter many have suspected that he was the descendant of Jewish converts to Christianity and others have noticed Jewish sounding intervals in his music The Viennese librettist Victor Leon summarized the connection of Jewish composers and writers with the form of operetta The audience for operetta wants to laugh beneath tears—and that is exactly what Jews have been doing for the last two thousand years since the destruction of Jerusalem Another factor in the evolution of musical theatre was vaudeville and during the early th century the form was explored and expanded by Jewish comedians and actors such as Jack Benny Fanny Brice Eddie Cantor The Marx Brothers Anna Held Al Jolson Molly Picon Sophie Tucker and Ed Wynn During the period when Broadway was monopolized by revues and similar entertainments Jewish producer Florenz Ziegfeld dominated the theatrical scene with his Follies
By Jews the vast majority of them immigrants from Eastern Europe already composed a quarter of the population of New York City and almost immediately Jewish artists and intellectuals began to show their influence on the cultural life of that city and through time the country as a whole Likewise while the modern musical can best be described as a fusion of operetta earlier American entertainment and African American culture and music as well as Jewish culture and music the actual authors of the first book musicals were the Jewish Jerome Kern Oscar Hammerstein II George and Ira Gershwin George S Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind From that time until the s a vast majority of successful musical theatre composers lyricists and book writers were Jewish a notable exception is the Protestant Cole Porter who acknowledged that the reason he was so successful on Broadway was that he wrote what he called Jewish music Rodgers and Hammerstein Frank Loesser Lerner and Loewe Stephen Sondheim Leonard Bernstein Stephen Schwartz Kander and Ebb and dozens of others during the Golden Age of musical theatre were Jewish Since the Tony Award for Best Original Score was instituted in approximately of nominated scores and of winning scores were by Jewish composers Of successful British and French musical writers both in the West End and Broadway Claude Michel Schönberg and Lionel Bart are Jewish among others
One explanation of the affinity of Jewish composers and playwrights to the musical is that traditional Jewish religious music was most often led by a single singer a cantor while Christians emphasize choral singing
Many of these writers used the musical to explore issues relating to assimilation the acceptance of the outsider in society the racial situation in the United States the overcoming of obstacles through perseverance and other topics pertinent to Jewish Americans and Western Jews in general often using subtle and disguised stories to get this point across For example Kern Rodgers Hammerstein the Gershwins Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg wrote musicals and operas aiming to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urging racial harmony these works included Show Boat Porgy and Bess Finian's Rainbow South Pacific and The King and I Towards the end of Golden Age writers also began to openly and overtly tackle Jewish subjects and issues such as Fiddler on the Roof and Rags Bart's Blitz also tackles relations between Jews and Gentiles Jason Robert Brown and Alfred Uhry's Parade is a sensitive exploration of both anti Semitism and historical American racism The original concept that became West Side Story was set in the Lower East Side during Easter Passover celebrations the rival gangs were to be Jewish and Italian Catholic
The ranks of prominent Jewish producers directors designers and performers include Boris Aronson David Belasco Joel Grey the Minskoff family Zero Mostel Joseph Papp Mandy Patinkin the Nederlander family Harold Prince Max Reinhardt Jerome Robbins the Shubert family and Julie Taymor Jewish playwrights have also contributed to non musical drama and theatre both Broadway and regional Edna Ferber Moss Hart Lillian Hellman Arthur Miller and Neil Simon are only some of the prominent Jewish playwrights in American theatrical history Approximately of the plays and musicals that have won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama were written and composed by Jewish Americans
The Association for Jewish Theater is a contemporary organization that includes both American and international theaters that focus on theater with Jewish content It has also expanded to include Jewish playwrights
The earliest known Hebrew language drama was written around by a Jewish Italian writer from Mantua A few works were written by rabbis and Kabbalists in th century Amsterdam where Jews were relatively free from persecution and had both flourishing religious and secular Jewish cultures All of these early Hebrew plays were about Biblical or mystical subjects often in the form of Talmudic parables During the post Emancipation period in th century Europe many Jews translated great European plays such as those by Shakespeare Molière and Schiller giving the characters Jewish names and transplanting the plot and setting to within a Jewish context
Modern Hebrew theatre and drama however began with the development of Modern Hebrew in Europe the first Hebrew theatrical professional performance was in Moscow in and was closely linked with the Jewish national renaissance movement of the twentieth century The historical awareness and the sense of primacy which accompanied the Hebrew theatre in its early years dictated the course of its artistic and aesthetic development These traditions were soon transplanted to Israel Playwrights such as Natan Alterman Hayyim Nahman Bialik Leah Goldberg Ephraim Kishon Hanoch Levin Aharon Megged Moshe Shamir Avraham Shlonsky Yehoshua Sobol and A B Yehoshua have written Hebrew language plays Themes that are obviously common in these works are the Holocaust the Arab Israeli conflict the meaning of Jewishness and contemporary secular religious tensions within Jewish Israel The most well known Hebrew theatre company and Israel's national theatre is the Habima meaning the stage in Hebrew which was formed in in Lithuania and re established in in Russia another prominent Israeli theatre company is the Cameri Theatre which is Israel's first and leading repertory theatre
The first theatrical event by Mountain Jews took place in December when Asaf Agarunov a teacher and a Zionist staged a story by Naum Shoykovich translated from Hebrew The Burn for Burn and staged it in honor of schoolteacher Nagdimuna ben Simona's Shimunov wedding
In a drama studio was opened in Derbent Soviet Union headed by Rabbi Yashaiyo Rabinovich
In the first Soviet Union theatre opened in Derbent which included three troupes Russian Mountain Jews and Turk It was based on drama circles which were led by Manashir and Khanum Shalumov Initially in the circle men played the female roles Later women began to take part in the theatre In the Judeo Tat theatre was the winner of the festival of theatres in Dagestan
During World War II most of the actors were drafted into the army Many theatre actors died in the war In the theatre resumed its work and in it was closed The official reason was its unprofitability
In the s the theatre resumed its activities and experienced its second heyday The actress Akhso Ilyaguevna Shalumova Honored Artist of the Dagestan ASSR returned to the theatre She played the role of JuhuriШими Дербенди Shimi Derbendi's wife Shahnugor based on the stories of writer Hizgil Avshalumov
In the s the People's Judeo Tat theatre was organized For many years its director was Abram Avdalimov Honored Cultural Worker of the Dagestan ASSR singer actor and playwright His successor was Roman Izyaev who was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour for his meritorious service
In the s the Judeo Tat theatre experienced another crisis it rarely held performances and did not have any premieres Only in when it became a municipal theater was it able to resume its activity From to the theatre was headed by actor and musician Raziil Semenovich Ilyaguev Honored Worker of Culture of the Republic of Dagestan For the next two years the theatre was headed by Alesya Isakova

The roster of Jewish entrepreneurs in the English language American film industry is legendary Samuel Goldwyn Louis B Mayer the Warner Brothers David O Selznick Marcus Loew and Adolph Zukor Fox to name just a few and continuing into recent times with such industry giants as super agent Michael Ovitz Michael Eisner Lew Wasserman Jeffrey Katzenberg Steven Spielberg and David Geffen However few of these brought a specifically Jewish sensibility either to the art of film or with the sometime exception of Spielberg to their choice of subject matter The historian Eric Hobsbawm described the situation as follows
A more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the Marx Brothers Mel Brooks or Woody Allen other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the Barbra Streisand vehicle Yentl or John Frankenheimer's The Fixer More recently Call Me By Your Name can be given as an example of a movie with Jewish sensibility Jewish film festivals are nowadays conducted in many major cities around the world as vehicles of introducing such films to wider audiences including among others the Boston JFF San Francisco JFF Jerusalem JFF etc
The first radio chains the Radio Corporation of America and the Columbia Broadcasting System were created by the Jewish American David Sarnoff and William S Paley respectively These Jewish innovators were also among the first producers of televisions both black and white and color Among the Jewish immigrant communities of America there was also a thriving Yiddish language radio with its golden age from the s to the s
Although there is little specifically Jewish television in the United States National Jewish Television largely religious broadcasts only three hours a week Jews have been involved in American television from its earliest days From Sid Caesar and Milton Berle to Joan Rivers Gilda Radner and Andy Kaufman to Billy Crystal to Jerry Seinfeld Jewish stand up comedians have been icons of American television Other Jews that held a prominent role in early radio and television were Eddie Cantor Al Jolson Jack Benny Walter Winchell and David Susskind More figures are Larry King Michael Savage and Howard Stern In the analysis of Paul Johnson The Broadway musical radio and TV were all examples of a fundamental principle in Jewish diaspora history Jews opening up a completely new field in business and culture a tabula rasa on which to set their mark before other interests had a chance to take possession erect guild or professional fortifications and deny them entry
One of the first televised situation comedies The Goldbergs was set in a specifically Jewish milieu in the Bronx While the overt Jewish milieu of The Goldbergs was unusual for an American television series there were a few other examples such as Brooklyn Bridge and Bridget Loves Bernie Jews have also played an enormous role among the creators and writers of television comedies Woody Allen Mel Brooks Selma Diamond Larry Gelbart Carl Reiner and Neil Simon all wrote for Sid Caesar Reiner's son Rob Reiner worked with Norman Lear on All in the Family which often engaged anti semitism and other issues of prejudice Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld created the hit sitcom Seinfeld Lorne Michaels Al Franken Rosie Shuster and Alan Zweibel of Saturday Night Live breathed new life into the variety show in the s
More recently American Jews have been instrumental to novelistic television series such as The Wire and The Sopranos Variously acclaimed as one of the greatest television series of all time The Wire was created by David Simon Simon also served as executive producer head writer and show runner Matthew Weiner produced the fifth and sixth seasons of The Sopranos and later created Mad Men
More remarkable contributors are David Benioff and D B Weiss creators of Game of Thrones TV series Ron Leavitt co creator of Married with Children Damon Lindelof and J J Abrams co creators of Lost David Crane and Marta Kauffman creators of Friends Tim Kring creator of Heroes Sydney Newman co creator of Doctor Who Darren Star creator Sex and the City and Melrose Place Aaron Spelling co creator of Beverly Hills Chuck Lorre co creator of The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men Gideon Raff creator of Prisoners of War which Homeland is based on Aaron Ruben and Sheldon Leonard co creators of The Andy Griffith Show Don Hewitt creator of Minutes Garry Shandling co creator of The Larry Sanders Show Ed Weinberger co creator of The Cosby Show David Milch creator of Deadwood Steven Levitan co creator of Modern Family Dick Wolf creator of Law Order David Shore creator House Max Mutchnick and David Kohan creators of Will Grace There is also a significant role of Jews in acting by actors such as Sarah Jessica Parker William Shatner Leonard Nimoy Mila Kunis Zac Efron Hank Azaria David Duchovny Fred Savage Zach Braff Noah Wyle Adam Brody Katey Sagal Sarah Michelle Gellar Alyson Hannigan Michelle Trachtenberg David Schwimmer Lisa Kudrow and Mayim Bialik
Jewish musical contributions also tend to reflect the cultures of the countries in which Jews live the most notable examples being classical and popular music in the United States and Europe Some music however is unique to particular Jewish communities such as Israeli music Israeli folk music Klezmer Sephardic and Ladino music and Mizrahi music
Before Emancipation virtually all Jewish music in Europe was sacred music with the exception of the performances of klezmorim during weddings and other occasions The result was a lack of a Jewish presence in European classical music until the th century with a very few exceptions normally enabled by specific aristocratic protection such as Salamone Rossi and Claude Daquin the work of the former is considered the beginning of Jewish art music After Jews were admitted to mainstream society in England gradually after their return in the th century France Austria Hungary the German Empire and Russia in that order the Jewish contribution to the European music scene steadily increased but in the form of mainstream European music not specifically Jewish music Notable examples of Jewish Romantic composers by country are Charles Valentin Alkan Paul Dukas and Fromental Halevy from France Josef Dessauer Karl Goldmark and Gustav Mahler from Bohemia most Austrian Jews during this time were native not to what is today Austria but the outer provinces of the Empire Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer from Germany and Anton and Nikolai Rubinstein from Russia Singers included John Braham and Giuditta Pasta There were very many notable Jewish violin and pianist virtuosi including Joseph Joachim Ferdinand David Carl Tausig Henri Herz Leopold Auer Jascha Heifetz and Ignaz Moscheles During the th century the number of Jewish composers and notable instrumentalists increased as did their geographical distribution Sample Jewish th century composers include Arnold Schoenberg and Alexander von Zemlinsky from Austria Hanns Eisler and Kurt Weill from Germany Viktor Ullmann and Jaromír Weinberger from Bohemia and later the Czech Republic the former perished at the Auschwitz extermination camps George Gershwin and Aaron Copland from the United States Darius Milhaud and Alexandre Tansman from France Alfred Schnittke and Lera Auerbach from Russia Lalo Schifrin and Mario Davidovsky from Argentina and Paul Ben Haim and Shulamit Ran from Israel There are some genres and forms of classical music that Jewish composers have been associated with including notably during the Romantic period French Grand Opera The most prolific composers of this genre included Giacomo Meyerbeer Fromental Halévy and the later Jacques Offenbach Halevy's La Juive was based on Scribe's libretto very loosely connected to the Jewish experience
While orchestral and operatic music works by Jewish composers would in general be considered secular many Jewish as well as non Jewish composers have incorporated Jewish themes and motives into their music Sometimes this is done covertly such as the klezmer band music that many critics and observers believe lies in the third movement of Mahler's Symphony No and this type of Jewish reference was most common during the th century when openly displaying one's Jewishness would most likely hamper a Jew's chances at assimilation During the th century however many Jewish composers wrote music with direct Jewish references and themes eg David Amram Symphony Songs of the Soul Leonard Bernstein Kaddish Symphony Chichester Psalms Ernest Bloch Schelomo Arnold Schoenberg Mario Castelnuovo Tedesco Violin Concerto no Kurt Weill The Eternal Road and Hugo Weisgall Psalm of the Instant Dove
In the late twentieth century prominent composers like Morton Feldman Gyorgy Ligeti or Alfred Schnittke gave significant contributions to the history of contemporary music
The great songwriters and lyricists of American traditional popular music and jazz standards were predominantly Jewish including Harold Arlen Jerome Kern George Gershwin Frank Loesser Richard Rodgers and Irving Berlin
Deriving from Biblical traditions Jewish dance has long been used by Jews as a medium for the expression of joy and other communal emotions Each Jewish diasporic community developed its own dance traditions for wedding celebrations and other distinguished events For Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe for example dances whose names corresponded to the different forms of klezmer music that were played were an obvious staple of the wedding ceremony of the shtetl Jewish dances both were influenced by surrounding Gentile traditions and Jewish sources preserved over time Nevertheless the Jews practiced a corporeal expressive language that was highly differentiated from that of the non Jewish peoples of their neighborhood mainly through motions of the hands and arms with more intricate legwork by the younger men In general however in most religiously traditional communities members of the opposite sex dancing together or dancing at times other than at these events was frowned upon
Jewish humor is the long tradition of humor in Judaism dating back to the Torah and the Midrash but generally refers to the more recent stream of verbal frequently self deprecating and often anecdotal humor originating in Europe Jewish humor took root in the United States over the last hundred years beginning with vaudeville and continuing through radio stand up film and television A significant number of American comedians have been or are Jewish
Compared to music or theater there is less of a specifically Jewish tradition in the visual arts The most likely and accepted reason is that as has been previously shown with Jewish music and literature before Emancipation Jewish culture was dominated by the religious tradition of aniconism As most Rabbinical authorities believed that the Second Commandment prohibited much visual art that would qualify as graven images Jewish artists were relatively rare until they lived in assimilated European communities beginning in the late th century Despite fears by early religious communities of art being used for idolatrous purposes Jewish sacred art is recorded in the Tanakh and extends throughout Jewish Antiquity and the Middle Ages The Tabernacle and the two Temples in Jerusalem form the first known examples of Jewish art During the first centuries of the Common Era Jewish religious art also was created in regions surrounding the Mediterranean such as Syria and Greece including frescoes on the walls of synagogues of which the Dura Europas Synagogue was the only survivor prior to its destruction by ISIL in as well as the Jewish catacombs in Rome
A Jewish tradition of illuminated manuscripts in at least Late Antiquity has left no survivors but can be deduced from borrowings in Early Medieval Christian art A number of luxury pieces of gold glass from the later Roman period have Jewish motifs Several Hellenistic style floor mosaics have also been excavated in synagogues from Late Antiquity in Israel and Palestine especially of the signs of the Zodiac which was apparently acceptable in a low status position on the floor Some such as that at Naaran show evidence of a reaction against images of living creatures around CE The decoration of sarcophagi and walls at the cave cemetery at Beit She'arim shows a mixture of Jewish and Hellenistic motifs However for a period of several centuries between about and CE there are scarcely any survivals of identifiably Jewish art
Middle Age Rabbinical and Kabbalistic literature also contain textual and graphic art most famously illuminated haggadahs such as the Sarajevo Haggadah and other manuscripts like the Nuremberg Mahzor Some of these were illustrated by Jewish artists and some by Christians equally some Jewish artists and craftsmen in various media worked on Christian commissions Outside of Europe Yemenite Jewish silversmiths developed a distinctive style of finely wrought silver that is admired for its artistry Johnson again summarizes this sudden change from a limited participation by Jews in visual art as in many other arts to a large movement by them into this branch of European cultural life
Again the arrival of the Jewish artist was a strange phenomenon It is true that over the centuries there had been many animals though few humans depicted in Jewish art lions on Torah curtains owls on Judaic coins animals on the Capernaum capitals birds on the rim of the fountain basis in the th century Naro synagogue in Tunis there were carved animals too on timber synagogues in eastern Europe indeed the Jewish wood carver was the prototype of the modern Jewish plastic artist A book of Yiddish folk ornament printed at Vitebsk in was similar to Chagall's own bestiary But the resistance of pious Jews to portraying the living human image was still strong at the beginning of the th centuryThere were few Jewish secular artists in Europe prior to the Emancipation that spread throughout Europe with the Napoleonic conquests There were exceptions and Salomon Adler was a prominent portrait painter in th century Milan The delay in participation in the visual arts parallels the lack of Jewish participation in European classical music until the nineteenth century and which was progressively overcome with the rise of Modernism in the th century There were many Jewish artists in the th century but Jewish artistic activity boomed during the end of World War I The Jewish artistic Renaissance has its roots in the Fifth Zionist Congress which included an art exhibition featuring Jewish artists EM Lilien and Hermann Struck The exhibition helped legitimize art as an expression of Jewish culture According to Nadine Nieszawer Until Jews were always plunged into their books but from the first Russian Revolution they became emancipated committed themselves in politics and became artists A real Jewish cultural rebirth Individual Jews figured in the modern artistic movements of Europe— With the exception of those living in isolated Jewish communities most Jews listed here as contributing to secular Jewish culture also participated in the cultures of the peoples they lived with and nations they lived in In most cases however the work and lives of these people did not exist in two distinct cultural spheres but rather in one that incorporated elements of both
During the early th century Jews figured particularly prominently in the Montparnasse movement and after World War II among the abstract expressionists Alexander Bogen Helen Frankenthaler Adolph Gottlieb Philip Guston Al Held Lee Krasner Barnett Newman Milton Resnick Jack Tworkov Mark Rothko and Louis Schanker as well as among Contemporary artists Modernists and Postmodernists Many Russian Jews were prominent in the art of scenic design particularly the aforementioned Chagall and Aronson as well as the revolutionary Léon Bakst who like the other two also painted One Mexican Jewish artist was Pedro Friedeberg historians disagree as to whether Frida Kahlo's father was Jewish or Lutheran Gustav Klimt was not Jewish but nearly all of his patrons and several of his models were Among major artists Chagall may be the most specifically Jewish in his themes But as art fades into graphic design Jewish names and themes become more prominent Leonard Baskin Al Hirschfeld Peter Max Ben Shahn Art Spiegelman and Saul Steinberg
Jews have also played a very important role in medias other than painting in photography some notable figures are André Kertész Robert Frank Helmut Newton Garry Winogrand Cindy Sherman Steve Lehman and Adi Nes in installation art and street art some notable figures are Sigalit Landau Dede and Michal Rovner
