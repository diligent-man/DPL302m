in medicine homans sign sometimes spelled as homans sign or called dorsiflexion sign is considered by some physicians to be a sign of deep vein thrombosis dvt
it was defined by john homans in as discomfort behind the knee upon forced dorsiflexion of the foot
after many examples of false positive homans signs were reported homans redefined it in stating that discomfort need have no part in the reaction and that increased resistance involuntary flexure of the knee or pain in the calf upon forced dorsiflexion should be considered positive responses
it is estimated to have a sensitivity of and a specificity of and is thus considered to have no diagnostic value since a positive sign does not indicate dvt and a negative sign does not rule it out
still it is widely used in clinical practice probably because of its historical role prior to the availability of more reliable diagnostic studies such as a d dimer titration or a doppler ultrasound as well the ease of eliciting it
an elevated d dimer in the elderly population has no predictive value for deep venous thrombosis
signs and symptoms of dvt in general are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis being helpful only to help determine the likelihood of a dvt with the use of a clinical prediction rule such as the wells score
there may exist some concern that eliciting this sign may be dangerous and that it should not be elicited
