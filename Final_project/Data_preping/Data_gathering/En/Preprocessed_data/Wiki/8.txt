The VR official was one of three postage stamps introduced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in May for the pre payment of postage While the Penny Black and the Two Pence Blue were for use by the general public as were the Mulready envelopes and letter sheets the VR official was for use on official mail In appearance the VR Official was the same as the issued Penny Black except that the Maltese crosses in the top corners were removed and replaced by the letters V and R hence its common name
The plate layout for this issue was the same in almost all respects as that used for the penny black and the two pence blue produced at the same time The only difference in the marginal inscription was the plate identification which was shown as a letter see picture rather than a number as used on the general issue of postage stamps
The idea of this stamp was that it would be used on official correspondence from government departments However the public dislike and mockery of the Mulready envelope and letter sheets led to vast numbers of the Mulreadies being issued to the various departments with the tax office being the heaviest user
Since existing stocks could be used the idea of the official stamp was abandoned Nearly all of the supplies which had been printed were destroyed on January Twenty one sheets survived a few of the stamps passed invalidly through the posts and Rowland Hill used some to experiment with cancellation techniques
The stamp was forged by Bernhardt Assmus in August who was unmasked by the dealer Morris Giwelb to whom he had sold a forged copy of the stamp
