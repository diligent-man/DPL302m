information technology backup data backup copy computer data taken stored elsewhere may used restore original data loss event
verb form referring process back whereas noun adjective form backup
backup used recover data loss data deletion corruption recover data earlier time backup provide simple form disaster recovery however backup system able reconstitute computer system complex configuration computer cluster active directory server database server
backup system contains least one copy data considered worth saving
information repository model may used provide structure storage
different type data storage device used copying backup data already secondary storage onto archive files
also different way device arranged provide geographic dispersion data security portability
process include method dealing live data including open file well compression encryption de-duplication
backup scheme may include dry run validate reliability data backed up
backup strategy requires information repository secondary storage space data aggregate backup data sources
repository could simple list backup medium dvd etc date produced could include computerized index catalog relational database
backup data need stored requiring backup rotation scheme system backing data computer medium limit number backup different date retained separately appropriate re-use data storage medium overwriting backup longer needed
scheme determines piece removable storage used backup operation long retained ha backup data stored it
state least copy data stored different type storage medium one copy kept offsite remote location include cloud storage
different medium used eliminate data loss due similar reason example optical disc may tolerate underwater lto tape may ssds cannot fail due head crash damaged spindle motor since moving part unlike hard drive offsite copy protects fire theft physical medium
disaster protected hard drive like made iosafe alternative offsite copy limitation like able resist fire limited period time offsite copy still remains ideal choice
unstructured repository may simply stack tape dvd-rs external hdds minimal information wa backed when
method easiest implement unlikely achieve high level recoverability lack automation
repository using backup method contains complete source data copy taken one specific point time
copying system image method frequently used computer technician record known good configurations
however imaging generally useful way deploying standard configuration many system rather tool making ongoing backup diverse systems
incremental backup store data changed since reference point time
typically full backup file infrequent interval serving reference point incremental repository
subsequently number incremental backup made successive time periods
backup system create synthetic full backup series incrementals thus providing equivalent frequently full backup
done modify single archive file speed restores recent version files
continuous data protection cdp refers backup instantly save copy every change made data
allows restoration data point time comprehensive advanced data protection
near-cdp backup applicationsoften marketed cdpautomatically take incremental backup specific interval example every minute one hour hours
near-cdp backup application use journaling typically based periodic snapshot read-only copy data frozen particular point time
near-cdp except apple time machine intent-logs every change host system often saving byte block-level difference rather file-level differences
backup method differs simple disk mirroring enables roll-back log thus restoration old image data
intent-logging allows precaution consistency live data protecting self-consistent file requiring application quiesced made ready backup
near-cdp practicable ordinary personal backup application opposed true cdp must run conjunction virtual machine equivalent therefore generally used enterprise client-server backups
reverse incremental backup method store recent archive file mirror source data series difference mirror current state previous states
reverse incremental backup method start non-image full backup
full backup performed system periodically synchronizes full backup live copy storing data necessary reconstruct older versions
either done using hard linksas apple time machine doe using binary diffs
differential backup save data ha changed since last full backup
mean maximum two backup repository used restore data
however time last full backup thus accumulated change data increase doe time perform differential backup
restoring entire system requires starting recent full backup applying last differential backup
differential backup copy file created changed since last full backup regardless whether differential backup made since whereas incremental backup copy file created changed since recent backup type full incremental
change file may detected recent datetime last modification file attribute andor change file size
variation incremental backup include multi-level incrementals block-level incrementals compare part file instead entire files
regardless repository model used data ha copied onto archive file data storage medium
magnetic tape wa long time commonly used medium bulk data storage backup archiving interchange
wa previously le expensive option longer case smaller amount data
tape sequential access medium rate continuously writing reading data fast
tape medium ha low cost per space tape drive typically dozen time expensive hard disk drive optical drives
many tape format proprietary specific certain market like mainframe particular brand personal computer
remaining viable super format ibm also referred tsxx series
use hard disk storage ha increased time ha become progressively cheaper
hard disk usually easy use widely available accessed quickly
however hard disk backup close-tolerance mechanical device may easily damaged tape especially transported
mid-s several drive manufacturer began produce portable drive employing ramp loading accelerometer technology sometimes termed shock sensor industry average drop test drive technology showed drive remaining intact working inch non-operating drop onto industrial carpeting
manufacturer also offer 'ruggedized' portable hard drive include shock-absorbing case around hard disk claim range higher drop specifications
period year stability hard disk backup shorter tape backups
external hard disk connected via local interface like scsi usb firewire esata via longer-distance technology like ethernet iscsi fibre channel
disk-based backup system via virtual tape library otherwise support data deduplication reduce amount disk storage capacity consumed daily weekly backup data
recordable cd dvd blu-ray disc commonly used personal computer generally cheap
past capacity speed disc lower hard disk tape although advance optical medium slowly shrinking gap
potential future data loss caused gradual medium degradation predicted measuring rate correctable minor data error consecutively many increase risk uncorrectable sectors
support error scanning varies among optical drive vendors
many optical disc format worm type make useful archival purpose since data cannot changed
moreover optical disc vulnerable head crash magnetism imminent water ingres power surge fault drive typically halt spinning
optical medium modular storage controller tied medium like hard drive flash storage flash memory controller allowing removed accessed different drive
however recordable medium may degrade earlier long-term exposure light
optical storage system allow cataloged data backup without human contact disc allowing longer data integrity

various method used manage backup medium striking balance accessibility security cost
medium management method mutually exclusive frequently combined meet user's needs
using on-line disk staging data sent near-line tape library common example
online backup storage typically accessible type data storage begin restore milliseconds
internal hard disk disk array maybe connected san example online backup
type storage convenient speedy vulnerable deleted overwritten either accident malevolent action wake data-deleting virus payload
nearline storage typically le accessible le expensive online storage still useful backup data storage
mechanical device usually used move medium unit storage drive data read written
example tape library restore time ranging second minutes
off-line storage requires direct action provide access storage medium example inserting tape tape drive plugging cable
data accessible via computer except limited period written read back largely immune on-line backup failure modes
access time varies depending whether medium on-site off-site
backup medium may sent off-site vault protect disaster site-specific problem
vault simple system administrator's home office sophisticated disaster-hardened temperature-controlled high-security bunker facility backup medium storage
data replica off-site also on-line eg off-site raid mirror
backup site disaster recovery center used store data enable computer system network restored properly configure event disaster
due high cost backing rarely considered preferred method moving data dr site
typical way would remote disk mirroring keep dr data date possible
backup operation start selecting extracting coherent unit data
data modern computer system stored discrete unit known files
backing much redundant data information repository fill quickly
backing insufficient amount data eventually lead loss critical information
copying file making copy file simplest common way perform backup
mean perform basic function included backup software operating systems
partial file copying backup may include block byte within file changed given period time
substantially reduce needed storage space requires higher sophistication reconstruct file restore situation
deleted file prevent unintentional restoration file intentionally deleted record deletion must kept
versioning file backup application full onlysystem imaging also back file modified since last backup
way retrieve many different version given file delete hard disk still find information repository archivefilesystem dump copy whole filesystem block-level made
also known raw partition backup related disk imaging
process usually involves unmounting filesystem running program like dd unix
disk read sequentially large buffer type backup faster reading every file normally especially filesystem contains many small file highly fragmented nearly full
method also read free disk block contain useful data method also slower conventional reading especially filesystem nearly empty
filesystems xfs provide dump utility read disk sequentially high performance skipping unused sections
corresponding restore utility selectively restore individual file entire volume operator's choice
identification change filesystems archive bit file say wa recently changed
backup software look date file compare last backup determine whether file wa changed
versioning file system versioning filesystem track change file
nilfs versioning filesystem linux examplefiles actively updated present challenge back up
one way back live data temporarily quiesce eg close file take snapshot resume live operations
snapshot instantaneous function filesystems present copy filesystem frozen specific point time often copy-on-write mechanism
also case across interrelated file may found conventional database application microsoft exchange server
term fuzzy backup used describe backup live data look like ran correctly doe represent state data single point time
open file backup many backup software application undertake back open file internally consistent state
application simply check whether open file use try later
interrelated database file backup interrelated database file system offer mean generate hot backup database online usable
may include snapshot data file plus snapshotted log change made backup running
upon restore change log file applied bring copy database point time initial backup ended
however genuinely-high-availability interactive application backed via continuous data protectionnot information stored computer stored files
accurately recovering complete system scratch requires keeping track non-file data too
system description system specification needed procure exact replacement disaster
boot sector boot sector sometimes recreated easily saving it
partition layout layout original disk well partition table filesystem setting needed properly recreate original system
