Geography and wealth have long been perceived as correlated attributes of nations
Sachs argue that geography has a key role in the development of a nation's economic growth
For instance nations that reside along coastal regions or those who have access to a nearby water source are more plentiful and able to trade with neighboring nations
In addition countries that have a tropical climate face a significant amount of difficulties such as disease intense weather patterns and lower agricultural productivity
The correlation between geography and a nation's wealth can be observed by examining a country's GDP gross national product per capita which takes into account a nation's economic output and population
The wealthiest nations of the world with the highest standard of living tend to be those at the northern extreme of areas open to human habitation—including Northern Europe the United States and Canada
Within prosperous nations wealth often increases with distance from the equator for example the Northeast United States has long been wealthier than its southern counterpart and northern Italy wealthier than southern regions of the country
Even within Africa this effect can be seen as the nations farthest from the equator are wealthier
In Africa the wealthiest nations are the three on the southern tip of the continent South Africa Botswana and Namibia and the countries of North Africa
Similarly in South America Argentina Southern Brazil Chile and Uruguay have long been the wealthiest
Within Asia Indonesia located on the equator is among the poorest
Within Central Asia Kazakhstan is wealthier than other former Soviet Republics which border it to the south like Uzbekistan
Researchers at Harvard's Center for International Development found in that only one tropical economy — Singapore — is classified as high-income by the World Bank while all countries within regions zoned as temperate had either middle- or high-income economies
Most of the recent studies use national gross domestic product per person as measured by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as the unit of comparison
Intra-national comparisons use their own data and political divisions such as states or provinces then delineate the study areas
One of the first to describe and assess the phenomenon was the French philosopher Montesquieu who asserted in the th century that cold air constringes sic the extremities of the external fibres of the body this increases their elasticity and favours the return of the blood from the extreme parts to the heart
It contracts those very fibres consequently it also increases their force
On the contrary warm air relaxes and lengthens the extremes of the fibres of course it diminishes their force and elasticity
People are therefore more vigorous in cold climates
The th century historian Henry Thomas Buckle wrote that climate soil food and the aspects of nature are the primary causes of intellectual progress—the first three indirectly through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth and the last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of thought the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible the understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are small and feeble
Physiologist Jared Diamond was inspired to write his Pulitzer Prize-winning work Guns Germs and Steel by a question posed by Yali a New Guinean politician why were Europeans so much wealthier than his people In this book Diamond argues that the Europe-Asia Eurasia land mass is particularly favorable for the transition of societies from hunter-gatherer to farming communities
This continent stretches much farther along the same lines of latitude than any of the other continents
Since it is much easier to transfer a domesticated species along the same latitude than it is to move it to a warmer or colder climate any species developed at a particular latitude will be transferred across the continent in a relatively short amount of time
Thus the inhabitants of the Eurasian continent have had a built-in advantage in terms of earlier development of farming and a greater range of plants and animals from which to choose
Diamond notes that modern technologies and institutions were designed primarily in a small area of northwestern Europe
After the Scientific Revolution in Europe in the th century the quality of life increased and wealth began to spread to the middle class
This included agricultural techniques machines and medicines
These technologies and models readily spread to areas colonized by Europe which happened to be of similar climate such as North America and Australia
As these areas also became centres of innovation this bias was further enhanced
Technologies from automobiles to power lines are more often designed for colder and drier regions since most of their customers are from these regions
The book goes on to document a feedback effect of technologies being designed for the wealthy which makes them more wealthy and thus more able to fund technological development
He notes that the far north has not always been the wealthiest latitude until only a few centuries ago the wealthiest belt stretched from Southern Europe through the Middle East northern India and southern China
A dramatic shift in technologies beginning with ocean-going ships and culminating in the Industrial Revolution saw the most developed belt move north into northern Europe China and the Americas
Northern Russia became a superpower while southern India became impoverished and colonized
Diamond argues that such dramatic changes demonstrate that the current distribution of wealth is not due to immutable factors such as climate or race citing the early emergence of agriculture in ancient Mesopotamia as evidence
Diamond also notes the feedback effect in the growth of medical technology stating that more research money goes into curing the ailments of northerners
Ticks mosquitos and rats which continue to be important disease vectors benefit from warmer temperatures and higher humidities
There has long been a malarial belt spanning the equatorial portions of the globe the disease is especially deadly to children under the age of five
Notably it has been almost impossible for most forms of northern livestock to thrive due to the endemic presence of the tsetse fly
Jared Diamond has linked domestication of animals in Europe and Asia to the development of diseases that enabled these countries to conquer the inhabitants of other continents
The close association of people in Eurasia with their domesticated animals provided a vector for the rapid transmission of diseases
Inhabitants of lands with few domesticated species were never exposed to the same range of diseases and so at least on the American continents succumbed to diseases introduced from Eurasia
These effects were exhaustively discussed in William McNeill's book Plagues and Peoples
The Harvard study mentions high infant mortality as another factor since birth rates usually increase in compensation women may delay their entry into the workforce to care for their younger children
The education of the surviving children then becomes difficult perpetuating a cycle of poverty

McMillan of Purdue University and Tufts University hypothesize that the disparity is partially due to the effects of frost in increasing soil fertility
Hernando Zuleta of the Universidad del Rosario has proposed that where output fluctuations are more profound ie
areas that experience winter saving is more pronounced which leads to the adoption or creation of capital-intensive technologies
Daron Acemoglu Simon Johnson and James A
Robinson of MIT argued in that in places where Europeans faced high mortality rates they could not settle and were more likely to set up exploitative institutions
These institutions offered no protection for private property or checks and balances against government expropriation
They assert that after controlling for the effect of institutions countries in Africa or those closer to the equator do not have lower incomes
This work has been disputed by David Albouy who argues that European mortality rates in the study were badly mismeasured falsely supporting its conclusion
