Growth of religion involves the spread of individual religions and the increase in the numbers of religious adherents around the world Statistics commonly measure the absolute number of adherents the percentage of the absolute growth per year and the growth of converts in the world
Studies in the st century suggest that in terms of percentage and worldwide spread Islam is the fastest growing major religion in the world A comprehensive religious forecast for by the Pew Research Center predicts that the global Muslim population will grow at a faster rate than the Christian population primarily due to the average younger age and higher fertility rate of Muslims It is projected that birth rates rather than conversion will prove the main factor in the growth of any given religion While according to various scholars and sources Pentecostalism a Protestant Christian movement is the fastest growing religion in the world this growth is primarily due to religious conversion
Counting the number of converts to a religion can prove difficult Although some national censuses ask people about their religion they do not ask if they have converted to their presently espoused faith Additionally in some countries legal and social consequences make conversion difficult For example individuals can receive a death sentence if they openly leave Islam in some Muslim countries Statistical data on conversion to and from Islam are scarce According to a study published in by Pew Research what little information is available suggests that religious conversion has no net impact on the Muslim population as the number of people who convert to Islam is roughly similar to those who leave Islam
Some religions proselytise vigorously Christianity and Islam for example while others such as Judaism and Sikhism do not generally encourage conversions into their ranks Some faiths grow exponentially at first especially for example along trade routes
or for reasons of social prestige
only for their zeal to wane note the flagging case of Zoroastrianism The growth of a religion can interact with factors such as persecution entrenched rival religions such as established religions and religious market saturation

According to a Pew Research Center survey between and an estimated million babies were born to Buddhist mothers and roughly million Buddhists died meaning that the natural increase in the Buddhists population i e the number of births minus the number of deaths was million over this period According to the same study Buddhists are projected to decline in absolute number dropping from nearly million in to million in Low fertility rates and aging populations in countries such as China Thailand and Japan are the main demographic reasons for the expected shrinkage in the Buddhist population in the years ahead

According to scholars Miikka Ruokanen and Paulos Huang of University of Helsinki the rebirth of traditional religion in China is faster and larger than the spread of other religions in the country such as Buddhism and Christianity

On the other hand in the Pew Forum found that statistical data for Muslim conversions is scarce and as per their little available information there is no substantial net gain or loss of Muslims due to religious conversion It also stated that the number of people who embrace Islam and the number of those who leave Islam are roughly equal Thus this report excludes religious conversion as a direct factor from the projection of Muslim population growth People switching their religions will likely have no effect on the growth of the Muslim population as the number of people who convert to Islam is roughly similar to those who leave Islam Another study found that the number of people who will leave Islam is and the number of converts to Islam is so the net gain to Islam through conversion should be million between and mostly from Sub Saharan Africa million The growth of Islam from to has been estimated at due to high birthrates in Asia the Middle East and Europe The report also shows that the fall in the birth rate of Muslims slowed down the growth rate from to It is due to the fall of the fertility rate in many Muslim majority countries Despite the decline Muslims still have the highest birth rate among the world's major religious groups According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace the World Christian Database as of has Islam as the fastest growing religion in the world A Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood
According to a Pew Research Center survey between and an estimated million babies were born to Muslim mothers and roughly million Muslims died meaning that the natural increase in the Muslim population i e the number of births minus the number of deaths was million over this period and it added small net gains through religious conversion into Islam According to a Pew Research Center survey by Muslims will remain the second world's largest religion and if current trends continue the number of Muslims will reach billion or
It was reported in that around British people convert to Islam every year with most of them being women According to an earlier census surveys found that there was an increase of conversions to Islam in the United Kingdom Many converts to Islam said that they suffered from hostility from their families According to a report by CNN Islam has drawn converts from all walks of life most notably African Americans Studies estimated about converting to Islam annually in the United States According to The New York Times an estimated of American Muslims are converts these converts are mostly African American According to The Huffington Post observers estimate that as many as Americans convert to Islam annually most of them are women and African Americans Experts say that conversions to Islam have doubled in the past years in France among the six million Muslims in France about are converts On the other hand according to Pew Research the number of American converts to Islam is roughly equal to the number of American Muslims who leave Islam and this is unlike other religions in the United States where the number of those who leave these religions is greater than the number of those who convert to it and most people who leave Islam become unaffiliated according to same study ex Muslims were more likely to be Christians compare to ex Hindus or ex Jews
Resurgent Islam is one of the most dynamic religious movements in the contemporary world The Vatican's yearbook of statistics revealed that for the first time Islam has outnumbered the Roman Catholics globally It stated that Islam has overtaken Roman Catholicism as the biggest single religious denomination in the world and stated that It is true that while Muslim families as is well known continue to make a lot of children Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer According to Foreign Policy high birth rates were cited as the reason for the Muslim population growth With children per woman Muslims have higher fertility levels than the world's overall population between and High fertility is a major driver of projected Muslim population growth around the world and in particular regions Between and with exception of the Middle East and North Africa Muslim fertility of any other region in the world was higher than the rate for the region as a whole While Muslim birth rates are expected to experience a decline it will remain above replacement level and higher fertility than the world's overall by As per U N 's global population forecasts as well as the
Pew Research projections over time fertility rates generally converge toward the
replacement level Globally Muslims were younger median age of than the overall population median age of as of While decline of Muslim birth rates in coming years have also been well documented According to David Ignatius there is major decline in Muslim fertility rates as pointed out by Nicholas Eberstadt Based on the data from Muslim majority countries and territories he found that Muslims' birth rate has significantly dropped for between and to while the global population decline was during that period It also stated that over a decline was found in Muslim countries and over a decline in Iran Oman the United Arab Emirates Algeria Bangladesh Tunisia Libya Albania Qatar and Kuwait
According to the religious forecast for by Pew Research Center between and modest net gains through religious conversion are expected for Muslims million and most of the net gains through religious conversion for Muslims found in the Sub Saharan Africa million The study also reveals that due to young age relatively high fertility rate among Muslims by there will be near parity between Muslims billion or of the population and Christians billion or possibly for the first time in history While both religions will grow but Muslim population will exceed the Christian population and by Muslim population will be more than the Christian population By the end of Muslims are expected to outnumber Christians According to the same study Muslims population growth is twice of world's overall population growth due to young age and relatively high fertility rate and as a result Muslims are projected to rise to of the world's population from
While the total Fertility Rate of Muslims in North America is children per woman in the to period well above the regional average and the replacement level Europe's Muslim population also has higher fertility than other religious groups in the region well above the regional average A new study of Population Reference Bureau by demographers Charles Westoff and Tomas Frejka suggests that the fertility gap between Muslims and non Muslims is shrinking and although the Muslim immigrants do have more children than other Europeans their fertility tends to decline over time often faster than among non Muslims
Generally there are few reports about how many people leave Islam in Muslim majority countries The main reason for this is the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries up to and including the death penalty for apostasy On the other hand the increasingly large ex Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented A Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood Equally Darren E Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non religious Muslims Quantitative research is lacking but he believes the European trend mirrors the American data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood and percent hold no religious identification Many Muslims who leave Islam face social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or other penalties According to Harvard University professor Robert D Putnam there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian American is slightly less religious than the average American According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from in to in according to a telephone survey around the Los Angeles region A June online survey found a much smaller percentage of Iranians stating they believe in Islam with half of those surveyed indicating they had lost their religious faith The poll conducted by the Netherlands based GAMAAN Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran using online polling to provide greater anonymity for respondents surveyed Iranians and found identified as Shia as Sunni and as Sufi Muslim A survey conducted by Pew Research Center in found that conversion has a negative impact on the growth of the Muslim population in Europe with roughly more people leaving Islam than converting into Islam between and
By an estimated million Muslims were living in Europe up from in By Muslims are expected to make up of Europe's population including an estimated million in the EU including million foreign born Muslim immigrants Islam is widely considered as the fastest growing religion in Europe due primarily to immigration and above average birth rates Between and the Muslim fertility rate in Europe was On the other hand the fertility rate in Europe as a whole was Pew study also reveals that Muslims are younger than other Europeans In the median age of Muslims throughout Europe was eight years younger than the median for all Europeans According to a religious forecast for by Pew Research Center conversion does not add significantly to the growth of the Muslim population in Europe according to the same study the net loss is due to religious switching
The Pew Research Center notes that the data that we have isn't pointing in the direction of 'Eurabia' at all and predicts that the percentage of Muslims is estimated to rise to in due to immigration and above average birth rates And only two western European countries France and Belgium will become around percent Muslim by According to Justin Va sse the fertility rate of Muslim immigrants declines with integration He further points out that Muslims are not a monolithic or cohesive group Most academics who have analysed the demographics dismiss the predictions that the EU will have Muslim majorities
It is completely reasonable to assume that the overall Muslim population in Europe will increase and Muslim citizens have and will have a significant impact on European life The prospect of a homogenous Muslim community per se or a Muslim majority in Europe is however out of the question Eric Kaufman of University of London denied the claims of Eurabia According to him Muslims will be a significant minority rather than majority in Europe and as per their projections for in the Western Europe there will be per cent Muslim population in high immigration countries such as Germany France and the UK Eric Kaufman also argue that the main reason why Islam is expanding along with other religions is not because of conversion to Islam but primarily to the nature of the religion as he calls it pro natal where Muslims tend to have more children Doug Saunders states that by Muslims and Non Muslims birth rates will be equal in Germany Greece Spain and Denmark without taking account of the Muslims immigration to these countries He also states that Muslims Non Muslims fertility rate difference will decrease from to and this different will continue to shrink as a result of which Muslims and non Muslims fertility rate will be identical by A survey conducted by Pew Research Center in found that conversion has a negative impact on the growth of the Muslim population in Europe with roughly more people leaving Islam than converting into Islam between and
It is often reported from various sources including the German domestic intelligence service Bundesnachrichtendienst that Salafism is the fastest growing Islamic movement in the world

According to Rodney Stark Islam was spread after military conquests after Arab armies began overtaking Christian regions from Syria to North Africa and Spain as well as Zoroastrian Buddhist and Hindu regions in Central Asia parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia via military invasions traders and Sufi missionaries According to some scholars the Jizya poll tax was the most important factor in the mass conversion to Islam the tax paid by all non Muslims Dhimmis which translated means protected persons in Islamic empires While other scholars oppose this belief because the jizya was not of great value and those who could not pay it were exempt from it such as Christians under the Ottoman Empire's authority Hindus and Buddhists under regime of Muslim invaders Coptic Christians under administration of the Muslim Arabs Zoroastrians living under Islamic rule in ancient Persia and also with Jewish communities in the medieval Arab world while some scholars indicate that some Muslim rulers in India did not consistently collect the jizya poll tax from Dhimmis Under Islamic law Muslims are required to pay Zakat one of the five pillars of Islam Muslims take out of their salaries and use the funds give to the needy Since non Muslims are not required to pay Zakat nor entitled to benefit from it they had to support their own poor and in addition they had to pay Jizya if they wanted the same protections the Muslims received
In India Islam was brought by various traders and rulers from Afghanistan and other places
According to other scholars many converted for a whole host of reasons the main statement of which was evangelization by Muslims though there were several instances where some were pressured to convert owing to internal violence and friction between the Christian and Muslim communities according to historian Philip Jenkins
However John L Esposito a scholar on the subject of Islam in The Oxford History of Islam states that the spread of Islam was often peaceful and sometimes even received favorably by Christians In a conference on religion at Yale University's The MacMillan Center Initiative on Religion Politics and Society which hosted a speech from Hugh Kennedy he stated forced conversions played little part in the history of the spread of the faith However the poll tax known as Jizyah may have played a part in converting people over to Islam but as Britannica notes The rate of taxation and methods of collection varied greatly from province to province and were greatly influenced by local pre Islamic customs and there were even cases when Muslims had the tax levied against them on top of Zakat Hugh Kennedy has also discussed the Jizyah issue and stated that Muslim governments discouraged conversion but were unable to prevent it
Today the majority of the world's Jewish population is concentrated in two countries the United States and Israel in the United States and Israel were collectively home to more than percent of the global Jewish population each country having approximately percent of the world's Jews Israel is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through natural population growth and extensive immigration although the Jewish populations of other countries in Europe and North America have recently increased through immigration In the Diaspora in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady but Orthodox and Haredi Jewish communities whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons have experienced rapid population growth
Orthodox and Conservative Judaism discourage proselytism to non Jews but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for them to reconnect to their Jewish roots Additionally while in principle Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith this position has not translated into active proselytism instead of taking the form of an effort to reach out to non Jewish spouses of intermarried couples Studies have shown that Haredi Jews population is rising rapidly due to the young age and very high fertility rate especially in Israel
The overall growth rate of Jews in Israel is annually The diaspora countries by contrast have low Jewish birth rates an increasingly elderly age composition and a negative balance of people leaving Judaism versus those joining
There is also a trend of Orthodox movements reaching out to secular Jews in order to give them a stronger Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past years there has been a trend known as the Baal teshuva movement for secular Jews to become more religiously observant though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown Additionally there is also a growing rate of conversion to Jews by Choice of gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews
Rates of interreligious marriage vary widely In the United States it is just under percent in the United Kingdom around percent in France around percent and in Australia and Mexico as low as percent In the United States only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate with Jewish religious practice The result is that most countries in the Diaspora have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live
In the core Jewish population reached its historical peak of million of the global population Because of the Holocaust the number had been reduced to million by the end of The population grew again to around million by the s but has since recorded near zero growth until around due to low fertility rates and to assimilation Since the world's Jewish population has been growing modestly at a rate of around in This increase primarily reflects the rapid growth of Haredi and some Orthodox sectors who are becoming a growing proportion of Jews

ARDA WCD statistics place the Bah Faith as currently the largest religious minority in Iran despite significant persecution and the overall Iranian diaspora Panama and Belize the second largest international religion in Bolivia Zambia and Papua New Guinea and the third largest international religion in Chad and Kenya In the religion was officially recognized in Indonesia and in addition to various countries it is the second largest religion in state of South Carolina a fact that despite its small size got some attention in Based on data from Bah s were the largest minority religion in counties out of the counties in the United States The countries with the fastest annual growth from to per annum where a country has over people were starting with the fastest Qatar UAE Bahrain Oman Kuwait Kazakhstan Western Sahara South Sudan and Niger ranging from growth per year up to

Zoroastrianism was founded during the early Persian Empire in the th century BCE by Zarathustra It served as the state religion of the ancient Iranian empires for more than a millennium from around BCE to CE but declined from the th century onwards following the Muslim conquest of Persia of Zoroastrianism declined as forced conversion increased with the rise of Islam From the th century onwards Zoroastrians emigrated to Gujarat India where they found asylum from unjust persecutions and since then are called Parsi since Indians called Persia Faras and hence named them Parsi Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians at around at most with the majority living in India Iran and North America their number has been thought to be declining
India has the world's largest Zoroastrian population who are called Parsis According to the Census of India there are Parsis in India According to the National Commission for Minorities there are a variety of causes that are responsible for this steady decline in the population of the community the most significant of which were childlessness and migration Demographic trends project that by the year the Parsis will number only The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a 'tribe' One fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest as of Parsis over the age of make up for of the community Only of the Parsi community are under years of age which translates to births per year per individuals Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India

Statistics on religious adherence are difficult to gather and often contradictory statistics for the change of religious adherence are even more so requiring multiple surveys separated by many years using the same data gathering rules This has only been achieved in rare cases and then only for particular countries such as the American Religious Identification Survey in the United States or census data from Australia which has included a voluntary religious question since
The World Religion Database WRD is a peer reviewed database of international religious statistics based on research conducted at the Institute on Culture Religion World Affairs at Boston University It is published by Brill and is the most comprehensive database of religious demographics available to scholars providing data for all of the world's countries Adherence data is largely compiled from census and surveys The database groups adherents into broadly defined categories Agnostics Atheists Bah s Buddhists Chinese folk religionists Christians Confucianists Daoists Ethnoreligionists Hindus Jains Jews Muslims New Religionists Shintoists Sikhs Spiritists and Zoroastrians The WRD is edited by demographers Todd M Johnson and Brian J Grim
Projections of future religious adherence are based on assumptions that trends total fertility rates life expectancy political climate conversion rates secularization etc will continue Such forecasts cannot be validated empirically and are contentious but are useful for comparison
Professor Eric Kaufmann whose academic specialization is how demography affects irreligion religion politics wrote in
According to the Pew Research Center published in religious conversion may have little impact on religious demographics between and Christianity is expected to lose a net of million adherents mostly to religiously unaffiliated while religiously unaffiliated are expected to gain million adherents Islam is expected to gain million followers while Buddhists and Jews are expected to lose million and million adherents respectively
The largest net gains for the religiously unaffiliated between and are expected in North America million Europe million Latin America million and the Asia Pacific region million Islam is projected to have a net gain of followers in Sub Saharan Africa million and Asia Pacific million but net loss of followers in North America million and Europe million Christianity is expected to have the largest net loss of followers between and in North America million Europe million Latin America and the Caribbean million sub Saharan Africa million and Asia Pacific million
Only in recent decades have surveys begun to measure changes in religious identity among individuals Religious switching is a sensitive topic in India and carries social and legal repercussions including the death penalty for apostasy in Muslim majority countries In China it is difficult to project rates at which Christianity Islam and Buddhism are gaining converts nor what are the retention rates among converts
These forecasts lack reliable data on religious conversion in China but according to media reports and expert assessments it is possible that the rapid growth of Christianity in China may maintain or even increase the current numerical advantage of Christianity as the largest religion in the world and may negatively affect the growth of the Religiously Unaffiliated This scenario Chinese scenario is based primarily on sensitivity tests
