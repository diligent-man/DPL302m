the witan literally wise men was the king s council in anglo saxon england from before the seventh century until the th century
it was composed of the leading magnates both ecclesiastic and secular and meetings of the council were sometimes called the witenagemot
its primary function was to advise the king on subjects such as promulgation of laws judicial judgments approval of charters transferring land settlement of disputes election of archbishops and bishops and other matters of major national importance
the witan also had to elect and approve the appointment of a new king
its membership was composed of the most important noblemen including ealdormen thegns and senior clergy
the terms witan and witenagemot are increasingly avoided by modern historians although few would go as far as geoffrey hindley who described witenagemot as an essentially victorian coinage
the blackwell encyclopaedia of anglo saxon england prefers king s council but adds that it was known in old english as the witan
john maddicott regarded the word witan with suspicion even though it is used in sources such as the anglo saxon chronicle
for these reasons in his study of the origins of the english parliament he generally preferred the more neutral word assembly
he described witena gemot as a rare th century usage with only nine pre conquest examples mainly in the crisis of
patrick wormald was also sceptical describing witena gemot as a word always rare and unattested before
henrietta leyser commented in that for decades historians avoided using the word witan for assemblies in case they were interpreted as proto parliaments and she went on recent historiography however has reintroduced the term since it is clear that it was generally accepted that certain kinds of business could only be transacted with a substantial number of the king s wise men in other words in the company of his witan she does not mention the term witanagemot
it is generally accepted that the english witenagemot had its origins in ancient germanic assemblies summoned to witness royal grants of land
yet whatever their status in the fourth and fifth centuries the nature of these assemblies in england was irrevocably changed when christianity was introduced circa a d
hereafter church and state were inseparably intertwined and this was reflected in the strong ecclesiastical element in the witan s membership and concerns records of decisions made by witan encompass ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions alike
anglo saxon society was based on reciprocal arrangements between the king and all those lower in the societal order
the principal conflicts of this period such as the norse invasions and the norman conquest all relied on troops raised by kings from ealdormen and thegns from whom they had received sworn fealty
as in later medieval times kings offered land in this era in exchange for military support in times of war and thus holding regular royal councils was means of ensuring nobles held input and viewpoints into defence needs and legislative planning and feasibility when demanded
the chronicles state that various kings of the period during the heptarchy and the later united england consulted their nobles and senior clergy to witness charters and collectively form laws for the common good
this is most noted perhaps by the chronicles concerning offa of mercia and alfred the great of wessex respectively and thelstan eadred edgar the peaceful thelred the unready and cnut the great of the eventual sole kingdom of the english
the chronicles in many instances cite numerous witans that were held for the aforementioned purposes and by the aforecited monarchs of the period
the purpose of the witan therefore was to ensure that those who were responsible for fighting wars and implementing laws more so in the case of ealdormen who held administrative control over counties and major towns cities could not only offer input but also forestall any potential rebellion from a lack of inclusion in this process
the exact nature of the witenagemot however remains essentially vague fluctuating and incoherent nevertheless there is much direct evidence of the witan s various activities
knowledge about who made up the witan and who was present at their meetings is provided mainly by lists of witnesses to charters or grants of land which were concocted at the witenagemots
reference to the witan s acta or official decisions are also preserved in law codes
the first recorded act of a witenagemot was the law code issued by king thelberht of kent ca
the earliest document which survives in sustained old english prose however the witan was certainly in existence long before this time
altogether about charters and law codes survive which attest to the workings of the various meetings of the witan of which there are around recorded
these documents clearly indicate that the witan was composed of the nation s highest echelon of both ecclesiastical and secular officers
present on the ecclesiastical side were archbishops bishops and abbots and occasionally also abbesses and priests on the secular side ealdormen or eorls in the latter centuries and thegns
members of the royal family were also present and the king presided over the entire body
in his investigation into anglo saxon institutions h
chadwick wrote i have not thought it necessary to discuss at length the nature of the powers possessed by the council i e the witenagemot for there can be little hope of arriving at any definite conclusions on this subject
indeed it seems at least doubtful whether the functions of the council were ever properly defined
similarly in his study of the witenagemots felix liebermann stated that its functions and power differ considerably at various times still he was able to give a relatively detailed description of its constitution from the time of ine the witan was composed of the aristocratic lite created by monarchy
the king generally indeed advised by the existing nobility conferred prelatures and ealdormanries with both of which a seat in the national assembly i e the witenagemot was legally or practically connected
members of the royal family ladies not excepted were present at many gemots
the king alone raised a man to the position of a gesith a thane a provincial or local reeve a court officer or a royal chaplain one of which titles seems to have been the indispensable qualification for a vote as no periodicity of the assembly was fixed the king determined when and where it was to meet for the most part choosing places under his immediate control he presided spoke first put his questions proposed his bills of proposed laws and finally dismissed the witan
the witan was noted by contemporary sources as having the singular power to ceosan to cyninge to choose the king from amongst the extended royal family
nevertheless at least until the th century royal succession generally followed the ordinary system of primogeniture the historian chadwick interpreted these facts as proof that the so called election of the king by the witan merely amounted to formal recognition of the deceased king s natural successor
but liebermann was generally less willing than chadwick to see the witan s significance as buried under the weight of the royal prerogative the influence of the king or at least of kingship on the constitution of the assembly seems therefore to have been immense
but on the other hand he the king was elected by the witan he could not depose the prelates or ealdormen who held their office for life nor indeed the hereditary thanes at any rate the king had to get on with the highest statesmen appointed by his predecessor though possibly disliked by him until death made a post vacant that he could fill with a relation or a favourite not however without having a certain regard to the wishes of the aristocracy
liebermann s more subtle position seems to be vindicated by testimony from abbot lfric of eynsham the leading homilist of the late tenth century who wrote no man can make himself king but the people has the choice to choose as king whom they please but after he is consecrated as king he then has dominion over the people and they cannot shake his yoke off their necks in addition to having a role in the election of english kings it is often held that the witenagemots had the power to depose an unpopular king
however there are only two occasions when this probably happened in and with the depositions of kings sigeberht of wessex and alhred of northumbria respectively
the witan s powers are illustrated by the following event
in the year king thelred ii thelred the unready fled the country from sweyn forkbeard who then had the witan proclaim him king
within a few weeks however sweyn died and thelred was called back to england by the witan
according to the anglo saxon chronicle the witan would only receive him back under the condition that he promise to rule better than he had
thelred did so and was reinstated as king of england
his nickname of the unr d or unready means ill advised indicating that contemporaries regarded those who sat in the witan as part responsible for the failure of his reign
though in general the witan were recognized as the king s closest advisors and policy makers various witan also operated in other capacities there are mentions of eodwitan people s witan angolcynnes witan england s witan and an anglo saxon and archbishop of york wulfstan ii wrote that it is incumbent on bishops that venerable witan always travel with them and dwell with them at least of the priesthood and that they may consult with them and who may be their counsellors at every time
even when summoned explicitly by kings the witenagemots did not represent the political will of all england before the unification of england in the tenth century separate witenagemots were convened by the kings of essex kent mercia northumbria sussex and wessex
indeed even after wessex became the dominant power in england supplanting the other kingdoms local witan continued to meet until as late as
in his work on alfred the great historian david sturdy argues that the witan did not embody modern notions of a national institution or a democratic body victorian notions of a national witan are crazy dreams without foundation myths of a democratic parliament that never was
witan would advise on the administration and organization of the kingdom dealing with issues such as taxation jurisprudence and both internal and external security
the witenagemot was in many ways different from the future institution of the parliament of england it had substantially different powers and some major limitations such as a lack of a fixed procedure schedule or meeting place
the witan could seek to prevent autocracy and carry on government during interregnums but ultimately the witenagemot answered to the king
it only assembled when he summoned it and its assembling without his approval could be considered treason
the witenagemot was more an advisory council
in some cases weak kings such as ethelred the unready were dependent on the witenagemot while others used it as simply a group of advisers
though no set date was ever in use witenagemots met at least once a year and commonly more often
there was no single seat of a witenagemot it being held where the king was who typically had no single fixed court either
witenagemots are known to have met in at least locations including amesbury calne cheddar gloucester london and winchester
the meeting places were often on royal estates but some witenagemots were convened in the open at prominent rocks hills meadows and famous trees
this arrangement ended after the norman invasion of england in when william i of england replaced the witenagemot with the curia regis or king s court
however in a sign of the witenagemot s enduring legacy the curia regis continued to be dubbed a witan by chroniclers until as late as the th century
the saxon myth claimed that the old saxon witan originated in a representative assembly of english landholders
the claim was that the original assembly was then subsequently disbanded by the norman invaders and later reappeared as the parliament of england
this idea was held across the thirteen colonies in north america in the years prior to the american revolution
among the believers were americans including thomas jefferson and jonathan mayhew
