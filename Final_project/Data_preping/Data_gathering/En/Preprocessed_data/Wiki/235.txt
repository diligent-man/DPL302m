His mother the queen is identified as Driza Th kar Tibetan Wylie 'bri bza' thod dkar ZYPY Zhisa T gar The date of his birth and of when he took the throne are not certain In Tibetan accounts it is generally accepted that he was born in an Ox year of the Tibetan calendar which means one of the following dates or CE He is thought to have ascended the throne at age thirteen twelve by Western reckoning by this reckoning c
There are difficulties with this position however and several earlier dates for the birth of Songtsen Gampo have been suggested including or
It is said that Songtsen Gampo was born at Gyama in Meldro a region to the northeast of modern Lhasa the son of the Yarlung king Namri Songtsen The book The Holder of the White Lotus says that it is believed that he was a manifestation of Avalokite vara of whom the Dalai Lamas are similarly believed to be a manifestation His identification as a cakravartin and incarnation of Avalokite vara began in earnest in the indigenous Buddhist literary histories of the th century
Some Dunhuang documents say that as well as his sister Sad mar kar or Sa tha ma kar Songtsen Gampo had a younger brother who was betrayed and died in a fire sometime after Apparently according to one partially damaged scroll from Dunhuang there was hostility between Sa tha ma kar and Songtsen Gampo's younger brother bTzan srong who as a result was forced to settle in gNyal an old district to the southeast of Yarlung and across the metres ft Yart Tra Pass which bordered on modern Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh in India Little if anything else is known about this brother

Songtsen Gampo had six consorts of whom four are considered native and two the well known ones foreign Highest ranking was Pogong Mongza Tricham Wylie pho gong mong bza' khri lcam also called Mongza the Mong clan wife who is said to have been the mother of Gungsong Gungtsen Other notable wives include a noble woman of the Western Xia known as Minyakza Western Xia wife Wylie mi nyag bza' and a noble woman from Zhangzhung Well known even today are his two 'foreign' wives the Nepali princess Bhrikuti the great lady the Nepalese wife Wylie bal mo bza' khri btsun ma as well as the Chinese Princess Wencheng Chinese Wife Wylie rgya mo bza' These two wives are credited in Tibetan tradition in playing crucial roles in the adoption of Buddhism in Tibet and held to explain the two great influences on Tibetan Buddhism Indo Nepali and Chinese
Songtsen Gampo's heir Gungsong Gungtsen died before his father so his son Mangsong Mangtsen took the throne His mother is sometimes said to have been a Chinese princess Wylie kong jo but this is thought to be highly unlikely His mother was most probably Mangmoje Trikar Wylie mang mo rje khri skar who is mentioned in the Genealogy found in the hidden library in the caves in Dunhuang the Tibetan Annals which list the names of the Tibetan emperors and the names of their consorts who bore future emperors and the clans they came from
Some accounts say that when Gungsong Gungtsen reached the age of thirteen twelve by Western reckoning his father Songtsen Gampo retired and he ruled for five years which could have been the period when Songtsen Gampo was working on the new constitution Gungsong Gungtsen is also said to have married 'A zha Mang mo rje when he was thirteen and they had a son Mangsong Mangtsen r CE Gungsong Gungtsen is said to have only ruled for five years when he died at eighteen His father Songtsen Gampo took the throne again Gungsong Gungtsen is said to have been buried at Donkhorda the site of the royal tombs to the left of the tomb of his grandfather Namri Songtsen gNam ri Srong btsan The dates for these events are very unclear
According to Tibetan tradition Songtsen Gampo was enthroned while still a minor as the thirty third king of the Yarlung Dynasty after his father was poisoned circa He is said to have been born in an unspecified Ox year and was years old by Western reckoning when he took the throne This accords with the tradition that the Yarlung kings took the throne when they were and supposedly old enough to ride a horse and rule the kingdom If these traditions are correct he was probably born in the Ox year CE The Old Book of Tang notes that he was still a minor when he succeeded to the throne

Songtsen Gampo is said to have sent his minister Thonmi Sambhota to India to devise a script for Classical Tibetan which led to the creation of the first Tibetan literary works and translations court records and a constitution After Thonmi Sambhota returned from India Songtsen Gampo stayed in a cave for three years with Thonmi Sambhota to learn whatever he had learned in India
Songtsen Gampo moved the seat of his newly unified kingdom from the Yarlung Valley to the Kyichu Valley site of the future city of Lhasa The site itself was originally a herding ground called Rasa the place of goats but the name was changed to Lhasa the place of gods on the king's founding of the Jokhang Temple The name Lhasa itself originally referred simply to the temple precincts
He is also credited with bringing many new cultural and technological advances to Tibet The Jiu Tangshu or Old Book of Tang states that after the defeat in of an Indian army in support of Chinese envoys the Chinese Emperor Gaozong a devout Buddhist gave him the title variously written Binwang Guest King or Zongwang Cloth tribute King and rolls of multicoloured silk in and granted the Tibetan king's request for silkworms' eggs mortars and presses for making wine and workmen to manufacture paper and ink

Songtsen Gampo was adept at diplomacy as well as on the field of battle The king's minister Nyang Mangpoje Shangnang with the aid of troops from Zhangzhung defeated the Sumpa in northeastern Tibet circa Tibetan Annals OTA l
Six years later c Myang Mang po rje Zhang shang was accused of treason and executed OTA l Richardson Minister Mgar srong rtsan succeeded him
The Jiu Tangshu records that the first ever embassy from Tibet arrived in China from Songtsen Gampo in the th Zhenguan year or CE Tang dynasty chronicles describe this as a tribute mission but it brought an ultimatum demanding a marriage alliance not subservient rituals After this demand was refused Tibet launched victorious military attacks against Tang affiliates in and
There is some confusion as to whether Central Tibet conquered Zhangzhung during the reign of Songtsen Gampo or in the reign of Trisong Detsen r until or CE The Old Book of Tang do seems to place these events clearly in the reign of Songtsen Gampo for they say that in Yangtong Zhangzhung and various Qiang peoples altogether submitted to him Following this he united with the country of Yangtong to defeat the 'Azha or Tuyuhun and then conquered two more tribes of Qiang before threatening Songzhou with an army of according to the Chinese more than men according to Tibetan sources He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and when refused attacked Songzhou According to the Tang annals he finally retreated and apologised and later the emperor granted his request but the histories written in Tibet all say that the Tibetan army defeated the Chinese and that the Tang emperor delivered a bride under threat of force
Early Tibetan accounts say that the Tibetan king and the king of Zhangzhung had married each other's sisters in a political alliance However the Tibetan wife of the king of the Zhangzhung complained of poor treatment by the king's principal wife War ensued and through the treachery of the Tibetan princess King Ligmikya of Zhangzhung while on his way to Sum ba Amdo province was ambushed and killed by King Srongtsen Gampo's soldiers As a consequence The Zhangzhung kingdom was annexed to Bod Central Tibet Thereafter the new kingdom born of the unification of Zhangzhung and Bod was known as Bod rGyal khab R A Stein places the conquest of Zhangzhung in
He next attacked and defeated the Tangut people who later formed the Western Xia state in CE the Bailang and Qiang tribes The Bailan people were bounded on the east by the Tanguts and on the west by the Domi They had been subject to the Chinese since
After a successful campaign against China in the frontier province of Songzhou in OTA l the Chinese emperor agreed to send a Chinese princess for Songtsen Gampo to marry
Around after Songtsen Gampo had a dispute with his younger brother Tsensong Wylie brtsan srong the younger brother was burnt to death by his own minister Khasek Wylie mkha' sregs possibly at the behest of the emperor
The Old Book of Tang records that when the king of Nipoluo Nepal the father of Licchavi king Naling Deva or Narendradeva died an uncle Yu sna kug ti Vishnagupta usurped the throne The Tibetans gave him refuge and reestablished him on his throne in that is how he became subject to Tibet
Sometime later but still within the Zhenguan period CE the Tibetans sent an envoy to present day Nepal where the king received him joyfully and later when a Tibetan mission was attacked in present day India by then minister of emperor Harshavardhan who had usurped the throne after emperor Harshavardhan's death around AD the Licchavi king came to their aid Songtsen Gampo married Princess Bhrikuti the daughter of King Licchavi
The Chinese Princess Wencheng niece of the Emperor Taizong of Tang left China in to marry Songtsen Gampo arriving the next year Peace between China and Tibet prevailed for the remainder of Songtsen Gampo's reign
Both wives are considered to have been incarnations of Tara Standard Tibetan Drolma the Goddess of Compassion the female aspect of Chenrezig where Dolma or Drolma Sanskrit means Tara As Sarat Chaundra explains the two wives of Emperor Srong btsan gambo are venerated under this name The Chinese princess is called Dol kar of 'the white Dolma ' and the Nepalese princess Dol jang or 'the green Dolma ' The latter is prayed to by women for fecundity
The Jiu Tangshu adds that Songtsen Gampo thereupon built a city for the Chinese princess and a palace for her within its walls According to Chinese sources As the princess disliked their custom of painting their faces red Lungstan Songtsen Gampo ordered his people to put a stop to the practice and it was no longer done He also discarded his felt and skins put on brocade and silk and gradually copied Chinese civilization He also sent the children of his chiefs and rich men to request admittance into the national school to be taught the classics and invited learned scholars from China to compose his official reports to the emperor
However according to Tibetologist John Powers such accounts of Tibet embracing Chinese culture through Wencheng are not corroborated by Tibetan histories
Songtsen Gampo's sister Sad mar kar was sent to marry Lig myi rhya the king of Zhangzhung However when the king refused to consummate the marriage she then helped Songtsen Gampo to defeat Lig myi rhya and incorporate the Zhangzhung of Western Tibet into the Tibetan Empire in thus gaining control of most if not all of the Tibetan plateau
