songtsen gampo tibetan wylie srong btsan sgam po zypy songz n gambo also songzan ganbu chinese pinyin s ngz n g nb was the rd tibetan king and founder of the tibetan empire and is traditionally credited with the introduction of buddhism to tibet influenced by his nepali consort bhrikuti of nepal s licchavi dynasty as well as with the unification of what had previously been several tibetan kingdoms
he is also regarded as responsible for the creation of the tibetan script and therefore the establishment of classical tibetan the language spoken in his region at the time as the literary language of tibet
his mother the queen is identified as driza th kar tibetan wylie bri bza thod dkar zypy zhisa t gar
the date of his birth and of when he took the throne are not certain
in tibetan accounts it is generally accepted that he was born in an ox year of the tibetan calendar which means one of the following dates or ce
he is thought to have ascended the throne at age thirteen twelve by western reckoning by this reckoning c
there are difficulties with this position however and several earlier dates for the birth of songtsen gampo have been suggested including or
it is said that songtsen gampo was born at gyama in meldro a region to the northeast of modern lhasa the son of the yarlung king namri songtsen
the book the holder of the white lotus says that it is believed that he was a manifestation of avalokite vara of whom the dalai lamas are similarly believed to be a manifestation
his identification as a cakravartin and incarnation of avalokite vara began in earnest in the indigenous buddhist literary histories of the th century
some dunhuang documents say that as well as his sister sad mar kar or sa tha ma kar songtsen gampo had a younger brother who was betrayed and died in a fire sometime after
apparently according to one partially damaged scroll from dunhuang there was hostility between sa tha ma kar and songtsen gampo s younger brother btzan srong who as a result was forced to settle in gnyal an old district to the southeast of yarlung and across the metres ft yart tra pass which bordered on modern bhutan and arunachal pradesh in india
little if anything else is known about this brother
songtsen gampo s mother the queen is identified as a member of the ts pong clan wylie tshe spong tibetan annals wylie tshes pong which played an important part in the unification of tibet
her name is recorded variously but is identified as driza t kar the bri wife named white skull woman wylie bri bza thod dkar tibetan annals wylie bring ma tog dgos
songtsen gampo had six consorts of whom four are considered native and two the well known ones foreign
highest ranking was pogong mongza tricham wylie pho gong mong bza khri lcam also called mongza the mong clan wife who is said to have been the mother of gungsong gungtsen
other notable wives include a noble woman of the western xia known as minyakza western xia wife wylie mi nyag bza and a noble woman from zhangzhung
well known even today are his two foreign wives the nepali princess bhrikuti the great lady the nepalese wife wylie bal mo bza khri btsun ma as well as the chinese princess wencheng chinese wife wylie rgya mo bza
these two wives are credited in tibetan tradition in playing crucial roles in the adoption of buddhism in tibet and held to explain the two great influences on tibetan buddhism indo nepali and chinese
songtsen gampo s heir gungsong gungtsen died before his father so his son mangsong mangtsen took the throne
his mother is sometimes said to have been a chinese princess wylie kong jo but this is thought to be highly unlikely
his mother was most probably mangmoje trikar wylie mang mo rje khri skar who is mentioned in the genealogy found in the hidden library in the caves in dunhuang the tibetan annals which list the names of the tibetan emperors and the names of their consorts who bore future emperors and the clans they came from
some accounts say that when gungsong gungtsen reached the age of thirteen twelve by western reckoning his father songtsen gampo retired and he ruled for five years which could have been the period when songtsen gampo was working on the new constitution
gungsong gungtsen is also said to have married a zha mang mo rje when he was thirteen and they had a son mangsong mangtsen r
gungsong gungtsen is said to have only ruled for five years when he died at eighteen
his father songtsen gampo took the throne again
gungsong gungtsen is said to have been buried at donkhorda the site of the royal tombs to the left of the tomb of his grandfather namri songtsen gnam ri srong btsan
the dates for these events are very unclear
according to tibetan tradition songtsen gampo was enthroned while still a minor as the thirty third king of the yarlung dynasty after his father was poisoned circa
he is said to have been born in an unspecified ox year and was years old by western reckoning when he took the throne
this accords with the tradition that the yarlung kings took the throne when they were and supposedly old enough to ride a horse and rule the kingdom
if these traditions are correct he was probably born in the ox year ce
the old book of tang notes that he was still a minor when he succeeded to the throne
the current head of the royal house of tibet and king in exile is a direct descendant of the dharma kings and crowned king of tibet by tenzin gyatso th dalai lama is his majesty king lhagyari trichen namgyal wangchuk
the king lives in the united states and travels the world speaking out for the human and religious rights of the tibetan people under the occupation of the people s republic of china
songtsen gampo is said to have sent his minister thonmi sambhota to india to devise a script for classical tibetan which led to the creation of the first tibetan literary works and translations court records and a constitution
after thonmi sambhota returned from india songtsen gampo stayed in a cave for three years with thonmi sambhota to learn whatever he had learned in india
songtsen gampo moved the seat of his newly unified kingdom from the yarlung valley to the kyichu valley site of the future city of lhasa
the site itself was originally a herding ground called rasa the place of goats but the name was changed to lhasa the place of gods on the king s founding of the jokhang temple
the name lhasa itself originally referred simply to the temple precincts
he is also credited with bringing many new cultural and technological advances to tibet
the jiu tangshu or old book of tang states that after the defeat in of an indian army in support of chinese envoys the chinese emperor gaozong a devout buddhist gave him the title variously written binwang guest king or zongwang cloth tribute king and rolls of multicoloured silk in and granted the tibetan king s request for silkworms eggs mortars and presses for making wine and workmen to manufacture paper and ink
traditional accounts say that during the reign of songtsen gampo examples of handicrafts and astrological systems were imported from china and the western xia the dharma and the art of writing came from india material wealth and treasures from the nepalis and the lands of the mongols while model laws and administration were imported from the uyghurs of the second turkic khaganate to the north
songtsen gampo is traditionally credited with being the first to bring buddhism to the tibetan people
he is also said to have built many buddhist temples including the jokhang in lhasa the city in which he is credited in one tradition with founding and establishing as his capital and tradruk temple in n dong
during his reign the translation of buddhist texts from sanskrit into tibetan began
songtsen gampo is considered to be the first of the three dharma kings wylie chos rgyal songtsen gampo trisong detsen and ralpacan who established buddhism in tibet
the inscription on the skar cung pillar erected by ralpacan who ruled c
reports that during songtsen gampo s reign shrines of the three jewels were established by building the temple of ra sa lhasa and so on the first edict of trisong detsen mentions a community of monks at this vihara
songtsen gampo was adept at diplomacy as well as on the field of battle
the king s minister nyang mangpoje shangnang with the aid of troops from zhangzhung defeated the sumpa in northeastern tibet circa tibetan annals ota l
six years later c
myang mang po rje zhang shang was accused of treason and executed ota l
richardson
minister mgar srong rtsan succeeded him
the jiu tangshu records that the first ever embassy from tibet arrived in china from songtsen gampo in the th zhenguan year or ce
tang dynasty chronicles describe this as a tribute mission but it brought an ultimatum demanding a marriage alliance not subservient rituals
after this demand was refused tibet launched victorious military attacks against tang affiliates in and
there is some confusion as to whether central tibet conquered zhangzhung during the reign of songtsen gampo or in the reign of trisong detsen r
until or ce
the old book of tang do seems to place these events clearly in the reign of songtsen gampo for they say that in yangtong zhangzhung and various qiang peoples altogether submitted to him following this he united with the country of yangtong to defeat the azha or tuyuhun and then conquered two more tribes of qiang before threatening songzhou with an army of according to the chinese more than men according to tibetan sources
he then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the chinese emperor to ask for a chinese princess in marriage and when refused attacked songzhou
according to the tang annals he finally retreated and apologised and later the emperor granted his request but the histories written in tibet all say that the tibetan army defeated the chinese and that the tang emperor delivered a bride under threat of force
early tibetan accounts say that the tibetan king and the king of zhangzhung had married each other s sisters in a political alliance
however the tibetan wife of the king of the zhangzhung complained of poor treatment by the king s principal wife
war ensued and through the treachery of the tibetan princess king ligmikya of zhangzhung while on his way to sum ba amdo province was ambushed and killed by king srongtsen gampo s soldiers
as a consequence the zhangzhung kingdom was annexed to bod central tibet
thereafter the new kingdom born of the unification of zhangzhung and bod was known as bod rgyal khab r
stein places the conquest of zhangzhung in
he next attacked and defeated the tangut people who later formed the western xia state in ce the bailang and qiang tribes
the bailan people were bounded on the east by the tanguts and on the west by the domi
they had been subject to the chinese since
after a successful campaign against china in the frontier province of songzhou in ota l
the chinese emperor agreed to send a chinese princess for songtsen gampo to marry
around after songtsen gampo had a dispute with his younger brother tsensong wylie brtsan srong the younger brother was burnt to death by his own minister khasek wylie mkha sregs possibly at the behest of the emperor
the old book of tang records that when the king of nipoluo nepal the father of licchavi king naling deva or narendradeva died an uncle yu sna kug ti vishnagupta usurped the throne
the tibetans gave him refuge and reestablished him on his throne in that is how he became subject to tibet
sometime later but still within the zhenguan period ce the tibetans sent an envoy to present day nepal where the king received him joyfully and later when a tibetan mission was attacked in present day india by then minister of emperor harshavardhan who had usurped the throne after emperor harshavardhan s death around ad the licchavi king came to their aid
songtsen gampo married princess bhrikuti the daughter of king licchavi
the chinese princess wencheng niece of the emperor taizong of tang left china in to marry songtsen gampo arriving the next year
peace between china and tibet prevailed for the remainder of songtsen gampo s reign
both wives are considered to have been incarnations of tara standard tibetan drolma the goddess of compassion the female aspect of chenrezig where dolma or drolma sanskrit means tara
as sarat chaundra explains the two wives of emperor srong btsan gambo are venerated under this name
the chinese princess is called dol kar of the white dolma and the nepalese princess dol jang or the green dolma the latter is prayed to by women for fecundity
the jiu tangshu adds that songtsen gampo thereupon built a city for the chinese princess and a palace for her within its walls
according to chinese sources as the princess disliked their custom of painting their faces red lungstan songtsen gampo ordered his people to put a stop to the practice and it was no longer done
he also discarded his felt and skins put on brocade and silk and gradually copied chinese civilization
he also sent the children of his chiefs and rich men to request admittance into the national school to be taught the classics and invited learned scholars from china to compose his official reports to the emperor
however according to tibetologist john powers such accounts of tibet embracing chinese culture through wencheng are not corroborated by tibetan histories
songtsen gampo s sister sad mar kar was sent to marry lig myi rhya the king of zhangzhung
however when the king refused to consummate the marriage she then helped songtsen gampo to defeat lig myi rhya and incorporate the zhangzhung of western tibet into the tibetan empire in thus gaining control of most if not all of the tibetan plateau
following the visit by the famous chinese pilgrim monk xuanzang to the court of harsha the king ruling magadha harsha sent a mission to china which in turn responded by sending an embassy consisting of li yibiao and wang xuance who probably travelled through tibet and whose journey is commemorated in inscriptions at rajagrha modern rajgir and bodhgaya
wang xuanze made a second journey in but he was badly treated by harsha s usurper his minister arjuna and harsha s mission plundered
this elicited a response from tibetan and nepalese licchavi troops who together soundly defeated arjuna s forces
in the king of xihai jun was conferred upon songtsen gampo by tang gaozong the emperor of the tang dynasty
according to the tibetan annals songtsen gampo must have died in and in the tang emperor sent an envoy with a letter of mourning and condolences
his tomb is in the chongyas valley near yalung metres high and metres long
