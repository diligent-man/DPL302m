the roman imperial cult identified emperors and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority auctoritas of the roman state
its framework was based on roman and greek precedents and was formulated during the early principate of augustus
it was rapidly established throughout the empire and its provinces with marked local variations in its reception and expression
augustus s reforms transformed rome s republican system of government to a de facto monarchy couched in traditional roman practices and republican values
the princeps emperor was expected to balance the interests of the roman military senate and people and to maintain peace security and prosperity throughout an ethnically diverse empire
the official offer of cultus to a living emperor acknowledged his office and rule as divinely approved and constitutional his principate should therefore demonstrate pious respect for traditional republican deities and mores
a deceased emperor held worthy of the honor could be voted a state divinity divus plural divi by the senate and elevated as such in an act of apotheosis
the granting of apotheosis served religious political and moral judgment on imperial rulers and allowed living emperors to associate themselves with a well regarded lineage of imperial divi from which unpopular or unworthy predecessors were excluded
this proved a useful instrument to vespasian in his establishment of the flavian imperial dynasty following the death of nero and civil war and to septimius in his consolidation of the severan dynasty after the assassination of commodus
the imperial cult was inseparable from that of rome s official deities whose cult was essential to rome s survival and whose neglect was therefore treasonous
traditional cult was a focus of imperial revivalist legislation under decius and diocletian
it therefore became a focus of theological and political debate during the ascendancy of christianity under constantine i
the emperor julian failed to reverse the declining support for rome s official religious practices theodosius i adopted christianity as rome s state religion
rome s traditional gods and imperial cult were officially abandoned
however many of the rites practices and status distinctions that characterized the cult to emperors were perpetuated in the theology and politics of the christianized empire
for five centuries the roman republic did not give worship to any historic figure or any living man although surrounded by divine and semi divine monarchies
rome s legendary kings had been its masters with their removal republican romans could identify romulus the founder of the city with the god quirinus and still retain republican liberty
similarly rome s ancestor hero aeneas was worshipped as jupiter indiges
the romans worshipped several gods and demi gods who had been human and knew the theory that all the gods had originated as human beings yet republican traditions mos maiorum were staunchly conservative and anti monarchic
the aristocrats who held almost all roman magistracies and thereby occupied almost all of the senate acknowledged no human as their inherent superior
no citizen living or dead was officially regarded as divine but the honors awarded by the state crowns garlands statues thrones processions were also suitable to the gods and tinged with divinity indeed when the emperors were later given state worship it was done by a decree of the senate phrased like any other honor
among the highest of honors was the triumph
when a general was acclaimed imperator by his troops the senate would then choose whether to award him a triumph a parade to the capitol in which the triumphator displayed his captives and spoils of war in the company of his troops by law all were unarmed
the triumphator rode in a chariot bearing divine emblems in a manner supposed to be inherited from the ancient kings of rome and ended by dedicating his victory to jupiter capitolinus
some scholars have viewed the triumphator as impersonating or even becoming a king or a god or both for the day but the circumstances of triumphal award and subsequent rites also functioned to limit his status
whatever his personal ambitions his victory and his triumph alike served the roman senate people and gods and were recognised only through their consent
in private life however tradition required that some human beings be treated as more or less divine cult was due from familial inferiors to their superiors
every head of household embodied the genius the generative principle and guardian spirit of his ancestors which others might worship and by which his family and slaves took oaths his wife had a juno
a client could call his patron jupiter on earth
the dead collectively and individually were gods of the underworld or afterlife dii manes
a letter has survived from cornelia the mother of the gracchi expecting that when she was dead her sons would venerate her as deus parens a parental or a nurturing divinity such piety was expected from any dutiful son
a prominent clan might claim divine influence and quasi divine honors for its leader
death masks imagines were made for all notable romans and were displayed in the atria of their houses they were used to represent their ghostly presence at family funerals
the mask of scipio africanus cornelia s father and victor over hannibal was stored in the temple of jupiter his epitaph by ennius said that he had ascended to heaven
a tradition arose in the centuries after his death that africanus had been inspired by prophetic dreams and was himself the son of jupiter
there are several cases of unofficial cult directed at men viewed as saviors military or political
in further spain in the s bc loyalist romans greeted the proconsul metellus pius as a savior burning incense as if to a god for his efforts to quash the lusitanian rebellion led by the roman sertorius a member of the faction which called itself men of the people populares
this celebration in spain featured a lavish banquet with local and imported delicacies and a mechanical statue of victory to crown metellus who wore extralegally a triumphator s toga picta for the occasion
these festivities were organized by the quaestor gaius urbinus but were not acts of the state
metellus liked all this but his older and pious veteres et sanctos contemporaries thought it arrogant and intolerable
after the land reformers tiberius and gaius gracchus were both murdered by their opponents their supporters fell down and offered daily sacrifice at the statues of the gracchi as though they were visiting the shrines of the gods
after gaius marius defeated the teutones private citizens would offer food and drink to him alongside their household gods he was called the third founder of rome after romulus and camillus
in bc offerings of incense and wine were made at crossroad shrines to statues of the still living marius gratidianus the nephew of the elder marius who was wildly popular in his own right in large part for monetary reforms that eased an economic crisis in rome during his praetorship
when the romans began to dominate large parts of the greek world rome s senior representatives there were given the same divine honours as were hellenistic rulers
this was a well established method for greek city states to declare their allegiance to an outside power such a cult committed the city to obey and respect the king as they obeyed and respected apollo or any of the other gods
the cities of ionia worshipped the spartan general lysander when he personally dominated greece immediately following the peloponnesian war according to plutarch this was the first instance of ruler cult in greek history
there were similar instances of divine cult to humans in the same century although some rulers like agesilaus declined it
clearchus tyrant of heraclea dressed up like zeus and claimed godhood this did not stop the heracleots from assassinating him
isocrates said of philip ii of macedon that after he conquered the persian empire there would be nothing for him to attain but to become a god the city of amphipolis and a private society at athens worshiped him even without this conquest he himself set out his statue dressed as a god as the thirteenth of the twelve olympians
but it was philip s son alexander the great who made the divinity of kings standard practice among the greeks
the egyptians accepted him as pharaoh and therefore divine after he drove the persians out of egypt other nations received him as their traditional divine or quasi divine ruler as he acquired them
in bc he sent word to the greek cities that they should also make him a god they did so with marked indifference which did not stop them from rebelling when they heard of his death next year
his immediate successors the diadochi offered sacrifices to alexander and made themselves gods even before they claimed to be kings they put their own portraits on the coinage whereas the greeks had always reserved this for a god or for an emblem of the city
when the athenians allied with demetrius poliorcetes eighteen years after the deification of alexander they lodged him in the parthenon with athena and sang a hymn extolling him as a present god who heard them as the other gods did not
euhemerus a contemporary of alexander wrote a fictitious history of the world which showed zeus and the other established gods of greece as mortal men who had made themselves into gods in the same way ennius appears to have translated this into latin some two centuries later in scipio africanus time
the ptolemies of egypt and the seleucids claimed godhood as long as they lasted they may have been influenced in this by the persian and egyptian traditions of divine kings although the ptolemies had separate cults in egyptian polytheism as pharaoh and in the greek
not all greek dynasties made the same claims the descendants of demetrius who were kings of macedon and dominated the mainland of greece did not claim godhead or worship alexander cf
ptolemaic cult of alexander the great
the roman magistrates who conquered the greek world were fitted into this tradition games were set up in honor of m
claudius marcellus when he conquered sicily at the end of the second punic war as the olympian games were for zeus they were kept up for a century and a half until another roman governor abolished them to make way for his own honors
when t
quinctius flamininus extended roman influence to greece proper temples were built for him and cities placed his portrait on their coinage he called himself godlike isotheos in an inscription at delphi but not in latin or at rome
the greeks also devised a goddess roma not worshipped at rome who was worshipped with flamininus their joint cult is attested in bc she would become a symbol of idealised romanitas in the later roman provinces and a continuing link whereas a marcellus or flamininus might only hold power for a couple years
when king prusias i of bithynia was granted an interview by the roman senate he prostrated himself and addressed them as saviour gods which would have been etiquette at his own court livy was shocked by polybius account of this and insists that there is no roman source it ever happened
worship and temples appear to have been routinely offered by greeks to their roman governors with varied reactions
cicero declined a temple proposed by the city officials of roman asia to his brother and himself while the latter was proconsul to avoid jealousy from other romans when cicero himself was governor of cilicia he claimed to have accepted no statues shrines or chariots
his predecessor appius claudius pulcher was so pleased however when the cilicians built a temple to him that when it was not finished at the end of claudius year in office claudius wrote cicero to make sure it was done and complaining that cicero was not active enough in the matter
the romans and the greeks gave religious reverence to and for human beings in ways that did not make the recipients gods these made the first greek apotheoses easier
similar middle forms appeared as augustus approached official divinity
the greeks did not consider the dead to be gods but they did pay them homage and give them sacrifices using different rituals than those for the gods of olympus
the greeks called the extraordinary dead founders of cities and the like heroes in the simplest form hero cult was the burial and the memorials which any respectable greek family gave their dead but paid for by their city in perpetuity
most heroes were the figures of ancient legend but some were historical the athenians revered harmodius and aristogeiton as heroes as saviours of athens from tyranny also collectively those who fell at the battle of marathon
statesmen did not generally become heroes but sophocles was the hero dexion the receiver not as a playwright nor a general but because when the athenians took asclepius cult during the peloponnesian war sophocles housed an image of asclepius until a shrine could be built
the athenian leader hagnon founded amphipolis shortly before the peloponnesian war thirteen years later while hagnon was still alive the spartan general brasidas liberated it from the athenian empire and was fatally wounded in the process
the amphipolitans buried him as a hero declaring him the second founder of the city and erased hagnon s honors as much as they could
the greeks also honored founders of cities while they were still alive like hagnon
this could also be extended to men who did equally important things during the period when dion ruled in syracuse the syracusans gave him heroic honors for suppressing the tyrants and repeated this for timoleon these could also be described as worshipping his good spirit agathos daimon agathodaemon every greek had an agathodaemon and the greek equivalent of a toast was offered to one s agathodaemon
timoleon was called savior he set up a shrine to fortune automatia in his house and his birthday the festival of his daimon became a public holiday
other men might claim divine favor by having a patron among the gods so alcibiades may have had both eros and cybele as patrons and clearchus of heraclea claimed to be son of zeus
alexander claimed the patronage of dionysus and other gods and heroes he held a banquet at bactra which combined the toast to his agathos daimon and libations to dionysus who was present within alexander and therefore the celebrants saluted alexander rather than the hearth and altar as they would have done for a toast
it was not always easy to distinguish between heroic honors veneration for a man s good spirit worship of his patron deity worship of the fortune of a city he founded and worship of the man himself
one might slide into another in egypt there was a cult of alexander as god and as founder of alexandria ptolemy i soter had a separate cult as founder of ptolemais which presumably worshipped his daimon and then gave him heroic honors but in his son s reign the priests of alexander also worshipped ptolemy and berenice as the savior gods theoi soteres
finally a man might like philip ii assume some prerogatives of godhood and not others
the first attalid kings of pergamum were not gods and supported a cult of dionysus cathegemon as their ancestor they put the picture of philetaerus the first prince on the coins rather than their own
eventually like the seleucids they acquired an eponymous priest and put themselves on the coinage but they still were not called gods before their deaths
pergamum was usually allied with rome and this may have influenced the eventual roman practice
in the last decades of the roman republic its leaders regularly assumed extra constitutional powers
the mos majorum had required that magistrates hold office collectively and for short periods there were two consuls even colonies were founded by boards of three men but these new leaders held power by themselves and often for years
the same men were often given extraordinary honors
triumphs grew ever more splendid marius and sulla the rival leaders in rome s first civil war each founded cities which they named after themselves sulla had annual games in his honor at rome itself bearing his name the unofficial worship of marius is above
in the next generation pompey was allowed to wear his triumphal ornaments whenever he went to the games at the circus
such men also claimed a special relationship to the gods sulla s patron was venus felix and at the height of his power he added felix to his own name his opponent marius believed he had a destiny and that no ordinary man might kill him
pompey also claimed venus personal favour and built her a temple
but the first roman to become a god as part of aiming at monarchy was julius caesar
caesar could claim personal ties to the gods both by descent and by office
he was from the gens julia whose members contended to be descended from aeneas and his mother venus
in his eulogy for his aunt julia caesar also indirectly claimed to be descended from ancus marcius and the kings of rome and so from mars
moreover when he was a teenager marius had named him flamen dialis the special priest of jupiter
sulla had cancelled this appointment however relatively early in his career caesar had become pontifex maximus the chief priest of rome who fulfilled most of the religious duties of the ancient kings
he had spent his twenties in the divine monarchies of the eastern mediterranean and was intimately familiar with bithynia
caesar made use of these connections in his rise to power but not more than his rivals would have or more than his other advantages
when he spoke at the funeral of his aunt julia in bc julius caesar spoke of her descent from the roman kings and implied his own but he also reminded his audience she had been marius wife and by implication that he was one of the few surviving marians
when however he defeated his rivals in bc and assumed full personal control of the roman state he asserted more
during the roman civil war since bc he had returned to the eastern mediterranean where he had been called god and savior and been familiar with the ptolemaic egyptian monarchy of cleopatra called cleopatra thea because of the weight she placed on her own divinity
also he had a new senate to deal with
most of the more resolute defenders of the senate had joined with pompey and one way or another they were not sitting in the senate
caesar had replaced them with his own partisans few of whom were committed to the old roman methods some of them were not even from italy
it was rumoured that caesar intended a despotic removal of power and wealth from rome eastwards perhaps to alexandria or ilium troy
during the civil war he had declared venus his patron goddess he vowed to erect a temple for venus victrix if she granted him the battle of pharsalia but he had built it in bc to venus genetrix which epithet combined her aspects as his ancestress the mother of the roman people and the goddess invoked in the philosophical poem de rerum natura
the new senate had also put up a statue of caesar with an inscription declaring him a demi god but he had it effaced as not the claim he wished to make
granted the same extension of rights to triumphal dress as pompey had been given caesar took to wearing his triumphal head wreath wherever and whenever excusing this as a cover for his baldness
he may also have publicly worn the red boots and the toga picta painted purple toga usually reserved to a triumphing general for the day of his triumph a costume also associated with the rex sacrorum the priestly king of the sacred rites of rome s monarchic era later the pontifex maximus the monte albano kings and possibly the statue of jupiter capitolinus
when the news of his final victory at the battle of munda reached rome the parilia the games commemorating the founding of the city were to be held the next day they were rededicated to caesar as if he were founder
statues were set up to caesar s liberty and to caesar himself as unconquered god he was accorded a house at public expense which was built like a temple his image was paraded with those of the gods his portrait was put on the coins the first time a living man had appeared on roman coinage
early in bc he was called parens patriae father of the fatherland legal oaths were taken by his genius his birthday was made a public festival the month quinctilis was renamed july in his honor as june was named for juno
at last a special priest a flamen was ordained for him the first was to be mark antony caesar s adjutant then consul
to be served by a flamen would rank caesar not only as divine but as an equal of quirinus jupiter and mars
in cicero s hostile account the living caesar s honours in rome were already and unambiguously those of a full blown god deus
caesar s name as a living divinity not as yet ratified by senatorial vote was divus julius or perhaps jupiter julius divus at that time was a slightly archaic form of deus suitable for poetry implying some association with the bright heavens
a statue of him was erected next to the statues of rome s ancient kings with this he seemed set to make himself king of rome in the hellenistic style as soon as he came back from the expedition to parthia he was planning but he was betrayed and killed in the senate on march bc
an angry grief stricken crowd gathered in the roman forum to see his corpse and hear mark antony s funeral oration
antony appealed to caesar s divinity and vowed vengeance on his killers
a fervent popular cult to divus julius followed
it was forcefully suppressed but the senate soon succumbed to caesarian pressure and confirmed caesar as a divus of the roman state
a comet interpreted as caesar s soul in heaven was named the julian star sidus iulium and in bc with the full consent of the senate and people of rome caesar s young heir his great nephew octavian held ceremonial apotheosis for his adoptive father
in bc antony took up his appointment as flamen of the divus julius
provincial cult centres caesarea to the divus julius were founded in caesarian colonies such as corinth
antony s loyalty to his late patron did not extend to caesar s heir but in the last significant act of the long drawn civil war on august bc octavian defeated antony at actium
in bc the koina of asia and bithynia requested permission to worship octavian as their deliverer or saviour
this was by no means a novel request but it placed octavian in a difficult position
he must satisfy popularist and traditionalist expectations and these could be notoriously incompatible
marius gratidianus s popular support and cult had ended in his public and spectacular death in bc at the hands of his enemies in the senate likewise caesar s murder now marked an hubristic connection between living divinity and death
octavian had to respect the overtures of his eastern allies acknowledge the nature and intent of hellenic honours and formalise his own pre eminence among any possible rivals he must also avoid a potentially fatal identification in rome as a monarchic deistic aspirant
it was decided that cult honours to him could be jointly offered to dea roma at cult centres to be built at pergamum and nicomedia
provincials who were also roman citizens were not to worship the living emperor but might worship dea roma and the divus julius at precincts in ephesus and nicaea
in bc octavian dedicated the temple of the divus julius at the site of caesar s cremation
not only had he dutifully legally and officially honoured his adoptive father as a divus of the roman state
he had come into being through the julian star and was therefore the divi filius son of the divinity
but where caesar had failed octavian had succeeded he had restored the pax deorum lit
peace of the gods and re founded rome through august augury
in bc he was voted and accepted the elevated title of augustus
augustus appeared to claim nothing for himself and innovate nothing even the cult to the divus julius had a respectable antecedent in the traditional cult to di parentes
his unique and still traditional position within the senate as princeps or primus inter pares first among equals offered a curb to the ambitions and rivalries that had led to the recent civil wars
as censor and pontifex maximus he was morally obliged to renew the mos maiores by the will of the gods and the senate and people of rome senatus populusque romanus
as tribune he encouraged generous public spending and as princeps of the senate he discouraged ambitious extravagance
he disbanded the remnants of the civil war armies to form new legions and a personal imperial guard the praetorian guard the patricians who still clung to the upper echelons of political military and priestly power were gradually replaced from a vast empire wide reserve of ambitious and talented equestrians
for the first time senatorial status became heritable
ordinary citizens could circumvent the complex hierarchic bureaucracy of the state and appeal directly to the emperor as if to a private citizen
the emperor s name and image were ubiquitous on state coinage and on the streets within and upon the temples of the gods and particularly in the courts and offices of the civil and military administration
oaths were sworn in his name with his image as witness
his official res gestae achievements included his repair of temples in bc alone the founding or repair of others in rome during his lifetime and the overhauling or foundation of civic amenities including a new road water supplies senate house and theatres
above all his military pre eminence had brought an enduring and sacred peace which earned him the permanent title of imperator and made the triumph an imperial privilege
he seems to have managed all this within due process of law through a combination of personal brio cheerfully veiled threats and self deprecation as just another senator
in rome it was enough that the office munificence auctoritas and gens of augustus were identified with every possible legal religious and social institution of the city
should foreigners or private citizens wish to honour him as something more that was their prerogative within moderation his acknowledgment of their loyalty demonstrated his own moral responsibility and generosity his imperial revenue funded temples amphitheatres theatres baths festivals and government
this unitary principle laid the foundations for what is now known as imperial cult which would be expressed in many different forms and emphases throughout the multicultural empire
in the eastern provinces cultural precedent ensured a rapid and geographically widespread dissemination of cult extending as far as the augustan military settlement at modern day najran
considered as a whole these provinces present the empire s broadest and most complex syntheses of imperial and native cult funded through private and public initiatives and ranging from the god like honours due a living patron to what harland interprets as privately funded communal mystery rites
the greek cities of roman asia competed for the privilege of building high status imperial cult centres neocorates
ephesus and sardis ancient rivals had two apiece until the early rd century ad when ephesus was allowed an additional temple to the reigning emperor caracalla
when he died the city lost its brief celebrated advantage through a religious technicality
the eastern provinces offer some of the clearest material evidence for the imperial domus and familia as official models of divine virtue and moral propriety
centres including pergamum lesbos and cyprus offered cult honours to augustus and the empress livia the cypriot calendar honoured the entire augustan familia by dedicating a month each and presumably cult practise to imperial family members their ancestral deities and some of the major gods of the romano greek pantheon
coin evidence links thea livia with hera and demeter and julia the elder with venus genetrix aphrodite
in athens livia and julia shared cult honour with hestia equivalent to vesta and the name of gaius was linked to ares mars
these eastern connections were made within augustus lifetime livia was not officially consecrated in rome until some time after her death
eastern imperial cult had a life of its own
around in the reign of the emperor probus and just before the outbreak of the diocletianic persecution part of the luxor temple was converted to an imperial cult chapel
the western provinces were only recently latinised following caesar s gallic wars and most fell outside the graeco roman cultural ambit
there were exceptions polybius mentions a past benefactor of new carthage in republican iberia said to have been offered divine honours
in bc roman citizens in iberia burned incense to metellus pius as more than mortal in hope of his victory against sertorius
otherwise the west offered no native traditions of monarchic divinity or political parallels to the greek koina to absorb the imperial cult as a romanising agency
the western provincial concilia emerged as direct creations of the imperial cult which recruited existing local military political and religious traditions to a roman model
this required only the willingness of barbarian elites to romanise themselves and their communities
the first known western regional cults to augustus were established with his permission around bc in north western celtic spain and named arae sestianae after their military founder l
sestius quirinalis albinianus
soon after in either bc or bc the first provincial imperial cult centre in the west was founded at lugdunum by drusus as a focus for his new tripartite administrative division of gallia comata
lugdunum set the type for official western cult as a form of roman provincial identity parceled into the establishment of military administrative centres
these were strategically located within the unstable barbarian western provinces of the new principate and inaugurated by military commanders who were in all but one instance members of the imperial family
the first priest of the ara altar at lugdunum s great imperial cult complex was caius julius vercondaridubnus a gaul of the provincial elite given roman citizenship and entitled by his priestly office to participate in the local government of his provincial concilium
though not leading to senatorial status and almost certainly an annually elected office unlike the traditional lifetime priesthoods of roman flamines priesthood in imperial provinces thus offered a provincial equivalent to the traditional roman cursus honorum
the rejection of cult spurned romanitas priesthood and citizenship in ad segimundus imperial cult priest of what would later be known as colonia claudia ara agrippinensium sited at modern cologne in germany cast off or destroyed his priestly regalia to join the rebellion of his kinsman arminius
in the early principate an altar inscribed marazgu aug usto sac rum dedicated to marazgu augustus identifies a local ancient libyan berber deity with the supreme power of augustus
in the senatorial province of africa proconsularis altars to the dii magifie augusti attest according to potter a deity who was simultaneously local and universal rather than one whose local identity was subsumed or absorbed by an imperial divus or deity
two temples are attested to roma and the divus augustus one dedicated under tiberius at leptis magna and another julio claudian at mactar
a third at carthage was dedicated to the gens augusta in the very early empire
even as he prepared his adopted son tiberius for the role of princeps and recommended him to the senate as a worthy successor augustus seems to have doubted the propriety of dynastic imperium this however was probably his only feasible course
when augustus died he was voted a divus by the senate and his body was cremated in a sumptuous funeral his soul was said to have ascended to the heavens to join his adoptive father among the olympians his ashes were deposited in the imperial mausoleum which tactfully identified him and later his descendants by his imperial names rather than as divus
after augustus the only new cults to roman officials are those connected to the imperial household
on his death the senate debated and passed a lex de imperio which voted tiberius princeps through his proven merit in office and awarded him the honorific augustus as name and title
tiberius accepted his position and title as emperor with apparent reluctance
though he proved a capable and efficient administrator he could not match his predecessor s extraordinary energy and charisma
roman historians described him as morose and mistrustful
with a self deprecation that may have been entirely genuine he encouraged the cult to his father and discouraged his own
after much wrangling he allowed a single temple in smyrna to himself and the genius of the senate in ad eleven cities had competed with some vehemence and even violence for the honour
his lack of personal auctoritas allowed increasing praetorian influence over the imperial house the senate and through it the state
in ad his praetorian prefect sejanus by now a virtual co ruler was implicated in the death of tiberius son and heir apparent drusus and was executed as a public enemy
in umbria the imperial cult priest sevir augustalis memorialised the providence of tiberius caesar augustus born for the eternity of the roman name upon the removal of that most pernicious enemy of the roman people
in crete thanks were given to the numen and foresight of tiberius caesar augustus and the senate in foiling the conspiracy but at his death the senate and his heir caligula chose not to officially deify him
caligula s rule exposed the legal and moral contradictions of the augustan republic
to legalise his succession the senate was compelled to constitutionally define his role but the rites and sacrifices to the living genius of the emperor already acknowledged his constitutionally unlimited powers
the princeps played the role of primus inter pares only through personal self restraint and decorum
it became evident that caligula had little of either
he seems to have taken the cult of his own genius very seriously and is said to have enjoyed acting the god or rather several of them
however his infamous and oft cited impersonations of major deities may represent no more than his priesthood of their cults a desire to shock and a penchant for triumphal dress or simply mental illness
whatever his plans there is no evidence for his official cult as a living divus in rome or his replacement of state gods and none for major deviations or innovations in his provincial cult
his reported sexual relations with his sister drusilla and her deification after death aroused scorn from later historians after caligula s death her cult was simply allowed to fade
his reported extortion of priesthood fees from unwilling senators are marks of private cult and personal humiliations among the elite
caligula s fatal offense was to willfully insult or offend everyone who mattered including the senior military officers who assassinated him
the histories of his reign highlight his wayward impiety
perhaps not only his in ad the senate decreed that the emperor should sit on a high platform even in the very senate house
claudius his successor and uncle intervened to limit the damage to the imperial house and those who had conspired against it and had caligula s public statues discreetly removed
claudius was chosen emperor by caligula s praetorians and consolidated his position with cash payments donativa to the military
the senate were forced to ratify the choice and accept the affront
claudius adopted the cognomen caesar deified augustus wife livia years after her death and in ad was granted the title pater patriae father of the fatherland but relations between emperor and senate seem to have been irreparable
claudius showed none of caligula s excesses
he seems to have entirely refused a cult to his own genius but the offer of cult simultaneously acknowledged the high status of those empowered to grant it and the extraordinary status of the princeps claudius repeated refusals may have been interpreted as offensive to senate provincials and the imperial office itself
he further offended the traditional hierarchy by promoting his own trusted freedmen as imperial procurators those closest to the emperor held high status through their proximity
it has been assumed that he allowed a single temple for his cult in britain following his conquest there
the temple is certain it was sited at camulodunum modern colchester the main colonia in the province and was a focus of british wrath during the boudiccan revolt of ad
but cult to the living claudius there is very unlikely he had already refused alexandrine cult honours as vulgar and impious and cult to living emperors was associated with arae altars not temples
the british worship offered him as a living divus is probably no more than a cruel literary judgment on his worth as emperor
despite his evident respect for republican norms he was not taken seriously by his own class and in seneca s fawning neronian fiction the roman gods cannot take him seriously as a divus the wild british might be more gullible
in reality they proved resentful enough to rebel though probably less against the claudian divus than against brutal abuses and the financial burden represented by its temple
claudius died in ad and was deified by his adopted son and successor nero
after an apparently magnificent funeral the divus claudius was given a temple on rome s disreputable mons caelius
fishwick remarks that the malicious humour of the site can hardly have been lost by those in the know
the location of claudius temple in britain the occasion for his pathetic triumph may be more of the same
once in power nero allowed claudius cult to lapse built his domus aurea over the unfinished temple indulged his sybaritic and artistic inclinations and allowed the cult of his own genius as paterfamilias of the roman people
senatorial attitudes to him appear to have been largely negative
he was overthrown in a military coup and his institutions of cult to his dead wife poppaea and infant daughter claudia augusta were abandoned
otherwise he seems to have been a popular emperor particularly in the eastern provinces
tacitus reports a senatorial proposal to dedicate a temple to nero as a living divus taken as ominous because divine honours are not paid to an emperor till he has ceased to live among men
nero s death saw the end of imperial tenure as a privilege of ancient roman patrician and senatorial families
in a single chaotic year power passed violently from one to another of four emperors
the first three promoted their own genius cult the last two of these attempted nero s restitution and promotion to divus
the fourth vespasian son of an equestrian from reate secured his flavian dynasty through reversion to an augustan form of principate and renewed the imperial cult of divus julius
vespasian was respected for his restoration of roman tradition and the augustan modesty of his reign
he dedicated state cult to genio populi romani the genius of the roman people respected senatorial republican values and repudiated neronian practice by removing various festivals from the public calendars which had in tacitus unsparing assessment become foully sullied by the flattery of the times
he may have had the head of nero s colossus replaced or recut for its dedication or rededication to the sun god in ad
following the first jewish revolt and the destruction of the temple in jerusalem in ad he imposed the didrachmon formerly paid by jews for their temple s upkeep but now re routed to jupiter capitolinus as victor over them and their god
jews who paid the tax were exempt from the cult to imperial state deities
those who offered it however were ostracised from their own communities
vespasian appears to have approached his own impending cult with dry humour according to suetonius his last words were puto deus fio i think i m turning into a god
vespasian s son titus reigned for two successful years then died of natural causes
he was deified and replaced by his younger brother domitian
within two weeks of accession domitian had restored the cult of the ruling emperor s genius
he remains a controversial figure described as one of the very few emperors to scandalously style himself a living divus as evidenced by the use of master and god dominus et deus in imperial documents
however there are no records of domitian s personal use of the title its use in official address or cult to him its presence on his coinage or in the arval acts relating to his state cult
it occurs only in his later reign and was almost certainly initiated and used by his own procurators who in the claudian tradition were also his freedmen
like any other paterfamilias and patron domitian was master and god to his extended familia including his slaves freedmen and clients
pliny s descriptions of sacrifice to domitian on the capitol are consistent with the entirely unremarkable private and informal rites accorded to living emperors
domitian was a traditionalist severe and repressive but respected by the military and the general populace
he admired augustus and may have sought to emulate him but made the same tactless error as caligula in treating the senate as clients and inferiors rather than as the fictive equals required by augustan ideology
his assassination was planned and implemented from within his court and his name officially but rather unsystematically erased from inscriptions
the senate chose the elderly childless and apparently reluctant nerva as emperor
nerva had long standing family and consular connections with the julio claudian and flavian families but proved a dangerously mild and indecisive princeps he was persuaded to abdicate in favour of trajan
pliny the younger s panegyric of ad claims the visible restoration of senatorial authority and dignity throughout the empire under trajan but while he praises the emperor s modesty pliny does not disguise the precarious nature of this autocratic gift
under trajan s very capable civil and military leadership the office of emperor was increasingly interpreted as an earthly viceregency of the divine order
he would prove an enduring model for roman imperial virtues
the emperor hadrian s hispano roman origins and marked pro hellenism changed the focus of imperial cult
his standard coinage still identifies with the genius populi romani but other issues stress his identification with hercules gaditanus hercules of gades and rome s imperial protection of greek civilisation
commemorative coinage shows him raising up provincial deities thus elevating and restoring the provinces he promoted sagalassos in greek pisidia as the empire s leading imperial cult centre and in ad he sponsored the exclusively greek panhellenion
he was said to have wept like a woman at the death of his young lover antinous and arranged his apotheosis
dio claims that hadrian was held to ridicule for this emotional indulgence particularly as he had delayed the apotheosis of his own sister paulina after her death
the cult of antinous would prove one of remarkable longevity and devotion particularly in the eastern provinces
bithynia as his birthplace featured his image on coinage as late as the reign of caracalla r
his popular cult appears to have thrived well into the th century when he became the whipping boy of pagan worship in christian polemic
vout remarks his humble origins untimely death and resurrection as theos and his identification and sometimes misidentification by later scholarship with the images and religious functions of apollo dionysius bacchus and later osiris
in rome itself he was also theos on two of three surviving inscriptions but was more closely associated with hero cult which allowed direct appeals for his intercession with higher gods
hadrian imposed the imperial cult to himself and jupiter on judaea following the bar kokhba revolt
he was predeceased by his wife vibia sabina
both were deified but hadrian s case had to be pleaded by his successor antoninus pius
marcus aurelius tutor fronto offers the best evidence of imperial portraiture as a near ubiquitous feature of private and public life
though evidence for private emperor worship is as sparse in this era as in all others fronto s letters imply the genius cult of the living emperor as an official domestic and personal practice probably more common than cult to the divi in this and other periods
marcus son commodus succumbed to the lures of self indulgence easy populism and rule by favourites
he described his reign as a golden age and himself as a new romulus and re founder of rome but was deeply antagonistic toward the senate he reversed the standard republican imperial formula to populus senatusque romanus the people and senate of rome
he increasingly identified himself with the demigod hercules in statuary temples and in the arena where he liked to entertain as a bestiarius in the morning and a gladiator in the afternoon
in the last year of his life he was voted the official title romanus hercules the state cult to hercules acknowledged him as heroic a divinity or semi divinity but not a divus who had once been mortal
commodus may have intended declaring himself as a living god some time before his murder on the last day of ad
the nervan antonine dynasty ended in chaos
the senate declared damnatio memoriae on commodus whose urban prefect pertinax was declared emperor by the praetorian guard in return for the promise of very large donatives
pertinax had risen through equestrian ranks by military talent and administrative efficiency to become senator consul and finally and briefly emperor he was murdered by his praetorians for attempting to cap their pay
pertinax was replaced by didius julianus who had promised cash to the praetorians and restoration of power to the senate
julianus began his reign with an ill judged appeal to the memory of commodus a much resented attempt to bribe the populace en masse and the use of praetorian force against them
in protest a defiant urban crowd occupied the senatorial seats at the circus maximus
against a background of civil war among competing claimants in the provinces septimius severus emerged as a likely victor
the senate soon voted for the death of julianus the deification of pertinax and the elevation of septimius as emperor
only a year had passed since the death of commodus
sit divus dum non sit vivus let him be a divus as long as he is not alive
attributed to caracalla before murdering his co emperor and brother geta
in ad septimius severus triumphally entered rome and gave apotheosis to pertinax
he cancelled the senate s damnatio memoriae of commodus deified him as a frater brother and thereby adopted marcus aurelius as his own ancestor through an act of filial piety
severan coin images further re enforced septimius association with prestigious antonine dynasts and the genius populi romani
septimius reign represents a watershed in relations between senate emperors and the military
senatorial consent defined divine imperium as a republican permission for the benefit of the roman people and apotheosis was a statement of senatorial powers
where vespasian had secured his position with appeals to the genius of the senate and augustan tradition septimius overrode the customary preferment of senators to senior military office
he increased plebeian privilege in rome stationed a loyal garrison there and selected his own commanders
he paid personal attention to the provinces as sources of revenue military manpower and unrest
following his defeat of his rival clodius albinus at lugdunum he re founded and reformed its imperial cult centre dea roma was removed from the altar and confined to the temple along with the deified augusti
fishwick interprets the obligatory new rites as those due any paterfamilias from his inferiors
septimius own patron deities melqart hercules and liber bacchus took pride of place with himself and his two sons at the saecular games of ad
septimius died of natural causes in ad at eboracum modern york while on campaign in britannia after leaving the empire equally to caracalla and his older brother geta along with advice to be harmonious enrich the soldiers and scorn all other men
by ad caracalla had murdered geta pronounced his damnatio memoriae and issued the constitutio antoniniana this gave full roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire
and was couched as a generous invitation to celebrate the victory of the roman people in foiling geta s conspiracy
in reality caracalla was faced by an endemic shortfall of cash and recruits
his gift was a far from popular move as most of its recipients were humiliores of peasant status and occupation approximately of the total population
humiliores they remained but now liable to pay taxes serve in the legions and adopt the name of their liberator
where other emperors had employed the mos maiorum of family obligation at the largely symbolic level of genius cult caracalla literally identified his personal survival with the state and his citizens
caracalla inherited the devotion of his father s soldiery but his new citizens were not inclined to celebrate and his attempts to court popularity in commodan style seem to have misfired
in philostratus estimation his embrace of empire foundered on his grudging parochial mindset
he was assassinated in ad with the possible collusion of his praetorian prefect macrinus
the military hailed macrinus as imperator and he arranged for the apotheosis of caracalla
aware of the impropriety of his unprecedented leap through the traditional cursus honorum from equestrian to emperor he respectfully sought senatorial approval for his self nomination
it was granted the new emperor had a lawyer s approach to imperium but his foreign policy proved too cautious and placatory for the military
after little more than a year he was murdered in a coup and replaced with an emperor of syrian background and severan descent varius avitus bassianus more usually known by the latinised name of his god and his priesthood elagabalus
the year old emperor brought his solar mountain deity from his native emesa to rome and into official imperial cult
in syria the cult of elagabalus was popular and well established
in rome it was a foreign and according to some ancient sources disgusting eastern novelty
in ad the priest elagabalus replaced jupiter with the god elagabalus as sol invictus the unconquered sun and thereafter neglected his imperial role as pontifex maximus
according to marius maximus he ruled from his degenerate domus through prefects who included among others a charioteer a locksmith a barber and a cook
at the very least he appears to have been regarded as an unacceptably effete eccentric by the senate and military alike
he was assassinated by the praetorians at the age of subjected to the fullest indignities of damnatio memoriae and replaced with his young cousin alexander severus the last of his dynasty who reigned for years until killed in a mutiny
this section provides an overview of developments most relevant to cult for a full listing of emperors by name and date see list of roman emperors
the end of the severan dynasty marked the breakdown of central imperium
against a background of economic hyperinflation and latterly endemic plague rival provincial claimants fought for supremacy and failing this set up their own provincial empires
most emperors seldom even saw rome and had only notional relationships with their senates
in the absence of coordinated imperial military response foreign peoples seized the opportunity for invasion and plunder
maximinus thrax reigned ad sequestered the resources of state temples in rome to pay his armies
the temples of the divi were first in line
it was an unwise move for his own posterity as the grant or withholding of apotheosis remained an official judgment of imperial worthiness but the stripping of the temples of state gods caused far greater offense
maximinus s actions more likely show need in extreme crisis than impiety as he had his wife deified on her death but in a rare display of defiance the senate deified his murdered predecessor then openly rebelled
his replacement gordian i reigned briefly but successfully and was made a divus on his death
a succession of short lived soldier emperors followed
further development in imperial cult appears to have stalled until philip the arab who dedicated a statue to his father as divine in his home town of philippopolis and brought the body of his young predecessor gordian iii to rome for apotheosis
coins of philip show him in the radiate solar crown suggestive of solar cult or a hellenised form of imperial monarchy with rome s temple to venus and dea roma on the reverse
in ad philip was succeeded or murdered and usurped by his praetorian prefect decius a traditionalist ex consul and governor
after an accession of doubtful validity decius justified himself as rightful restorer and saviour of empire and its religio early in his reign he issued a coin series of imperial divi in radiate solar crowns
philip the three gordians pertinax and claudius were omitted presumably because decius thought them unworthy of the honour
in the wake of religious riots in egypt he decreed that all subjects of the empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to ancestral gods or suffer a penalty sacrifice on rome s behalf by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as roman
only jews were exempt from this obligation
the decian edict required that refusal of sacrifice be tried and punished at proconsular level
apostasy was sought rather than capital punishment
a year after its due deadline the edict was allowed to expire and shortly after this decius himself died
valerian identified christianity as the largest most stubbornly self interested of non roman cults outlawed christian assembly and urged christians to sacrifice to rome s traditional gods
his son and co augustus gallienus an initiate of the eleusinian mysteries identified himself with traditional roman gods and the virtue of military loyalty
aurelian appealed for harmony among his soldiers concordia militum stabilised the empire and its borders and established an official hellenic form of unitary cult to the palmyrene sol invictus in rome s campus martius
the senate hailed him as restitutor orbis restorer of the world and deus et dominus natus god and born ruler he was murdered by his praetorians
his immediate successors consolidated his achievements coinage of probus shows him in radiate solar crown and his prolific variety of coin types include issues showing the temple of venus and dea roma in rome
these policies and preoccupations culminated in diocletian s tetrarchy the empire was divided into western and eastern administrative blocs each with an augustus senior emperor helped by a caesar junior emperor as augustus in waiting
provinces were divided and subdivided their imperial bureaucracy became extraordinary in size scope and attention to detail
diocletian was a religious conservative
on his accession in ad he held games in honour of the divus antinous
where his predecessors had attempted the persuasion and coercion of recalcitrant sects diocletian launched a series of ferocious reactions known in church history as the great persecution
according to lactantius this began with a report of ominous haruspicy in diocletian s domus and a subsequent but undated dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military
a date of is regarded as likely and eusebius also says the persecutions of christians began in the army
however maximilian s martyrdom came from his refusal of military service and marcellus for renouncing his military oath
legally these were military insurrections and diocletian s edict may have followed these and similar acts of conscience and faith
an unknown number of christians appear to have suffered the extreme and exemplary punishments traditionally reserved for rebels and traitors
under diocletian s expanded imperial collegia imperial honours distinguished both augusti from their caesares and diocletian as senior augustus from his colleague maximian
while the division of empire and imperium seemed to offer the possibility of a peaceful and well prepared succession its unity required the highest investiture of power and status in one man
an elaborate choreography of etiquette surrounded the approach to the imperial person and imperial progressions
the senior augustus in particular was made a separate and unique being accessible only through those closest to him
diocletian s avowed conservatism almost certainly precludes a systematic design toward personal elevation as a divine monarch
rather he formally elaborated imperial ceremony as a manifestation of the divine order of empire and elevated emperorship as the supreme instrument of the divine will
the idea was augustan or earlier expressed most clearly in stoic philosophy and the solar cult especially under aurelian
at the very beginning of his reign before his tetrarchy diocletian had adopted the signum of jovius his co augustus adopted the title herculius
during the tetrarchy such titles were multiplied but with no clear reflection of implicit divine seniority in one case the divine signum of the augustus is inferior to that of his caesar
these divine associations may have followed a military precedent of emperors as comes to divinities or divinities as comes to emperors
moreover the divine signum appears in the fairly narrow context of court panegyric and civil etiquette
it makes no appearance on the general coinage or stauary of the tetrarchs who are presented as impersonal near homogenous abstractions of imperial might and unity
the augustan settlement was promoted by its contemporary apologists as restorative and conservative rather than revolutionary
official cult to the genius of the living princeps as first among equals recognised his exceptional powers his capacity for self restraint and his pious respect for republican traditions
good emperors rejected offers of official cult as a living deity and accepted the more modest honour of genius cult
claims that later emperors sought and obtained divine honours in rome reflect their bad relationship with their senates in tertullian s day it was still a curse to name the emperor a god before his death
on the other hand to judge from the domestic ubiquity of the emperor s image private cults to living emperors are as likely in rome as elsewhere
as gradel observes no roman was ever prosecuted for sacrificing to his emperor
the divi had some form of precedent in the di parentes divine ancestors who received ancestral rites as manes gods of the underworld during the parentalia and other important domestic festivals
their powers were limited deceased mortals did not normally possess the divine power numen of the higher gods
deceased emperors did not automatically become divi they must be nominated for the privilege
their case was discussed by the senate then put to the vote
as long as the correct rituals and sacrifice were offered the divus would be received by the heavenly gods as a coelicola a dweller in heaven a lesser being than themselves
popular belief held that the divus augustus would be personally welcomed by jupiter
in seneca s apocolocyntosis on the other hand the unexpected arrival of the divinised claudius creates a problem for the olympians who have no idea who or what he is and when they find out they cannot think what to do with him
seneca s sarcastic wit an unacceptable impiety towards a deus freely portrays the divus claudius as just a dead ridiculous and possibly quite bad emperor
though their images were sacrosanct and their rites definitively divine divi could be created unmade reinstated or simply forgotten
augustus and trajan appear to have remained the ideals for longer than any and cult to good divi appears to have lasted well into the late imperial dominate
the immense power of living emperors on the other hand was mediated through the encompassing agency of the state
once acknowledged as paterfamilias to an empire a princeps was naturally entitled to genius cult from imperial subjects of all classes
cult to a living emperor s numen was quite another matter and might be interpreted as no less than a statement of divine monarchy
imperial responses to the first overtures of cult to the august numen were therefore extremely cautious
only much later probably in consequence of the hyperinflation of honours to living emperors could a living emperor be openly formally addressed as numen praesens the numinous presence
the obscure relationship between deus divus and numen in imperial cult might simply reflect its origins as a pragmatic respectful and somewhat evasive imperial solution using broad terminology whose meanings varied according to context
for beard et al a practicable and universal roman cult of deified emperors and others of the imperial house must have hinged on the paradox that a mortal might like the semi divine heroic figures of hercules aeneas and romulus possess or acquire sufficient measure of numen to rise above their mortal condition and be in the company of the gods yet remain mortal in the eyes of roman traditionalists
sacred offerings sacrificium formed the contract of public and private religio from oaths of office treaty and loyalty to business contracts and marriage
participation in sacrificium acknowledged personal commitment to the broader community and its values which under decius became a compulsory observance
livy believed that military and civil disasters were the consequence of error vitium in augury neglect of due and proper sacrifice and the impious proliferation of foreign cults and superstitio
religious law focused on the sacrificial requirements of particular deities on specific occasions
in julio claudian rome the arval priesthood sacrificed to roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the imperial family on their birthdays accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt
on january they consecrated the annual vows sacrifice promised in the previous year was paid as long as the gods had kept the imperial family safe for the contracted time
if not it could be withheld as it was in the annual vow following the death of trajan
in pompeii the genius of the living emperor was offered a bull presumably a standard practice in imperial cult at this time though lesser offerings of wine cakes and incense were also given especially in the later imperial era
the divi and genii were offered the same kind of sacrifice as the state gods but cult officials seem to have offered christians the possibility of sacrifice to emperors as the lesser act
by ancient tradition presiding magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed actions through an augur who read the divine will through the observation of natural signs in the sacred space templum of sacrifice
magistrates could use their right of augury ius augurum to adjourn and overturn the process of law but were obliged to base their decision on the augur s observations and advice
for cicero this made the augur the most powerful authority in the late republic
in the later republic augury came under the supervision of the college of pontifices a priestly magistral office whose powers were increasingly woven into the cursus honorum
the office of pontifex maximus eventually became a de facto consular office
when the consul lepidus died his office as pontifex maximus passed to augustus who took priestly control over the state oracles including the sibylline books and used his powers as censor to suppress unapproved oracles
octavian s honorific title of augustus indicated his achievements as expressions of divine will where the impiety of the late republic had provoked heavenly disorder and wrath ira deorum his obedience to divine ordinance brought divine peace pax deorum
the mos maiorum established the near monarchic familial authority of the ordinary paterfamilias the father of the family or the owner of the family estate his obligations to family and community and his priestly duties to his lares and domestic penates
his position was hereditary and dynastic unlike the elected time limited offices of republican magistrates
his family and especially his slaves and freedmen owed a reciprocal duty of cult to his genius
genius pl
genii was the essential spirit and generative power depicted as a serpent or as a perennial youth often winged within an individual and their clan gens pl
gentes such as the julli julians of julius caesar
a paterfamilias could confer his name a measure of his genius and a role in his household rites obligations and honours upon those he adopted
as caesar s adopted heir octavian stood to inherit the genius heritable property and honours of his adoptive father in addition to those obtained through his own birth gens and efforts
the exceptionally potent genius of living emperors expressed the will of the gods through imperial actions
in bc libation offerings to the genius of octavian later augustus became a duty at public and private banquets and from bc state oaths were sworn by the genius of the living emperor
the roman paterfamilias offered daily cult to his lares and penates and to his di parentes divi parentes in domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth
as goddess of all hearths including the ritual hearth of the state vesta connected the public and private duties of citizens
her official cults were supervised by the pontifex maximus from a state owned house near the temple of vesta
when augustus became pontifex maximus in bc he gave the vestals his own house on the palatine
his penates remained there as its domestic deities and were soon joined by his lares
his gift therefore tied his domestic cult to the sanctified vestals and rome s sacred hearth and symbolically extended his domus to the state and its inhabitants
he also co opted and promoted the traditional and predominantly plebeian compitalia shrines and extended their festivals whose lares were known thereafter as augusti
rome s citizen legionaries appear to have maintained their marian traditions
they gave cult to jupiter for the emperor s well being and regular cult to state local and personal divinities
cult to the imperial person and familia was generally offered on imperial accessions anniversaries and renewal of annual vows a bust of the ruling emperor was kept in the legionary insignia shrine for the purpose attended by a designated military imaginifer
by the time of the early severans the legions offered cult to the state gods the imperial divi the current emperor s numen genius and domus or familia and special cult to the empress as mother of the camp at around this time mithraic cults became very popular with the military and provided a basis for syncretic imperial cult which absorbed mithras into solar and stoic monism as a focus of military concordia and loyalty
an imperial cult temple was known as a caesareum latin or sebasteion greek
in fishwick s analysis cult to roman state divi was associated with temples and the genius cult to the living emperor with his altar
the emperor s image and its siting within the temple complex focused attention on his person and attributes and his position in the divine and human hierarchies
expenditure on the physical expression of imperial cult was vast and was only curbed by the imperial crisis of the rd century
as far as is known no new temples to state divi were built after the reign of marcus aurelius
the imperial divi and living genii appear to have been served by separate ceremonies and priesthoods
emperors themselves could be priests of state gods the divi and their own genius cult images
the latter practice illustrates the imperial genius as innate to its holder but separable from him as a focus of respect and cult formally consistent with cult to the personification of ideas and ideals such as fortune fortuna peace pax or victory victoria et al
in conjunction with the genius of the emperor senate or roman people julius caesar had showed his affinity with the virtue of clemency clementia a personal quality associated with his divine ancestor and patron goddess venus
priests typically and respectfully identified their function by manifesting the appearance and other properties of their deus
the duties of imperial priests were both religious and magistral they included the provision of approved imperial portraits statues and sacrifice the institution of regular calendrical cult and the inauguration of public works imperial games state ludi and munera to authorised models
in effect priests throughout the empire were responsible for re creating expounding and celebrating the extraordinary gifts powers and charisma of emperors
as part of his religious reforms augustus revived subsidised and expanded the compitalia games and priesthoods dedicated to the lares of the vici neighbourhoods to include cult to his own lares or to his genius as a popular benefactor
thereafter the lares compitales were known as lares augusti
tiberius created a specialised priesthood the sodales augustales dedicated to the cult of the deceased deified augustus
this priestly office and the connections between the compitalia cults and the imperial household appear to have lasted for as long as the imperial cult itself
greek philosophies had significant influence in the development of imperial cult
stoic cosmologists saw history as an endless cycle of destruction and renewal driven by fortuna luck or fortune fatum fate and logos the universal divine principle
the same forces inevitably produced a s t r saviour who would transform the destructive and unnatural disorder of chaos and strife to pax fortuna and salus peace good fortune and well being and is thus identified with solar cults such as apollo and sol invictus
livy in the early to mid st century bc and lucan in the st century ad interpreted the crisis of the late republic as a destructive phase which led to religious and constitutional renewal by augustus and his restoration of peace good fortune and well being to the roman people
augustus was a messianic figure who personally and rationally instigated a golden age the pax augusta and was patron priest and protege to a range of solar deities
the imperial order was therefore not merely justified by appeals to the divine it was represented as an innately natural benevolent and divine institution
the imperial cult tolerated and later included specific forms of pluralistic monism
for imperial cult apologists monotheists had no rational grounds for refusal but imposition of cult was counter productive
jews presented a special case
long before the civil war judaism had been tolerated in rome by diplomatic treaty with graeco judaean rulers
it was brought to prominence and scrutiny after judaea s enrollment as a client kingdom in bc
the following jewish diaspora helped disperse early judaic christianity
early christians appear to have been regarded as a sub sect of judaism and as such were sporadically tolerated
jewish sources on emperors polytheistic cult and the meaning of empire are fraught with interpretive difficulties
in caligula s reign jews resisted the placing of caligula s statue in their temple and pleaded that their offerings and prayers to yahweh on his behalf amounted to compliance with his request for worship
according to philo caligula was unimpressed because the offering was not made directly to him whether to his genius or his numen is never made clear but the statue was never installed
philo does not challenge the imperial cult itself he commends the god like honours given augustus as the first and the greatest and the common benefactor but caligula shames the imperial tradition by acting like an egyptian
however philo is clearly pro roman a major feature of the first jewish revolt ad was the ending of jewish sacrifices to rome and the emperor and the defacement of imperial images
to pagan romans a simple act of sacrifice whether to ancestral gods under decius or state gods under diocletian represented adherence to roman tradition and loyalty to the pluralistic unity of the empire
refusal to adhere to the cult was treason
christians however identified hellenistic honours as parodies of true worship
under the reign of nero or domitian according to momigliano the author of the book of revelation represented rome as the beast from the sea judaeo roman elites as the beast from the land and the charagma official roman stamp as a sign of the beast
some christian thinkers perceived divine providence in the timing of christ s birth at the very beginning of the empire that brought peace and laid paths for the spread of the gospels rome s destruction of jerusalem and its temple was interpreted as divine punishment of the jews for their refusal of the christ
with the abatement of persecution jerome could acknowledge empire as a bulwark against evil but insist that imperial honours were contrary to christian teaching
as pontifex maximus constantine i favoured the catholic church of the christians against the donatists because
it is contrary to the divine law
that we should overlook such quarrels and contentions whereby the highest divinity may perhaps be roused not only against the human race but also against myself to whose care he has by his celestial will committed the government of all earthly things
official letter from constantine dated ad
in this change of imperial formula constantine acknowledged his responsibility to an earthly realm whose discord and conflict might arouse the ira deorum he also recognised the power of the new christian priestly hierarchy in determining what was auspicious or orthodox
though unbaptised constantine had triumphed under the signum of the christ probably some form of labarum as an adapted or re interpreted legionary standard
he may have officially ended or attempted to end blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his imperial iconography and court ceremonial elevated him to superhuman status
constantine s permission for a new cult temple to himself and his family in umbria is extant the cult should not be polluted by the deception of any contagious superstition
at the first council of nicaea constantine united and re founded the empire under an absolute head of state by divine dispensation and was honoured as the first christian imperial divus
on his death he was venerated and was held to have ascended to heaven
philostorgius later criticised christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus constantine
his three sons re divided their imperial inheritance constantius ii was an arian his brothers were nicene
constantine s nephew julian rome s last non christian emperor rejected the galilean madness of his upbringing for a synthesis of neo platonism stoic asceticism and universal solar cult and actively fostered religious and cultural pluralism
his restored augustan form of principate with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned
the western emperor gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus and against the protests of the senate removed the altar of victoria victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the vestals
theodosius i briefly re united the western and eastern halves of the empire officially adopted nicene christianity as the imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults
he refused to restore victoria to the senate house extinguished vesta s sacred fire and vacated her temple
even so he accepted address as a living divinity comparable to hercules and jupiter by his overwhelmingly pagan senate
after his death the sundered eastern and western halves of empire followed increasingly divergent paths nevertheless both were roman and both had emperors
imperial ceremonial notably the imperial adventus or ceremony of arrival which derived in greater part from the triumph was embedded within roman culture church ceremony and the gospels themselves
the last western divus was probably libius severus who died in ad
very little is known about him
his imperium was not recognised by his eastern counterpart and he may have been a puppet emperor of the germanic general ricimer
in the west imperial authority was partly replaced by the spiritual supremacy and political influence of the roman catholic church
in the eastern empire sworn adherence to christian orthodoxy became a prerequisite of imperial accession anastasius i signed a document attesting his obedience to orthodox doctrine and practice
he is the last emperor known to be consecrated as divus on his death ad
the title appears to have been abandoned on grounds of its spiritual impropriety but the consecration of eastern emperors continued they held power through divine ordinance and their rule was the manifestation of sacred power on earth
the adventus and the veneration of the imperial image continued to provide analogies for devotional representations icons of the heavenly hierarchy and the rituals of the orthodox church
the roman imperial cult is sometimes considered a deviation from rome s traditional republican values a religiously insincere cult of personality which served imperial propaganda
it drew its power and effect however from both religious traditions deeply engrained in roman culture such as the veneration of the genius of each individual and of the ancestral dead and on forms of the hellenistic ruler cult developed in the eastern provinces of the empire
the nature and function of imperial cult remain contentious not least because its roman historians employed it equally as a topos for imperial worth and imperial hubris
it has been interpreted as an essentially foreign graeco eastern institution imposed cautiously and with some difficulty upon a latin western roman culture in which the deification of rulers was constitutionally alien if not obnoxious
in this viewpoint the essentially servile and un roman imperial cult was established at the expense of the traditional roman ethics which had sustained the republic
for christians and secularists alike the identification of mortal emperors with godhead represented the spiritual and moral bankruptcy of paganism which led to the triumph of christianity as rome s state religion
very few modern historians would now support this point of view
some among them beard et al
find no distinct category of imperial cult within the religio political life of empire the romans themselves used no such enveloping term
cult to living or dead emperors was inseparable from imperial state religion which was inextricably interwoven with roman identity and whose beliefs and practices were founded within the ancient commonality of rome s social and domestic mos maiorum
descriptions of cult to emperors as a tool of imperial propaganda or the less pejorative civil religion emerge from modern political thought and are of doubtful value in republican rome cult could be given to state gods personal gods triumphal generals magnates benefactors patrons and the ordinary paterfamilias living or dead
cult to mortals was not an alien practise it acknowledged their power status and their bestowal of benefits
the augustan settlement appealed directly to the republican mos maiorum and under the principate cult to emperors defined them as emperors
with rare exceptions the earliest institution of cult to emperors succeeded in providing a common focus of identity for empire
it celebrated the charisma of roman imperial power and the meaning of empire according to local interpretations of romanitas firstly an agency of transformation then of stability
cult to imperial deities was associated with commonplace public ceremonies celebrations of extraordinary splendour and unnumbered acts of private and personal devotion
the political usefulness of such an institution implies neither mechanical insincerity nor lack of questioning about its meaning and propriety an empire wide unifying cult would necessarily be open to a multitude of personal interpretations but its significance to ordinary romans is almost entirely lost in the critical interpretations of a small number of philosophically literate skeptical or antagonistic romans and greeks whether christian or hellene
the decline of prosperity security and unity of empire was clearly accompanied by loss of faith in rome s traditional gods and at least in the west in roman emperors
for some romans this was caused by the neglect of traditional religious practices
for others equally roman breakdown of empire was god s judgment on faithless or heretical christians and hardened pagans alike
as roman society evolved so did cult to emperors both proved remarkably resilient and adaptable
until its confrontation by fully developed christian orthodoxy imperial cult needed no systematic or coherent theology
its part in rome s continued success was probably sufficient to justify sanctify and explain it to most romans
confronted with crisis in empire constantine matched the augustan achievement by absorbing christian monotheism into the imperial hierarchy
