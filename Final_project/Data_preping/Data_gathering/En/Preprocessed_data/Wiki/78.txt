claytronics is an abstract future concept that combines nanoscale robotics and computer science to create individual nanometer scale computers called claytronic atoms or catoms which can interact with each other to form tangible d objects that a user can interact with
this idea is more broadly referred to as programmable matter
claytronics has the potential to greatly affect many areas of daily life such as telecommunication human computer interfaces and entertainment
current research is exploring the potential of modular reconfigurable robotics and the complex software necessary to control the shape changing robots
locally distributed predicates or ldp is a distributed high level language for programming modular reconfigurable robot systems mrrs
there are many challenges associated with programming and controlling a large number of discrete modular systems due to the degrees of freedom that correspond with each module
for example reconfiguring from one formation to one similar may require a complex path of movements controlled by an intricate string of commands even though the two shapes differ slightly
in research efforts to develop a hardware concept were successful on the scale of millimeters creating cylindrical prototypes millimeters in diameter which interact with each other via electromagnetic attraction
their experiments helped researchers verify the relationship between mass and potential force between objects as a fold reduction in size which should translate to a fold increase in force relative to mass
recent advancements in this prototype concept are in the form of one millimeter diameter cylindrical robots fabricated on a thin film by photolithography that would cooperate with each other using complex software that would control electromagnetic attraction and repulsion between modules
today extensive research and experiments with claytronics are being conducted at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania by a team of researchers which consists of professors todd c
mowry seth goldstein graduate and undergraduate students and researchers from intel labs pittsburgh
the driving force behind programmable matter is the actual hardware that is manipulating itself into whatever form is desired
claytronics consists of a collection of individual components called claytronic atoms or catoms
in order to be viable catoms need to fit a set of criteria
first catoms need to be able to move in three dimensions relative to each other and be able to adhere to each other to form a three dimensional shape
second the catoms need to be able to communicate with each other in an ensemble and be able to compute state information possibly with assistance from each other
fundamentally catoms consist of a cpu a network device for communication a single pixel display several sensors an onboard battery and a means to adhere to one another
the researchers at carnegie mellon university have developed various prototypes of catoms
these vary from small cubes to giant helium balloons
the prototype that is most like what developers hope catoms will become is the planar catom
these take the form of mm diameter cylinders
these cylinders are equipped with electromagnets arranged in a series of stacked rings along the cylinder s circumference
movement is achieved by the catoms cooperatively enabling and disabling the magnets in order to roll along each other s surfaces
only one magnet on each catom is energized at a time
these prototypes are able to reconfigure themselves quite quickly with the uncoupling of two units movement to another contact point and recoupling taking only about ms
power is supplied to the catoms using pickup feet on the bottom of the cylinder
conductive strips on the table supply the necessary power
in the current design the catoms are only able to move in two dimensions relative to each other
future catoms will be required to move in three dimensions relative to each other
the goal of the researchers is to develop a millimeter scale catom with no moving parts to allow for mass manufacturability
millions of these microrobots will be able to emit variable color and intensity of light allowing for dynamic physical rendering
the design goal has shifted to creating catoms that are simple enough to only function as part of an ensemble with the ensemble as a whole being capable of higher function
as the catoms are scaled down an onboard battery sufficient to power it will exceed the size of the catom itself so an alternate energy solution is desired
research is being done into powering all of the catoms in an ensemble utilizing the catom to catom contact as a means of energy transport
one possibility being explored is using a special table with positive and negative electrodes and routing the power internally through the catoms via virtual wires
another major design challenge will be developing a genderless unary connector for the catoms in order to keep reconfiguration time at a minimum
nanofibers provide a possible solution to this challenge
nanofibers allow for great adhesion on a small scale and allow for minimum power consumption when the catoms are at rest
organizing all of the communication and actions between millions of sub millimeter scale catoms requires development of advanced algorithms and programming languages
the researchers and engineers of carnegie mellon intel claytronics research lab launched a wide range of projects to develop the necessary software to facilitate communication between catoms
the most important projects are developing new programming languages which work more efficiently for claytronics
the goal of a claytronics matrix is to dynamically form three dimensional shapes
however the vast number of catoms in this distributed network increases complexity of micro management of each individual catom
so each catom must perceive accurate position information and command of cooperation with its neighbors
in this environment software language for the matrix operation must convey concise statements of high level commands in order to be universally distributed
languages to program a matrix require a more abbreviated syntax and style of command than normal programming languages such as c and java
the carnegie mellon intel claytronics research project has created two new programming languages meld and locally distributed predicates ldp
meld is a declarative language a logic programming language originally designed for programming overlay networks
by using logic programming the code for an ensemble of robots can be written from a global perspective enabling the programmer to concentrate on the overall performance of the claytronics matrix rather than writing individual instructions for every one of the thousands to millions of catoms in the ensemble
this dramatically simplifies the thought process for programming the movement of a claytronics matrix
ldp is a reactive programming language
it has been used to trigger debugging in the earlier research
with the addition of language that enables the programmer to build operations in the development of the shape of the matrix it can be used to analyze the distributed local conditions
it can operate on fixed size connected groups of modules providing various functions of state configuration
a program that addresses a fixed size module rather than the entire ensemble allows programmers to operate the claytronic matrix more frequently and efficiently
ldp further provides a means of matching distributed patterns
it enables the programmer to address a larger set of variables with boolean logic which enables the program to search for larger patterns of activity and behavior among groups of modules
performance errors for thousands to millions of individual catoms are hard to detect and debug therefore claytronics matrix operations require a dynamic and self directed process for identifying and debugging errors
claytronics researchers have developed distributed watchpoints an algorithm level approach to detecting and fixing errors missed by more conventional debugging techniques
it establishes nodes that receive surveillance to determine the validity of distributed conditions
this approach provides a simple and highly descriptive set of rules to evaluate distributed conditions and proves effective in the detection of errors
two important classes of claytronics algorithms are shape sculpting and localization algorithms
the ultimate goal of claytronics research is creating dynamic motion in three dimensional poses
all the research on catom motion collective actuation and hierarchical motion planning require shape sculpting algorithms to convert catoms into the necessary structure which will give structural strength and fluid movement to the dynamic ensemble
meanwhile localization algorithms enable catoms to localize their positions in an ensemble
a localization algorithm should provide accurate relational knowledge of catoms to the whole matrix based on noisy observation in a fully distributed manner
as the capabilities of computing continue to develop and robotic modules shrink claytronics will become useful in many applications
the featured application of claytronics is a new mode of communication
claytronics will offer a more realistic sense to communication over long distance called pario
similar to how audio and video provide aural and visual stimulation pario provides an aural visual and physical sensation
a user will be able to hear see and touch the one communicating with them in a realistic manner
pario could be used effectively in many professional disciplines from engineering design education and healthcare to entertainment and leisure activities such as video games
the advancements in nanotechnology and computing necessary for claytronics to become a reality are feasible but the challenges to overcome are daunting and will require great innovation
