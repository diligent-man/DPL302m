driving force behind programmable matter actual hardware manipulating whatever form desired
claytronics consists collection individual component called claytronic atom catoms
first catoms need able move three dimension relative able adhere form three-dimensional shape
second catoms need able communicate ensemble able compute state information possibly assistance other
fundamentally catoms consist cpu network device communication single pixel display several sensor onboard battery mean adhere one another
researcher carnegie mellon university developed various prototype catoms
prototype like developer hope catoms become planar catom
cylinder equipped electromagnet arranged series stacked ring along cylinder's circumference

another major design challenge developing genderless unary connector catoms order keep reconfiguration time minimum
nanofibers allow great adhesion small scale allow minimum power consumption catoms rest
organizing communication action million sub-millimeter scale catoms requires development advanced algorithm programming languages
researcher engineer carnegie mellon-intel claytronics research lab launched wide range project develop necessary software facilitate communication catoms
important project developing new programming language work efficiently claytronics
however vast number catoms distributed network increase complexity micro-management individual catom
catom must perceive accurate position information command cooperation neighbors
environment software language matrix operation must convey concise statement high-level command order universally distributed
language program matrix require abbreviated syntax style command normal programming language c java
carnegie mellon-intel claytronics research project ha created two new programming language meld locally distributed predicate ldp
meld declarative language logic programming language originally designed programming overlay networks
using logic programming code ensemble robot written global perspective enabling programmer concentrate overall performance claytronics matrix rather writing individual instruction every one thousand million catoms ensemble
dramatically simplifies thought process programming movement claytronics matrix
addition language enables programmer build operation development shape matrix used analyze distributed local conditions
operate fixed-size connected group module providing various function state configuration
program address fixed-size module rather entire ensemble allows programmer operate claytronic matrix frequently efficiently
enables programmer address larger set variable boolean logic enables program search larger pattern activity behavior among group modules
performance error thousand million individual catoms hard detect debug therefore claytronics matrix operation require dynamic self-directed process identifying debugging errors
claytronics researcher developed distributed watchpoints algorithm-level approach detecting fixing error missed conventional debugging techniques
