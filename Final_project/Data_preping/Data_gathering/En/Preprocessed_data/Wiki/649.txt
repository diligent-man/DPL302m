the chu army chinese pinyin ch y ng lit
chu state braves was a standing regional army organized by zuo zongtang
the name is taken from the hunan region where the army was raised
the army was financed through local nobles and gentry as opposed to the central government
the chu army was one of two armies known as the hunan army
another hunan army called the xiang army was created by zeng guofan to fight in the taiping rebellion
remnants of the xiang army which also fought in the war were then called the old hunan army
the xiang army was part of a new series of original armies called yung ying in qing dynasty china separate from the manchu eight banners and green standard army
the main points of difference were in their regional affiliations since these forces were often raised and led via kinship and local networks and their contravention of the normal chinese military policy where army generals were frequently rotated to prevent ambitious commanders building power bases
in the case of the yung ying the need for unit cohesion meant that officers were appointed by commanders and remained in command of their units throughout entire campaigns
general zuo zongtang commanded the hunan army in the dungan revolt in december sending of them to suzhou in gansu
in hunan the scholar literi were militarized and more commoners enlisted as officers in the army
zuo raised a man army from hunan before he began the final push to reconquer gansu from the dungan rebels they participated along with other regional armies the sichuan anhui and henan armies also joined the battle
the hunan army was extensively infiltrated by the anti qing gelaohui secret society who started several mutinies during the dungan revolt delaying crucial offensives
zuo put down the mutinies and executed those involved
another commander of the hunan army during the revolt was the manchu to lung a dolonga who had been transferred from a manchu banner
his leadership over the hunan forces defeated the muslim rebels and totally destroyed their position in shaanxi province expelling them to gansu
another commander under to long a was lei cheng kuan who fought successfully against the rebels enabling gansu roads to be reopened after capturing crucial cities
hunan army troops were also stationed in taiwan
they were commanded by liu ao and numbered battalions and came under liu mingchuan s command after he became governor of taiwan
another army which was stationed on taiwan was the anhui army
they were given modern breechloading guns and trained in modern warfare
western instructors were brought in
liu had stated that the two armies were strong crossbows the strength of which has been spent
he said on the rifles that unless the sights of the firearms are set accurately the aim cannot be gauged for either distance or height to have a rifle would then be the same as having none
