transactional ntfs abbreviated txf component introduced window vista present later version microsoft window operating system brings concept atomic transaction ntfs file system allowing window application developer write file-output routine guaranteed either succeed completely fail completely
major operating system component including system restore task scheduler window update rely txf stability
development window vista winfs also relied txf storing files
due complexity various nuance developer need consider part application development microsoft ha deprecated txf stated may removed future version windows
microsoft ha strongly recommended developer investigate using alternative rather adopting transactional ntfs api platform may available future version windows
transactional ntfs allows file directory created modified renamed deleted atomically
using transaction ensures correctness operation series file operation done transaction operation committed operation succeed
transactional ntfs implemented top kernel transaction manager window kernel component introduced window vista provides transactioning object kernel
ntfs file system already support journaling low-level operation writing block data
atomic operation single file common example saving file application application machine crash writing file part file could written possibly resulting corrupted file
would significant problem previous version file wa over-written data would likely lost
atomic operation spanning multiple file application need update several file set change necessary file operation performed single transaction preventing inconsistent update event failure
atomic operation spanning multiple computer performing operation multiple computer fairly common administrative task corporate network transactional ntfs integrates distributed transaction coordinator ensure change successfully applied machineswith exception read operation using transactional ntfs transaction encrypting file system file supported window vista
