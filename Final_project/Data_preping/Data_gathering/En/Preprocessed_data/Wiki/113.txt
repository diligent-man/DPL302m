abu abdullah muhammad al idrisi al qurtubi al hasani as sabti or simply al idrisi l dri si arabic latin dreses was an arab muslim geographer cartographer and egyptologist who for some time lived in palermo sicily at the court of king roger ii
muhammed al idrisi was born in ceuta then belonging to the almoravids
he created the tabula rogeriana one of the most advanced medieval world maps
al idrisi was born into the large hammudid family of north africa and al andalus which claimed descent from the idrisids of morocco and ultimately the prophet muhammad
al idrisi was born in the city of ceuta at the time controlled by the almoravids but now a part of spain where his great grandfather had been forced to settle after the fall of hammudid m laga to the zirids of granada
he spent much of his early life travelling through north africa and al andalus muslim spain of the times and seems to have acquired detailed information on both regions
he visited anatolia when he was barely
he studied in c rdoba
his travels took him to many parts of europe including portugal the pyrenees the french atlantic coast hungary and j rv k now known as york
because of conflict and instability in al andalus al idrisi joined contemporaries such as abu al salt in sicily where the normans had overthrown arabs formerly loyal to the fatimids
al idrisi incorporated the knowledge of africa the indian ocean and the far east gathered by islamic merchants and explorers and recorded on islamic maps with the information brought by the norman voyagers to create the most accurate map of the world in pre modern times which served as a concrete illustration of his kitab nuzhat al mushtaq latin opus geographicum which may be translated a diversion for the man longing to travel to far off places
the tabula rogeriana was drawn by al idrisi in for the norman king roger ii of sicily after a stay of eighteen years at his court where he worked on the commentaries and illustrations of the map
the map with legends written in arabic while showing the eurasian continent in its entirety only shows the northern part of the african continent and lacks details of the horn of africa and southeast asia
for roger it was inscribed on a massive disc of solid silver two metres in diameter
on the geographical work of al idrisi s p
scott wrote in
al idrisi s work influenced a number of islamic scholars including ibn sa id al maghribi hafiz i abru and ibn khaldun but his work was unknown in western europe and had little influence on the development of renaissance cartography
al idrisi in his famous tabula rogeriana mentioned irlandah al kabirah great ireland
according to him from the extremity of iceland to that of great ireland the sailing time was one day although historians note that both al idrisi and the norse tend to understate distances the only location this reference is thought to have possibly pointed to must likely have been in greenland
al idrisi mentioned that chinese junks carried leather swords iron and silk
he mentions the glassware of the city of hangzhou and labels quanzhou s silk as the best
in his records of chinese trade al idrisi also wrote about the silla dynasty one of korea s historical dynasties and a major trade partner to china at the time and was one of the first arabs to do so
as well as the maps al idrisi produced a compendium of geographical information with the title kitab nuzhat al mushtaq fi khtiraq al afaq
the title has been translated as the book of pleasant journeys into faraway lands or the pleasure of him who longs to cross the horizons
it has been preserved in nine manuscripts seven of which contain maps
the translated title of this work in the pleasure of him form attracted favourable comment from the team selecting lists of names for features expected to be discovered by the new horizons probe reconnoitring the pluto system
the al idrisi montes is a geographical feature in that system named after him
in the introduction al idrisi mentions two sources for geographical coordinates claudius ptolemy and an astronomer that must be ishaq ibn al hasan al zayyat and states that he has cross checked oral reports from different informers to see if geographical coordinates were consistent
an abridged version of the arabic text was published in rome in with title de geographia universali or kit b nuzhat al musht q f dhikr al am r wa al aq r wa al buld n wa al juzur wa al mad in wa al f q which in english would be recreation of the desirer in the account of cities regions countries islands towns and distant lands
this was one of the first arabic books ever printed
the first translation from the original arabic was into latin
the maronite s gabriel sionita and joannes hesronita translated an abridged version of the text which was published in paris in with the title of geographia nubiensis
not until the middle of the th century was a complete translation of the arabic text published
this was a translation into french by pierre am d e jaubert
more recently sections of the text have been translated for particular regions
beginning in a critical edition of the complete arabic text was published
al idrisi s geographical text nuzhat al mushtaq is often cited by proponents of pre columbian andalusian americas contact theories
in this text al idrisi wrote the following on the atlantic ocean
this translation by professor muhammad hamidullah is however questionable since it reports after having reached an area of sticky and stinking waters the mugharrarin also translated as the adventurers moved back and first reached an uninhabited island where they found a huge quantity of sheep the meat of which was bitter and uneatable and then continued southward and reached the above reported island where they were soon surrounded by barques and brought to a village whose inhabitants were often fair haired with long and flaxen hair and the women of a rare beauty
among the villagers one spoke arabic and asked them where they came from
then the king of the village ordered them to bring them back to the continent where they were surprised to be welcomed by berbers
apart from the marvellous and fanciful reports of this history the most probable interpretation is that the mugharrarin reached the sargasso sea a part of the ocean covered by seaweed which is very close to bermuda yet one thousand miles away from the american mainland
then while coming back they may have landed either on the azores or on madeira or even on the westernmost canary island el hierro because of the sheep
last the story with the inhabited island might have occurred either on tenerife or on gran canaria where the mugharrarin presumably met members of the guanche tribe
this would explain why some of them could speak arabic some sporadic contacts had been maintained between the canary islands and morocco and why they were quickly deported to morocco where they were welcomed by berbers
yet the story reported by idrisi is an indisputable account of a certain knowledge of the atlantic ocean by andalusians and moroccans
furthermore al idrisi writes an account of eight mugharrarin all from the same family who set sail from lisbon lashbuna in the first half of that century and navigated in the seaweed rich seas beyond the azores
idrisi describes an island of cormorants with which has been tentatively identified as corvo cape verde but on weak grounds
among the lesser known works of al idrisi is a medical dictionary that he compiled in which he brings down a list of simple drugs and plants and their curative effects used by physicians apothecaries and merchants in his day
the list is unique as it includes the names of drugs in as many as languages among which are spanish berber latin greek and sanskrit including some sixty hebrew terms transliterated into arabic and which are thought to have been passed down to him by andalusian jewish informants
at the end of the section on medicinal herbs which are described under each letter of the alphabet he gives an index of their entries
one of the books of herbal medicine frequently cited by al idrisi is marwan ibn ganah s kit b al tal who in turn had been influenced by the andalusian arab physician ibn juljul
al idrisi was the main character in tariq ali s book entitled a sultan in palermo
al idrisi is a major character in karol szymanowski s opera king roger
al idrisi s ideas on mare tenebrarum sea of darkness are alluded to in pascal mercier s book entitled night train to lisbon
the popular idrisi gis system developed by clark university is named after muhammad al idrisi
al idrisi is a supporting character in zeyn joukhadar s novel the map of salt and stars
