the united states navy reserve usnr known as the united states naval reserve from to is the reserve component rc of the united states navy
members of the navy reserve called reservists are enrolled in the selected reserve selres the individual ready reserve irr the full time support fts or the retired reserve program
the mission of the navy reserve is to provide strategic depth and deliver operational capabilities to the navy and marine corps team and joint forces in the full range of military operations from peace to war
the reserve consists of officers and enlisted personnel who serve in every state and territory as well as overseas as of september
the largest cohort the selres have traditionally drilled one weekend a month and two weeks of annual training during the year receiving base pay and certain special pays e g flight pay dive pay when performing inactive duty training idt aka drills and full pay and allowances while on active duty for annual training at active duty for training adt active duty for operational support ados active duty for special work adsw or under mobilization mob orders or otherwise recalled to full active duty
every state as well as guam and puerto rico has at least one navy operational support center nosc formerly the naval reserve center staffed by full time support fts personnel where the selres sailors come to do their weekend drills
the size of these centers varies greatly depending on the number of assigned reservists
they are intended mostly to handle administrative functions and classroom style training
however some noscs have more extensive training facilities including damage control trainers and small boat units
some noscs are co located on existing military facilities but most are outside the wire stand alone facilities that are often the only u s
navy representation in their communities or even the entire state
because of this noscs outside the fleet concentration areas are also heavily tasked to provide personnel both fts staff and selres for participation in funeral honors details
this service provided to the local community is one of the nosc s top two priority missions the other being training and mobilization of selres
those selres assigned to front line operational units such as naval aviators naval flight officers naval flight surgeons and enlisted personnel assigned to navy reserve or active reserve integrated ari aviation squadrons and wings or personnel assigned to major combatant command fleet and other major staff positions are typically funded for far more duty than the weekend per month two weeks per year construct often well in excess of man days per year
selres have also performed additional duty in times of war or national crisis often being recalled to full time active duty for one two or three or more years and deploying to overseas locations or aboard warships as has been recently seen during operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom
fts also known as tar training and administration of the reserve serve in uniform all year round and provide administrative support to selres and operational support for the navy
they are full time career active duty personnel but reside in the reserve component rc and perform a role similar to active guard and reserve agr air reserve technician art and army reserve technician in the air force reserve command the air national guard the u s
army reserve and the army national guard
the individual ready reserve irr do not typically drill or train regularly but can be recalled to service in a full mobilization requiring a presidential order
some irr personnel who are not currently assigned to selres billets typically senior commissioned officers in the ranks of commander or captain for whom selres billets are limited will serve in volunteer training units vtu or will be support assigned to established active duty or reserve commands while in a vtu status
these personnel will drill for points but no pay and are not eligible for annual training with pay
however they remain eligible for other forms of active duty with pay and mobilization
the largest source of irr officers in the navy reserve are commissioned from the united states merchant marine academy and comprise more than of the navy s strategic sealift officer community which is focused on strategic sealift and sea based logistics
reservists are called to active duty or mobilized as needed and are required to sign paperwork acknowledging this possibility upon enrollment in the reserve program
after the september attacks of reservists were mobilized to support combat operations
the war on terrorism has even seen the activation of a reserve squadron the vfa hunters flying f a hornet aircraft which deployed on board the uss theodore roosevelt cvn
additionally more than navy reservists have been mobilized and deployed to serve in iraq and afghanistan including more than who have done a second combat tour
they have served alongside army marine air force coast guard and service personnel from other countries performing such missions as countering deadly improvised explosive devices constructing military bases escorting ground convoys operating hospitals performing intelligence analysis guarding prisoners and doing customs inspections for units returning from deployments
reflecting the importance of reservists in the naval history of the united states the first citizen sailors put to sea even before the continental congress created the continental navy forerunner of today s u s
on june inspired to act after hearing the news of minutemen and british regulars battling on the fields of lexington and concord citizens of the seaside town of machias maine commandeered the schooner unity and engaged the british warship hms margaretta boarding her and forcing her surrender after bitter close quarters combat
in the ensuing years of the american revolution the small size of the continental navy necessitated the service of citizen sailors who put to sea manning privateers their far flung raids against the british merchant fleet as important as the sea battles of john paul jones in establishing the american naval tradition
following the american revolution the expense of maintaining a standing navy was deemed too great resulting in the selling of the last continental navy ship in
however attacks by barbary pirates against american merchant vessels in the mediterranean sea prompted a change in course in
a navy that helped give birth to the nation was now deemed essential to preserving its security which faced its most serious threat during the war of
not only did reservists raid british commerce on the high seas but they also outfitted a fleet of barges called the chesapeake bay flotilla in an effort to defend that vital body of water against british invasion
though overwhelmed by an enemy superior in numbers these men most recruited from baltimore continued to wage war on land joining in the defense of washington d c
having fought against a foreign power naval reservists faced a much different struggle with the outbreak of the civil war which divided a navy and a nation
within days of the attack president abraham lincoln authorized an increase in the personnel levels of the navy which assumed an important role in the strategy to defeat the confederacy with a blockade of the south and a campaign to secure control of the mississippi river
by war s end the navy had grown from a force numbering in to one manned by sailors
a total of men from twenty one states enlisted during the war and volunteers were present during some of the storied naval engagements of the american civil war including serving in monitor during her battle with css virginia and the daring mission to destroy the confederate ironclad css albemarle
the latter action resulted in the awarding of the medal of honor to six reserve enlisted men
with the lack of any major threat to the united states in the post civil war years the u s
navy took on the appearance and missions of the force it had in
then came publication of naval theorist captain alfred thayer mahan s landmark study the influence of sea power upon history which in part prompted a modernization of the u s
fleet and brought some of the first calls for an organized naval reserve to help man these more advanced ships
in the meantime state naval militias represented the navy s manpower reserve demonstrating their capabilities during the spanish american war in which they assisted in coastal defense and served aboard ship
militiamen from massachusetts new york michigan and maryland manned four auxiliary cruisers prairie yankee yosemite and dixie seeing action off cuba
all told some officers and enlisted men of various state naval militias answered the call to arms
as successful as the state naval militias were in the spanish american war which made the united states a world power events unfolding in europe following the turn of the century demonstrated that a modern war at sea required a federal naval reserve force
the first formally funded naval reserve force was organized around the united states merchant marine with the formation of the merchant marine reserve then called the naval auxiliary reserve in
with the outbreak of world war i in the secretary of the navy josephus daniels and his assistant a young new yorker named franklin d
roosevelt launched a campaign in congress to appropriate funding for such a force
their efforts brought passage of legislation on march creating the naval reserve force whose members served in the cockpits of biplanes and hunted enemy u boats during the great war
though the financial difficulties of the great depression and interwar isolationism translated into difficult times for the naval reserve the organizational structure persevered and expanded with the creation of naval aviation cadet program and the naval reserve officer training corps
when world war ii erupted on september the naval reserve was ready
by the summer of virtually all of its members were serving on active duty their numbers destined to swell when japanese planes roared out of a clear blue sky over pearl harbor on december
navy reserve sailors from minnesota aboard the uss ward fired the first u s
shots of world war ii by sinking a japanese mini submarine outside the entrance to pearl harbor
over the course of the ensuing four years the navy would grow from a force of to one that at its peak numbered the vast majority of them reservists including five future u s
presidents
the end of world war ii brought a different struggle in the form of the cold war which over the course of nearly five decades was waged with the haunting specter of nuclear war
cold war battlegrounds took naval reservists to korea where a massive mobilization of weekend warriors filled out the complements of ships pulled from mothballs and in some cases sent carriers to sea with almost their entire embarked air groups consisting of reserve squadrons
other calls came during the berlin crisis and vietnam and with the defense build up of the s presided over by secretary of the navy john lehman a naval reservist the naval reserve not only expanded but also took steps towards greater interoperability with the active component with respect to equipment
yet the divisions between the active and reserve cultures remained distinct
this began to change in the s as over naval reservists supported the persian gulf war s operations desert shield and desert storm which coincided with the ongoing collapse of the soviet union
since that time whether responding to the ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia or the threat of world terrorism the latter coming to the forefront in the attacks against the world trade center and the pentagon on september the naval reserve transformed from a force in waiting for massive mobilization to an integral component in carrying out the mission of the u s
in the u s
naval reserve was redesignated as the u s
navy reserve
as admiral william j
fallon stated we must remember that the reserves which represent twenty percent of our warfighting force are absolutely vital to our navy s ability to fight and win wars now and in the future
