david pierce of wired compared google home to amazon echo writing in a summary that sometimes home feels like sci fi magic
sometimes it reaches beyond its grasp and falls flat
the echo is less impressive but more reliable
pierce praised the look of google home writing that it feels minimalist thoughtful and warm in the environment and also praised its speaker describing it as richer brighter and more dynamic than the echo and loud enough to fill a room
while noting that home s use of the google assistant functioned in different ways than it does through the allo app or pixel smartphone meaning quick instructions rather than longer tasks he praised its search abilities writing that you d expect home to excel at search
it does despite some wrong search hiccups
pierce criticized its lack of interoperability with other google assistant enabled devices though he called its future potential for connecting information across google s product lines enormous
ron amadeo of ars technica praised google home s setup process and its ability to pick up voice commands even from a distance calling the latter absolutely incredible
he noted the device s limiting of its bluetooth capabilities at the time before the may update however writing that it s important to know that google home is not a bluetooth speaker it s purely a google cast device
if you want to play audio on a google home the service needs to have a google cast button
he similarly criticized the assistant s lack of cross device functionality writing that pretty much all the actions you send to a google home will stay on that google home and there s never an interaction with your phone and he noted concerns and questions regarding whether google has an intention to incorporate the functionality deeper into its product lines
additionally in his summary he wrote that why pay for a device that is less capable than an android phone
