the saundarya lahari sanskrit meaning the waves of beauty is a famous literary work in sanskrit attributed to adi shankara
some believe the first part ananda lahari was etched on mount meru by ganesha himself or by pushpadanta
sage gaudapada the teacher of shankar s teacher govinda bhagavadpada memorised the writings of pushpadanta which was carried down to adi shankara
its hundred and three shlokas verses praise the beauty grace and munificence of goddess tripura sundari as goddess parvati
norman brown translated it to english which was published as volume of the harvard oriental series in
saundarya lahari was composed in kashmir
the saundarya lahari is not only a collection of holy hymns but also a tantra textbook giving instructions on puja sri yantra and worshiping methods different hymns different yantra almost one to each shloka it describes the appropriate tantra method of performing devotion connected to each specific shloka and details the results ensuring therefrom
there are many interpretations and commentaries but best of these are arguably those that provide word to word translations as also the yantra the devotion to be performed and the results of the devotion
it is once said that adi shankara visited kailash to worship shiva and parvati
there the lord gave him a manuscript containing verses which described the many facets of the goddess as a gift to him
while shankara was returning after visiting kailash nandi stopped him on the way
he snatched the manuscript from him tore it into two took one part and gave the other to shankara
shankara desolate ran to shiva and narrated the incident to him
shiva smiling commanded him to retain the verses with him as the initial part of the verses and then write an extra verses in praise of the goddess himself
thus verses are the original work of lord shiva shedding great light on the ancient rituals of tantra yantra and various powerful mantra
verses describe the mystical experience of the union of shiva and shakti and related phenomena
in fact it opens with the assertion that only when shiva is united with shakti does he have the power to create to manifest
the remaining verses that is are composed by adi shankara himself which mainly focuses on the appearance of the goddess
all the verses are collectively known as soundarya lahari
the soundarya lahari is not only a poem
it is a tantra textbook giving instructions on puja and offerings many yantra almost one to each shloka describing the tantra technique of performing devotion connected to each specific shloka and details the results ensuing therefrom
there are many interpretations and commentaries but best of these are arguably those that provide word to word translations as also the yantra the devotion to be performed and the results of the devotion
verses are more straightforward they describe the physical beauty of the goddess and are sometimes referred to as the soundarya lahari itself
many scholars however refer to the entire text with one name namely soundarya lahari
first verses cover the detailed account of internal worship of the mother
it consists of systematic exposition of the concept of kundalini sri chakra mantra verses
this depicts the supreme reality as non dual but with a distinction between shiva and shakti the power holder and power being and will
the power that is the mother or maha tripura sundari becomes the dominant factor and the power holder or shiva becomes a substratum
the first verse itself clearly describes this idea
united with shakti shiva is endowed with power to create or otherwise he is incapable of even a movement the same idea is brought out in verse brahma creates the universe vishnu sustains rudra destroys and maheshwar absorbs every thing and assimilates into sadashiva
on receiving mandate from thy creeper like brows sadasiva restores everything into activity as in the previous cycle such prominence of the mother can be seen in verses and also
there are several legends about this work
one legend says that once adi shankara visited kailash to worship shiva and parvati
there the lord gave him a manuscript containing verses which described the many facets of the goddess as a gift to him
while shankara was returning after visiting kailash nandi stopped him on the way
he snatched the manuscript from him tore it into two took one part and gave the other to shankara
shankara desolate ran to shiva and narrated the incident to him
shiva smilingly commanded him to retain the verses with him as the initial part of the verses and then write an extra verses in praise of the goddess himself
thus verses are the original work of lord shiva shedding great light on the ancient rituals of tantra yantra and various powerful mantra
the remaining verses that is are composed by adi shankara himself which mainly focuses on the appearance of the goddess
yet another legend says that once when adi shankara was visiting kailash lord shiva was writing about the beauty of goddess parvati on the walls of their home
shiva rubbed what he wrote as he didn t want adi shankara who was an outsider reading about the beauty of his wife
but adi shankara had seen some part of the writings and with his superior mind recollected the rest
thus he composed the soundarya lahari waves of beauty of the devi
