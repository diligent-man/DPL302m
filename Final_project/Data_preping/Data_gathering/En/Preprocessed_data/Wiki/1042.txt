Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof is a railway station in the German city of Karlsruhe The station is classified as a Category station as it is a major hub where several railways connect
When the Baden Mainline was built between Mannheim and Basel the original Karlsruhe station was built on Kriegsstra e between Ettlinger Tor and Mendelssohnplatz about metres south of Karlsruher Marktplatz the central square of Karlsruhe The station was designed by Friedrich Eisenlohr and it was opened on April with two platforms From the beginning it was designed as a through station South of the station there was a locomotive depot and to its east there was a freight yard and a central workshop
It was built to Irish gauge mm ft in as were all railways built by the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway in the early days It was converted to standard gauge in In the following years other routes were connected to Karlsruhe station in the line to Stuttgart in the Maxau Railway German Maxaubahn connecting with the Palatinate in the Rhine Railway to Mannheim in the Kraichgau Railway and in the strategic railway from Graben Neudorf via Rastatt to Haguenau The tracks ran at ground level and the approach lines were built with sharp curves because of the confined spaces
The increased rail traffic and the resulting frequent closures of the level crossings disrupted the ever growing city and made its expansion more difficult After several years of discussion which considered among other things the raising of the level of the tracks the Baden parliament decided in to relocate the station to a site one kilometre south of the existing site
After the opening of the new station in the existing railway station lost its function as a railway station and continued to be used until the s as a market hall Today the Baden State Theatre is located on the former railway yard Some of the remaining tracks were used over the decades as sidings but have since been entirely removed The freight yard was used as a repair shop until Ludwig Erhard Allee was built in the meantime on the grounds of the freight yard the workshop area is currently being redeveloped with blocks of flats
The station building which continues in use was built about a kilometre south of its predecessor between S dstadt and the marshalling yard Construction began in to the plans of August St rzenacker and the station was opened on the night of October The station and access tracks were built in the district of Beiertheim and also occupied a significant part of the Stadtgarten city garden the location of Karlsruhe Zoo and the garden behind the Stephanienbad now Paul Gerhardt church This resulted in the cutting down of the then oldest eastern cottonwood poplar in Europe
The platforms and the approach tracks were built on an embankment with access via a pedestrian underpass The entrance building is on the north side of the tracks The building has both neoclassical and Art Nouveau features East of the station building there is a second underpass which originally served as an outlet for arriving passengers and was used for a time mainly as an underground car park and a few years ago for secure bicycle parking but it is now back in use as a pedestrian underpass A five span steel concourse was built to cover five island platforms Later an eleventh platform track was built and in the s three more platform tracks were created south of the station concourse West of the station building a station annex was built with four terminal tracks where the lines from the Palatinate and Graben Neudorf via Eggenstein terminated The construction of the new station also affected the access routes Thus the former stations at M hlburger Tor in Karlsruhe and in Beiertheim and R ppurr were closed The stations in M hlburg and Durlach were relocated and the tracks of the line to M hlacker which had previously ended in Durlach were extended to the new Hauptbahnhof so that there were now four tracks between Durlach and Karlsruhe Also the new Karlsruhe West station was opened for passenger services
The station forecourt was designed by Wilhelm Vitalli The square with a rectangular ground plan is surrounded by arcades At the end of the square to the east and the west are two hotel buildings and on the northern side is the entrance to the Stadtgarten and the commercial buildings The station forecourt is a typical ensemble of urban architecture from the last years before the First World War East of the station was the railway post office which had a railway siding on the tramway as well
A week before the opening of the station a tram line was opened between Ettlinger Tor and the new station which after removal of the access tracks to the old station was connected to the city centre A new terminus for the Alb Valley Railway Albtalbahn was opened meters west of the station in Ebertstra e in
In the Second World War the station was damaged by bombing but not destroyed so that it could be rebuilt after the war The period after was characterised by a continuous modernisation of the station and the forecourt In the electrification of the railway was completed In the rebuilding of the station forecourt began where in the spirit of the times a pedestrian underpass was created and the car and tram traffic were reorganised In a new interlocking controlled by pushing buttons was put into operation
At the end of the s the station was expanded to include three through tracks and a parking garage was built This was intended to be followed by a redesign of the area immediately south of the station but this has still not been implemented Two platforms were extended and modernised for Karlsruhe's inclusion in the Intercity Express network and the access stairs were complemented with lifts and escalators
In there was a further reorganisation of the station forecourt during which the pedestrian underpass was closed and the tram station was rebuilt In a rail link was built between the western track south of the station and the Albtalbahnhof the Karlsruhe station of the Alb Valley Railway over which Stadtbahn light rail services could run to Rastatt as line S S of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn between the rail network and the tram network As a result two terminating tracks and were no longer necessary and in the mid s they were closed so the station now has through tracks and two terminating tracks and
