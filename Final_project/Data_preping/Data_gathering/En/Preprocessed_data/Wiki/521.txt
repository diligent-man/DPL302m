The Boeing Model 307 Stratoliner is an American four-engine monoplane airliner that entered commercial service in July 1940
It was the first airliner to enter revenue service with a pressurized cabin, which with supercharged engines, allowed it to cruise above the weather
As such it represented a major advance, and was capable of cruising at 220 mph (350 km/h) to the contemporary Douglas DC-3s 160 mph (260 km/h), and could fly at 20,000 ft (6,100 m) compared to 8,000 ft (2,400 m).
In commercial service the Model 307 had a crew of five to six, including a flight engineer, two flight attendants and an optional navigator, and had a capacity for 33 passengers which later modifications increased to 38
Examples were also flown as the Boeing C-75 Stratoliner by the United States Army Air Forces.
In 1935, Boeing designed a four-engine airliner in parallel with the Boeing Model 299 B-17 heavy bomber then in development, as the Model 307
It combined the wings, tail, rudder, landing gear, and engines from the B-17 with a new, pressurized circular cross-section fuselage with a maximum diameter of 138 in (3,500 mm).
The first aircraft built, registration NX19901 crashed on March 18, 1939 while being demonstrated to KLM's representatives
After takeoff the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 11,000 ft (3,400 m) where stability tests were made
While carrying out side-slips, it entered an inadvertent spin following a stall and made two to three turns before the engines were used to stop the spin
While recovering from the subsequent dive, the wings and horizontal tail surfaces were over stressed and failed due to excessive loads
All ten aboard were killed, which included TWA's representative, KLM's technical director, a Dutch Air Ministry representative, Boeing's test pilot, as well as their Chief Aerodynamicist and their Chief Engineer.
Subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of a dorsal fin extended from the vertical tail fixed the problem, which was then air tested on NC19903, and also incorporated into Boeing's rear fuselage redesign for the B-17E bomber.
The Stratoliners were normally flown with a pilot and co-pilot, and unusually for the time, both Pan Am and TWA aircraft carried a flight engineer to reduce the workload on the two pilots, by monitoring the engines for any problems and fine tuning them, while they also controlled fuel consumption from each of the tanks to maintain the aircraft's fore-aft and lateral balance
Too much fuel used in one tank could result in the aircraft becoming uncontrollable
They also monitored other aircraft systems, including the hydraulics used for undercarriage retraction and the cabin pressurization system.
Pan Am aircraft had one additional crew member compared to TWA aircraft
Because they made long overwater flights, they carried a navigator, who wasn't considered necessary for overland flights, which were served by a network of beacons across the continent.
Both TWA and Pan Am normally carried two flight attendants
TWA began using women as cabin crew in late 1935, which they called Hostesses, while Pan Am continued to use male stewards until late in WW2.
Following the entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, long-range transports were needed to transport government and military officials around the globe, and many aircraft, including TWA's Boeing 307s, were pressed into service.
Beginning in February 1942, these were flown to Albuquerque, New Mexico for conversion to meet military needs, which included the removal of pressurization equipment to save weight, removal of some of the forward seats, and alteration of two of the four forward sleeper compartments to provide space for an additional five 212.5 US gal (804 l; 176.9 imp gal) fuel tanks and a crew rest area
The landing gear was strengthened, and the maximum takeoff weight increased from 45,000 to 56,000 lb (20,000 to 25,000 kg), while the exterior was painted olive drab with grey undersides.
After a couple of years the USAAF found it now had enough long range transports and sold the fleet back to TWA paid to have them reconverted back to civil standard under the SA-307B-1 designation by Boeing, who replaced the wings and horizontal tail with those from the B-17G, while slightly more powerful engines were fitted and the electrical system was replaced with from the B-29 Superfortress
The cabin was redesigned and passenger capacity was increased from 33 to 38.

NC19910 delivered to Pan Am as Clipper Comet
To Aerovias Ecuatorianas as Quito HC-004 and later to Quaker City Airways as N75385
Crashed 10 May 1958.The first Boeing 307 Stratoliner NX19901 made its first flight from Boeing Field, near Seattle on December 31, 1938, prior to its intended delivery to Pan Am following testing and certification.
The first customer delivery was to millionaire Howard Hughes, who bought NX19904 for $315,000 for a round-the-world flight, hoping to break his own record of 91 hours 14 minutes set from July 10 to 14, 1938 in a Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra
Hughes' Stratoliner was fitted with extra fuel tanks and was ready for the first leg of the round-the-world attempt when Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, causing the attempt to be abandoned.
Hughes later had the extra fuel tanks removed, and had it fitted with much more powerful Wright R-2600 engines for its transformation into "The Flying Penthouse"
In 1949, Hughes spent an additional $100,000 renovating it so he could sell it, which now included a new interior designed by Raymond Loewy
Oil tycoon Glenn McCarthy bought it and named it Shamrock , for the opening of his new Shamrock Hotel, however McCarthy defaulted on payments and it was returned to Hughes
It languished unflown until 1964, when it was damaged beyond repair by a hurricane and bought for $69 by Kenneth W
London, who cut the wings and tail off, built a hull under it, and installed a pair of V-8 engines to convert it into a houseboat he named Londonaire
After various repossessions, deaths and failed sales later, it became the Cosmic Muffin, in which form it still survives.
In 1937 Pan American Airways placed the first order for two Stratoliners, which they soon increased to six
A second order for five followed, from Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA)
Pan Am had received three and TWA received its five before war intervened and civil aircraft production halted.
Ten 307s were built, three being delivered to Pan Am (NC19902 Clipper Rainbow, NC19903 Clipper Flying Cloud, and NC19910 Clipper Comet), five to TWA (NC19905 Comanche, NC19906 Cherokee, NC19907 Zuni, NC19908 Apache, and NC19909 Navajo), one aircraft went to Hughes (NX19904), and one was wrecked in testing prior to delivery
NC19906 marked as NX1940 for promotional purposes.
Deliveries to Pan Am started in March 1940
TWA received its first Stratoliner on 6 May, 1940, and the last one was delivered on 4 June, 1940
Both TWA and Pan Am carried out their first revenue flights on 8 July, 1940
TWA's Stratoliners flew between Los Angeles and New York, making three stops, while Pan Am's flew from Miami to Latin America.
On the entry of the United States into World War II, Pan Am continued operating its Stratoliners on routes to Central and South America, but under direction of the Army Air Forces' Air Transport Command,
All five TWA Stratoliners were withdrawn from operations on 24 December 1941 while TWA created a subsidiary, the Intercontinental Division (ICD), whose civilian crews would operate them on behalf of the United States Army Air Forces
The Stratoliners were sold to the USAAF, who assigned the type the C-75 designation, and each of them was given a USAAF serial number
The first of these was accepted by the USAAF on 1 March 1941 and the last one on 17 December 1942
The first service flight was made beginning 26 February, when a 307 flew to South America, before crossing the South Atlantic to Africa, and leisurely making their way to Prestwick, Scotland where they arrived on 20 April, 1942, primarily having carried munitions.
After a couple of years the USAAF found it now had enough long range transports and sold the fleet back to TWA, with the aircraft being received by them between 6 January 1944 and 19 December 1944.
Two main routes were flown between Washington, D.C
and Cairo across the South Atlantic, and between New York and Prestwick, Scotland, across the North Atlantic
They often flew non-stop the 2,122 mi (3,415 km) between Gander, Newfoundland and Prestwick, Scotland in the north, and the 2,500 mi (4,100 km) between Natal, Brazil and Accra, Ghana in the south
After July 1942 a refueling stop at Ascension Island was added in the South Atlantic
In the north, stops at Iceland or Greenland were often necessary, when flying west against the prevailing winds
As Douglas C-54 Skymasters took over the Gander to Prestwick route, the C-75s operated between Marrakech and Prestwick over the Atlantic.
The USAAF returned the five C-75s to TWA between 6 January 1944 and 19 December 1944
It cost TWA $2 million to have them rebuilt by Boeing and the first of them resumed passenger service on April 1, 1945
The CAA recertified these as SA-307B-1 civilian transports with their old registration numbers
TWA had the interior cabin redesigned in two sections, with ten seats forward and 28 aft.
Pan Am flew its unmodified 33-passenger Stratoliners between Miami and Havana until 1947, then sold them off to various small operators, including Aerovias Ecuatorianas (AREA)
Some later returned to the US, whilst others went to South-East Asia to replace losses there.
One aircraft was eventually purchased by the Haitian Air Force in 1954 and after plans to use it for passenger service were cancelled, it was fitted out as a Presidential transport
When François "Papa Doc" Duvalier came into power in 1957 he didn't trust his pilots, and so chose not to use it, but instead had the aircraft sold off the same year, with the money raised being used to buy five North American T-6G Texan training aircraft
This aircraft would later return to the U.S
and is now restored and at the Smithsonian Museum.
Although TWA was already committed to the larger and faster Lockheed Constellation, they only began to withdraw the Stratoliners in April 1951 having contineued to use them in domestic service, where they were replaced with the similarly sized but cheaper to operate twin-engine Martin 2-0-2
The five SA-307B-1s were sold to the French operator Aigle Azur (French for Blue Eagle) who received them between 14 May 1951 and 19 December 1951
and who used them on scheduled flights from France to North and Central Africa, and later to French Indo-China.
Three were transferred to Aigle Azur's Vietnamese subsidiary, Aigle Azur Extrême-Orient (Blue Eagle Far East), and were used in South East Asia, in various liveries and registrations, with at least one aircraft remaining in commercial use until 1974
Two aircraft remained in Europe for Mediterranean runs, especially around Corsica, operated by Airnautic
The subsidiary was sold to UAT in 1955, and this in turn merged to become UTA in 1963, but the original branding was kept until 1961
Some of these aircraft remained under contract to the ICC/CIC, running both ad hoc flights plus regular scheduled services for diplomats between various, often hostile, capitals
Aircraft write-offs required buying other surviving 307s for maintenance and continuity of service
At various times following independence, most received Laotian XW registrations, whilst maintaining the same services
Some were registered to the CITCA leasing company, and a couple formed the basis for the national-carrier Royal Air Lao's fleet.
United StatesHoward Hughes bought one aircraft.
Pan American Airways (PAA: Pan Am) received three aircraft.
Trans World Airlines (TWA) received five aircraft.
Quaker City Airways, ex-Pan Am airframe. EcuadorAerovias Ecuatorianas CA/AREA Ecuador, as HC-004. FranceAigle Azur operated ex-TWA aircraft bought in 1951.
Commission Internationale de Contrôle (CIC) operated the Aigle Azur aircraft, including those of its affiliates, such as the CITCA leasing company which were under contract to the CIC/ICC.Airnautic operated two aircraft. LaosRoyal Air Lao operated two ex-Aigle Azur aircraft. CambodiaRoyal Air Cambodge operated one aircraft with French registration.
Cambodia Air Commercial operated one aircraft, under a Laos registration. HaitiHaitian Air Corps
Compagnie Haïtienne de Transports Aériens (CoHaTA) (a Military transport organization) operated one ex-Pan Am airframe intended as a presidential transport from 1954 until sold and the money used to buy 5 North American T-6G trainers in 1957. United StatesUnited States Army Air Forces operated five ex-TWA SA-307Bs as C-75s
Three Pan Am 307s operated under the direction of the USAAF but ownership remained with Pan Am.According to the Aviation Safety Network, the Boeing 307 was involved in eight hull-loss incidents with 67 fatalities
Four of the eight incidents involved fatalities, with one being shot down while in a war zone.
March 18, 1939: Boeing's prototype 307 NX19901 crashed near Mt
Rainier during a test flight, killing all ten on board
The recovery from a spin caused the aircraft to break up.
May 10, 1958: Quaker City Airways S-307 N75385 force-landed near Madras, Oregon on a test flight, after an explosion and fire in the cabin, possibly due to a fuel leak, and was consumed by the fire
Both pilots survived.
May 22, 1961: Aigle Azur Extrême Orient S-307 F-BHHR was blown off the runway and crashed at Tan Son Nhat International Airport while landing after the number four engine failed in flight during a non-scheduled Saigon-Vientiane service
The 28 passengers and crew survived, but the aircraft was written off.
December 29, 1962: Airnautic SA-307B-1 F-BELZ collided with Monte Renoso, on Corsica due to crew error while on a Bastia-Nice-Ajaccio-Nice-Bastia flight, killing all 25 on board in the worst accident involving the 307.
October 18, 1965: International Control Commission SA-307B-1 F-BELV disappeared on a scheduled non-commercial Vientiane-Hanoi flight with 13 on board and was probably shot down.
February 27, 1971: Royal Air Lao SA-307B-1 XW-PGR struck a Royal Lao Air Force Douglas C-47 while landing at Luang Prabang, damaging the wing
A lack of spares prevented repairs.
June 27, 1974: Cambodia Air Commercial SA-307B-1 XW-TFR force-landed in a rice field shortly after takeoff from Battambang Airport en route to Phnom Penh due to poor maintenance which caused the failure of three engines
The right wing struck a tree and separated just before landing
19 of 39 on board died.
March 13, 1975: Royal Air Lao SA-307B-1 XW-TFP force-landed in the Mekong River in Laos while on a Hong Kong-Vientiane cargo service
Both pilots were held prisoner by the Pathet Lao for two months
The wreck was located in 1986.The sole intact Boeing 307 Stratoliner, NC19903 is preserved in flying condition at the Smithsonian's Steven F
Udvar-Hazy Center
After having been restored to flying condition, it was being delivered to the Smithsonian on what was to be its last flight when it ran out of fuel and ditched in Elliott Bay near Seattle, Washington in March 2002
Despite the incident, it was raised and again restored, and it completed its flight to the Smithsonian, where it was placed on display.
The fuselage of Howard Hughes' 307 (NX19904) also survives, although it was stripped of flying surfaces and converted into the houseboat Cosmic Muffin
The aircraft was awaiting restoration at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in the early 1960s when it was severely damaged in a hurricane after its tiedowns failed and it was blown into trees
The aircraft was later salvaged for its conversion into a house boat and the interior remains notable for the additions made by Howard Hughes
It is now part of the Florida Air Museum's collection.
