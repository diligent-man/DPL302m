The Boeing Model Stratoliner is an American four-engine monoplane airliner that entered commercial service in July
It was the first airliner to enter revenue service with a pressurized cabin which with supercharged engines allowed it to cruise above the weather
As such it represented a major advance and was capable of cruising at mph kmh to the contemporary Douglas DC-s mph kmh and could fly at ft m compared to ft m
In commercial service the Model had a crew of five to six including a flight engineer two flight attendants and an optional navigator and had a capacity for passengers which later modifications increased to
Examples were also flown as the Boeing C- Stratoliner by the United States Army Air Forces
In Boeing designed a four-engine airliner in parallel with the Boeing Model B- heavy bomber then in development as the Model
It combined the wings tail rudder landing gear and engines from the B- with a new pressurized circular cross-section fuselage with a maximum diameter of in mm
The first aircraft built registration NX crashed on March while being demonstrated to KLM's representatives
After takeoff the aircraft climbed to an altitude of ft m where stability tests were made
While carrying out side-slips it entered an inadvertent spin following a stall and made two to three turns before the engines were used to stop the spin
While recovering from the subsequent dive the wings and horizontal tail surfaces were over stressed and failed due to excessive loads
All ten aboard were killed which included TWA's representative KLM's technical director a Dutch Air Ministry representative Boeing's test pilot as well as their Chief Aerodynamicist and their Chief Engineer
Subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of a dorsal fin extended from the vertical tail fixed the problem which was then air tested on NC and also incorporated into Boeing's rear fuselage redesign for the B-E bomber
The Stratoliners were normally flown with a pilot and co-pilot and unusually for the time both Pan Am and TWA aircraft carried a flight engineer to reduce the workload on the two pilots by monitoring the engines for any problems and fine tuning them while they also controlled fuel consumption from each of the tanks to maintain the aircraft's fore-aft and lateral balance
Too much fuel used in one tank could result in the aircraft becoming uncontrollable
They also monitored other aircraft systems including the hydraulics used for undercarriage retraction and the cabin pressurization system
Pan Am aircraft had one additional crew member compared to TWA aircraft
Because they made long overwater flights they carried a navigator who wasn't considered necessary for overland flights which were served by a network of beacons across the continent
Both TWA and Pan Am normally carried two flight attendants
TWA began using women as cabin crew in late which they called Hostesses while Pan Am continued to use male stewards until late in WW
Following the entry of the United States into World War II in December long-range transports were needed to transport government and military officials around the globe and many aircraft including TWA's Boeing s were pressed into service
Beginning in February these were flown to Albuquerque New Mexico for conversion to meet military needs which included the removal of pressurization equipment to save weight removal of some of the forward seats and alteration of two of the four forward sleeper compartments to provide space for an additional five US gal l imp gal fuel tanks and a crew rest area
The landing gear was strengthened and the maximum takeoff weight increased from to lb to kg while the exterior was painted olive drab with grey undersides
After a couple of years the USAAF found it now had enough long range transports and sold the fleet back to TWA paid to have them reconverted back to civil standard under the SA-B- designation by Boeing who replaced the wings and horizontal tail with those from the B-G while slightly more powerful engines were fitted and the electrical system was replaced with from the B- Superfortress
The cabin was redesigned and passenger capacity was increased from to

Crashed May The first Boeing Stratoliner NX made its first flight from Boeing Field near Seattle on December prior to its intended delivery to Pan Am following testing and certification
The first customer delivery was to millionaire Howard Hughes who bought NX for for a round-the-world flight hoping to break his own record of hours minutes set from July to in a Lockheed Model Super Electra
Hughes' Stratoliner was fitted with extra fuel tanks and was ready for the first leg of the round-the-world attempt when Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September causing the attempt to be abandoned
Hughes later had the extra fuel tanks removed and had it fitted with much more powerful Wright R- engines for its transformation into The Flying Penthouse
In Hughes spent an additional renovating it so he could sell it which now included a new interior designed by Raymond Loewy
Oil tycoon Glenn McCarthy bought it and named it Shamrock for the opening of his new Shamrock Hotel however McCarthy defaulted on payments and it was returned to Hughes
It languished unflown until when it was damaged beyond repair by a hurricane and bought for by Kenneth W
London who cut the wings and tail off built a hull under it and installed a pair of V- engines to convert it into a houseboat he named Londonaire
After various repossessions deaths and failed sales later it became the Cosmic Muffin in which form it still survives
In Pan American Airways placed the first order for two Stratoliners which they soon increased to six
A second order for five followed from Transcontinental Western Air TWA
Pan Am had received three and TWA received its five before war intervened and civil aircraft production halted
Ten s were built three being delivered to Pan Am NC Clipper Rainbow NC Clipper Flying Cloud and NC Clipper Comet five to TWA NC Comanche NC Cherokee NC Zuni NC Apache and NC Navajo one aircraft went to Hughes NX and one was wrecked in testing prior to delivery
NC marked as NX for promotional purposes
Deliveries to Pan Am started in March
TWA received its first Stratoliner on May and the last one was delivered on June
Both TWA and Pan Am carried out their first revenue flights on July
TWA's Stratoliners flew between Los Angeles and New York making three stops while Pan Am's flew from Miami to Latin America
On the entry of the United States into World War II Pan Am continued operating its Stratoliners on routes to Central and South America but under direction of the Army Air Forces' Air Transport Command
All five TWA Stratoliners were withdrawn from operations on December while TWA created a subsidiary the Intercontinental Division ICD whose civilian crews would operate them on behalf of the United States Army Air Forces
The Stratoliners were sold to the USAAF who assigned the type the C- designation and each of them was given a USAAF serial number
The first of these was accepted by the USAAF on March and the last one on December
The first service flight was made beginning February when a flew to South America before crossing the South Atlantic to Africa and leisurely making their way to Prestwick Scotland where they arrived on April primarily having carried munitions
After a couple of years the USAAF found it now had enough long range transports and sold the fleet back to TWA with the aircraft being received by them between January and December
Two main routes were flown between Washington DC
and Cairo across the South Atlantic and between New York and Prestwick Scotland across the North Atlantic
They often flew non-stop the mi km between Gander Newfoundland and Prestwick Scotland in the north and the mi km between Natal Brazil and Accra Ghana in the south
After July a refueling stop at Ascension Island was added in the South Atlantic
In the north stops at Iceland or Greenland were often necessary when flying west against the prevailing winds
As Douglas C- Skymasters took over the Gander to Prestwick route the C-s operated between Marrakech and Prestwick over the Atlantic
The USAAF returned the five C-s to TWA between January and December
It cost TWA million to have them rebuilt by Boeing and the first of them resumed passenger service on April
The CAA recertified these as SA-B- civilian transports with their old registration numbers
TWA had the interior cabin redesigned in two sections with ten seats forward and aft
Pan Am flew its unmodified -passenger Stratoliners between Miami and Havana until then sold them off to various small operators including Aerovias Ecuatorianas AREA
Some later returned to the US whilst others went to South-East Asia to replace losses there
One aircraft was eventually purchased by the Haitian Air Force in and after plans to use it for passenger service were cancelled it was fitted out as a Presidential transport
When Franois Papa Doc Duvalier came into power in he didn't trust his pilots and so chose not to use it but instead had the aircraft sold off the same year with the money raised being used to buy five North American T-G Texan training aircraft
This aircraft would later return to the US
and is now restored and at the Smithsonian Museum
Although TWA was already committed to the larger and faster Lockheed Constellation they only began to withdraw the Stratoliners in April having contineued to use them in domestic service where they were replaced with the similarly sized but cheaper to operate twin-engine Martin --
The five SA-B-s were sold to the French operator Aigle Azur French for Blue Eagle who received them between May and December
and who used them on scheduled flights from France to North and Central Africa and later to French Indo-China
Three were transferred to Aigle Azur's Vietnamese subsidiary Aigle Azur Extrme-Orient Blue Eagle Far East and were used in South East Asia in various liveries and registrations with at least one aircraft remaining in commercial use until
Two aircraft remained in Europe for Mediterranean runs especially around Corsica operated by Airnautic
The subsidiary was sold to UAT in and this in turn merged to become UTA in but the original branding was kept until
Some of these aircraft remained under contract to the ICCCIC running both ad hoc flights plus regular scheduled services for diplomats between various often hostile capitals
Aircraft write-offs required buying other surviving s for maintenance and continuity of service
At various times following independence most received Laotian XW registrations whilst maintaining the same services
Some were registered to the CITCA leasing company and a couple formed the basis for the national-carrier Royal Air Lao's fleet
Pan American Airways PAA Pan Am received three aircraft
Trans World Airlines TWA received five aircraft
Quaker City Airways ex-Pan Am airframe EcuadorAerovias Ecuatorianas CAAREA Ecuador as HC- FranceAigle Azur operated ex-TWA aircraft bought in
Commission Internationale de Contrle CIC operated the Aigle Azur aircraft including those of its affiliates such as the CITCA leasing company which were under contract to the CICICCAirnautic operated two aircraft LaosRoyal Air Lao operated two ex-Aigle Azur aircraft CambodiaRoyal Air Cambodge operated one aircraft with French registration

Compagnie Hatienne de Transports Ariens CoHaTA a Military transport organization operated one ex-Pan Am airframe intended as a presidential transport from until sold and the money used to buy North American T-G trainers in United StatesUnited States Army Air Forces operated five ex-TWA SA-Bs as C-s
Three Pan Am s operated under the direction of the USAAF but ownership remained with Pan AmAccording to the Aviation Safety Network the Boeing was involved in eight hull-loss incidents with fatalities
Four of the eight incidents involved fatalities with one being shot down while in a war zone
March Boeing's prototype NX crashed near Mt
Rainier during a test flight killing all ten on board
The recovery from a spin caused the aircraft to break up
May Quaker City Airways S- N force-landed near Madras Oregon on a test flight after an explosion and fire in the cabin possibly due to a fuel leak and was consumed by the fire
May Aigle Azur Extrme Orient S- F-BHHR was blown off the runway and crashed at Tan Son Nhat International Airport while landing after the number four engine failed in flight during a non-scheduled Saigon-Vientiane service
The passengers and crew survived but the aircraft was written off
December Airnautic SA-B- F-BELZ collided with Monte Renoso on Corsica due to crew error while on a Bastia-Nice-Ajaccio-Nice-Bastia flight killing all on board in the worst accident involving the
October International Control Commission SA-B- F-BELV disappeared on a scheduled non-commercial Vientiane-Hanoi flight with on board and was probably shot down
February Royal Air Lao SA-B- XW-PGR struck a Royal Lao Air Force Douglas C- while landing at Luang Prabang damaging the wing
June Cambodia Air Commercial SA-B- XW-TFR force-landed in a rice field shortly after takeoff from Battambang Airport en route to Phnom Penh due to poor maintenance which caused the failure of three engines
The right wing struck a tree and separated just before landing
March Royal Air Lao SA-B- XW-TFP force-landed in the Mekong River in Laos while on a Hong Kong-Vientiane cargo service
Both pilots were held prisoner by the Pathet Lao for two months
The wreck was located in The sole intact Boeing Stratoliner NC is preserved in flying condition at the Smithsonian's Steven F
After having been restored to flying condition it was being delivered to the Smithsonian on what was to be its last flight when it ran out of fuel and ditched in Elliott Bay near Seattle Washington in March
Despite the incident it was raised and again restored and it completed its flight to the Smithsonian where it was placed on display
The fuselage of Howard Hughes' NX also survives although it was stripped of flying surfaces and converted into the houseboat Cosmic Muffin
The aircraft was awaiting restoration at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in the early s when it was severely damaged in a hurricane after its tiedowns failed and it was blown into trees
The aircraft was later salvaged for its conversion into a house boat and the interior remains notable for the additions made by Howard Hughes
It is now part of the Florida Air Museum's collection
