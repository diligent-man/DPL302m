the maurya empire was a geographically extensive iron age historical power in south asia based in magadha founded by chandragupta maurya in bce and existing in loose knit fashion until bce
the maurya empire was centralized by the conquest of the indo gangetic plain and its capital city was located at pataliputra modern patna
outside this imperial center the empire s geographical extent was dependent on the loyalty of military commanders who controlled the armed cities sprinkling it
during ashoka s rule ca
bce the empire briefly controlled the major urban hubs and arteries of the indian subcontinent excepting the deep south
it declined for about years after ashoka s rule and dissolved in bce with the assassination of brihadratha by pushyamitra shunga and foundation of the shunga dynasty in magadha
chandragupta maurya raised an army with the assistance of chanakya author of arthasastra and overthrew the nanda empire in c bce
chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western india by conquering the satraps left by alexander the great and by bce the empire had fully occupied northwestern india
the mauryan empire then defeated seleucus i a diadochus and founder of the seleucid empire during the seleucid mauryan war thus acquiring territory west of the indus river
under the mauryas internal and external trade agriculture and economic activities thrived and expanded across south asia due to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance administration and security
the maurya dynasty built a precursor of the grand trunk road from patliputra to taxila
after the kalinga war the empire experienced nearly half a century of centralized rule under ashoka
ashoka s embrace of buddhism and sponsorship of buddhist missionaries allowed for the expansion of that faith into sri lanka northwest india and central asia
the population of south asia during the mauryan period has been estimated to be between and million
the empire s period of dominion was marked by exceptional creativity in art architecture inscriptions and produced texts but also by the consolidation of caste in the gangetic plain and the declining rights of women in the mainstream indo aryan speaking regions of india
archaeologically the period of mauryan rule in south asia falls into the era of northern black polished ware nbpw
the arthashastra and the edicts of ashoka are the primary sources of written records of mauryan times
the lion capital of ashoka at sarnath is the national emblem of the republic of india
the name maurya does not occur in ashoka s inscriptions or the contemporary greek accounts such as megasthenes s indica but it is attested by the following sources
the junagadh rock inscription of rudradaman c
ce prefixes maurya to the names chandragupta and ashoka
the puranas c
th century ce or earlier use maurya as a dynastic appellation
the buddhist texts state that chandragupta belonged to the moriya clan of the shakyas the tribe to which gautama buddha belonged
the jain texts state that chandragupta was the son of a royal superintendent of peacocks mayura poshaka
tamil sangam literature also designate them as moriyar and mention them after the nandas
kuntala inscription from the town of bandanikke north mysore of th century ad chronologically mention mauryya as one of the dynasties which ruled the region according to some scholars kharavela s hathigumpha inscription nd st century bc mentions era of maurya empire as muriya kala mauryan era but this reading is disputed other scholars such as epigraphist d
sircar read the phrase as mukhiya kala the principal art
according to the buddhist tradition the ancestors of the maurya kings had settled in a region where peacocks mora in pali were abundant
therefore they came to be known as moriyas literally belonging to the place of peacocks
according to another buddhist account these ancestors built a city called moriya nagara moriya city which was so called because it was built with the bricks coloured like peacocks necks
the dynasty s connection to the peacocks as mentioned in the buddhist and jain traditions seems to be corroborated by archaeological evidence
for example peacock figures are found on the ashoka pillar at nandangarh and several sculptures on the great stupa of sanchi
based on this evidence modern scholars theorize that the peacock may have been the dynasty s emblem
some later authors such as dhundiraja a commentator on the mudrarakshasa and an annotator of the vishnu purana state that the word maurya is derived from mura and the mother of the first maurya king
however the puranas themselves make no mention of mura and do not talk of any relation between the nanda and the maurya dynasties
dhundiraja s derivation of the word seems to be his own invention according to the sanskrit rules the derivative of the feminine name mura iast mur would be maureya the term maurya can only be derived from the masculine mura
prior to the maurya empire the nanda empire ruled over most of the indian subcontinent
the nanda empire was a large militaristic and economically powerful empire due to conquering the mahajanapadas
according to several legends chanakya travelled to pataliputra magadha the capital of the nanda empire where chanakya worked for the nandas as a minister
however chanakya was insulted by the emperor dhana nanda of the nanda dynasty and chanakya swore revenge and vowed to destroy the nanda empire
he had to flee in order to save his life and went to taxila a notable center of learning to work as a teacher
on one of his travels chanakya witnessed some young men playing a rural game practicing a pitched battle
he was impressed by the young chandragupta and saw royal qualities in him as someone fit to rule
meanwhile alexander the great was leading his indian campaigns and ventured into punjab
his army mutinied at the beas river and refused to advance further eastward when confronted by another army
alexander returned to babylon and re deployed most of his troops west of the indus river
soon after alexander died in babylon in bce his empire fragmented into independent kingdoms led by his generals
the maurya empire was established in the magadha region under the leadership of chandragupta maurya and his mentor chanakya
chandragupta was taken to taxila by chanakya and was tutored about statecraft and governing
requiring an army chandragupta recruited and annexed local military republics such as the yaudheyas that had resisted alexanders empire
the mauryan army quickly rose to become the prominent regional power in the north west of the indian subcontinent
the mauryan army then conquered the satraps established by the macedonians
ancient greek historians nearchus onesictrius and aristobolus have provided lot of information about the mauryan empire
the greek generals eudemus and peithon ruled in the indus valley until around bce when chandragupta maurya with the help of chanakya who was now his advisor fought and drove out the greek governors and subsequently brought the indus valley under the control of his new seat of power in magadha
chandragupta maurya s ancestry is shrouded in mystery and controversy
on one hand a number of ancient indian accounts such as the drama mudrarakshasa signet ring of rakshasa rakshasa was the prime minister of magadha by vishakhadatta describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the nanda family
a kshatriya clan known as the mauryas are referred to in the earliest buddhist texts mahaparinibbana sutta
however any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence
chandragupta first emerges in greek accounts as sandrokottos
as a young man he is said to have met alexander
chanakya is said to have met the nanda king angered him and made a narrow escape
historically reliable details of chandragupta s campaign against nanda empire are unavailable and legends written centuries later are inconsistent
buddhist jain and hindu texts claim magadha was ruled by the nanda dynasty which with chanakya s counsel chandragupta conquered nanda empire
the army of chandragupta and chanakya first conquered the nanda outer territories and finally besieged the nanda capital pataliputra
in contrast to the easy victory in buddhist sources the hindu and jain texts state that the campaign was bitterly fought because the nanda dynasty had a powerful and well trained army
the buddhist mahavamsa tika and jain parishishtaparvan records chandragupta s army unsuccessfully attacking the nanda capital
chandragupta and chanakya then began a campaign at the frontier of the nanda empire gradually conquering various territories on their way to the nanda capital
he then refined his strategy by establishing garrisons in the conquered territories and finally besieged the nanda capital pataliputra
there dhana nanda accepted defeat the conquest was fictionalised in mudrarakshasa play it contains narratives not found in other versions of the chanakya chandragupta legend
because of this difference thomas trautmann suggests that most of it is fictional or legendary without any historical basis
radha kumud mukherjee similarly considers mudrakshasa play without historical basis
these legends state that the nanda king was defeated deposed and exiled by some accounts while buddhist accounts claim he was killed
with the defeat of nanda chandragupta maurya founded the maurya empire
after the death of alexander the great in bce chandragupta led a series of campaigns in bce to take satrapies in the indus valley and northwest india
when alexander s remaining forces were routed returning westwards seleucus i nicator fought to defend these territories
not many details of the campaigns are known from ancient sources
seleucus was defeated and retreated into the mountainous region of afghanistan
the two rulers concluded a peace treaty in bce including a marital alliance
under its terms chandragupta received the satrapies of paropamisadae kamboja and gandhara and arachosia kandhahar and gedrosia balochistan
seleucus i received the war elephants that were to have a decisive role in his victory against western hellenistic kings at the battle of ipsus in bce
diplomatic relations were established and several greeks such as the historian megasthenes deimakos and dionysius resided at the mauryan court
megasthenes in particular was a notable greek ambassador in the court of chandragupta maurya
according to arrian ambassador megasthenes c c bce lived in arachosia and travelled to pataliputra
megasthenes description of mauryan society as freedom loving gave seleucus a means to avoid invasion however underlying seleucus decision was the improbability of success
in later years seleucus successors maintained diplomatic relations with the empire based on similar accounts from returning travellers
chandragupta established a strong centralised state with an administration at pataliputra which according to megasthenes was surrounded by a wooden wall pierced by gates and towers
aelian although not expressly quoting megasthenes nor mentioning pataliputra described indian palaces as superior in splendor to persia s susa or ecbatana
the architecture of the city seems to have had many similarities with persian cities of the period
chandragupta s son bindusara extended the rule of the mauryan empire towards southern india
the famous tamil poet mamulanar of the sangam literature described how areas south of the deccan plateau which comprised tamil country was invaded by the maurya army using troops from karnataka
mamulanar states that vadugar people who resided in andhra karnataka regions immediately to the north of tamil nadu formed the vanguard of the mauryan army
he also had a greek ambassador at his court named deimachus
according to plutarch chandragupta maurya subdued all of india and justin also observed that chandragupta maurya was in possession of india
these accounts are corroborated by tamil sangam literature which mentions about mauryan invasion with their south indian allies and defeat of their rivals at podiyil hill in tirunelveli district in present day tamil nadu
chandragupta renounced his throne and followed jain teacher bhadrabahu
he is said to have lived as an ascetic at shravanabelagola for several years before fasting to death as per the jain practice of sallekhana
bindusara was born to chandragupta the founder of the mauryan empire
this is attested by several sources including the various puranas and the mahavamsa
he is attested by the buddhist texts such as dipavamsa and mahavamsa bindusaro the jain texts such as parishishta parvan as well as the hindu texts such as vishnu purana vindusara
according to the th century jain writer hemachandra s parishishta parvan the name of bindusara s mother was durdhara
some greek sources also mention him by the name amitrochates or its variations
historian upinder singh estimates that bindusara ascended the throne around bce
bindusara just years old inherited a large empire that consisted of what is now northern central and eastern parts of india along with parts of afghanistan and baluchistan
bindusara extended this empire to the southern part of india as far as what is now known as karnataka
he brought sixteen states under the mauryan empire and thus conquered almost all of the indian peninsula he is said to have conquered the land between the two seas the peninsular region between the bay of bengal and the arabian sea
bindusara did not conquer the friendly tamil kingdoms of the cholas ruled by king ilamcetcenni the pandyas and cheras
apart from these southern states kalinga modern odisha was the only kingdom in india that did not form part of bindusara s empire
it was later conquered by his son ashoka who served as the viceroy of ujjaini during his father s reign which highlights the importance of the town
bindusara s life has not been documented as well as that of his father chandragupta or of his son ashoka
chanakya continued to serve as prime minister during his reign
according to the medieval tibetan scholar taranatha who visited india chanakya helped bindusara to destroy the nobles and kings of the sixteen kingdoms and thus to become absolute master of the territory between the eastern and western oceans
during his rule the citizens of taxila revolted twice
the reason for the first revolt was the maladministration of susima his eldest son
the reason for the second revolt is unknown but bindusara could not suppress it in his lifetime
it was crushed by ashoka after bindusara s death
bindusara maintained friendly diplomatic relations with the hellenic world
deimachus was the ambassador of seleucid emperor antiochus i at bindusara s court
diodorus states that the king of palibothra pataliputra the mauryan capital welcomed a greek author iambulus
this king is usually identified as bindusara
pliny states that the egyptian king philadelphus sent an envoy named dionysius to india
according to sailendra nath sen this appears to have happened during bindusara s reign
unlike his father chandragupta who at a later stage converted to jainism bindusara believed in the ajivika sect
bindusara s guru pingalavatsa janasana was a brahmin of the ajivika sect
bindusara s wife queen subhadrangi queen dharma aggamahesi was a brahmin also of the ajivika sect from champa present bhagalpur district
bindusara is credited with giving several grants to brahmin monasteries brahmana bhatto
historical evidence suggests that bindusara died in the s bce
according to upinder singh bindusara died around bce
alain dani lou believes that he died around bce
sailendra nath sen believes that he died around bce and that his death was followed by a four year struggle of succession after which his son ashoka became the emperor in bce
according to the mahavamsa bindusara reigned for years
the vayu purana which names chandragupta s successor as bhadrasara states that he ruled for years
as a young prince ashoka r bce was a brilliant commander who crushed revolts in ujjain and takshashila
as monarch he was ambitious and aggressive re asserting the empire s superiority in southern and western india
but it was his conquest of kalinga bce which proved to be the pivotal event of his life
ashoka used kalinga to project power over a large region by building a fortification there and securing it as a possession
although ashoka s army succeeded in overwhelming kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units an estimated soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare including over of ashoka s own men
hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war
when he personally witnessed the devastation ashoka began feeling remorse
although the annexation of kalinga was completed ashoka embraced the teachings of buddhism and renounced war and violence
he sent out missionaries to travel around asia and spread buddhism to other countries
ashoka implemented principles of ahimsa by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor many thousands of people in war ravaged kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude
while he maintained a large and powerful army to keep the peace and maintain authority ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across asia and europe and he sponsored buddhist missions
he undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country
over years of peace harmony and prosperity made ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in indian history
he remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern india
the edicts of ashoka set in stone are found throughout the subcontinent
ranging from as far west as afghanistan and as far south as andhra nellore district ashoka s edicts state his policies and accomplishments
although predominantly written in prakrit two of them were written in greek and one in both greek and aramaic
ashoka s edicts refer to the greeks kambojas and gandharas as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire
they also attest to ashoka s having sent envoys to the greek rulers in the west as far as the mediterranean
the edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the hellenic world at the time such as amtiyoko antiochus tulamaya ptolemy amtikini antigonos maka magas and alikasudaro alexander as recipients of ashoka s proselytism
the edicts also accurately locate their territory yojanas away a yojanas being about miles corresponding to the distance between the center of india and greece roughly miles
ashoka was followed for years by a succession of weaker kings
he was succeeded by dasharatha maurya who was ashoka s grandson
none of ashoka s sons could ascend the throne after him
mahinda his first born was on to spread buddhism in the world
kunala maurya was blind hence couldn t ascend the throne and tivala son of kaurwaki died even earlier than ashoka
another son jalauka does not have much story behind him
the empire lost many territories under dasharatha which were later reconquered by samprati kunala s son
post samprati the mauryas slowly lost many territories
in bce brihadratha maurya was killed by his general pushyamitra shunga in a military parade without any heir
hence the great maurya empire finally ended giving rise to the shunga empire
reasons advanced for the decline include the succession of weak kings after a oka maurya the partition of the empire into two the growing independence of some areas within the empire such as that ruled by sophagasenus a top heavy administration where authority was entirely in the hands of a few persons an absence of any national consciousness the pure scale of the empire making it unwieldy and invasion by the greco bactrian empire
some historians such as h
raychaudhuri have argued that ashoka s pacifism undermined the military backbone of the maurya empire
others such as romila thapar have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been grossly exaggerated
buddhist records such as the ashokavadana write that the assassination of brihadratha and the rise of the shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for buddhists and a resurgence of hinduism
according to sir john marshall pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions although later shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of buddhism
other historians such as etienne lamotte and romila thapar among others have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of buddhists are lacking and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated
the fall of the mauryas left the khyber pass unguarded and a wave of foreign invasion followed
the greco bactrian king demetrius capitalized on the break up and he conquered southern afghanistan and parts of northwestern india around bce forming the indo greek kingdom
the indo greeks would maintain holdings on the trans indus region and make forays into central india for about a century
under them buddhism flourished and one of their kings menander became a famous figure of buddhism he was to establish a new capital of sagala the modern city of sialkot
however the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate
numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of christ
although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the shungas satavahanas and kalingas are unclear what is clear is that scythian tribes renamed indo scythians brought about the demise of the indo greeks from around bce and retained lands in the trans indus the region of mathura and gujarat
megasthenes mentions military command consisting of six boards of five members each i navy ii military transport iii infantry iv cavalry with catapults v chariot divisions and vi elephants
the empire was divided into four provinces with the imperial capital at pataliputra
from ashokan edicts the names of the four provincial capitals are tosali in the east ujjain in the west suvarnagiri in the south and taxila in the north
the head of the provincial administration was the kumara royal prince who governed the provinces as king s representative
the kumara was assisted by mahamatyas and council of ministers
this organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the emperor and his mantriparishad council of ministers
the mauryans established a well developed coin minting system
coins were mostly made of silver and copper
certain gold coins were in circulation as well
the coins were widely used for trade and commerce
historians theorise that the organisation of the empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by kautilya in the arthashastra a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade
the expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the iron age
according to megasthenes the empire wielded a military of infantry cavalry chariots and war elephants besides followers and attendants
a vast espionage system collected intelligence for both internal and external security purposes
having renounced offensive warfare and expansionism ashoka nevertheless continued to maintain this large army to protect the empire and instil stability and peace across west and south asia even though large parts were under the control of mauryan empire the spread of information and imperial message was limited since many parts were inaccessible and were situated far away from capital of empire
arthashastra and megasthenes accounts of pataliputra describe the intricate municipal system formed by maurya empire to govern its cities
a city counsel made up of thirty commissioners was divided into six committees or boards which governed the city
the first board fixed wages and looked after provided goods second board made arrangement for foreign dignitaries tourists and businessmen third board made records and registrations fourth looked after manufactured goods and sale of commodities fifth board regulated trade issued licenses and checked weights and measurements sixth board collected sales taxes
some cities such as taxila had autonomy to issue their own coins
the city counsel had officers who looked after public welfare such as maintenance of roads public buildings markets hospitals educational institutions etc
the official head of the village was gramika in towns nagarika
the city counsel also had some magisterial powers
for the first time in south asia political unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce with increased agricultural productivity
the previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms many small armies powerful regional chieftains and internecine warfare gave way to a disciplined central authority
farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings paying instead to a nationally administered and strict but fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the arthashastra
chandragupta maurya established a single currency across india and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants farmers and traders
the mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits regional private armies and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas
although regimental in revenue collection maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity while internal trade in india expanded greatly due to new found political unity and internal peace
under the indo greek friendship treaty and during ashoka s reign an international network of trade expanded
the khyber pass on the modern boundary of pakistan and afghanistan became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world
greek states and hellenic kingdoms in west asia became important trade partners of india
trade also extended through the malay peninsula into southeast asia
india s exports included silk goods and textiles spices and exotic foods
the external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the mauryan empire
ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads waterways canals hospitals rest houses and other public works
the easing of many over rigorous administrative practices including those regarding taxation and crop collection helped increase productivity and economic activity across the empire
in many ways the economic situation in the mauryan empire is analogous to the roman empire of several centuries later
both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to corporations
while rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state driven projects mauryan india had numerous private commercial entities
these existed purely for private commerce and developed before the mauryan empire itself
in the early period of empire brahmanism was an important religion
the mauryans favored brahmanism as well as jainism and buddhism
minor religious sects such as ajivikas also received patronage
chandragupta maurya followed jainism after retiring when he renounced his throne and material possessions to join a wandering group of jain monks
chandragupta was a disciple of the jain monk acharya bhadrabahu
it is said that in his last days he observed the rigorous but self purifying jain ritual of santhara fast unto death at shravana belgola in karnataka
samprati the grandson of ashoka also patronized jainism
samprati was influenced by the teachings of jain monks like suhastin and he is said to have built derasars across india
some of them are still found in the towns of ahmedabad viramgam ujjain and palitana
it is also said that just like ashoka samprati sent messengers and preachers to greece persia and the middle east for the spread of jainism but to date no research has been done in this area
thus jainism became a vital force under the mauryan rule
chandragupta and samprati are credited for the spread of jainism in south india
hundreds of thousands of temples and stupas are said to have been erected during their reigns
magadha the centre of the empire was also the birthplace of buddhism
ashoka initially practised brahmanism but later followed buddhism following the kalinga war he renounced expansionism and aggression and the harsher injunctions of the arthashastra on the use of force intensive policing and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels
ashoka sent a mission led by his son mahinda and daughter sanghamitta to sri lanka whose king tissa was so charmed with buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made buddhism the state religion
ashoka sent many buddhist missions to west asia greece and south east asia and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools as well as the publication of buddhist literature across the empire
he is believed to have built as many as stupas across india such as sanchi and mahabodhi temple and he increased the popularity of buddhism in afghanistan thailand and north asia including siberia
ashoka helped convene the third buddhist council of india s and south asia s buddhist orders near his capital a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the buddhist religion
indian merchants embraced buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the mauryan empire
the population of south asia during the mauryan period has been estimated to be between and million
according to tim dyson the period of the mauryan empire saw the consolidation of caste among the indo aryan people who had settled in the gangetic plain increasingly meeting tribal people who were incorporated into their eveolving caste system and the declining rights of women in the indo aryan speaking regions of india though these developments did not affect people living in large parts of the subcontinent
the greatest monument of this period executed in the reign of chandragupta maurya was the old palace at paliputra modern kumhrar in patna
excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace which is thought to have been a group of several buildings the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers
the pillars were set in regular rows thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays
the number of columns is each about meters high
according to the eyewitness account of megasthenes the palace was chiefly constructed of timber and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of susa and ecbatana its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds
the buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs
kau ilya s arthashastra also gives the method of palace construction from this period
later fragments of stone pillars including one nearly complete with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish indicate that ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones
during the ashokan period stonework was of a highly diversified order and comprised lofty free standing pillars railings of stupas lion thrones and other colossal figures
the use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel
this period marked the beginning of the buddhist school of architecture
ashoka was responsible for the construction of several stupas which were large domes and bearing symbols of buddha
the most important ones are located at sanchi bharhut amaravati bodhgaya and nagarjunakonda
the most widespread examples of mauryan architecture are the ashoka pillars and carved edicts of ashoka often exquisitely decorated with more than spread throughout the indian subcontinent
the peacock was a dynastic symbol of mauryans as depicted by ashoka s pillars at nandangarh and sanchi stupa
the protection of animals in india was advocated by the time of the maurya dynasty being the first empire to provide a unified political entity in india the attitude of the mauryas towards forests their denizens and fauna in general is of interest
the mauryas firstly looked at forests as resources
for them the most important forest product was the elephant
military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle elephants these played a role in the defeat of seleucus one of alexander s former generals
the mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch tame and train wild elephants than to raise them
kautilya s arthashastra contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the protector of the elephant forests
the mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber as well as lions and tigers for skins
elsewhere the protector of animals also worked to eliminate thieves tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle
the mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them
they regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation
they employed some of them the food gatherers or aranyaca to guard borders and trap animals
the sometimes tense and conflict ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the mauryas to guard their vast empire
when ashoka embraced buddhism in the latter part of his reign he brought about significant changes in his style of governance which included providing protection to fauna and even relinquished the royal hunt
he was the first ruler in history to advocate conservation measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts
the edicts proclaim that many followed the king s example in giving up the slaughter of animals one of them proudly states
however the edicts of ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events the mention of a panas coins fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule breakers did exist
the legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting felling fishing and setting fires in forests
relations with the hellenistic world may have started from the very beginning of the maurya empire
plutarch reports that chandragupta maurya met with alexander the great probably around taxila in the northwest
chandragupta ultimately occupied northwestern india in the territories formerly ruled by the greeks where he fought the satraps described as prefects in western sources left in place after alexander justin among whom may have been eudemus ruler in the western punjab until his departure in bce or peithon son of agenor ruler of the greek colonies along the indus until his departure for babylon in bce
seleucus i nicator the macedonian satrap of the asian portion of alexander s former empire conquered and put under his own authority eastern territories as far as bactria and the indus appian history of rome the syrian wars until in bce he entered into a confrontation with emperor chandragupta
though no accounts of the conflict remain it is clear that seleucus fared poorly against the indian emperor as he failed to conquer any territory and in fact was forced to surrender much that was already his
regardless seleucus and chandragupta ultimately reached a settlement and through a treaty sealed in bce seleucus according to strabo ceded a number of territories to chandragupta including eastern afghanistan and balochistan
chandragupta and seleucus concluded a peace treaty and a marriage alliance in bce
chandragupta received vast territories and in a return gave seleucus war elephants a military asset which would play a decisive role at the battle of ipsus in bce
in addition to this treaty seleucus dispatched an ambassador megasthenes to chandragupta and later deimakos to his son bindusara at the mauryan court at pataliputra modern patna in bihar
later ptolemy ii philadelphus the ruler of ptolemaic egypt and contemporary of ashoka is also recorded by pliny the elder as having sent an ambassador named dionysius to the mauryan court
mainstream scholarship asserts that chandragupta received vast territory west of the indus including the hindu kush modern day afghanistan and the balochistan province of pakistan
archaeologically concrete indications of mauryan rule such as the inscriptions of the edicts of ashoka are known as far as kandahar in southern afghanistan
the treaty on epigamia implies lawful marriage between greeks and indians was recognized at the state level although it is unclear whether it occurred among dynastic rulers or common people or both
classical sources have also recorded that following their treaty chandragupta and seleucus exchanged presents such as when chandragupta sent various aphrodisiacs to seleucus
his son bindusara amitraghata slayer of enemies also is recorded in classical sources as having exchanged presents with antiochus i
an influential and large greek population was present in the northwest of the indian subcontinent under ashoka s rule possibly remnants of alexander s conquests in the indus valley region
in the rock edicts of ashoka some of them inscribed in greek ashoka states that the greeks within his dominion were converted to buddhism
fragments of edict have been found in greek and a full edict written in both greek and aramaic has been discovered in kandahar
it is said to be written in excellent classical greek using sophisticated philosophical terms
in this edict ashoka uses the word eusebeia piety as the greek translation for the ubiquitous dharma of his other edicts written in prakrit
also in the edicts of ashoka ashoka mentions the hellenistic kings of the period as recipients of his buddhist proselytism although no western historical record of this event remains
