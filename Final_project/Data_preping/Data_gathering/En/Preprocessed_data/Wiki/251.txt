paralanguage also known as vocalics is a component of meta communication that may modify meaning give nuanced meaning or convey emotion by using techniques such as prosody pitch volume intonation etc
it is sometimes defined as relating to nonphonemic properties only
paralanguage may be expressed consciously or unconsciously
the study of paralanguage is known as paralinguistics and was invented by george l
trager in the s while he was working at the foreign service institute of the u s
department of state
his colleagues at the time included henry lee smith charles f
hockett working with him on using descriptive linguistics as a model for paralanguage edward t
hall developing proxemics and ray birdwhistell developing kinesics
trager published his conclusions in and
his work has served as a basis for all later research especially those investigating the relationship between paralanguage and culture since paralanguage is learned it differs by language and culture
a good example is the work of john j
gumperz on language and social identity which specifically describes paralinguistic differences between participants in intercultural interactions
the film gumperz made for bbc in multiracial britain cross talk does a particularly good job of demonstrating cultural differences in paralanguage and their impact on relationships
paralinguistic information because it is phenomenal belongs to the external speech signal ferdinand de saussure s parole but not to the arbitrary conventional code of language saussure s langue
the paralinguistic properties of speech play an important role in human communication
there are no utterances or speech signals that lack paralinguistic properties since speech requires the presence of a voice that can be modulated
this voice must have some properties and all the properties of a voice as such are paralinguistic
however the distinction linguistic vs
paralinguistic applies not only to speech but to writing and sign language as well and it is not bound to any sensory modality
even vocal language has some paralinguistic as well as linguistic properties that can be seen lip reading mcgurk effect and even felt e g
by the tadoma method
speech signals arrive at a listener s ears with acoustic properties that may allow listeners to identify location of the speaker sensing distance and direction for example
sound localization functions in a similar way also for non speech sounds
the perspectival aspects of lip reading are more obvious and have more drastic effects when head turning is involved
the speech organs of different speakers differ in size
as children grow up their organs of speech become larger and there are differences between male and female adults
the differences concern not only size but also proportions
they affect the pitch of the voice and to a substantial extent also the formant frequencies which characterize the different speech sounds
the organic quality of speech has a communicative function in a restricted sense since it is merely informative about the speaker
it will be expressed independently of the speaker s intention
paralinguistic cues such as loudness rate pitch pitch contour and to some extent formant frequencies of an utterance contribute to the emotive or attitudinal quality of an utterance
typically attitudes are expressed intentionally and emotions without intention but attempts to fake or to hide emotions are not unusual
consequently paralinguistic cues relating to expression have a moderate effect of semantic marking
that is a message may be made more or less coherent by adjusting its expressive presentation
for instance upon hearing an utterance such as i drink a glass of wine every night before i go to sleep is coherent when made by a speaker identified as an adult but registers a small semantic anomaly when made by a speaker identified as a child
this anomaly is significant enough to be measured through electroencephalography as an n
autistic individuals have a reduced sensitivity to this and similar effects
emotional tone of voice itself paralinguistic information has been shown to affect the resolution of lexical ambiguity
some words have homophonous partners some of these homophones appear to have an implicit emotive quality for instance the sad die contrasted with the neutral dye uttering the sound dai in a sad tone of voice can result in a listener writing the former word significantly more often than if the word is uttered in a neutral tone
ordinary phonetic transcriptions of utterances reflect only the linguistically informative quality
the problem of how listeners factor out the linguistically informative quality from speech signals is a topic of current research
some of the linguistic features of speech in particular of its prosody are paralinguistic or pre linguistic in origin
a most fundamental and widespread phenomenon of this kind is described by john ohala as the frequency code
this code works even in communication across species
it has its origin in the fact that the acoustic frequencies in the voice of small vocalizers are high while they are low in the voice of large vocalizers
this gives rise to secondary meanings such as harmless submissive unassertive which are naturally associated with smallness while meanings such as dangerous dominant and assertive are associated with largeness
in most languages the frequency code also serves the purpose of distinguishing questions from statements
it is universally reflected in expressive variation and it is reasonable to assume that it has phylogenetically given rise to the sexual dimorphism that lies behind the large difference in pitch between average female and male adults
in text only communication such as email chatrooms and instant messaging paralinguistic elements can be displayed by emoticons font and color choices capitalization and the use of non alphabetic or abstract characters
nonetheless paralanguage in written communication is limited in comparison with face to face conversation sometimes leading to misunderstandings
a gasp is a kind of paralinguistic respiration in the form of a sudden and sharp inhalation of air through the mouth
a gasp may indicate difficulty breathing and a panicked effort to draw air into the lungs
gasps also occur from an emotion of surprise shock or disgust
like a sigh a yawn or a moan a gasp is often an automatic and unintentional act
gasping is closely related to sighing and the inhalation characterizing a gasp induced by shock or surprise may be released as a sigh if the event causing the initial emotional reaction is determined to be less shocking or surprising than the observer first believed
as a symptom of physiological problems apneustic respirations a k a
apneusis are gasps related to the brain damage associated with a stroke or other trauma
a sigh is a kind of paralinguistic respiration in the form of a deep and especially audible single exhalation of air out of the mouth or nose that humans use to communicate emotion
it is voiced pharyngeal fricative sometimes associated with a guttural glottal breath exuded in a low tone
it often arises from a negative emotion such as dismay dissatisfaction boredom or futility
a sigh can also arise from positive emotions such as relief particularly in response to some negative situation ending or being avoided
like a gasp a yawn or a moan a sigh is often an automatic and unintentional act
in literature a sigh is often used to signify that the person producing it is lovelorn
scientific studies show that babies sigh after to breaths
this serves to improve the mechanical properties of lung tissue and it also helps babies to develop a regular breathing rhythm
behaviors equivalent to sighing have also been observed in animals such as dogs monkeys and horses
in text messages and internet chat rooms or in comic books a sigh is usually represented with the word itself sigh possibly within asterisks sigh
sighing is also a reflex governed by a few neurons
moaning and groaning both refer to an extended guttural sounds emanating from the throat which typically indicate displeasure and are made by humans beginning in infancy
although moaning is associated with pain and suffering moans may also accompany pleasurable physical experiences such as eating stimulating food receiving a massage or engaging in sexual activity
moans and groans are also noises traditionally associated with ghosts and their supposed experience of suffering in the afterlife
clearing one s throat is a metamessaging nonverbal form of communication used in announcing one s presence upon entering the room or approaching a group
it is done by individuals who perceive themselves to be of higher rank than the group they are approaching and utilize the throat clear as a form of communicating this perception to others
the throat clear is also used to convey nonverbalized disapproval
and in chimpanzee social hierarchy this utterance is a sign of rank directed by alpha males and higher ranking chimps to lower ranking ones and signals a mild warning or a slight annoyance
as a form of metacommunication the throat clear is acceptable only to signal that a formal business meeting is about to start
it is not acceptable business etiquette to clear one s throat when approaching a group on an informal basis
the basis of one s authority has already been established and requires no further reiteration by this ancillary nonverbal communication
mhm is between a literal language and movement by making a noise hmm or mhm to make a pause for the conversation or as a chance to stop and think
the mhm utterance is often used in narrative interviews such as an interview with a disaster survivor or sexual violence victim
in this kind of interview it s better for the interviewers or counselors not to intervene too much when an interviewee is talking
the mhm assures the interviewee that they are being heard and can continue their story
observing emotional differences and taking care of an interviewee s mental status is an important way to find slight changes during conversation
huh meaning what that is used when an utterance by another is not fully heard or requires clarification is an essentially universal expression but may be a normal word learned like other words and not paralanguage
if it is a word it is a rare or possibly even unique one being found with basically the same sound and meaning in almost all languages
several studies have used the fmri paradigm to observe brain states brought about by adjustments of paralinguistic information
one such study investigated the effect of interjections that differed along the criteria of lexical index more or less wordy as well as neutral or emotional pronunciation a higher hemodynamic response in auditory cortical gyri was found when more robust paralinguistic data was available
some activation was found in lower brain structures such as the pons perhaps indicating an emotional response
