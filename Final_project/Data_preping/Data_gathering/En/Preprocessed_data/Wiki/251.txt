paralinguistic property speech play important role human communication
utterance speech signal lack paralinguistic property since speech requires presence voice modulated
paralinguistic applies speech writing sign language well bound sensory modality
even vocal language ha paralinguistic well linguistic property seen lip reading mcgurk effect even felt eg
speech signal arrive listener's ear acoustic property may allow listener identify location speaker sensing distance direction example

affect pitch voice substantial extent also formant frequency characterize different speech sounds
organic quality speech ha communicative function restricted sense since merely informative speaker
paralinguistic cue loudness rate pitch pitch contour extent formant frequency utterance contribute emotive attitudinal quality utterance
typically attitude expressed intentionally emotion without intention attempt fake hide emotion unusual
