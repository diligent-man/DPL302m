the curtain opens on domenico soriano a wealthy neapolitan shop keeper who is raging against filumena a former prostitute
they lived together for years as husband and wife but with his frequently having trysts with other women and she has tricked him pretending to be near death and convincing him to marry her in extremis
domenico however would rather marry diana a young girl who is already in the house pretending to be a nurse
filumena reveals the real reason for the marriage to domenico she wants to create a family for her three children umberto michele and riccardo who have no idea of who their mother really is
domenico is not going to allow this and asks his lawyer nocella to annul the marriage
filumena speaks to the young men telling them that she is their mother
filumena accepts the defeat of the annulment but tells domenico that one of the three children is actually his
all attempts to find out who his son is fail and domenico after months remarries filumena accepting to be the father of all three

filumena marturano initially was written as a tribute to eduardo s sister titina de filippo a famous neapolitan theatrical actress who took the title role in the first production in naples in
the play followed the success of napoli milionaria which eduardo had written and which had premiered the year before to general acclaim
the first night of the new play proved a disappointment however and received lukewarm notices from the neapolitan theatre going public
titina decided to address this by following her own instincts and performing as she felt the role required
she was proved right
the play achieved great success so great in fact that for many years afterwards titina was called filumena in italy rather than her own
thanks to an arrangement made by carlo trabucco the editor of the daily italian christian democrat newspaper il popolo an audience was arranged for the cast to meet pope pius xii in a private audience in the vatican
at the audience the pope unexpectedly asked to hear one of the monologues and titina recited for him the prayer of filumena to the madonna of the roses
despite the strong connection between titina de filippo and the role in the mind of the italian public another actress regina bianchi was able to achieve cult status as filumena in subsequent years
