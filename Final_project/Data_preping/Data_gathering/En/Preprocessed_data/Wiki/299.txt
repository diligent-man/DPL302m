Filumena Marturano initially was written as a tribute to Eduardo's sister Titina De Filippo a famous Neapolitan theatrical actress who took the title role in the first production in Naples in The play followed the success of Napoli milionaria which Eduardo had written and which had premiered the year before to general acclaim The first night of the new play proved a disappointment however and received lukewarm notices from the Neapolitan theatre going public Titina decided to address this by following her own instincts and performing as she felt the role required She was proved right The play achieved great success so great in fact that for many years afterwards Titina was called Filumena in Italy rather than her own
Thanks to an arrangement made by Carlo Trabucco the editor of the daily Italian Christian Democrat newspaper Il Popolo an audience was arranged for the cast to meet Pope Pius XII in a private audience in the Vatican At the audience the pope unexpectedly asked to hear one of the monologues and Titina recited for him the prayer of Filumena to the Madonna of the Roses
Despite the strong connection between Titina De Filippo and the role in the mind of the Italian public another actress Regina Bianchi was able to achieve cult status as Filumena in subsequent years
