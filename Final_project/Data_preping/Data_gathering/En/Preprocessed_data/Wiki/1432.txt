dezocine sold under the brand name dalgan is an atypical opioid analgesic which is used in the treatment of pain
it is used by intravenous infusion and intramuscular injection
dezocine is an opioid receptor modulator acting as a partial agonist of the and opioid receptors
it has a similar profile of effects to related opioids acting at the opioid receptor including analgesia and euphoria
unlike other opioids acting at the opioid receptor however dezocine does not produce side effects such as dysphoria or hallucinations at any therapeutically used dose
dezocine was first synthesized in
it was introduced for medical use in the united states in but was not marketed in other countries
dezocine was discontinued in the united states in with no official reason given
however it has become one of the most widely used analgesics in china
in light of the opioid epidemic dezocine has seen a resurgence in use and interest
dezocine is generally administered intravenously as dalgan to relieve post operative pain in patients
it can also be administered in intramuscular doses and is given once rather than continuously
it is often administered in post operative laparoscopy patients as an alternative to fentanyl
dezocine has potent analgesic effects and comparable or greater pain relieving ability than morphine codeine and pethidine meperidine
it is a more effective analgesic than pentazocine but causes relatively more respiratory depression than pentazocine
dezocine is a useful drug for the treatment of pain but side effects such as dizziness limit its clinical application and it can produce opioid withdrawal syndrome in patients already dependent on other opioids
because of its high efficacy dezocine is often administered at a base dose of mg kg
respiratory depression a side effect of dezocine reaches a ceiling at to mg kg
side effects at lower doses include mild gastrointestinal discomfort and dizziness
because decozine has mixed agonist antagonist effects at the opioid receptors it has a lowered dependence potential than purely agonistic opioids
it can be prescribed therefore in small doses over an extended period of time without causing patients to develop and sustain an addiction
its efficacy as an analgesic is dose dependent however it displays a ceiling effect in induced respiratory depression at to mg kg
dezocine acts as an opioid receptor receptor modulator
it is specifically a mixed agonist antagonist or partial agonist of the and opioid receptors
dezocine could also act as a biased agonist of the opioid receptor although more research is needed to confirm this
the binding affinity of dezocine varies depending on the opioid receptor with it having the highest affinity for the opioid receptor intermediate affinity for the opioid receptor and the lowest affinity for the opioid receptor
in addition to its opioid activity dezocine has been found to act as a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri with pic values of for the serotonin transporter sert and for the norepinephrine transporter net
these actions theoretically might contribute to its analgesic efficacy
dezocine is five times as potent as pethidine and one fifth as potent as butorphanol as an analgesic
due to its partial agonist nature at the opioid receptor dezocine has significantly reduced side effects relative to opioid analgesics acting as full agonists of the receptor such as morphine
moreover dezocine is not a controlled substance and there are no reports of addiction related to its use indicating that unlike virtually all other clinically employed opioid receptor agonists including weak partial agonists like buprenorphine and for reasons that are not fully clear it is apparently non addictive
this unique benefit makes long term low dose treatment of chronic pain and or opioid dependence with dezocine more feasible than with most other opioids
despite having a stronger respiratory depressant effect than morphine dezocine shows a ceiling effect on its respiratory depressive action so above a certain dose this effect does not get any more severe
dezocine has an bioavailability by intramuscular injection of
it has a mean t of fewer than two minutes and its biological half life is hours
dezocine is a member of the benzomorphan group of opioids
it is related to other benzomorphan opioids such as pentazocine
dezocine is unusual among opioids as it is one of the only primary amines known to be active as an opioid along with bisnortilidine an active metabolite of tilidine
dezocine amino octahydro methyl methanobenzocyclodecen ol hydrobromide is a pale white crystal powder
it has no apparent odor
the salt is soluble at mg ml and a solution has a ph of
the synthesis of dezocine begins with the condensation of methyl methoxy tetralone with dibromopentane through use of nah or potassium tert butoxide
this yields bromopentyl methyl methoxy tetralone which is then cyclized with nah to produce methyl methoxy octahydro methanobenzocyclodecen one
the product is then treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to yield an oxime
a reduction reaction in hydrogen gas produces an isomeric mixture from which the final product is crystallized and cleaved with hbr
dezocine was patented by american home products corp
clinical trials ran from to before its approval by the u s
food and drug administration fda in
as of dezocine s usage is discontinued in the united states but it is still widely used in some other countries such as china
dezocine is the generic name of the drug and its inn and usan
the major brand name of dezocine is dalgan
in dezocine was listed as being marketed only in the united states
it has since been marketed in china
dezocine was discontinued in the united states in
as of dezocine is not used in the united states or canada
it is not commercially available in either of these countries nor is it offered as a prescribed analgesic for postoperative care
in china however it is commonly used after surgery
