dezocine sold brand name dalgan atypical opioid analgesic used treatment pain
dezocine opioid receptor modulator acting partial agonist opioid receptors
ha similar profile effect related opioids acting opioid receptor including analgesia euphoria
unlike opioids acting opioid receptor however dezocine doe produce side effect dysphoria hallucination therapeutically used dose
wa introduced medical use united state wa marketed countries
dezocine wa discontinued united state official reason given
however ha become one widely used analgesic china
light opioid epidemic dezocine ha seen resurgence use interest
dezocine generally administered intravenously dalgan relieve post-operative pain patients
dezocine ha potent analgesic effect comparable greater pain-relieving ability morphine codeine pethidine meperidine
effective analgesic pentazocine cause relatively respiratory depression pentazocine
dezocine useful drug treatment pain side effect dizziness limit clinical application produce opioid withdrawal syndrome patient already dependent opioids
high efficacy dezocine often administered base dose mgkg
respiratory depression side effect dezocine reach ceiling mgkg
side effect lower dos include mild gastrointestinal discomfort dizziness
decozine ha mixed agonistantagonist effect opioid receptor ha lowered dependence potential purely agonistic opioids
prescribed therefore small dos extended period time without causing patient develop sustain addiction
efficacy analgesic dose-dependent however display ceiling effect induced respiratory depression mgkg
dezocine could also act biased agonist opioid receptor although research needed confirm this
binding affinity dezocine varies depending opioid receptor highest affinity opioid receptor intermediate affinity opioid receptor lowest affinity opioid receptor
addition opioid activity dezocine ha found act serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri pic value serotonin transporter sert norepinephrine transporter net
dezocine five time potent pethidine one-fifth potent butorphanol analgesic
due partial agonist nature opioid receptor dezocine ha significantly reduced side effect relative opioid analgesic acting full agonist receptor morphine
moreover dezocine controlled substance report addiction related use indicating unlike virtually clinically-employed opioid receptor agonist including weak partial agonist like buprenorphine reason fully clear apparently non-addictive
unique benefit make long-term low-dose treatment chronic pain andor opioid dependence dezocine feasible opioids
despite stronger respiratory depressant effect morphine dezocine show ceiling effect respiratory depressive action certain dose effect doe get severe
ha mean fewer two minute biological half-life hours
dezocine unusual among opioids one primary amine known active opioid along bisnortilidine active metabolite tilidine
dezocine amino- octahydro- methyl- methanobenzocyclodecen- ol hydrobromide pale white crystal powder
synthesis dezocine begin condensation methyl- methoxy- tetralone dibromopentane use nah potassium tert-butoxide
yield bromopentyl- methyl- methoxy- tetralone cyclized nah produce methyl- methoxy- octahydro- methanobenzocyclodecen- one
reduction reaction hydrogen gas produce isomeric mixture final product crystallized cleaved hbr
dezocine's usage discontinued united state still widely used country china
commercially available either country offered prescribed analgesic postoperative care
