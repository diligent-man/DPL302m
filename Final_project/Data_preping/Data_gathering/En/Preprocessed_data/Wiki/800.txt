riesz's theorem represents dual space banach space cab continuous function interval ab riemann-stieltjes integral function bounded variation
riemann-stieltjes integral also appears formulation spectral theorem non-compact self-adjoint generally normal operator hilbert space
best simple existence theorem state f continuous g bounded variation b integral exists
function g bounded variation difference two bounded monotone functions
g bounded variation continuous function cannot integrated respect g
general integral well-defined f g share point discontinuity case well
important generalization lebesgue-stieltjes integral generalizes riemann-stieltjes integral way analogous lebesgue integral generalizes riemann integral
improper riemann-stieltjes integral allowed lebesgue integral strictly general riemann-stieltjes integral
riemann-stieltjes integral also generalizes case either integrand integrator g take value banach space
g ab x take value banach space x natural assume strongly bounded variation meaning that
