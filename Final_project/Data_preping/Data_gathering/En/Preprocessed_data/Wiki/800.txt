in mathematics the riemann stieltjes integral is a generalization of the riemann integral named after bernhard riemann and thomas joannes stieltjes
the definition of this integral was first published in by stieltjes
it serves as an instructive and useful precursor of the lebesgue integral and an invaluable tool in unifying equivalent forms of statistical theorems that apply to discrete and continuous probability
the riemann stieltjes integral of a real valued function
displaystyle f
of a real variable on the interval
displaystyle a b
with respect to another real to real function
displaystyle g
is denoted by
displaystyle int x a b f x mathrm d g x
its definition uses a sequence of partitions
displaystyle p
of the interval
displaystyle a b
displaystyle p a x x cdots x n b
the integral then is defined to be the limit as the norm the length of the longest subinterval of the partitions approaches
displaystyle
of the approximating sum
displaystyle s p f g sum i n f c i left g x i g x i right
where
displaystyle c i
is in the
displaystyle i
th subinterval
displaystyle x i x i
the two functions
displaystyle f
displaystyle g
are respectively called the integrand and the integrator
typically
displaystyle g
is taken to be monotone or at least of bounded variation and right semicontinuous however this last is essentially convention
we specifically do not require
displaystyle g
to be continuous which allows for integrals that have point mass terms
the limit is here understood to be a number a the value of the riemann stieltjes integral such that for every there exists such that for every partition p with norm p and for every choice of points ci in xi xi
displaystyle s p f g a varepsilon
the riemann stieltjes integral admits integration by parts in the form
displaystyle int a b f x mathrm d g x f b g b f a g a int a b g x mathrm d f x
and the existence of either integral implies the existence of the other
on the other hand a classical result shows that the integral is well defined if f is h lder continuous and g is h lder continuous with
if g is the cumulative probability distribution function of a random variable x that has a probability density function with respect to lebesgue measure and f is any function for which the expected value
displaystyle operatorname e left left f x right right
is finite then the probability density function of x is the derivative of g and we have
displaystyle operatorname e f x int infty infty f x g x mathrm d x
but this formula does not work if x does not have a probability density function with respect to lebesgue measure
in particular it does not work if the distribution of x is discrete i e all of the probability is accounted for by point masses and even if the cumulative distribution function g is continuous it does not work if g fails to be absolutely continuous again the cantor function may serve as an example of this failure
but the identity
displaystyle operatorname e f x int infty infty f x mathrm d g x
holds if g is any cumulative probability distribution function on the real line no matter how ill behaved
in particular no matter how ill behaved the cumulative distribution function g of a random variable x if the moment e x exists then it is equal to
displaystyle operatorname e left x n right int infty infty x n mathrm d g x
the riemann stieltjes integral appears in the original formulation of f
riesz s theorem which represents the dual space of the banach space c a b of continuous functions in an interval a b as riemann stieltjes integrals against functions of bounded variation
later that theorem was reformulated in terms of measures
the riemann stieltjes integral also appears in the formulation of the spectral theorem for non compact self adjoint or more generally normal operators in a hilbert space
in this theorem the integral is considered with respect to a spectral family of projections
the best simple existence theorem states that if f is continuous and g is of bounded variation on a b then the integral exists
a function g is of bounded variation if and only if it is the difference between two bounded monotone functions
if g is not of bounded variation then there will be continuous functions which cannot be integrated with respect to g
in general the integral is not well defined if f and g share any points of discontinuity but there are other cases as well
an important generalization is the lebesgue stieltjes integral which generalizes the riemann stieltjes integral in a way analogous to how the lebesgue integral generalizes the riemann integral
if improper riemann stieltjes integrals are allowed then the lebesgue integral is not strictly more general than the riemann stieltjes integral
the riemann stieltjes integral also generalizes to the case when either the integrand or the integrator g take values in a banach space
if g a b x takes values in the banach space x then it is natural to assume that it is of strongly bounded variation meaning that
displaystyle sup sum i g t i g t i x infty
the supremum being taken over all finite partitions
displaystyle a t leq t leq cdots leq t n b
of the interval a b
this generalization plays a role in the study of semigroups via the laplace stieltjes transform
the it integral extends the riemann stietjes integral to encompass integrands and integrators which are stochastic processes rather than simple functions see also stochastic calculus
a slight generalization is to consider in the above definition partitions p that refine another partition p meaning that p arises from p by the addition of points rather than from partitions with a finer mesh
specifically the generalized riemann stieltjes integral of f with respect to g is a number a such that for every there exists a partition p such that for every partition p that refines p
displaystyle s p f g a varepsilon
for every choice of points ci in xi xi
this generalization exhibits the riemann stieltjes integral as the moore smith limit on the directed set of partitions of a b
a consequence is that with this definition the integral
textstyle int a b f x mathrm d g x
can still be defined in cases where f and g have a point of discontinuity in common
the riemann stieltjes integral can be efficiently handled using an appropriate generalization of darboux sums
for a partition p and a nondecreasing function g on a b define the upper darboux sum of f with respect to g by
displaystyle u p f g sum i n g x i g x i sup x in x i x i f x
and the lower sum by
displaystyle l p f g sum i n g x i g x i inf x in x i x i f x
then the generalized riemann stieltjes of f with respect to g exists if and only if for every there exists a partition p such that
displaystyle u p f g l p f g varepsilon
furthermore f is riemann stieltjes integrable with respect to g in the classical sense if
displaystyle lim operatorname mesh p to u p f g l p f g quad
given a
displaystyle g x
which is continuously differentiable over
displaystyle mathbb r
it can be shown that there is the equality
displaystyle int a b f x mathrm d g x int a b f x g x mathrm d x
where the integral on the right hand side is the standard riemann integral assuming that
displaystyle f
can be integrated by the riemann stieltjes integral
more generally the riemann integral equals the riemann stieltjes integral if
displaystyle g
is the lebesgue integral of its derivative in this case
displaystyle g
is said to be absolutely continuous
it may be the case that
displaystyle g
has jump discontinuities or may have derivative zero almost everywhere while still being continuous and increasing for example
displaystyle g
could be the cantor function or devil s staircase in either of which cases the riemann stieltjes integral is not captured by any expression involving derivatives of g
the standard riemann integral is a special case of the riemann stieltjes integral where
displaystyle g x x
consider the function
displaystyle g x max x
used in the study of neural networks called a rectified linear unit relu
then the riemann stieltjes can be evaluated as
displaystyle int a b f x mathrm d g x int g a g b f x mathrm d x
where the integral on the right hand side is the standard riemann integral
cavalieri s principle can be used to calculate areas bounded by curves using riemann stieltjes integrals
the integration strips of riemann integration are replaced with strips that are non rectangular in shape
the method is to transform a cavaliere region with a transformation
displaystyle h
or to use
displaystyle g h
as integrand
for a given function
displaystyle f x
on an interval
displaystyle a b
a translational function
displaystyle a y
must intersect
displaystyle x f x
exactly once for any shift in the interval
a cavaliere region is then bounded by
displaystyle f x a y
displaystyle x
axis and
displaystyle b y a y b a
the area of the region is then
displaystyle int a y b y f x dx int a b f x dg x
where
displaystyle a
displaystyle b
are the
displaystyle x
values where
displaystyle a y
displaystyle b y
intersect
displaystyle f x
