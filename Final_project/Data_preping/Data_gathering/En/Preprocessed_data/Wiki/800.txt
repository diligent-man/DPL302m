In mathematics the RiemannStieltjes integral is a generalization of the Riemann integral named after Bernhard Riemann and Thomas Joannes Stieltjes
The definition of this integral was first published in by Stieltjes
It serves as an instructive and useful precursor of the Lebesgue integral and an invaluable tool in unifying equivalent forms of statistical theorems that apply to discrete and continuous probability
The RiemannStieltjes integral of a real-valued function
of a real variable on the interval
Its definition uses a sequence of partitions
The integral then is defined to be the limit as the norm the length of the longest subinterval of the partitions approaches
are respectively called the integrand and the integrator
is taken to be monotone or at least of bounded variation and right-semicontinuous however this last is essentially convention
to be continuous which allows for integrals that have point mass terms
The limit is here understood to be a number A the value of the RiemannStieltjes integral such that for every ε there exists δ such that for every partition P with normP δ and for every choice of points ci in xi xi+
The RiemannStieltjes integral admits integration by parts in the form
displaystyle int abfxmathrm d gx=fbgb-faga-int abgxmathrm d fx
and the existence of either integral implies the existence of the other
On the other hand a classical result shows that the integral is well-defined if f is α-Hölder continuous and g is β-Hölder continuous with α + β
If g is the cumulative probability distribution function of a random variable X that has a probability density function with respect to Lebesgue measure and f is any function for which the expected value
is finite then the probability density function of X is the derivative of g and we have
displaystyle operatorname E fX=int -infty infty fxg'xmathrm d x
But this formula does not work if X does not have a probability density function with respect to Lebesgue measure
In particular it does not work if the distribution of X is discrete ie all of the probability is accounted for by point-masses and even if the cumulative distribution function g is continuous it does not work if g fails to be absolutely continuous again the Cantor function may serve as an example of this failure
displaystyle operatorname E fX=int -infty infty fxmathrm d gx
holds if g is any cumulative probability distribution function on the real line no matter how ill-behaved
In particular no matter how ill-behaved the cumulative distribution function g of a random variable X if the moment EX exists then it is equal to
displaystyle operatorname E leftXnright=int -infty infty xnmathrm d gx
The RiemannStieltjes integral appears in the original formulation of F
Riesz's theorem which represents the dual space of the Banach space Cab of continuous functions in an interval ab as RiemannStieltjes integrals against functions of bounded variation
Later that theorem was reformulated in terms of measures
The RiemannStieltjes integral also appears in the formulation of the spectral theorem for non-compact self-adjoint or more generally normal operators in a Hilbert space
In this theorem the integral is considered with respect to a spectral family of projections
The best simple existence theorem states that if f is continuous and g is of bounded variation on a b then the integral exists
A function g is of bounded variation if and only if it is the difference between two bounded monotone functions
If g is not of bounded variation then there will be continuous functions which cannot be integrated with respect to g
In general the integral is not well-defined if f and g share any points of discontinuity but there are other cases as well
An important generalization is the LebesgueStieltjes integral which generalizes the RiemannStieltjes integral in a way analogous to how the Lebesgue integral generalizes the Riemann integral
If improper RiemannStieltjes integrals are allowed then the Lebesgue integral is not strictly more general than the RiemannStieltjes integral
The RiemannStieltjes integral also generalizes to the case when either the integrand ƒ or the integrator g take values in a Banach space
If g ab → X takes values in the Banach space X then it is natural to assume that it is of strongly bounded variation meaning that
the supremum being taken over all finite partitions
This generalization plays a role in the study of semigroups via the LaplaceStieltjes transform
The It integral extends the RiemannStietjes integral to encompass integrands and integrators which are stochastic processes rather than simple functions see also stochastic calculus
A slight generalization is to consider in the above definition partitions P that refine another partition Pε meaning that P arises from Pε by the addition of points rather than from partitions with a finer mesh
Specifically the generalized RiemannStieltjes integral of f with respect to g is a number A such that for every ε there exists a partition Pε such that for every partition P that refines Pε
for every choice of points ci in xi xi+
This generalization exhibits the RiemannStieltjes integral as the MooreSmith limit on the directed set of partitions of a b
A consequence is that with this definition the integral
can still be defined in cases where f and g have a point of discontinuity in common
The RiemannStieltjes integral can be efficiently handled using an appropriate generalization of Darboux sums
For a partition P and a nondecreasing function g on a b define the upper Darboux sum of f with respect to g by
Then the generalized RiemannStieltjes of f with respect to g exists if and only if for every ε there exists a partition P such that
Furthermore f is RiemannStieltjes integrable with respect to g in the classical sense if
it can be shown that there is the equality
displaystyle int abfxmathrm d gx=int abfxg'xmathrm d x
where the integral on the right-hand side is the standard Riemann integral assuming that
can be integrated by the RiemannStieltjes integral
More generally the Riemann integral equals the RiemannStieltjes integral if
is the Lebesgue integral of its derivative in this case
has jump discontinuities or may have derivative zero almost everywhere while still being continuous and increasing for example
could be the Cantor function or Devil's staircase in either of which cases the RiemannStieltjes integral is not captured by any expression involving derivatives of g
The standard Riemann integral is a special case of the RiemannStieltjes integral where
used in the study of neural networks called a rectified linear unit ReLU
Then the RiemannStieltjes can be evaluated as
displaystyle int abfxmathrm d gx=int gagbfxmathrm d x
where the integral on the right-hand side is the standard Riemann integral
Cavalieri's principle can be used to calculate areas bounded by curves using RiemannStieltjes integrals
The integration strips of Riemann integration are replaced with strips that are non-rectangular in shape
The method is to transform a Cavaliere region with a transformation
exactly once for any shift in the interval
A Cavaliere region is then bounded by
The area of the region is then
