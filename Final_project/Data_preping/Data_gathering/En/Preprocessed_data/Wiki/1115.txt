Gender and Judaism is a radical emerging subfield at the intersection of gender studies and Jewish studies Gender studies centers on interdisciplinary research on the phenomenon of gender It focuses on cultural representations of gender and people's lived experience Jewish studies is a field that looks at Jews and Judaism through such disciplines as history anthropology literary studies linguistics and sociology
Jewish law or halacha recognises gender ambiguity and has done so throughout Jewish history However unlike the modern concept of gender identity this ambiguity is defined according to physical presentation or lack thereof and primary and secondary sexual characteristics The concept of a Tumtum being a person of ambiguous gender and or sex is dealt with as is the concept of the androgynos being a person characterised with elements of both genders These concepts have precedent dating back to the beginning of Jewish thought
Gender and Judaism has drawn scholarly interest due to the rapid growth of its intersecting fields during the late th century fueled as well by popular and academic attention to Jewish feminism As universities established women's studies programs they have linked to Jewish studies as well For instance in Brandeis University established the Hadassah Brandeis Institute which aims to develop fresh ways of thinking about Jews and gender worldwide by producing and promoting scholarly research and artistic projects In addition controversies over the role of women in Jewish denominations and the gender separation in orthodox Judaism has drawn attention to gender roles as constructed and regulated by religious institutions For this reason besides the academic attention the liberal Jewish movements turn to gender and Judaism to reinforce their own mission and identity Notably the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College has established the Gottesman Chair in Gender and Judaism and operates Kolot the Center for Jewish Women's and Gender Studies the first such center established at a rabbinical seminary
With the U S based Association for Jewish Studies a women's caucus works to advance the study of gender within the Association for Jewish Studies and within the wider academic community AJS holds at least one panel on gender every annual meeting provides funding for presentations on gender and Judaism and published a collection of syllabi pertaining to gender
Zachar This term is derived from the word for memory and refers to the belief that the man carried the name and identity of the family It is usually translated as male in English
Nekevah This term is derived from the word for a crevice and probably refers to a vaginal opening It is usually translated as female in English
Androgynos A person who has both male and female physical sexual characteristics references in Mishna and Talmud st th centuries CE in classical midrash and Jewish law codes nd th centuries CE According to Rabbi Meir in the Mishna it is a unique creature neither male nor female
Tumtum A person whose sexual characteristics are indeterminate or obscured references in Mishna and Talmud in classical midrash and Jewish law codes Rabbi Meir contrasts it with the Androgynus saying it is not a unique creation sometimes a man and sometimes a woman
Ay lonit A female who does not develop at puberty and is infertile references in Mishna and Talmud in classical midrash and Jewish law codes
Saris A male who does not develop at puberty and or subsequently has their sexual organs removed A saris can be naturally a saris saris hamah or become one through human intervention saris adam references in mishna and Talmud in classical midrash and Jewish law codes Gender and Jewish studies intersect primarily through research on Jewish women and the role of women in Judaism and Jewish culture
Nonetheless gender and Jewish studies also investigate the gender phenomena pertaining to men and masculinity In addition the subfield encompasses research on homosexuality and queer theory as these pertain to Jews and Judaism
In historical terms gender and Jewish studies span a broad range from Biblical exegesis research on rabbinic literature Medieval Jewish culture the importance of gender in Jewish responses to modernity and gender identity politics in the contemporary period
There is a growing subfield in the study of gender and Judaism which sees the binaries of male and female as crucial constructs in Jewish thought
While the male female dialectic first makes its appearance in the story of creation the Talmud insists that the idea of male and female extends way beyond sex roles Everything that God created He created as male and female Baba Batra b
This dialectic takes on even greater theological significance in light of the Biblical book Song of Songs which has been traditionally interpreted as a metaphor for the relationship between God and the Nation of Israel where the Nation of Israel is cast as feminine towards God who is represented in the story by the male lover
Other examples of topics in which the male female dynamic is used metaphorically include the relationship between Shabbat and the days of the week the relationship between the Oral and Written Law the relationship between This World and the Next the interplay between the legal and extra legal aspects of Talmud Halacha and Aggada and the Jewish calendar which makes use of both the sun traditionally symbolic of the male force and the moon traditionally symbolic of the female force
There is also a movement among queer and gender non conforming Jews to use Torah as a basis for questioning a gender binary These conversations are more present in reconstructionist and reform sects but they also appear in Orthodox sects
