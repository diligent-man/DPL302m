miasma wa thought caused lot disease cold influenza heat stroke malaria dysentery
medical history china malaria referred different name different dynasty periods
poisoning psittacosis also called miasma ancient china accurately understand cause disease
sui dynasty doctor tsao yuan-fung mentioned miasma book pathogen syndromes
thought miasma southern china wa similar typhoid fever northern china
book discussed dysentery another chapter malaria single chapter
also claimed miasma caused various disease suggested one find apt specific way resolve problems
first western jin dynasty concept miasma wa gradually forming least eastern han dynasty wa description miasma
eastern jin large number northern people moved south miasma wa recognized men letter nobility
sui tang dynasty scholars-bureaucrats sent local official recorded investigated miasma
result government became concerned severe case cause miasma sending doctor area epidemic research disease heal patients
ming dynasty qing dynasty version local chronicle record different miasma different places
however southern china wa highly developed ming qing dynasties
environment changed rapidly century western science medical knowledge introduced china people knew distinguish deal disease
concept miasma therefore faded due progress medicine china
terrifying miasma disease southern region china made primary location relegating official sending criminal exile since qin-han dynasty
poet han yu tang dynasty example wrote nephew came see banishment chao prefecture poem en route
prevalent belief predominant fear southern region poisonous air gas evident historical documents
similar topic feeling toward miasma-infected south often reflected early chinese poetry records
scholar time agreed geological environment south direct impact population composition growth
many historical record reflect female le prone miasma infection mortality rate much higher south especially men
directly influenced agriculture cultivation southern economy men engine agriculture production
zhou qufei local magistrate southern song dynasty described treatise representative answer south
men short tan woman plump seldom came illness exclaimed populous female population guangxi region
hence development damp sultry south wa much slower north dynasties' political power resided much early chinese history

fear night air gradually disappeared understanding disease increased well improvement home heating ventilation
particularly important wa understanding agent spreading malaria wa mosquito active night rather miasmata
prior late century night air wa considered dangerous western cultures
throughout century medical community wa divided explanation disease proliferation
one side contagionists believing disease wa passed physical contact others believed disease wa present air form miasma thus could proliferate without physical contact
thomas southwood smith spent many year comparing miasmatic theory contagionism
current germ theory account disease proliferation direct indirect physical contact
early century living condition industrialized city britain increasingly unsanitary
population wa growing much faster rate infrastructure could support
example population manchester doubled within single decade leading overcrowding significant increase waste accumulation
miasma theory disease made sense sanitary reformer mid- century
miasma explained cholera disease epidemic place water wa stagnant foul-smelling
leading sanitary reformer london's edwin chadwick asserted smell disease maintained fundamental change structure sanitation system wa needed combat increasing urban mortality rates
chadwick saw problem cholera typhoid epidemic directly related urbanization proposed new independent sewerage system connected homes
chadwick supported proposal report london statistical society showed dramatic increase morbidity mortality rate since beginning urbanization early century
though chadwick proposed reform basis miasma theory proposal contribute improvement sanitation preventing reflux noxious air sewer back house using separate drainage system design sanitation
led incidentally decreased outbreak cholera thus helped support theory
miasma theory wa consistent observation disease wa associated poor sanitation hence foul odour sanitary improvement reduced disease
however wa inconsistent finding arising microbiology bacteriology later century eventually led adoption germ theory disease although consensus wa reached immediately
concern sewer gas wa major component miasma theory developed galen brought prominence great stink london summer led proponent theory observe sewer enclosed refuse human bowel medical science discovered could teem typhoid cholera microbes
nuisance removal disease prevention act wa passed identify whether transmission cholera wa air water
act wa used encourage owner clean dwelling connect sewers
even though eventually disproved understanding bacteria discovery virus miasma theory helped establish connection poor sanitation disease
encouraged cleanliness spurred public health reform britain led public health act local government act of
latter enabled instituting investigation health sanitary regulation town place upon petition resident result death rate exceeding norm
early medical sanitary engineering reformer included henry austin joseph bazalgette edwin chadwick frank forster thomas hawksley william haywood henry letheby robert rawlinson john simon john snow thomas wicksteed
effort associated british regulatory improvement reported united state early as
particularly notable century sanitation reform work joseph bazalgette chief engineer london's metropolitan board works
encouraged great stink parliament sanctioned bazalgette design construct comprehensive system sewer intercepted london's sewage diverted away water supply
system helped purify london's water saved city epidemics
however area wa yet connected bazalgette's system confined area epidemic acted testament efficiency system's design
year later influence sanitary reform britain wa described richard rogers
miasma theory contribute containing disease urban settlement allow adoption suitable approach reuse excreta agriculture
wa major factor practice collecting human excreta urban settlement reusing surrounding farmland
type resource recovery scheme wa common major city century introduction sewer-based sanitation systems
nowadays reuse excreta done hygienic manner known ecological sanitation promoted way closing loop
throughout century concern public health sanitation along influence miasma theory reason advocacy then-controversial practice cremation
infectious disease spread noxious gas emitted decaying organic matter included decaying corpses
public health argument cremation faded eclipsing miasma theory disease
although connection germ disease wa proposed quite early wa late germ theory wa generally accepted
miasmatic theory wa challenged john snow suggesting wa mean disease wa spread via poison morbid material orig materies morbi water
suggested response cholera epidemic broad street central london in
miasmatic theory's predominance among italian scientist discovery year filippo pacini bacillus caused disease wa completely ignored
wa robert koch proved bacterium bacillus anthracis caused anthrax brought definitive end miasma theory
work john snow notable helping make connection cholera typhoid epidemic contaminated water source contributed eventual demise miasma theory
cholera epidemic snow traced high mortality rate among citizen soho water pump broad street
snow convinced local government remove pump handle resulted marked decrease case cholera area
snow submitted paper british medical journal attributed high number cholera case water source contaminated human waste
snow used statistical data show citizen received water upstream source considerably le likely develop cholera received water downstream sources
though research supported hypothesis contaminated water foul air wa source cholera
epidemic review committee concluded snow's finding significant enough warrant change summarily dismissed
many water company civic authority pumped water directly contaminated source thames public well idea changing source implementing filtration technique wa unattractive economic prospect
john snow made testimony amendment nuisance removal disease prevention act regularized air pollution industries
year william farr wa major supporter miasma theory issued report criticize germ theory
formal experiment relationship germ disease conducted louis pasteur and
discovered pathology puerperal fever pyogenic vibrio blood suggested using boric acid kill microorganism confinement
eight year death john snow william farr publicly acknowledged miasma theory transmission cholera wa wrong statistical justification death rate
