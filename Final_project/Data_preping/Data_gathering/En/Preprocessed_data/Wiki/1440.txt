the miasma theory also called the miasmatic theory is an obsolete medical theory that held that diseases such as cholera chlamydia or the black death were caused by a miasma ancient greek for pollution a noxious form of bad air also known as night air
the theory held that epidemics were caused by miasma emanating from rotting organic matter
though
miasma theory is typically associated with the spread of contagious diseases some academics in the early nineteenth century suggested that the theory extended to
other conditions as well e g
one could become obese by inhaling the odor of food
the miasma theory was advanced by hippocrates in the fourth century b c
and accepted from ancient times in europe and china
the theory was eventually abandoned by scientists and physicians after replaced by the germ theory of disease specific germs not miasma caused specific diseases
however cultural beliefs about getting rid of odor made the clean up of waste a high priority for cities
the word miasma comes from ancient greek and means pollution
the idea also gave rise to the name malaria literally bad air through medieval italian
miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter miasmata that caused illnesses
the miasmatic position was that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water foul air and poor hygienic conditions
such infection was not passed between individuals but would affect individuals within the locale that gave rise to such vapors
it was identifiable by its foul smell
it was also initially believed that miasmas were propagated through worms from ulcers within those affected by a plague
in the fifth or fourth century bc hippocrates wrote about the effects of the environs over the human diseases
in the st century bc the roman architectural writer vitruvius described the potential effects of miasma latin nebula from fetid swamplands when visiting a city
the miasmatic theory of disease remained popular in the middle ages and a sense of effluvia contributed to robert boyle s suspicions about the hidden realities of the air
in the s miasma was used to explain the spread of cholera in london and in paris partly justifying haussmann s later renovation of the french capital
the disease was said to be preventable by cleansing and scouring of the body and items
william farr the assistant commissioner for the london census was an important supporter of the miasma theory
he believed that cholera was transmitted by air and that there was a deadly concentration of miasmata near the river thames banks
such a belief was in part accepted because of the general lack of air quality in urbanized areas
the wide acceptance of miasma theory during the cholera outbreaks overshadowed the partially correct theory brought forth by john snow that cholera was spread through water
this slowed the response to the major outbreaks in the soho district of london and other areas
the crimean war nurse florence nightingale was a proponent of the theory and worked to make hospitals sanitary and fresh smelling
it was stated in notes on nursing for the labouring classes that nightingale would keep the air the patient breathes as pure as the external air
fear of miasma registered in many early nineteenth century warnings concerning what was termed unhealthy fog
the presence of fog was thought to strongly indicate the presence of miasma
the miasmas were thought to behave like smoke or mist blown with air currents wafted by winds
it was thought that miasma didn t simply travel on air but changed the air through which it propagated the atmosphere was infected by miasma as diseased people were
in china miasma chinese pinyin zh ngq alternative names is an old concept of illness used extensively by ancient chinese local chronicles and works of literature
miasma has different names in chinese culture
most of the explanations of miasma refer to it as a kind of sickness or poison gas
the ancient chinese thought that miasma was related to the environment of parts of southern china
the miasma was thought to be caused by the heat moisture and the dead air in the southern chinese mountains
they thought that insects waste polluted the air the fog and the water and the virgin forest harbored a great environment for miasma to occur
in descriptions by ancient travelers soldiers or local officials most of them are men of letters of the phenomenon of miasma fog haze dust gas or poison geological gassing were always mentioned
the miasma was thought to have caused a lot of diseases such as the cold influenza heat strokes malaria or dysentery
in the medical history of china malaria had been referred to by different names in different dynasty periods
poisoning and psittacosis were also called miasma in ancient china because they did not accurately understand the cause of disease
in the sui dynasty doctor tsao yuan fung mentioned miasma in his book on pathogen and syndromes
he thought that miasma in southern china was similar to typhoid fever in northern china
however in his opinion miasma was different from malaria and dysentery
in his book he discussed dysentery in another chapter and malaria in a single chapter
he also claimed that miasma caused various diseases so he suggested that one should find apt and specific ways to resolve problems
the concept of miasma developed in several stages
first before the western jin dynasty the concept of miasma was gradually forming at least in the eastern han dynasty there was no description of miasma
during the eastern jin large numbers of northern people moved south and miasma was then recognized by men of letters and nobility
after the sui and the tang dynasty scholars bureaucrats sent to be the local officials recorded and investigated miasma
as a result the government became concerned about the severe cases and the causes of miasma by sending doctors to the areas of epidemic to research the disease and heal the patients
in the ming dynasty and qing dynasty versions of local chronicles record different miasma in different places
however southern china was highly developed in the ming and qing dynasties
the environment changed rapidly and after the th century western science and medical knowledge were introduced into china and people knew how to distinguish and deal with the disease
the concept of miasma therefore faded out due to the progress of medicine in china
the terrifying miasma diseases in the southern regions of china made it the primary location for relegating officials and sending criminals to exile since the qin han dynasty
poet han yu of the tang dynasty for example wrote to his nephew who came to see him off after his banishment to the chao prefecture in his poem en route
the prevalent belief and predominant fear of the southern region with its poisonous air and gases is evident in historical documents
similar topics and feelings toward the miasma infected south are often reflected in early chinese poetry and records
most scholars of the time agreed that the geological environments in the south had a direct impact on the population composition and growth
many historical records reflect that females were less prone to miasma infection and mortality rates were much higher in the south especially for the men
this directly influenced agriculture cultivation and the southern economy as men were the engine of agriculture production
zhou qufei a local magistrate from the southern song dynasty described in his treatise representative answers from the south
the men are short and tan while the women were plump and seldom came down with illness and exclaimed at the populous female population in the guangxi region
this inherent environmental threat also prevented immigration from other regions
hence development in the damp and sultry south was much slower than in the north where the dynasties political power resided for much of early chinese history
in india there was also a miasma theory and the indians take credit for being the first to put this miasma theory into clinical practice
the indians invented paan a gambir paste that was believed to help prevent miasma it was considered the first antimiasmatic application
this gambir tree is found in southern india and sri lanka
based on zymotic theory people believed vapors called miasmata singular miasma rose from the soil and spread diseases
miasmata were believed to come from rotting vegetation and foul water especially in swamps and urban ghettos
many people especially the weak or infirm avoided breathing night air by going indoors and keeping windows and doors shut
in addition to ideas associated with zymotic theory there was also a general fear that cold or cool air spread disease
the fear of night air gradually disappeared as understanding about disease increased as well as with improvements in home heating and ventilation
particularly important was the understanding that the agent spreading malaria was the mosquito active at night rather than miasmata
prior to the late th century night air was considered dangerous in most western cultures
throughout the th century the medical community was divided on the explanation for disease proliferation
on one side were the contagionists believing disease was passed through physical contact while others believed disease was present in the air in the form of miasma and thus could proliferate without physical contact
two members of the latter group were dr
thomas s
smith and florence nightingale
thomas southwood smith spent many years comparing the miasmatic theory to contagionism
florence nightingale
the current germ theory accounts for disease proliferation by both direct and indirect physical contact
in the early th century the living conditions in industrialized cities in britain were increasingly unsanitary
the population was growing at a much faster rate than the infrastructure could support
for example the population of manchester doubled within a single decade leading to overcrowding and a significant increase in waste accumulation
the miasma theory of disease made sense to the sanitary reformers of the mid th century
miasmas explained why cholera and other diseases were epidemic in places where the water was stagnant and foul smelling
a leading sanitary reformer london s edwin chadwick asserted that all smell is disease and maintained that a fundamental change in the structure of sanitation systems was needed to combat increasing urban mortality rates
chadwick saw the problem of cholera and typhoid epidemics as being directly related to urbanization and he proposed that new independent sewerage systems should be connected to homes
chadwick supported his proposal with reports from the london statistical society which showed dramatic increases in both morbidity and mortality rates since the beginning of urbanization in the early th century
though chadwick proposed reform on the basis of the miasma theory his proposals did contribute to improvements in sanitation such as preventing the reflux of noxious air from sewers back into houses by using separate drainage systems in the design of sanitation
that led incidentally to decreased outbreaks of cholera and thus helped to support the theory
the miasma theory was consistent with the observation that disease was associated with poor sanitation and hence foul odours and that sanitary improvements reduced disease
however it was inconsistent with the findings arising from microbiology and bacteriology in the later th century which eventually led to the adoption of the germ theory of disease although consensus was not reached immediately
concerns over sewer gas which was a major component of the miasma theory developed by galen and brought to prominence by the great stink in london in the summer of led proponents of the theory to observe that sewers enclosed the refuse of the human bowel which medical science had discovered could teem with typhoid cholera and other microbes
in the nuisances removal and diseases prevention act was passed to identify whether the transmission of cholera was by air or by water
the act was used to encourage owners to clean their dwellings and connect them to sewers
even though eventually disproved by the understanding of bacteria and the discovery of viruses the miasma theory helped establish the connection between poor sanitation and disease
that encouraged cleanliness and spurred public health reforms which in britain led to the public health acts of and and the local government act of
the latter of those enabled the instituting of investigations into the health and sanitary regulations of any town or place upon the petition of residents or as a result of death rates exceeding the norm
early medical and sanitary engineering reformers included henry austin joseph bazalgette edwin chadwick frank forster thomas hawksley william haywood henry letheby robert rawlinson john simon john snow and thomas wicksteed
their efforts and associated british regulatory improvements were reported in the united states as early as
particularly notable in th century sanitation reform is the work of joseph bazalgette chief engineer to london s metropolitan board of works
encouraged by the great stink parliament sanctioned bazalgette to design and construct a comprehensive system of sewers which intercepted london s sewage and diverted it away from its water supply
the system helped purify london s water and saved the city from epidemics
in the last of the three great british cholera
epidemics took hold in a small area of whitechapel
however the area was not yet connected to bazalgette s system and the confined area of the epidemic acted as testament to the efficiency of the system s design
years later the influence of those sanitary reforms on britain was described by richard rogers
the miasma theory did contribute to containing disease in urban settlements but did not allow the adoption of a suitable approach to the reuse of excreta in agriculture
it was a major factor in the practice of collecting human excreta from urban settlements and reusing them in the surrounding farmland
that type of resource recovery scheme was common in major cities in the th century before the introduction of sewer based sanitation systems
nowadays the reuse of excreta when done in a hygienic manner is known as ecological sanitation and is promoted as a way of closing the loop
throughout the th century concern about public health and sanitation along with the influence of the miasma theory were reasons for the advocacy of the then controversial practice of cremation
if infectious diseases were spread by noxious gases emitted from decaying organic matter that included decaying corpses
the public health argument for cremation faded with the eclipsing of the miasma theory of disease
although the connection between germ and disease was proposed quite early it was not until the late s that the germ theory was generally accepted
the miasmatic theory was challenged by john snow suggesting that there was some means by which the disease was spread via a poison or morbid material orig materies morbi in the water
he suggested this before and in response to a cholera epidemic on broad street in central london in
because of the miasmatic theory s predominance among italian scientists the discovery in the same year by filippo pacini of the bacillus that caused the disease was completely ignored
it was not until that robert koch proved that the bacterium bacillus anthracis caused anthrax which brought a definitive end to miasma theory
the work of john snow is notable for helping to make the connection between cholera and typhoid epidemics and contaminated water sources which contributed to the eventual demise of miasma theory
during the cholera epidemic of snow traced high mortality rates among the citizens of soho to a water pump in broad street
snow convinced the local government to remove the pump handle which resulted in a marked decrease in cases of cholera in the area
in snow submitted a paper to the british medical journal which attributed high numbers of cholera cases to water sources that were contaminated with human waste
snow used statistical data to show that citizens who received their water from upstream sources were considerably less likely to develop cholera than those who received their water from downstream sources
though his research supported his hypothesis that contaminated water not foul air was the source of cholera
epidemics a review committee concluded that snow s findings were not significant enough to warrant change and they were summarily dismissed
additionally other interests intervened in the process of reform
many water companies and civic authorities pumped water directly from contaminated sources such as the thames to public wells and the idea of changing sources or implementing filtration techniques was an unattractive economic prospect
in the face of such economic interests reform was slow to be adopted
in john snow made a testimony against the amendment to the nuisances removal and diseases prevention act that regularized air pollution of some industries
he claimed that
in the same year william farr who was then the major supporter of the miasma theory issued a report to criticize the germ theory
farr and the committee wrote that
the more formal experiments on the relationship between germ and disease were conducted by louis pasteur between and
he discovered the pathology of the puerperal fever and the pyogenic vibrio in the blood and suggested using boric acid to kill these microorganisms before and after confinement
by eight years after the death of john snow william farr publicly acknowledged that the miasma theory on the transmission of cholera was wrong by his statistical justification on the death rate
robert koch is widely known for his work with anthrax discovering the causative agent of the fatal disease to be bacillus anthracis
he published the discovery in a booklet as die tiologie der milzbrand krankheit begr ndet auf die entwicklungsgeschichte des bacillus anthracis the etiology of anthrax disease based on the developmental history of bacillus anthracis in while working in w llstein
his publication in on the structure of anthrax bacterium marked the first photography of a bacterium
he discovered the formation of spores in anthrax bacteria which could remain dormant under specific conditions
however under optimal conditions the spores were activated and caused disease
to determine this causative agent he dry fixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides used dyes to stain the cultures and observed them through a microscope
his work with anthrax is notable in that he was the first to link a specific microorganism with a specific disease rejecting the idea of spontaneous generation and supporting the germ theory of disease
