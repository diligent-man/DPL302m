in a review for the times of india javed amwer wrote vibe x is a good looking device
in fact it is more than good looking
it is incredibly thin and very light especially for a phone that has a five inch screen javed also wrote the frame around the screen is also made of tough plastic but has faux chrome finish
it is shiny and adds to the style of the device though we are not sure how well the shine will hold up with the use
the volume rocker on the right and the power button on the left have chamfered edges
these buttons fit in their sockets snuggly and feel perfect javed concluded vibe x has a great screen and a good design and the performance is also great
