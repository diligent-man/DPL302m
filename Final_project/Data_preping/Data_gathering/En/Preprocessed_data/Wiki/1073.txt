The California Democratic Council CDC is an independent California non profit founded at conferences at Asilomar and Fresno conferences in by future U S Senator Alan Cranston State Senator George Miller Jr and other liberal Democratic Party activists inspired by Adlai Stevenson's presidential candidacy they intended to organize the existing Stevenson Clubs into a grassroots movement to win back control of California State Government from the Republicans who then held the Governor's office and both US Senate seats
According to the group's website the organization which coordinates the activities of Democratic clubs statewide is the only one of its kind in the United States

President John F Kennedy said I have always regarded the California Democratic Council as one of the United States most important centers of citizen participation in politics In reality Kennedy and his brother Robert were closely allied in California to the Los Angeles political organization of Jesse Unruh the powerful Speaker of the State Assembly who was considered the bete noire of the liberal organization
The CDC club movement played an important role in the election of Governor Edmund G Pat Brown and a slate of other State Democratic candidates including Cranston as State Controller the first Democratic administration in the State since the New Deal
In CDC endorsed the US Senate candidacy of its founding father Alan Cranston but he lost the Democratic nomination to former Kennedy Press Secretary Pierre Salinger who was later defeated by George Murphy the Republican nominee in the General election
In the Council was bitterly split over the issue of American military entanglement in Vietnam After a horrendous struggle in which Governor Brown and Cranston sided with a CDC faction that was more moderate in opposing the war policy of President Lyndon Johnson both Brown and Cranston were booed and hissed at a CDC Convention Cranston's sister later concluded that this rift with the Democratic leadership marked the beginning of CDC's decline
Two years later CDC endorsed the anti war presidential candidacy of Senator Eugene McCarthy over that of Senator Robert F Kennedy who was supported by Unruh Kennedy won the Democratic Primary but was killed on the day of his victory
Later that year Cranston was at last elected US Senator remaining in office for the next years Though he had somewhat distanced himself from the Council his election symbolized the height of citizen participation in Party politics
