Spanish Gothic architecture is the style of architecture prevalent in Spain in the Late Medieval period
The Gothic style started in Spain as a result of Central European influence in the twelfth century when late Romanesque alternated with few expressions of pure Gothic architecture The High Gothic arrives with all its strength via the pilgrimage route the Way of St James in the thirteenth century Some of the most pure Gothic cathedrals in Spain closest related to the German and French Gothic were built at this time
In some cases the Gothic style was built and decorated with Mud jar elements by Mud jar craftsmen and Christian craftsmen influenced by them creating a highly distinctive Gothic style unique to Spain and Portugal The most important post thirteenth century Gothic styles in Spain are the Levantine Gothic characterized by its structural achievements and the unification of space and the Isabelline Gothic under the Catholic Monarchs that predicated a slow transition to Renaissance architecture
