In the fictional town of Ebbing Missouri Mildred Hayes is grieving over the rape and murder of her teenage daughter Angela seven months earlier
Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation Mildred rents three disused billboards near her home and posts on them Raped While Dying And Still No Arrests and How Come Chief Willoughby
The billboards upset many townspeople including Chief Bill Willoughby and the racist alcoholic police officer Jason Dixon
Despite harassment and threats Mildred remains determined for the billboards to stay up
Although Bill is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration he finds the billboards an unfair attack on his character
He also reveals to her he has terminal pancreatic cancer
Angered by the lack of respect for the chief's authority Dixon threatens the businessman who rented Mildred the billboards Red Welby and also arrests Mildred's friend Denise on trivial charges for drug possession
Mildred is visited by her abusive ex-husband Charlie who reveals that shortly before Angela's murder he had turned down her request to come and live with him
Bill takes Mildred in for questioning after she drills a hole in her dentist's thumb when he threatens her
During the interview Bill accidentally coughs up blood into Mildred's face
Mildred gets help and Bill is hospitalized but he leaves the hospital against medical advice and spends an idyllic day with his wife Anne and their two daughters
He then takes his own life in the barn with a handgun to spare his family the pain of watching him die slowly from cancer
He leaves suicide notes for several people including one for Mildred in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide and that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up for another month amused at the guilt this will bring her and hoping that they will keep attention on the murder
Dixon reacts to the news of Bill's death by assaulting Welby and throwing him out of a second-story window
This is witnessed by Abercrombie the chief's replacement who fires Dixon
Later the billboards are destroyed by arson
Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station which she believes is unoccupied for the night
However Dixon is there to read Bill's letter to him which advises him to let go of hate and learn to love
Dixon escapes with Angela's case file but suffers severe burns
Mildred's acquaintance James witnesses the incident and extinguishes Dixon's burning clothes
He later provides Mildred with an alibi claiming they were on a date at the time of the incident
Dixon is treated for his burns and put in the same hospital room as Welby to whom he apologizes
Jerome who was employed by Red Welby's company gives Mildred the spares that were made in case of mistakes
She uses them to restore the billboard messages
Discharged from the hospital Dixon overhears a man who threatened Mildred bragging in a bar of having raped and killed a girl in the same manner as Angela
He notes the Idaho license plate number of the man's vehicle then provokes a fight by scratching the man's face thereby getting a sample of his DNA underneath his fingernails
Meanwhile Mildred goes on a date with James to thank him for the alibi
Charlie enters with his -year-old girlfriend Penelope mocks James and admits to burning the billboards while drunk
James senses that Mildred went out with him out of pity and leaves angrily
Mildred considers attacking Charlie but instead tells him to treat Penelope well and leaves
Though commending him Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match that found on Angela's body and that the man was overseas on military duty nine months prior
Dixon concludes that the man must be guilty of some other rape and murder and joins Mildred on a trip to Idaho to kill him
On the way Mildred confesses to Dixon that she set the police station on fire he replies Who the hell else would it have been
They each express uncertainty about their mission and agree to decide what to do along the way

Malaya Drew plays Gabriella a local reporter and Christopher Berry plays bar patron Tony
Jerry Winsett appears as Geoffrey the dentist who has his thumb drilled by Mildred
Momma Dixon Jason Dixon's mother is portrayed by Sandy Martin

While traveling through the Southern United States around Martin McDonagh came across a couple of accusatory billboards about an unsolved crime which he described as raging and painful and tragic alleging the murder of a woman named Kathy Page by her husband Steve Page in Vidor Texas
The billboards highlighted the incompetence of the police work and deeply affected McDonagh he said that the image stayed in my mind kept gnawing at me and presumed that they were put up by the victim's mother
This incident combined with his desire to create strong female characters inspired him to write the story for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri
McDonagh discussed the creative process saying that it took him about ten years to decide that it was a mother who had taken these things out
It all became fiction based on a couple of actual billboards
The character of Mildred was written with Frances McDormand in mind and likewise the character of Dixon was written specifically for Sam Rockwell
McDormand initially felt that she was older than the character as it was written and suggested that Mildred instead be Angela's grandmother McDonagh disagreed feeling that it would change the story too much
McDormand's husband Joel Coen persuaded her to take the part regardless
McDormand took inspiration for her character from John Wayne and Rockwell wanting to make his character the exact opposite of Mildred took inspiration for his character in part from Wayne's co-star in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance Lee Marvin
Principal photography began on May in Sylva North Carolina and ran for days
Allison Outdoor Advertising of Sylva built the actual billboards which were put in a pasture near Black Mountain North Carolina because that location was better
Most of the time the billboards were covered because people in the area found them upsetting
David Penix of Arden North Carolina bought the billboards and used the wood for a roof in Douglas Lake Tennessee though the messages are no longer in order
Town Pump Tavern in Black Mountain which had appeared in The World Made Straight was used as a set and was closed for three days during filming
A pool table and booths were added
The bar's actual sign appeared in the film
The musical score was written by Carter Burwell who had also supplied the score for McDonagh's films In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths
As well as Burwell's score the film features songs by ABBA Joan Baez The Felice Brothers the Four Tops Monsters of Folk and Townes Van Zandt
The score was nominated for Best Original Score at the th Academy Awards
All tracks composed by Carter Burwell unless stated

Some criticized the script for McDonagh's portrayal of small town America
The New York Times columnist Wesley Morris called McDonagh's portrayal of rural America a caricature a set of postcards from a Martian lured to America by a cable news ticker and by rumors of how easily flattered and provoked we are Writing for The New Yorker Tim Parks praised the magnificently photographed images but wrote that the plot contained a thousand cheap coincidences
Parks concluded that the film is empty of emotional intelligence and devoid of any remotely honest observation of the society it purports to serve In her review for The New York Times Manohla Dargis wrote McDonagh's jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material's clichs and overriding theatricality
The film was also controversial for its handling of racial themes particularly surrounding the redemptive arc of Officer Dixon
In The Daily Beast blogger Ira Madison III described the treatment of Rockwell's character altogether offensiveMcDonagh's attempts to script the black experience in America are often fumbling and backward and full of outdated tropes Alyssa Rosenberg noted in The Washington Post that Dixon's redemption doesn't merely defang his previous venomous bigotry it softens Mildred's character development
