I am a mechanic That has been the direction of my entire vocational life Driving is a hobby a relaxation for me like golfing is to others I should like to drive a Formula One machine not for the grand prize but just to see what it is like I should think it would be jolly good funWith a very pronounced Brummie accent from his hometown of Birmingham renowned for car manufacturing combined with a seemingly obscure and sardonic sense of humour he was affectionately known by his American racing crew as Teddy Teabag for his tea drinking or Sidebite as he talked out of the side of his mouth He played a major role in the development and success of the racing versions of the Shelby Cobra in SCCA USRRC and FIA sports car racing between and as well as the Daytona Coupe and versions of the Cobra and the Ford GT GT

Miles had a reputation for courtesy on the track and was sometimes called the Stirling Moss of the West Coast While a member of the AC Cobra Ford Team Miles entered a Lotus in the Player's at Mosport In he shared a Ford GT MkII with Bruce McLaren at the Hours of Le Mans but retired with gearbox trouble Earlier in the year also with McLaren he had finished second at the Hours of Sebring
The next year he won the Hours of Daytona sharing the Ford GT MkII with Lloyd Ruby and then won the Hours of Sebring Several months later sharing the drive with Denny Hulme Miles was leading the Hours of Le Mans in the car but Ford executive Leo Beebe desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the finish line together instructed Carroll Shelby to order him to slow down which Shelby did Accordingly on the final lap the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLarenChris Amon and the third place car from Ford drew up and they cruised to the line together The French race officials after initially agreeing to Ford's dead heat photo finish reneged during the final hour of the race Although Miles' car and McLaren's car crossed the finish line together McLaren's was declared the winner because having started in second position behind Miles' car it had therefore covered more distance in fact meters more distance during the race Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring Daytona and Le Mans in the same year
The Ford J car was intended to be the successor to the Ford GT MkII and despite reliability problems showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials After the death of Walt Hansgen in a J car while testing at Le Mans in April Ford made the decision to shelve the J car and focus on the proven Mk IIs Little development was done for the rest of the World Sports Car Championship season Finally in August Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver The J car featured a breadvan shaped rear section that experimented with Kammback aerodynamic theories as well as an untested honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car but the design remained unproven with high speed prototype sports cars
After almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather Miles approached the end of the track's one mile km downhill back straight at top speed over miles per hour kmh when the car suddenly looped flipped crashed and caught fire The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles killing him instantly As a result the aerodynamics of the J car were greatly modified to correct the rear end lift generated at race speeds Ford executives under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the program in five months also ordered a roll cage to be installed in future versions of the car The significantly revised J car renamed the Ford Mk IV won the only two races in which it was entered the Sebring Hours and the Hours of Le Mans
