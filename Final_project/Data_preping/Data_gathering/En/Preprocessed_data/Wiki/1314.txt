Despite his distinguished if unexceptional career from July to March he was relegated to a Special Auxiliary Position a special arrangement intended to handle the large number of officers after the end of the war During that time he became a member of the Italian Fascist Party on May and was promoted to colonel on December
On his return to active duty in he was assigned to the General Secretariat of the Supreme Commission on Defence ans he le the service from February He remained at that post until March when he was sent to command the th Heavy Field Artillery Regiment
On January he was promoted brigadier general and in March he returned to Rome as chief of staff to the VIII Army Corps He then served as artillery commander of the III Army Corps at Milan in before being appointed acting chief of staff for the X Army Corps at Napoli in and for the VI Army Corps at Bologna in On November he was appointed to the highly prestigious and sought after post of commander of the Granatieri di Sardegna Infantry Division in Rome
In March he was sent to Italian Somaliland to command the Special Infantry Division Laghi during the Second Italo Ethiopian War There he occupied the area of the equatorial area and defeated the Ethiopian ras Desta Damtew In October he became governor of the area now the Galla Sidamo Governorate as well as commander of the local Italian garrison For his service he was promoted to divisional general in December and received a further Military Order of Savoy He remained at that position until His violent suppression of Ethiopian resistance particularly in the wake of a failed assassination attempt on Viceroy Rodolfo Graziani in February led to him being listed as a war criminal by the Ethiopian government which attempted to have him extradited to Ethiopia after the Second World War

Geloso remained in Albania until June During his tenure he planned for an attack on Greece and elements of his plans were indeed used in the subsequent Italian invasion of Greece but it was under quite different conditions and participating forces from his plans Although a capable organiser he was helpless in the backroom political manoeuvring that characterized the Fascist regime After disagreeing with Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano Mussolini's heir apparent during a discussion of a possible war with Greece on April he was replaced by Sebastiano Visconti Prasca
Italy's entry into World War II found him as head of the Third Army but he returned to Albania on November to take up command of the newly formed Eleventh Army in the ongoing war against Greece After the German invasion of Greece and the start of the country's occupation in September he was named Supreme Commander of the Italian Armed Forces in Greece while remaining commander of Eleventh Army He kept both positions until his dismissal in May In October he was promoted to army general
His tenure in Greece earned him criticism from many sides The Greeks naturally resented him as the commander in chief of the Italian occupation forces and the brutality that he displayed in anti partisan operations However the Italians' German allies considered him too weak and ineffective despite his reputation as a loyal adherent to the Axis alliance Geloso opposed the Germans' demands for even harsher retaliations and even resisted the demands for implementation of discriminatory measures against Greek Jews in the Italian occupation zone On the other hand Geloso in spring approved the institution of collective punishment against the civilian population in retaliation for partisan attacks including measures such as aerial bombardment and heavy artillery fire the pillaging of their food supplies and the deportation to concentration camps of the village chiefs and all of the men who made up the community council That order led to a series of atrocities over the following months such as the Domenikon massacre
At the same time Geloso's relations with the Germans became increasingly strained as he jealously guarded the Italian prerogatives in Greece against German encroachments particularly after the appointment of Colonel General Alexander Löhr as the German Commander in chief Southeast in December The appointment came as a result of the worsening situation on the North African Front which made an Allied landing in Greece increasingly likely The Germans who did not trust the Italians' ability to withstand such an attack began moving more of their own troops into Greece sought to supplant the Italians in certain strategic areas including Athens and the Athens Thessaloniki railway and justified the move by thereby making additional Italian troops available to defend western Greece Geloso vehemently refused to consider that and in a later meeting ounterproposed for any additional German forces in Greece to be placed under his command With the backing of the Italian high command the situation remained unresolved with Geloso even proposing setting up an Army Group East under his command comprising all Italian forces in the occupied areas of the Balkans as a counterpartbans counterweight to Löhr's command with himself at its head
Despite being highly praised by the chief of the Italian General Staff Ugo Cavallero as perhaps the best of our generals technically prepared energetic and tactful Geloso was dismissed on May and placed under the disposition of the Ministry of War The likely reason was his final disagreement with Löhr in a meeting a few days earlier Löhr demanded from the Italians a series of measures to curb the growing Greek Resistance including the arrest of the officers of the Greek army the confiscation of all radios and the handover of all Jews in the Italian zone to German control An Italian investigation headed by Admiral Domenico Cavagnari into his tenure in Greece ended up absolving him of all charges brought against him for malpractice and corruption
On June he was placed in the reserve because of his advanced age but was recalled to service attached to the Ministry of War In the days before the Italian armistice he was placed in command of the troops intended to defend Rome but he never actually exercised a field command He was captured by the Germans on September and sent to an officers' camp at Schokken He was liberated by the arrival of Red Army troops sent to Kharkov and thence returned to Italy on October During his imprisonment Geloso wrote to Graziani the Minister of War in the Italian Social Republic RSI asking for his intervention to secure his release but appeared not to have joined the RSI On his return to Italy he was asked to compile a series of memoranda on his fellow prisoners and their behaviour in captivity
He was placed on leave on February but was recalled to temporary service from April to June On May the Italian monarchy having been abolished the previous year he swore an oath of loyalty to the new Italian Republic On May he was placed in permanent leave because of his advanced age He died at Rome on July
