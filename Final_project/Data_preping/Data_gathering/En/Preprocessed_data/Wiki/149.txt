facilitated communication fc or supported typing is a scientifically discredited technique that attempts to aid communication by people with autism or other communication disabilities who are non verbal
the facilitator guides the disabled person s arm or hand and attempts to help them type on a keyboard or other device
there is widespread agreement within the scientific community and among disability advocacy organizations that fc is a pseudoscience
research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through fc rather than the disabled person
the facilitator may believe they are not the source of the messages due to the ideomotor effect which is the same effect that guides a ouija board
studies have consistently found that fc is unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions e g showing the patient but not the facilitator an object
in addition in numerous cases disabled persons have been assumed by facilitators to be typing a coherent message while the patient s eyes were closed or while they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board
facilitated communication has been called the single most scientifically discredited intervention in all of developmental disabilities
some promoters of the technique have claimed that fc cannot be clearly disproven because a testing environment might cause the subject to lose confidence
however there is a scientific consensus that facilitated communication is not a valid communication technique and its use is strongly discouraged by most speech and language disability professional organizations
there have been a large number of false abuse allegations made through facilitated communication
facilitated communication is promoted as a means to assist people with severe communication disabilities in pointing to letters on an alphabet board keyboard or other device so that they can communicate independently
it has also been called supported typing progressive kinesthetic feedback and written output communication enhancement
it is related to the rapid prompting method rpm also known as informative pointing which also has no evidence of efficacy
the person with disabilities who is often unable to rely on speech to communicate is called the communication partner while the person holding their arm is called the facilitator
the facilitator holds or touches the communication partner s elbow wrist hand sleeve or other parts of the body while the communication partner points to letters of the alphabet on a keyboard or other device
one device popular with early fc users was the canon communicator which printed a tape of letters when activated
however two american companies were later charged by the federal trade commission for making false and unsubstantiated claims that the device could enable disabled people to communicate using fc
the companies settled and stopped mentioning fc in their advertising campaigns
proponents of fc claim that the reason people with autism cannot communicate effectively involves motor issues such as apraxia and that they lack confidence in their abilities but physical support helps them overcome this limitation
however this claim is unsubstantiated
research indicates that non verbal autistics are unable to communicate due to intellectual disability
the facilitator is depicted as helping the patient with pointing to letters controlling involuntary arm movements avoiding mistakes initiating movement verbal prompts and moral support
it is also claimed that the facilitator must believe in the patient s ability to communicate
former facilitator janyce boynton who came to reject the technique after taking part in double blind trials later reported that her training took for granted that the process worked and that the complexity of facilitation made it hard to realise that messages were coming from her expectations and not from her patients scott lilienfeld the dobbs professor of psychology at emory university writing in the neuroethics blog admonishes practitioners of mental health practice not to ignore their epistemic duties responsibilities to seek out and possess accurate knowledge about the world and wrote
techniques similar to fc appeared around the s with early observations regarding facilitated teaching of children with autism being published by else hansen denmark lorna wing england and rosalind oppenheimer u s
studies were made in denmark in the s and s but did not have an impact outside of the country and the debate there died out in the early s due to a lack of scientific evidence
in australia special educator rosemary crossley independently created facilitated communication in where it became popular largely due to her efforts
it was popularized in the united states beginning in the late s by arthur schawlow and douglas biklen
fc has also received attention in asia and europe
early users of facilitated communication praised it for its apparent simplicity
it was promoted as a teaching strategy that did not require objective evaluation or close monitoring
however as early as more than peer reviewed studies had not only failed to demonstrate fc s efficacy but indicated that any successes reported were due to facilitator influence
this influence is usually attributed to non conscious movements and it is thought that facilitators are genuinely unaware that they are controlling the communications
in the american psychological association apa passed a resolution cautioning against the use of facilitated communication citing the lack of scientific evidence
they also stated that information obtained via fc should not be used to confirm or deny allegations of abuse or to make diagnostic or treatment decisions
in recognition of the continued scientific evidence against the technique this was followed by similar statements from the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry aacap american speech language hearing association asha and the international society for augmentative and alternative communication isaac in a british government report concluded that the phenomenon fails to materialise once facilitator effects have been controlled
it would be hard to justify further research on this
by it was reported in a comprehensive review of peer reviewed literature that facilitated communication fc had largely been empirically discredited as an effective intervention for previously uncommunicative persons with disabilities especially those with autism and related disorders
key empirical findings consistently showed that the facilitator and not the client initiated communication
many people believed fc had passed its peak characterizing it as a fad and pseudoscientific
however promotion of the technique continued with supporters dismissing empirical investigations as irrelevant flawed or unnecessary and calling fc an effective and legitimate intervention
as of the facilitated communication movement remained popular and it continued to be used in many countries
mostert writes all the newer pro fc studies operate from the premise that fc works and is a legitimate practice to be used in investigating any number of other phenomena related to people with autism and other related severe communication problems
such assumptions increasingly morph fc into a valid intervention among readers who are unaware of the empirical dismissal of the intervention and who might not be skilled in distinguishing solid from suspect research
in this regard it is likely that fc will continue to reinforce the assumptions of efficacy among parents and practitioners
these perceptions will continue to be reinforced by professional organizations such as the facilitated communication institute at syracuse university a fairly wide acceptance of fc internationally and the vacuum created by few if any future solid empirical studies that are likely to dissuade the faithful facilitated communication is closely related to the rapid prompting method rpm in which the facilitator holds the letter board instead of touching the patient
proponents of rpm deny similarities with fc and state that the prompts are nonspecific
however rpm contains subtle cuing that makes it highly susceptible to influence from the facilitator
other similarities between rpm and fc include reluctance or refusal to test their claims in controlled settings purportedly because the process breaks the trust between facilitator and client presumed competence reliance on anecdotal accounts as proof of efficacy maintenance of practices techniques and claims that are inconsistent with the known research claims of extraordinary literacy or intellectual breakthroughs unconscious verbal or physical cuing by facilitators to obtain the expected responses and inadequate or non existent protocols to account for the effects of the facilitator
in a dispute about the use of spelling to communicate s c a brand of rpm developed between the lower merion school district and the parent of a child attending school there
the parents claimed the child was deprived of a free education because the district declined to pay for a private educational program based on s c
in december of that year the found that there was no evidence that s c enabled the child to communicate and thus the school district prevailed

valid there is widespread agreement within the scientific community and multiple disability advocacy organizations that fc is not a valid technique for communicating with those with autism spectrum disorder
instead research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through fc involving ideomotor effect guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator
studies have consistently found that fc is unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions e g showing the patient but not the facilitator an object
while video tapes exist that appear to show disabled people communicating through fc or who have used it as a means to learn independent typing these videos are widely regarded as inaccurate and misleading
according to one researcher you can edit videotape and show whatever you want
they ll show you a close up of the finger moving across the keyboard
but you re not getting what else is going on
researchers attribute the facilitators beliefs about authorship to the ideomotor effect also called the clever hans or ouija effect
while proponents say that fc should never involve guiding the patient researchers attending an fc class in observed that physical force was used to prevent the patients from moving their hand away from the keyboard
facilitators may also influence movements without realizing it
researcher gina green stated very subtle influence can affect people s behavior
it doesn t even have to be touch
it can be the slightest sound the slightest visual cue guidelines for facilitators instruct practitioners to expect the emergence of hidden skills and sensitive personal information to use anecdotal data to validate authorship to avoid objective scrutiny
some observers have reported that while the facilitators were watching the letter board their communication partners were often distracted staring off into space rolling around on the floor falling asleep or otherwise not paying attention
in other cases the communication partners spoke words that conflicted with the words being typed
individuals described as highly competent would also give wrong answers to simple questions or information that they should have readily known e g
the name of the family dog the names of family members the spelling of their own name but which facilitators did not
proponents of the technique believed that patients who had not been taught reading writing or mathematics were capable of writing down complex thoughts and solving multiplication problems
patients have also been claimed to write books and poetry advocate for better treatment of people with disabilities express a desire to get married have sexual relations decide important medical issues and in some cases report abuses allegedly occurring in their homes
according to psychologist adrienne perry the adult or child with autism is made a screen for a facilitator s hostilities hopes beliefs or suspicions
while proponents of fc claim that autism is primarily a motor control problem that can be overcome with physical support this view is not accepted by the scientific community
autism is often accompanied by intellectual disabilities affecting language and communication which cannot be overcome by supportively holding someone s hand
facilitators reject objective data and use public opinion and qualitative studies to promote fc s efficacy despite contradicting a long history of autism research
in some cases patients learn to give specific responses to cues from the facilitator such as in cases where the facilitator only touches their shoulder or does not touch the patient at all
proponents also say that a few individuals using fc have developed the ability to type independently or with minimal support but these claims are anecdotal and have not been substantiated
many facilitators deny they are influencing their communication partners movements even when faced with evidence to the contrary
according to the american academy of pediatrics aap clinical report identification evaluation and management of children with autism spectrum disorder published in january the current scientific evidence does not support the use of facilitated communication in which a nonverbal individual is guided to communicate
this differs from augmentative and alternative communication in which the individual is taught to communicate independently
belief in facilitated communication is promoted by its status as a claimed miracle cure presented when parents are undergoing stress and grief from learning that their child has a disability
the only evidence of success is the transcript of apparent communication
in some cases of autism parents reject the diagnosis and say that their child s disability is physical rather than developmental and with fc or rpm their beliefs are confirmed
researchers james mulick john jacobson and frank kobe state that fc is used to stroke their hopes with empty promises regardless of their sincerity while reaping personal or political rewards and working hard to prevent systematic verification of their claims
they add that people with handicaps can be valued members of their families and communities without resorting to appeals to miracle cures and that genuine help is available but advances in treatment and understanding come at the price of rigorous training dedication to accuracy and scientific standards and objective verification of all treatment claims
bernard rimland a research psychologist who founded the autism research institute of san diego and the autism society of america asked how is it possible that an autistic kid can pick up the last tiny crumbs of potato chips off a plate but not have sufficient motor coordination to type the letter e howard shane director of the center for communication enhancement at children s hospital in boston and an associate professor at harvard medical school finds it curious that those being facilitated can only create these insightful comments when helped by an assistant
why when technology allowed people with severe disabilities the opportunity to access independent communication with even the slightest movement e g an eye wink movement of an eyebrow a puff of air into a straw would a facilitator need to hold their hand
testifying in the anna stubblefield court case psychology professor james todd called facilitated communication the single most scientifically discredited intervention in all of developmental disabilities and that every methodologically sound study of fc has shown it to be invalid
writing about that case in the journal disability and society mark sherry voiced similar concerns about fc s lack of scientific validity calling it a sham hoax and a fraud sherry s was the first article published in a disability studies journal which thoroughly critiqued stubblefield s actions a noteworthy contribution because stubblefield had also been in disability studies and had previously published about fc in the journal disability studies quarterly
sherry suggested that some of the defenders of stubblefield and fc more broadly are either her personal friends or work in institutions which receive substantial income from providing fc
a newspaper editorial from syracuse university where the techniques relevant to the case had been taught called it inexcusable and embarrassing that the university continues to support fc after over years of research has discredited it
members of the fc movement rely on anecdotal and observational data e g the existence of unique spellings or unexpected skills or revelations made during the communication session in order to back up their claims
however because cueing is often subtle and it is not always possible to observe the influence of the facilitator informal observations and facilitator reports have proven unreliable in determining authorship
parents and researchers who questioned fc s effectiveness and supported evaluating fc by objective methods have been accused of being oppressors of the disabled told they were narrow minded outmoded evil jealous they were not the ones to discover fc and in some cases accused of hate speech for advocating a more studied approach
proponents claim that testing is demeaning to the disabled person that the testing environment creates performance anxiety or that those being facilitated may purposely produce nonsense refuse to respond or give wrong answers to counteract the negative attitudes of those who are skeptical of the technique
mostert wrote in fc proponents must be encouraged to subject their claims to further scientific verification the claims of anecdotal evidence notwithstanding
if any small part of fc is ever to be found effective or even plausible it is abundantly clear that only by careful use of controlled experimental methods will this be established the only way to determine whether communications are truly independent is to perform controlled testing where the facilitator does not already know the answers to questions and therefore cannot inadvertently or purposefully cue their communication partner to obtain the desired answer
even if the facilitator feels like they are not moving the other person s hand they can still be providing cues that lead to specific letters on the keyboard
in when fc was fairly new to the united states douglas biklen was quoted in the washington post as saying he welcomed scientific studies but the article went on to say he doesn t want to do them
he s an educator not a psychiatrist and like other educators who have written about facilitated communication he is comfortable with the fact that there is often a lag time between the application of a new method and its scientific validation
although proponents say that fc is difficult or impossible to objectively test psychologist james t
todd wrote the determination of authorship in fc involves a straightforward application of basic experimental methods described comprehensively by mill more than a century and half ago but understood for millennia
we are not speaking of obscure or controversial techniques
we are speaking of authorship validation by selectively presenting different information to two people then observing what is produced despite the fc community s reluctance to participate in testing researchers outside the community set up blinded experiments to identify who was doing the communicating
some of the tests were conducted as a direct response to cases involving sexual abuse allegations made through facilitated communication against parents teachers and caregivers of people with disabilities
however a number of controlled evaluations were also conducted by clinicians researchers and program administrators who were considering the use of fc but wanted an objective empirical basis for deciding what role if any fc would have in their programs
the o d
heck center in schenectady new york was one of the first in the united states to go public with their findings which were that their clients produced meaningful responses through facilitated communication only when their facilitators had access to the correct responses
the report also ruled out issues of confidence or skepticism on the part of the evaluators
all twelve participants people with disabilities were chosen for the evaluation because their facilitators believed in their ability to communicate through fc
the study demonstrated that the communication partners were systematically and unknowingly being influenced by their facilitators
the researchers wrote in fact the nature of the findings permits us to assert that their output in facilitated communication was not only influenced but was controlled and determined by the facilitators
to all appearances these participants had been producing thoughtful communication and several had consistently engaged in interactive conversations using facilitated communication
many people serving these individuals believed that this output reflected the valid expressions of the participants the result of the o d
heck study seemed so startling especially in light of the positive response fc was getting in the popular press that frontline featured the story in its prisoners of silence
in genae a
hall research director for the behavior analysis center for autism wrote the fact that facilitators often control and direct the typing has been called facilitator influence which seems to be a misnomer
facilitator influence suggests that the disabled person is emitting verbal behavior and the facilitator is exerting partial control or influence over that behavior
although partial control certainly may occur when fading prompts within structured teaching programs such control has not been demonstrated in most cases of fc
rather than influencing the typed messages the facilitator appears to be the sole author of those messages
thus the focus of analysis is shifted from the disabled person s behavior to the facilitator s behavior
multiple other double blind studies were being conducted at the same time and whenever conditions were adequately controlled to prevent the facilitator from knowing the answers to questions the results revealed facilitator influence if not direct authorship
in thistledown regional centre in ontario canada conducted an internal study of people with autism and stopped using fc when the results showed facilitator influence was contaminating the messages being produced by these results had been replicated by researchers worldwide in at least studies in credible peer reviewed research journals using multiple different methods that ensure the facilitator does not know or cannot guess the expected message or does not look at the letters
in reflecting on the trajectory fc has taken in several countries including denmark the u s
and australia von tetzchner wrote in the struggle to keep up to date with an increasing number of published papers both researchers and practitioners tend to forget history
in order to avoid making the same mistakes over again the issues and processes underlying the rise and fall of facilitating techniques as well as other intervention methods in various countries should have a natural place in research reviews
when an intervention claimed to have exceptional effects disappears the likely reason is lack of positive results by more than controlled studies and blind tests had been conducted in addition to numerous controlled tests conducted in legal cases
the studies consistently showed without a doubt that the messages obtained through facilitated communication were controlled by the facilitators and not their communication partners
the vast majority of evidence now indicates that facilitated communication is not scientifically valid
however this information has not stopped many individuals from using this technique under various circumstances and furthermore advocating for its effectiveness
the overwhelming majority of studies conducted on the efficacy of this technique has revealed that any positive results indicating that facilitated communication has worked can be attributed to the facilitators themselves
be it the facilitator attributing their own beliefs and views onto the individual or creating a pseudo personality for the disabled individual based on their previous encounters with them it is clear that the facilitator is really the one doing all the communicating
the american psychological association apa issued a statement in that there was no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy finally even further defining facilitated communication as a pseudoscience the apa issued a statement indicating that facilitated communication studies have repeatedly demonstrated that it is not a scientifically valid technique and that it is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy
pat mirenda professor in the department of educational and counseling psychology and special education at the university of british columbia and co author david r
beukelman barkley professor of communication disorders at the university of nebraska lincoln had included fc in early versions of their textbook augmentative and alternative communication supporting children and adults with complex communication needs
these versions are quoted in pro fc literature
however they decided not to include fc in revised versions and in mirenda stated i came to recognize painfully to be honest that my advocacy stance biased me to interpret what i saw on videotapes as independent typing even though other explanations were more plausible e g subtle prompting resulting in an ideomotor effect and that even if independent typing did occur subsequent to fc exposure only correlational but definitely not causal evidence exists with regard to its relationship to fc
in short i do not endorse fc as a communication or instructional technique and i do not support its use
stephen n
calculator of the university of new hampshire an early proponent of fc later distanced himself from the movement because he could not replicate claims of independent communication in his own research studies
he described the importance of determining the extent of facilitator influence the consequences of falsely attributing messages to communicators rather than facilitators continue to have significant financial social and moral ramifications
facilitators must take extraordinary precautions to assure that they are not unduly influencing messages and thereby impinging on communicators freedom of speech
the rights of individuals to express their thoughts and ideas should not be circumvented by facilitators who communicate for them unwilling or not
janyce boynton who at one time was a strong fc proponent is now one of fc s leading critics
in the early s she was the facilitator for a non speaking high school girl with autism who seemed to describe having been sexually abused by her parents resulting in the girl and her brother being removed from their home
however systematic testing by howard shane revealed that the girl could not have been the author of the messages
the case was described in the pbs frontline documentary prisoners of silence
unlike many in the fc proponent community boynton accepted the evidence from shane s testing and other well controlled scientific studies
she stopped using fc convinced her school administration to implement a system wide prohibition on its use and apologized to the falsely accused parents of the girl she had worked with
in a presentation at the csicon meetings in boynton argued that most fc facilitators are well meaning but are caught up in a belief system that leads them to discount the overwhelming evidence that fc does not work
she maintains a clearinghouse of professional articles and media coverage about fc and helped in convincing the university of northern iowa to stop sponsoring an annual workshop that included instruction in fc
as stated by another member of that group stuart vyse this is just the beginning
there are a number of other universities and governmental organizations that tacitly or explicitly endorse fc and or its related techniques and ms
boynton and her allies have their eyes on a number of these future targets
in belgian neurologist steven laureys claimed that rom houben a comatose man was able to type out thoughts on a keypad with the help of facilitated communications
however when independent tests demonstrated that fc could not produce the correct answers to questions if the facilitator had not been in the room he agreed that houben had not been communicating
stories of purported successes are still reported in magazines such as reader s digest in movies and plays and on television shows such as abc s prime time live with diane sawyer
thousands of people teachers parents speech pathologists psychologists struggling to find a way to communicate with individuals who otherwise demonstrated little ability to use words to communicate adopted fc with blinding speed with little public scrutiny or debate
eric schopler then director of an autism education program at the university of north carolina chapel hill and editor of the journal of autism described promoting facilitated communication with no empirical evidence as reckless
describing this rapid rise in popularity particularly in the united states doctors john w
jacobson james a
mulick and allen a
schwartz wrote the general acceptance of fc by the public and segments of the professional community has called into question the rigor with which educational and therapeutic interventions are evaluated in publicly funded programs and the ability of many professionals to critically assess the procedures they use
as such fc serves as a case study in how the public and alarmingly some professionals fail to recognize the role of science in distinguishing truth from falsity and its applicability to assessing the value of treatment modalities james randi a magician familiar with the ideomotor effect commonly attributed to dowsing and later linked to fc was called in to investigate facilitated communication at the university of wisconsin at madison in and later called it a crock that does more harm than good by raising false hopes among families of autistic children
the james randi educational foundation has offered a million dollar prize to a valid demonstration of facilitated communication in randi responded in an interview for the rom houben case where it was shown that messages from a belgian man who was believed to be in a coma for years were generated by the facilitator our prize is still there
in syracuse university founded the facilitated communication institute to promote the use of fc
douglas biklen was appointed as the institute s first director
in the name was changed to the institute on communication and inclusion ici
it is part of the center on disability and inclusion of the school of education
according to the ici website the institute
is an active research training and support center and the nation s leading resource for information about communication and inclusion for individuals who type to communicate the institute carries out training and research in fc and publishes scholarly articles books and films
from through the university of northern iowa uni held the midwest summer institute that focused on inclusive schools employment and daily living as well as communication and supported or facilitated typing for people with autism spectrum disabilit ies and other complex communication needs in following the release of a statement from scientists and academics arguing fc had long been discredited and calling it an invalidated and demonstrably harmful practice
uni announced it would stop supporting the conference
there have been instances in which facilitated communication produces allegations of sexual or physical abuse
often the alleged abuse is sexual and contains extensive explicit pornographic details it is not known whether fc generates more abuse allegations than other suggestive techniques
researchers suspect that facilitators involved in this type of case may mistakenly believe there is a link between early abuse and autism or suspect familial abuse for other reasons
as green wrote in a article suggestions about sexual abuse permeate the culture
just watch oprah or phil donahue almost any time or scan the pop psychology section at your local bookstore
couple that with mandatory abuse reporting laws mix in a little bit of crusading zeal to save people with disabilities from mistreatment and you have a potent set of antecedents for facilitators to produce allegations in frontline s prisoners of silence featured the story of gerry gherardi of north carolina who was accused through fc generated messages of sexually abusing his son
despite protestations of innocence gherardi was forced to stay away from his home for six months
the charges were dropped when court ordered double blind tests showed that gherardi s son could not write
in the same year rimland reported in a new york times article that he knew of about cases where families were accused through facilitated communication of sexually abusing their children
by there were known cases with many others settled without reaching public visibility
since then the number of cases continues to increase
in addition to accusations of sexual abuse facilitators have reportedly fallen in love with their communication partners and relying on fc for consent initiated sexual physical contact with people in their care raising serious ethical and legal problems
in anna stubblefield a rutgers university newark philosophy professor was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault against a man with severe mental disabilities
a proponent of facilitated communication stubblefield s web site described her as certified as a facilitated communication trainer by the fc institute at the school of education syracuse university
she provides motor planning support for communication and literacy for adults and children stubblefield stated that the two of them had a mutually consenting relationship established through facilitated communication
at the time the investigation began in stubblefield was the chair of rutgers newark s philosophy department whose professional work centered on ethics race and disability rights but she was subsequently put on administrative leave without pay and removed as chair of the philosophy department
the victim was identified as d j a year old african american man with severe mental disabilities who cannot speak has cerebral palsy and is unable to stand independently or accurately direct movements of his body
based on his disability his mother and brother were appointed his legal guardians
stubblefield stated that she had successfully communicated with him determining he was of normal intelligence
she subsequently brought him to conferences where she held him out as a success story
in she revealed to his mother and brother that she had had sexual relations with d j
and said that they were in love attributing consent to messages received while facilitating
however testing of d j
by family members failed to establish the ability to communicate and stubblefield was thanked but denied further access to d j
she continued to attempt to maintain contact with d j
and began challenging control of d j s legal guardians over him
in august the family contacted the police
stubblefield pleaded not guilty to the charges and said that fc revealed d j
was mentally capable while prosecutors said that fc was scientifically discredited and that d j
did not have the ability to consent to sexual relations
experts evaluating d j
testified he did not have the intellectual ability to consent to sexual activity
facilitated communication testimony from d j
was not allowed as the technique was ruled unreliable under new jersey law
after a three week trial the jury found stubblefield guilty of two counts of first degree aggravated sexual assault
after conviction the judge revoked bail saying that she was a flight risk and she was sentenced to years in prison
this included requiring her to register as a sex offender
in july an appeals court overturned her conviction and ordered a retrial and in she pleaded guilty to third degree aggravated criminal sexual contact and was sentenced to time served
in october the family was awarded million in a civil lawsuit against stubblefield
in martina susanne schweiger of queensland australia received an month suspended jail sentence for two counts of indecent dealing with a year old client with severe autism with whom she worked at a disability services home
the client required hour support and was not able to speak write or use manual sign language
schweiger believed the client expressed love for her through fc which she claimed to reciprocate
she also believed the client again through fc indicated a desire to have sex
on one occasion schweiger removed her clothes in front of her client
on another she play wrestled with him touching his penis with her hands and mouth
she confessed her actions to her employer
after hearing reports from alan hudson psychology professor at rmit university that fc did not work for the young man judge gary long of maroochydore district court found schweiger guilty of the charges indicating that fc was neither reliable nor accurate as a method of communication
