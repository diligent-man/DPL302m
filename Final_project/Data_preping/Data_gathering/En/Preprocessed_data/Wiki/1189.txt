indigenous law in canada refers to the legal traditions customs and practices of indigenous peoples and groups
canadian aboriginal law is different from indigenous law
canadian aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices
canada was founded on the original territories of over different indigenous groups each using different indigenous legal traditions
cree blackfoot mi kmaq and numerous other first nations inuit and m tis will apply their own legal traditions in daily life creating contracts working with governmental and corporate entities ecological management and criminal proceedings and family law
most maintain their laws through traditional governance alongside the elected officials and federal laws
the legal precedents set millennia ago are known through stories and derived from the actions and past responses as well as through continuous interpretation by elders and law keepers the same process by which nearly all legal traditions from common laws and civil codes are formed
while the many legal traditions appear similar in that none were codified each has quite different sets of laws
many laws stem from stories which in turn may stem from writings or markings such as geographic features petroglyphs pictographs wiigwaasabakoon and more
inuit nunangat s governance differs quite markedly from its many nationed neighbour denendeh as denendeh s diverse dene laws differ quite markedly from laws governing ling t aan gitx san lax yip or wet suwet en yin tah and as those differ from haudenosaunee s eeyou istchee s or mi kma ki s
one thing most indigenous legal and governance traditions have in common is their use of clans such as anishinaabek s doodeman though most are matrilineal like gitx san s wilps
indigenous law refers to indigenous peoples own legal systems
this includes the laws and legal processes developed by indigenous groups to govern their relationships manage their natural resources and manage conflicts
indigenous law is developed from a variety of sources and institutions which differ across legal traditions
canadian aboriginal law is the area of law related to the canadian government s relationship with its indigenous peoples first nations m tis and inuit
section of the constitution act gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to aboriginals which includes groups governed by the indian act different numbered treaties and outside of those acts
aboriginal peoples as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in legal documents including the constitution act
anishinaabe laws stem from a large corpus of stories that create a narrative structure from which laws or ways of being as a community and as an individual were interpreted
these histories include tales of nanabozho and a wide spectrum of other beings and peoples and the moral implications and practical applications gleaned from them
anishinaabe law historically has interacted with the legal systems of other nations in examples like with the gdoo naaganinaa dish with one spoon treaty made with the haudenosaunee
arising from their homeland nitaskinan the atikamekw nation maintains a strong connection to their language and to their traditional legal system called either irakonikewin or orakonikewin
many differences arise between the english common law the french civil code and the atikamekw irakonikewin notably that of adoption or opikihawasowin
as of the governments of qu bec and the atikamekw nation are resolving differences in legal standings with regard to adoption procedures which exists as a part of a larger scale effort at harmonizing the laws of and reconciling the canadian state with indigenous nations
the blackfoot term akak stiman can be translated as law making
dene law describes the numerous legal traditions across the dene homelands collectively called denendeh whose territories include nations like the gwich in h n kaska tutchone sahtu dane zaa dene th t ch and d n s n amongst others
across dene nations it is understood that dene laws were enacted by the cultural hero or heroes yamoria and yamozha often called the great lawmaker s
dene legal principles generally rest on the three foundations of equality sharing and reciprocity as well as an interdependence on human and nonhuman life forces
legally and conceptually dene do not distinguish between human and nonhuman beings such as ravens caribous trees lakes and mountains
interpreted stories often see dene and nonhuman animals working together to find mutually beneficial solutions
indeed there exists an almost treaty like relationship between humans and many other beings creating obligations on nonhuman animals and other beings to share their gifts with humans as humans are obligated to show respect through conservation and gratitude
for example dene law stipulates that humans travelling across country must pay for their passage in the form of gifting things to waterways landforms and other beings such as ancestors
further conceptions of care differ between dene and english legal and social systems particularly with children maturing in different social and environmental situations such as through apprenticeships and dutiful listening to storytellers
the differences between english law and dene law have created significant friction between the dene nations and the canadian state
one example is the rupturing of intergenerational transmission of law due to residential schools separated children from their social and legal frameworks
another is the difference in conservation understandings under common law the northwest territories ministry of environment and natural resources sometimes promotes single sex hunting activities with posters detailing how to distinguish male from female caribou directing hunters to target the males
english law concerning the reproductive abilities of the herds considers sex selected hunting to be more sustainable whereas dene law sees the potential in a rupture of knowledge transferral similar to killing off all the elder men of a community
in contrast with the paternalistic english legal system wherein humans must oversee and conserve other species the dene worldview stresses the agency of nonhuman beings
this results in situations where beings hunted or fished which under english territorial law must be left alone or thrown back clashes with the dene legal institution of beings giving themselves to the hunters
as there exist many languages and cultures across denendeh so too are dene legal systems called differently from one territory to the next
for example t ch refer to dene law as d n owo de dena nezen refers to kaska law dene zhat law and stories is called mek dene ts el meg nd
the modern legal system of eeyou istchee has developed out of contact with the canadian state the province of qu bec and from the historical traditional eeyou or eenou eedouwin the eeyou eenou way of doing things
the legal system of the gitanyow is called gitanyow ayookxw
the gitx san set of laws is known as ayokim gitx san ayookim gitx san ayookw or ayook
forming the most fundamental core of gitx san society are the matrilineal houses or wilphl gitx san also called huwilp sing wilp which are each associated with one of the four p dee or clans lax gibuu wolf lax seel or lax ganeda raven frog giskaast fireweed and lax skiik eagle
gitx san authority and jurisdiction or dax gyat manifests through the wilphl gitx san and their relationships with the lax yip their territories
gix san lax yip or gitx san country maintains clear and distinct territorial jurisdictions associated with specific huwilp which are known and affirmed through what can be translated as treasures or inheritances the gwalax yee nst
the gwalax yee nst essentially define a wilp as these include not only the tangible like one s wilnaatahl or close relatives and lax yiphl wilp the lands and resources related to the wilp but also the intangible such as potlatch seat names and the adaawx oral histories including associated animal crests symbols limx oo y time immemorial songs limx sinaahl breath songs and limx nox nok spirit songs
the whole of gitx san society is woven together through the ayookim gitx san which dictate the conduct of the gitx san huwilp around inheritance marriage adoption access to property trespass injury redress of injury as well as citizenship use of resources conduct at potlatches etc
the backbone of the ayookw are the adaawx also spelled adaawk which sustain evidence for land ownership and social organization
and much like other coastal cascadian first nations the central core political institution is the potlatch or liligit
the wilp li iliget is the feast house and is seen as the gitx san parliament building and the li iliget take on different formats pending the type of gitx san business or obligation to be fulfilled
contemporarily the gitx san nation has dealt with a fracturing political structure where the indian act band councils with jurisdiction solely over the reserve lands exists in contention with traditional governance structures
as such and following the momentous delgamuukw gisday wa case the wilphl gitx san have coalesced into the gitx san huwilp government
although the adaawk were not accepted as testimonial evidence during the delgamuukw gisday wa case the precedence was set such that the admissibility of oral histories must be determined on a case by case basis rather than rendering inadmissible adaawx and other oral histories there are now more defined structures by which such lines of evidence are accepted in euro canadian courthouses
the current restructuring of the canadian legal environment is resulting in a relative re empowerment of gitx san ayookim and governance alongside other indigenous legal structures
haisla nuuyum or the haisla way of life laws denotes and dictates ways of interacting within haisla country and alongside neighbouring territories and settled nations
the nuyuum underpins historical and contemporary forms of leadership like the chief and council governing system and guides governing responsibilities across the nation
as the oldest continuously functioning representative democracy in the world the iroquoian six nations of the longhouse or the haudenosaunee confederated in an estimated c e
through the enacting of the great law of peace or kaianere k wa in kanien k ha
the uniting of the original five nations the on dow ga seneca the gayogo h n cayuga the onyota a ka oneida the on da gaga onondaga and the kanien keh ka mohawk and thus the core legal framework is recounted orally from the constitutional wampum and is symbolized by the tree of peace the eastern white pine
the laws are transmitted by means of symbolic wampum and are divided into articles in total
the transmission is done yearly by orally recounting the confederation narrative
this narrative conveys the travels and history of the great peacemaker jigonhsasee and hiawatha as they brought peace to haudenosaunee country
through them governmental structures and legal institutions were created to metaphorically socially economically and concretely unite families
as such nations are conceived as elder and younger brothers and when asked how this new structure would work the peacemaker replied it will take the form of the longhouse in which there are many hearths one for each family yet all live as one household under one chief mother
they shall have one mind and live under one law
thinking will replace killing and there shall be one commonwealth
traditional forms of inuit justice understand the interconnected nature of things
leaders and elders do not see themselves as agents of social control or law and order as each individual contributes to the functioning of the community
the word for inuit law in inuktitut is inuit qaujimajatuqangit from the root qaujima meaning to know and could be literally translated as that which has long been known by inuit it is also rendered as qauyimayatuqangit or qaujimanituqangit
the integration of inuit qaujimajatuqangit or iq and canadian law is an ongoing process
for example the nunavut court of justice is the only unified single level court in canada and the court travels to communities every six weeks to two years
there are also on the land and contemporary healing circle programs administered
the fundamental underlying concept of ktunaxa law or aknumu ti i is that the ktunaxa people arose from the land of their traditional country ktunaxa amak is where they remain keepers of the land obligated to care for and respect the land and all things on it living and nonliving
aknumu ti i as the law of the land thus dictates ktunaxa must protect and not overuse the land ultimately maintaining balance in the understanding that all things are connected as the land gives resources for survival
coming out of their traditional homeland kwakwa ka wakw a wi nagwis the kwakwa ka wakw legal system remains administered through the potlatch institution despite the potlatch ban which endured from to
like many other northern cascadia coastal nations the kwakwa ka wakw nation and its numerous community subdivisions such as the kwagu na mg is and dzawa da enux w amongst many others maintain a complex body of laws surrounding property rights of treasures namely songs dances coppers regalia names crests filled boxes stories and knowledge
in contradistinction with european legal systems kwakwa ka wakw law understands societal structures as well as individual rights and obligations differently
stories songs dances and knowledge are passed down and traded through specific potlatch rituals and dispute resolution occurs through ceremonies often done in big houses by specific knowledgeable community leaders or elders
as such intellectual and property law differs markedly from euro canadian legal systems and conflict is still being resolved from the near century long ban of a core institution
the canadian state is currently in the process of reconciling its laws and historical policies with the kwakwa ka wakw nation
la lway michif or m tis law is derived from a blending of legal traditions between the indigenous nations of the prairies the european canadians who settled in what would become the m tis homeland michif piyii and christianity
as m tis culture is an oral culture there remains a distinction between written and oral forms of m tis law as most protocols surrounding the family and community continue to be exclusively transmitted orally
the core foundation of m tis law rests upon inherited stories such as of ti jean wisahkecahk and nanbush and ultimately centres the family from which extend powers to the community regional and national levels where decisions are made by assembly
elders function as mediators and advisors within the m tis legal structure and ceremonies hold a core institutional rule
justice is underlined by individual and communal rights where judicial decisions are obligated to be made in the context of a relationship of respect and trust
dispute resolution hinges on being non adversarial decision making is by consensus with universal suffrage with the whole community deciding on rules and limits to authority
specific social structures also dictate certain functions such as the correction of misbehaviour falling to godparents and grandparents with male youth often being sent to live with uncles if problems persist and women in charge of welcoming and protecting newcomers with women s committees responsible for resolving cases of domestic violence
historically the m tis legal system included a general council in charge of supervising a policing organization called la garde
mi kma ki is home to netukulimk which is the use of the natural bounty provided by the creator for the self support and well being of the individual and the community
a foundation of netukulimk is achieving adequate standards of community nutrition and economic well being without jeopardizing the integrity diversity or productivity of our environment within the conceptual framework of netukulimk mi kmaw law functions as the foundation of sustaining mi kmaw families communities and society
this mindset understands the whole of life to be interconnected describing the rights and responsibilities of the mi kmaq with their families communities nation and eco system
