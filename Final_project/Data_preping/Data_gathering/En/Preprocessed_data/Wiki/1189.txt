Indigenous law in Canada refers to the legal traditions customs and practices of Indigenous peoples and groups Canadian aboriginal law is different from Indigenous Law Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices
Canada was founded on the original territories of over different Indigenous groups each using different Indigenous legal traditions Cree Blackfoot Mi'kmaq and numerous other First Nations Inuit and M tis will apply their own legal traditions in daily life creating contracts working with governmental and corporate entities ecological management and criminal proceedings and family law Most maintain their laws through traditional governance alongside the elected officials and federal laws The legal precedents set millennia ago are known through stories and derived from the actions and past responses as well as through continuous interpretation by elders and law keepers the same process by which nearly all legal traditions from common laws and civil codes are formed
While the many legal traditions appear similar in that none were codified each has quite different sets of laws Many laws stem from stories which in turn may stem from writings or markings such as geographic features petroglyphs pictographs wiigwaasabakoon and more Inuit Nunangat's governance differs quite markedly from its many nationed neighbour Denendeh as Denendeh's diverse Dene Laws differ quite markedly from laws governing Ling t Aan Gitx san Lax yip or Wet'suwet'en Yin'tah and as those differ from Haudenosaunee's Eeyou Istchee's or Mi'kma'ki's One thing most Indigenous legal and governance traditions have in common is their use of clans such as Anishinaabek's doodeman though most are matrilineal like Gitx san's Wilps
Indigenous law refers to Indigenous peoples own legal systems This includes the laws and legal processes developed by Indigenous groups to govern their relationships manage their natural resources and manage conflicts Indigenous law is developed from a variety of sources and institutions which differ across legal traditions Canadian aboriginal law is the area of law related to the Canadian Government's relationship with its Indigenous peoples First Nations M tis and Inuit Section of the Constitution Act gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to Aboriginals which includes groups governed by the Indian Act different Numbered Treaties and outside of those Acts Aboriginal peoples as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in legal documents including the Constitution Act
Anishinaabe laws stem from a large corpus of stories that create a narrative structure from which laws or ways of being as a community and as an individual were interpreted These histories include tales of Nanabozho and a wide spectrum of other beings and peoples and the moral implications and practical applications gleaned from them Anishinaabe Law historically has interacted with the legal systems of other nations in examples like with the Gdoo naaganinaa Dish With One Spoon Treaty made with the Haudenosaunee
Arising from their homeland Nitaskinan the Atikamekw Nation maintains a strong connection to their language and to their traditional legal system called either irakonikewin or orakonikewin Many differences arise between the English common law the French civil code and the Atikamekw irakonikewin notably that of adoption or opikihawasowin As of the governments of Qu bec and the Atikamekw Nation are resolving differences in legal standings with regard to adoption procedures which exists as a part of a larger scale effort at harmonizing the laws of and reconciling the Canadian State with Indigenous Nations

Dene law describes the numerous legal traditions across the Dene homelands collectively called Denendeh whose territories include nations like the Gwich'in H n Kaska Tutchone Sahtu Dane zaa Dene Th T ch and D n s n amongst others Across Dene nations it is understood that Dene laws were enacted by the cultural hero or heroes Yamoria and Yamozha often called the Great Lawmaker s
Dene legal principles generally rest on the three foundations of equality sharing and reciprocity as well as an interdependence on human and nonhuman life forces Legally and conceptually Dene do not distinguish between human and nonhuman beings such as ravens caribous trees lakes and mountains Interpreted stories often see Dene and nonhuman animals working together to find mutually beneficial solutions Indeed there exists an almost treaty like relationship between humans and many other beings creating obligations on nonhuman animals and other beings to share their gifts with humans as humans are obligated to show respect through conservation and gratitude For example Dene law stipulates that humans travelling across country must pay for their passage in the form of gifting things to waterways landforms and other beings such as ancestors Further conceptions of care differ between Dene and English legal and social systems particularly with children maturing in different social and environmental situations such as through apprenticeships and dutiful listening to storytellers
The differences between English law and Dene law have created significant friction between the Dene Nations and the Canadian State One example is the rupturing of intergenerational transmission of law due to residential schools separated children from their social and legal frameworks Another is the difference in conservation understandings Under common law the Northwest Territories Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources sometimes promotes single sex hunting activities with posters detailing how to distinguish male from female caribou directing hunters to target the males English law concerning the reproductive abilities of the herds considers sex selected hunting to be more sustainable whereas Dene law sees the potential in a rupture of knowledge transferral similar to killing off all the elder men of a community In contrast with the paternalistic English legal system wherein humans must oversee and conserve other species the Dene worldview stresses the agency of nonhuman beings This results in situations where beings hunted or fished which under English territorial law must be left alone or thrown back clashes with the Dene legal institution of beings giving themselves to the hunters
As there exist many languages and cultures across Denendeh so too are Dene legal systems called differently from one territory to the next For example T ch refer to Dene law as D N owo de Dena Nezen refers to Kaska law Dene Zhat law and stories is called Mek Dene Ts el Meg nd

Forming the most fundamental core of Gitx san society are the matrilineal Houses or wilphl Gitx san also called Huwilp sing Wilp which are each associated with one of the four P'dee or clans Lax gibuu Wolf Lax Seel or Lax Ganeda Raven Frog Giskaast Fireweed and Lax Skiik Eagle Gitx san authority and jurisdiction or Dax gyat manifests through the wilphl Gitx san and their relationships with the Lax yip their territories Gix san Lax yip or Gitx san Country maintains clear and distinct territorial jurisdictions associated with specific Huwilp which are known and affirmed through what can be translated as treasures or inheritances the gwalax yee nst The gwalax yee'nst essentially define a Wilp as these include not only the tangible like one's wilnaatahl or close relatives and lax yiphl wilp the lands and resources related to the Wilp but also the intangible such as potlatch seat names and the adaawx oral histories including associated animal crests symbols limx oo y time immemorial songs limx sinaahl breath songs and limx nox nok spirit songs
The whole of Gitx san society is woven together through the Ayookim Gitx san which dictate the conduct of the Gitx san Huwilp around inheritance marriage adoption access to property trespass injury redress of injury as well as citizenship use of resources conduct at potlatches etc The backbone of the Ayookw are the adaawx also spelled adaawk which sustain evidence for land ownership and social organization And much like other coastal Cascadian First Nations the central core political institution is the potlatch or liligit The Wilp Li iliget is the Feast House and is seen as the Gitx san Parliament Building and the li iliget take on different formats pending the type of Gitx san business or obligation to be fulfilled
Contemporarily the Gitx san Nation has dealt with a fracturing political structure where the Indian Act band councils with jurisdiction solely over the reserve lands exists in contention with traditional governance structures As such and following the momentous Delgamuukw Gisday wa case the wilphl Gitx san have coalesced into the Gitx san Huwilp Government Although the adaawk were not accepted as testimonial evidence during the Delgamuukw Gisday'wa case the precedence was set such that the admissibility of oral histories must be determined on a case by case basis Rather than rendering inadmissible adaawx and other oral histories there are now more defined structures by which such lines of evidence are accepted in Euro Canadian courthouses The current restructuring of the Canadian legal environment is resulting in a relative re empowerment of Gitx san Ayookim and governance alongside other Indigenous legal structures

The laws are transmitted by means of symbolic wampum and are divided into articles in total The transmission is done yearly by orally recounting the confederation narrative This narrative conveys the travels and history of the Great Peacemaker Jigonhsasee and Hiawatha as they brought peace to Haudenosaunee Country Through them governmental structures and legal institutions were created to metaphorically socially economically and concretely unite families As such nations are conceived as elder and younger brothers and when asked how this new structure would work the Peacemaker replied It will take the form of the longhouse in which there are many hearths one for each family yet all live as one household under one chief mother They shall have one mind and live under one law Thinking will replace killing and there shall be one commonwealth
Traditional forms of Inuit justice understand the interconnected nature of things Leaders and Elders do not see themselves as agents of social control or law and order as each individual contributes to the functioning of the community The word for Inuit Law in Inuktitut is Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit from the root qaujima meaning to know and could be literally translated as that which has long been known by Inuit It is also rendered as Qauyimayatuqangit or Qaujimanituqangit
The integration of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit or IQ and Canadian Law is an ongoing process For example the Nunavut Court of Justice is the only unified single level court in Canada and the court travels to communities every six weeks to two years
