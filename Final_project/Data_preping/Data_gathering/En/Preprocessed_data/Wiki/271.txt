the omphalos hypothesis is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the earth is billions of years old with a literal interpretation of the genesis creation narrative which implies that the earth is only a few thousand years old
it is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being within the past six to ten thousand years in keeping with flood geology and that the presence of objective verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is due to the creator introducing false evidence that makes the universe appear significantly older
the idea was named after the title of an book omphalos by philip henry gosse in which gosse argued that in order for the world to be functional god must have created the earth with mountains and canyons trees with growth rings adam and eve with fully grown hair fingernails and navels omphalos is greek for navel and all living creatures with fully formed evolutionary features etc and that therefore no empirical evidence about the age of the earth or universe can be taken as reliable
various supporters of young earth creationism have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe s age including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence
the idea was widely rejected in the th century when gosse published his aforementioned book
it saw some revival in the th century by some young earth creationists who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate from far off stars and galaxies addressing the starlight problem
stories of the beginning of human life based on the creation story in genesis have been published for centuries
the th century theologian ephrem the syrian described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms
by the th century scientific evidence of the earth s age had been collected and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts
this evidence was rejected by some writers at the time such as fran ois ren de chateaubriand
chateaubriand wrote in his book g nie du christianisme part i book iv chapter v that god might have created and doubtless did create the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits in modern times rabbi dovid gottlieb supported a similar position saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong but wrong and that the traditional jewish calendar is correct
in the middle of the th century the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the earth and the western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals
gosse published omphalos in to explain his answer to this question
he concluded that the religious tradition was correct
gosse began with the earlier idea that the earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created and that these organisms had false signs of their development such as hair on mammals which grows over time
he extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems and concluded that fossils were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work
therefore he reasoned fossils and other signs of the earth s age could not be used to prove the age his book sold poorly
other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in genesis with the scientific evidence included the interval theory or gap theory of creation in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the six days of creation
this idea was put forward by archbishop john bird sumner of canterbury in treatise on the records of creation
another popular idea promoted by the english theologian john pye smith was that the garden of eden described the events of only one small location
a third proposal by french naturalist georges louis leclerc comte de buffon held that the six days of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages rather than hour periods
theologians rejected gosse s proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies either lying in the scriptures or lying in nature
scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with uniformitarianism an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea
some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way
for instance john d
morris president of the institute for creation research wrote in about the appearance of age saying that what god created was functionally complete right from the start able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created
he does not extend this idea to the geological record preferring to believe that it was all created in the flood but others such as gerald e
aardsma go further with his idea of virtual history
this appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the virtual history we now see including the fossils
although gosse s original omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago including memories of times before this created in situ
this idea is sometimes called last thursdayism by its opponents as in the world might as well have been created last thursday
scientifically the concept is both unverifiable and unfalsifiable through any conceivable scientific study in other words it is impossible to conclude the truth of the hypothesis since it requires the empirical data itself to have been arbitrarily created to look the way it does at every observable level of detail
from a religious viewpoint it can be interpreted as god having created a fake universe such as illusions of light emitted from supernovae that never really happened or volcanic mountains that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion
in a rebuttal of the claim that god might have implanted a false history of the age of the universe in order to test our faith in the truth of the torah rabbi natan slifkin an author whose works have been banned by several haredi rabbis for going against the tenets of the talmud writes
redshift in light refers to a larger wavelength as measured by a receiver compared to the wavelength of the same light as measured by the emitter
scientists interpret the redshift in light received from other galaxies as evidence that the space between us and the galaxies is expanding that some galaxies are billions of light years distant from the milky way and that therefore the light has been traveling for billions of years requiring a universe billions of years in age
according to the omphalos hypothesis god created the redshift in light received from other galaxies in order to fool humans beginning in the th century but not before that time into thinking that the universe is billions of years old
among the many problems with this hypothesis including lack of any evidence and lack of reference to the phenomenon in the bible is that it would require that god adjusted the shift in exquisitely precise ways for each of the billions of individual galaxies and did so to deceive humans about the age of the universe in a way that was not detectable by humans until the th century
the five minute hypothesis is a skeptical hypothesis put forth by the philosopher bertrand russell that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing with human memory and all other signs of history included
it is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme philosophical skepticism with regard to memory and trust in evidentially derived historical chronology
jorge luis borges in his work tl n uqbar orbis tertius describes a fictional world in which some essentially follow as a religious belief a philosophy much like russell s discussion on the logical extreme of gosse s theory
borges had earlier written a short essay the creation and p
gosse that explored the rejection of gosse s omphalos
borges argued that its unpopularity stemmed from gosse s explicit if inadvertent outlining of what borges characterized as absurdities in the genesis story
