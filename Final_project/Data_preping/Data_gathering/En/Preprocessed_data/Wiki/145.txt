xinjiang uk nd i us n d j officially the xinjiang uygur autonomous region xuar is a landlocked autonomous region of the people s republic of china prc located in the northwest of the country at the crossroads of central asia and east asia
being the largest province level division of china by area and the th largest country subdivision in the world xinjiang spans over million square kilometres sq mi and has about million inhabitants
xinjiang borders the countries of mongolia russia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan afghanistan pakistan and india
the rugged karakoram kunlun and tian shan mountain ranges occupy much of xinjiang s borders as well as its western and southern regions
the aksai chin and trans karakoram tract regions both administered by china are claimed by india
xinjiang also borders the tibet autonomous region and the provinces of gansu and qinghai
the most well known route of the historic silk road ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border
it is home to a number of ethnic groups including the turkic uyghur kazakhs and kyrgyz the han tibetans hui chinese tajiks pamiris mongols russians and sibe
there are more than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities in xinjiang
older english language reference works often refer to the area as chinese turkestan east turkestan and east turkistan
xinjiang is divided into the dzungarian basin in the north and the tarim basin in the south by a mountain range and only about of xinjiang s land area is fit for human habitation
with a documented history of at least years a succession of people and empires have vied for control over all or parts of this territory
the territory came under the rule of the qing dynasty in the th century later replaced by the republic of china government
since and the chinese civil war it has been part of the people s republic of china
in xinjiang production and construction corps xpcc was established to strengthen border defense against the soviet union and promote the local economy by settling soldiers into the region
in xinjiang was administratively changed from a province into an autonomous region
in recent decades abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in xinjiang and it is currently china s largest natural gas producing region
from the s to the s the east turkestan independence movement separatist conflict and the influence of radical islam have resulted in unrest in the region with occasional terrorist attacks and clashes between separatist and government forces
these conflicts prompted the chinese government to commit a series of ongoing human rights abuses against uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in the province that is often characterized as genocide
the general region of xinjiang has been known by many different names in earlier times in indigenous languages as well as other languages
these names include altishahr the historical uyghur name for the southern half of the region referring to the six cities of the tarim basin as well as khotan khotay chinese tartary high tartary east chagatay it was the eastern part of the chagatai khanate moghulistan land of the mongols kashgaria little bokhara serindia due to indian cultural influence and in chinese western regions
in chinese under the han dynasty xinjiang was known as xiyu meaning western regions
between the nd century bce and nd century ce the han empire established the protectorate of the western regions or xiyu protectorate in an effort to secure the profitable routes of the silk road
the western regions during the tang era were known as qixi
qi refers to the gobi desert while xi refers to the west
the tang empire had established the protectorate general to pacify the west or anxi protectorate in to control the region
during the qing dynasty the northern part of xinjiang dzungaria was known as zhunbu dzungar region and the southern tarim basin was known as huijiang muslim frontier
both regions merged after qing dynasty suppressed the revolt of the altishahr khojas in and became the region of xiyu xinjiang chinese lit
western regions new frontier later simplified as xinjiang sinkiang chinese manchu
romanization ice jecen
the official name was given during the reign of the guangxu emperor in
according to chinese statesman zuo zongtang s report to the guangxu emperor xinjiang means an old land newly returned or the new old land
it can also be translated as new frontier or new territory in fact the term xinjiang was used in many other places conquered but never were ruled by chinese empires directly until the gradual gaitu guiliu administrative reform including regions in southern china
for instance present day jinchuan county in sichuan was then known as jinchuan xinjiang zhaotong in yunnan was named directly as xinjiang qiandongnan region anshun and zhenning were named as liangyou xinjiang etc
in xinjiang province was renamed xinjiang uygur autonomous region
the name that was originally proposed was simply xinjiang autonomous region because that was the name for the imperial territory
this proposal was not well received by uyghurs in the communist party who found the name colonialist in nature since it meant new territory saifuddin azizi the first chairman of xinjiang registered his strong objections to the proposed name with mao zedong arguing that autonomy is not given to mountains and rivers
it is given to particular nationalities some uyghur communists proposed the name tian shan uyghur autonomous region instead
the han communists in the central government denied the name xinjiang was colonialist and that the central government could be colonialists both because they were communists and because china was a victim of colonialism
but due to the uyghur complaints the administrative region would be named xinjiang uygur autonomous region
uyghur nationalists refer to xinjiang as uyghurstan
xinjiang consists of two main geographically historically and ethnically distinct regions with different historical names dzungaria north of the tianshan mountains and the tarim basin south of the tianshan mountains before qing china unified them into one political entity called xinjiang province in
at the time of the qing conquest in dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling nomadic tibetan buddhist dzungar people while the tarim basin was inhabited by sedentary oasis dwelling turkic speaking muslim farmers now known as the uyghur people
they were governed separately until
the native uyghur name for the tarim basin is altishahr
the qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former buddhist mongol area to the north of the tian shan and the turkic muslim area south of the tian shan and ruled them in separate administrative units at first
however qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called xinjiang
the very concept of xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the qing
it was originally not the native inhabitants who viewed it that way but rather the chinese who held that point of view
during the qing rule no sense of regional identity was held by ordinary xinjiang people rather xinjiang s distinct identity was given to the region by the qing since it had distinct geography history and culture while at the same time it was created by the chinese multicultural settled by han and hui and separated from central asia for over a century and a half
in the late th century it was still being proposed by some people that two separate regions be created out of xinjiang the area north of the tianshan and the area south of the tianshan while it was being argued over whether to turn xinjiang into a province
xinjiang is a large sparsely populated area spanning over million km comparable in size to iran which takes up about one sixth of the country s territory
xinjiang borders the tibet autonomous region and india s leh district in ladakh to the south qinghai and gansu provinces to the east mongolia bayan lgii govi altai and khovd provinces to the east russia s altai republic to the north and kazakhstan almaty and east kazakhstan regions kyrgyzstan issyk kul naryn and osh regions tajikistan s gorno badakhshan autonomous region afghanistan s badakhshan province and pakistan s gilgit baltistan to the west
the east west chain of the tian shan separate dzungaria in the north from the tarim basin in the south
dzungaria is a dry steppe and the tarim basin contains the massive taklamakan desert surrounded by oases
in the east is the turpan depression
in the west the tian shan split forming the ili river valley
the earliest inhabitants of the region encompassing modern day xinjiang were genetically of northeast asian and paleo siberian origin with later geneflow during the bronze age linked to the expansion of early indo europeans
these population dynamics gave rise to a heterogeneous demographic makeup
ancient samples from xinjiang during the bronze age showed higher affinity with paleo siberians than europeans suggesting that the spread of indo european tocharian languages was more linguistically than ethnically
linguistic evidence revealed that indo european languages spoken in the region specifically tocharian showed high amounts of influence from paleosiberian languages such as uralic and yeniseian languages
iron age samples from xinjiang while being of mixed ancestry were generally closer to northeast asians
in the late iron age geneflow from yellow river farmers increased throughout xinjiang associated with han chinese
between and the remains of individuals in the xiaohe cemetery were analyzed for y chromosome and mitochondrial dna markers
genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the paternal lineages of the xiaohe people were of west eurasian origin while the maternal lineages of the early population were diverse featuring both east eurasian and west eurasian lineages
over time the west eurasian maternal lineages were gradually replaced by east eurasian maternal lineages
this implies a pattern of outmarriage to women from siberian communities which over many hundreds of years led to the loss of the original diversity of mtdna lineages observed in the earlier xiaohe population
the tarim population was therefore always notably diverse reflecting a complex history of admixture between people of ancient north eurasian south asian and northeast asian descent
the tarim mummies have been found in various locations in the western tarim basin such as loulan the xiaohe tomb complex and q wrighul
these mummies have been previously suggested to have been tocharian or indo european speakers but recent evidence suggest that the mummies belonged to a distinct population unrelated to indo european pastoralists such as afanasievo and spoke a unknown language probably a language isolate
nomadic tribes such as the yuezhi saka and wusun were probably part of the migration of indo european speakers who had settled in western central asia long before the xiongnu and han chinese
by the time the han dynasty under emperor wu r
bc wrested the western tarim basin away from its previous overlords the xiongnu it was inhabited by various peoples who included the indo european speaking tocharians in turfan and kucha the saka peoples centered in the shule kingdom and the kingdom of khotan the various tibeto burmese groups especially people related to the qiang as well as the han chinese people
yuezhi culture is documented in the region
the first known reference to the yuezhi was in bc by the chinese chancellor guan zhong in his work guanzi guanzi essays
he described the y sh or ni sh as a people from the north west who supplied jade to the chinese from the nearby mountains also known as yushi in gansu
the longtime jade supply from the tarim basin is well documented archaeologically it is well known that ancient chinese rulers had a strong attachment to jade
all of the jade items excavated from the tomb of fuhao of the shang dynasty more than pieces were from khotan in modern xinjiang
as early as the mid first millennium bc the yuezhi engaged in the jade trade of which the major consumers were the rulers of agricultural china
crossed by the northern silk road the tarim and dzungaria regions were known as the western regions
at the beginning of the han dynasty bc ad the region was ruled by the xiongnu a powerful nomadic people based in present day mongolia
during the nd century bc the han dynasty prepared for war against xiongnu when emperor wu of han dispatched zhang qian to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and form an alliance with the yuezhi against the xiongnu
as a result of the war the chinese controlled the strategic region from the ordos and gansu corridor to lop nor
they separated the xiongnu from the qiang people on the south and gained direct access to the western regions
han china sent zhang qian as an envoy to the states of the region beginning several decades of struggle between the xiongnu and han china in which china eventually prevailed
in bc han china established the protectorate of the western regions at wulei near modern luntai to oversee the region as far west as the pamir mountains
the protectorate was seized during the civil war against wang mang r
ad returning to han control in due to the efforts of general ban chao
the western jin dynasty succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the th century
the short lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern china one after the other including former liang former qin later liang and western li ng all attempted to maintain the protectorate with varying degrees of success
after the final reunification of northern china under the northern wei empire its protectorate controlled what is now the southeastern region of xinjiang
local states such as shule yutian guizi and qiemo controlled the western region while the central region around turpan was controlled by gaochang remnants of a state northern liang that once ruled part of what is now gansu province in northwestern china
during the tang dynasty a series of expeditions were conducted against the western turkic khaganate and their vassals the oasis states of southern xinjiang
campaigns against the oasis states began under emperor taizong with the annexation of gaochang in
the nearby kingdom of karasahr was captured by the tang in and the kingdom of kucha was conquered in
the tang dynasty then established the protectorate general to pacify the west or anxi protectorate in to control the region
during the anshi rebellion which nearly destroyed the tang dynasty tibet invaded the tang on a broad front from xinjiang to yunnan
it occupied the tang capital of chang an in for days and controlled southern xinjiang by the end of the century
the uyghur khaganate took control of northern xinjiang much of central asia and mongolia at the same time
as tibet and the uyghur khaganate declined in the mid th century the kara khanid khanate a confederation of turkic tribes including the karluks chigils and yaghmas controlled western xinjiang during the th and th centuries
after the uyghur khaganate in mongolia was destroyed by the kirghiz in branches of the uyghurs established themselves in qocha karakhoja and beshbalik near present day turfan and r mqi
the uyghur state remained in eastern xinjiang until the th century although it was ruled by foreign overlords
the kara khanids converted to islam
the uyghur state in eastern xinjiang initially manichean later converted to buddhism
remnants of the liao dynasty from manchuria entered xinjiang in fleeing rebellion by the neighboring jurchens
they established a new empire the qara khitai which ruled the kara khanid and uyghur held parts of the tarim basin for the next century
although khitan and chinese were the primary administrative languages persian and uyghur were also used
present day xinjiang consisted of the tarim basin and dzungaria and was originally inhabited by indo european tocharians and iranian sakas who practiced buddhism and zoroastrianism
the turfan and tarim basins were inhabited by speakers of tocharian languages with caucasian mummies found in the region
the area became islamified during the th century with the conversion of the kara khanid khanate who occupied kashgar
during the mid th century the saka buddhist kingdom of khotan was attacked by the turkic muslim karakhanid ruler musa the karakhanid leader yusuf qadir khan conquered khotan around
after genghis khan unified mongolia and began his advance west the uyghur state in the turpan urumchi region offered its allegiance to the mongols in contributing taxes and troops to the mongol imperial effort
in return the uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom genghis khan s mongol empire conquered the qara khitai in
xinjiang was a stronghold of gedei khan and later came under the control of his descendant kaidu
this branch of the mongol family kept the yuan dynasty at bay until their rule ended
during the mongol empire era the yuan dynasty vied with the chagatai khanate for rule of the region and the latter controlled most of it
after the chagatai khanate divided into smaller khanates during the mid th century the politically fractured region was ruled by a number of persianized mongol khans including those from moghulistan with the assistance of local dughlat emirs uigurstan later turpan and kashgaria
these leaders warred with each other and the timurids of transoxiana to the west and the oirats to the east the successor chagatai regime based in mongolia and china
during the th century the dzungars established an empire over much of the region
the mongolian dzungars were the collective identity of several oirat tribes which formed and maintained one of the last nomadic empires
the dzungar khanate covered dzungaria extending from the western great wall of china to present day eastern kazakhstan and from present day northern kyrgyzstan to southern siberia
most of the region was renamed xinjiang by the chinese after the fall of the dzungar empire which existed from the early th to the mid th century
the sedentary turkic muslims of the tarim basin were originally ruled by the chagatai khanate and the nomadic buddhist oirat mongols in dzungaria ruled the dzungar khanate
the naqshbandi sufi khojas descendants of muhammad had replaced the chagatayid khans as rulers of the tarim basin during the early th century
there was a struggle between two khoja factions the afaqi white mountain and the ishaqi black mountain
the ishaqi defeated the afaqi and the afaq khoja invited the th dalai lama the leader of the tibetans to intervene on his behalf in
the dalai lama then called on his dzungar buddhist followers in the dzungar khanate to act on the invitation
the dzungar khanate conquered the tarim basin in setting up the afaqi khoja as their puppet ruler
after converting to islam the descendants of the previously buddhist uyghurs in turfan believed that the infidel kalmuks dzungars built buddhist monuments in their region
the turkic muslims of the turfan and kumul oases then submitted to the qing dynasty and asked china to free them from the dzungars the qing accepted their rulers as vassals
they warred against the dzungars for decades before defeating them qing manchu bannermen then conducted the dzungar genocide nearly eradicating them and depopulating dzungaria
the qing freed the afaqi khoja leader burhan ud din and his brother khoja jihan from dzungar imprisonment and appointed them to rule the tarim basin as qing vassals
the khoja brothers reneged on the agreement declaring themselves independent leaders of the tarim basin
the qing and the turfan leader emin khoja crushed their revolt and by china controlled dzungaria and the tarim basin
the manchu qing dynasty gained control of eastern xinjiang as a result of a long struggle with the dzungars which began during the th century
in with the help of the oirat noble amursana the qing attacked ghulja and captured the dzungar khan
after amursana s request to be declared dzungar khan went unanswered he led a revolt against the qing
qing armies destroyed the remnants of the dzungar khanate over the next two years and many han chinese and hui moved into the pacified areas
the native dzungar oirat mongols suffered greatly from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous smallpox epidemic
writer wei yuan described the resulting desolation in present day northern xinjiang as an empty plain for several thousand li with no oirat yurt except those surrendered it has been estimated that percent of the or more dzungars died from a combination of disease and warfare and recovery took generations
han and hui merchants were initially only allowed to trade in the tarim basin their settlement in the tarim basin was banned until the muhammad yusuf khoja invasion when the qing rewarded merchants for fighting off khoja by allowing them to settle in the basin
the uyghur muslim sayyid and naqshbandi sufi rebel of the afaqi suborder jahangir khoja was sliced to death lingchi in by the manchus for leading a rebellion against the qing
according to robert montgomery martin many chinese with a variety of occupations were settled in dzungaria in in turkestan the tarim basin however only a few chinese merchants and garrison soldiers were interspersed with the muslim population
the ush rebellion by the uyghurs against the manchu began after uyghur women were raped by the servants and son of manchu official su cheng
it was said that ush muslims had long wanted to sleep on sucheng and son s hides and eat their flesh because of the months long abuse
the manchu emperor ordered the massacre of the uyghur rebel town qing forces enslaved the uyghur children and women and killed the uyghur men
sexual abuse of uyghur women by manchu soldiers and officials triggered deep uyghur hostility against manchu rule
by the s xinjiang had been under qing rule for a century
the region was captured in from the dzungar khanate whose population the oirats became the targets of genocide
xinjiang was primarily semi arid or desert and unattractive to non trading han settlers and others including the uyghurs settled there
the dungan revolt by the muslim hui and other muslim ethnic groups was fought in china s shaanxi ningxia and gansu provinces and in xinjiang from to
the conflict led to a reported million deaths due to migration and war with many refugees dying of starvation
thousands of muslim refugees from shaanxi fled to gansu some formed battalions in eastern gansu intending to reconquer their lands in shaanxi
while the hui rebels were preparing to attack gansu and shaanxi yaqub beg an uzbek or tajik commander of the kokand khanate fled from the khanate in after losing tashkent to the russians
beg settled in kashgar and soon controlled xinjiang
although he encouraged trade built caravansareis canals and other irrigation systems his regime was considered harsh
the chinese took decisive action against yettishar an army under general zuo zongtang rapidly approached kashgaria reconquering it on may
after reconquering xinjiang in the late s from yaqub beg the qing dynasty established xinjiang new frontier as a province in making it part of china and dropping the old names of zhunbu dzungar region and huijiang muslimland
after xinjiang became a chinese province the qing government encouraged the uyghurs to migrate from southern xinjiang to other areas of the province such as the region between qitai and the capital largely inhabited by han chinese and r mqi tacheng tabarghatai yili jinghe kur kara usu ruoqiang lop nor and the lower tarim river
in the qing dynasty was replaced by the republic of china
yuan dahua the last qing governor of xinjiang fled
one of his subordinates yang zengxin took control of the province and acceded in name to the republic of china in march of that year
balancing mixed ethnic constituencies yang controlled xinjiang until his assassination after the northern expedition of the kuomintang
the kumul rebellion and others broke out throughout xinjiang during the early s against jin shuren yang s successor involving uyghurs other turkic groups and hui muslim chinese
jin enlisted white russians to crush the revolts
in the kashgar region on november the short lived first east turkestan republic was self proclaimed after debate about whether it should be called east turkestan or uyghuristan
the region claimed by the etr encompassed the kashgar khotan and aksu prefectures in southwestern xinjiang
the chinese muslim kuomintang th division national revolutionary army defeated the army of the first east turkestan republic in the battle of kashgar ending the republic after chinese muslims executed its two emirs abdullah bughra and nur ahmad jan bughra
the soviet union invaded the province it was brought under the control of northeast han warlord sheng shicai after the xinjiang war
sheng ruled xinjiang for the next decade with support from the soviet union many of whose ethnic and security policies he instituted
the soviet union maintained a military base in the province and deployed several military and economic advisors
sheng invited a group of chinese communists to xinjiang including mao zedong s brother mao zemin but executed them all in in fear of a conspiracy
in president and premier of china chiang kai shek informed by the soviet union of shicai s intention to join it transferred him to chongqing as the minister of agriculture and forestry the following year
during the ili rebellion the soviet union backed uyghur separatists to form the second east turkestan republic nd etr in the ili region while most of xinjiang remained under kuomintang control
the people s liberation army entered xinjiang in when kuomintang commander tao zhiyue and government chairman burhan shahidi surrendered the province to them
five etr leaders who were to negotiate with the chinese about etr sovereignty died in an air crash that year in the kazakh soviet socialist republic
the prc autonomous region was established on october replacing the province that year the first modern census in china was taken in uyghurs were percent of xinjiang s total population of million
although xinjiang was designated a uygur autonomous region since more than percent of its area is designated autonomous areas for native non uyghur groups
modern uyghurs developed ethnogenesis in when the prc recognized formerly separately self identified oasis peoples
in the s general wang zhen coerced thousands of hunanese women into sexual servitude at pla units in xinjiang
southern xinjiang is home to most of the uyghur population about nine million people out of a total population of twenty million fifty five percent of the han population mainly urban live in northern xinjiang
this created an economic imbalance since the northern junghar basin dzungaria is more developed than the south
since chinese economic reform since the late s has exacerbated uneven regional development more uyghurs have migrated to xinjiang s cities and some han have migrated to xinjiang for economic advancement
deng xiaoping made a nine day visit to xinjiang in and described the region as unsteady
increased ethnic contact and labor competition coincided with uyghur terrorism since the s such as the r mqi bus bombings
in uyghurs were percent of xinjiang s population and percent of r mqi s population
with nine percent of xinjiang s population r mqi accounts for percent of the region s gdp many rural uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light heavy and petrochemical industries
han in xinjiang are older better educated and work in higher paying professions than their uyghur counterparts
han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to r mqi while some uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city
han and uyghurs are equally represented in r mqi s floating population which works primarily in commerce
auto segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration employment relationships and endogamy
in uyghurs were a majority in the tarim basin and a plurality in xinjiang as a whole
xinjiang has public libraries and museums compared to none in
it has newspapers in languages compared with four in
according to official statistics the ratio of doctors medical workers clinics and hospital beds to the general population surpasses the national average the immunization rate has reached percent
the ongoing xinjiang conflict includes the xinjiang raid a thwarted suicide bombing attempt on a china southern airlines flight the kashgar attack which killed police officers four days before the beijing olympics the august syringe attacks the hotan attack the kunming attack the april r mqi attack and the may r mqi attack
several of the attacks were orchestrated by the turkistan islamic party formerly the east turkestan islamic movement identified as a terrorist group by several entities including russia turkey the united kingdom the united states until october and the united nations
in chinese communist party ccp leadership in xinjiang commenced a people s war against the three evil forces of separatism terrorism and extremism
they deployed two hundred thousand party cadres to xinjiang and the launched the civil servant family pair up program
xi was dissatisfied with the initial results of the people s war and replaced zhang chunxian with chen quanguo in
following his appointment chen oversaw the recruitment of tens of thousands of additional police officers and the division of society into three categories trusted average untrustworthy
he instructed his subordinated to take this crackdown as the top project and to pre mpt the enemy to strike at the outset following a meeting with xi in beijing chen quanguo held a rally in r mqi with ten thousand troops helicopters and armored vehicles
as they paraded he announced a smashing obliterating offensive and declared that they would bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the people s war
chinese authorities have operated internment camps to indoctrinate uyghurs and other muslims as part of the people s war since at least
the camps have been criticized by a number of countries and human rights organizations for abuse and mistreatment with some alleging uyghur genocide
in ccp general secretary xi jinping said practice has proven that the party s strategy for governing xinjiang in the new era is completely correct
in the standard uyghur language textbooks used in xinjiang since the early s were outlawed and their authors and editors sentenced to death or life imprisonment
the textbooks had been created and approved by relevant government officials however according to the ap in the chinese government said that the and editions of the textbooks contained passages preaching ethnic separatism violence terrorism and religious extremism and that several people were inspired by the books to participate in a bloody anti government riot in the regional capital urumqi in shirzat bawudun the former head of the xinjiang department of justice and sattar sawut the former head of the xinjiang education department were sentenced to death on terrorism and extremism charges
three other educators and two textbook editors were given lesser sentences
chen was replaced as community party secretary for xinjiang by ma xingrui in december
xinjiang is divided into thirteen prefecture level divisions four prefecture level cities six prefectures and five autonomous prefectures including the sub provincial autonomous prefecture of ili which in turn has two of the seven prefectures within its jurisdiction for mongol kazakh kyrgyz and hui minorities
at the end of the year the total population of xinjiang was million
these are then divided into districts county level cities counties and autonomous counties
ten of the county level cities do not belong to any prefecture and are de facto administered by the xinjiang production and construction corps
sub level divisions of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region is shown in the adjacent picture and described in the table below
xinjiang is the largest political subdivision of china accounting for more than one sixth of china s total territory and a quarter of its boundary length
xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands with dotted oases conducive to habitation accounting for of xinjiang s total area by at the foot of tian shan kunlun mountains and altai mountains respectively
xinjiang is split by the tian shan mountain range tengri tagh which divides it into two large basins the dzungarian basin in the north and the tarim basin in the south
a small v shaped wedge between these two major basins limited by the tian shan s main range in the south and the borohoro mountains in the north is the basin of the ili river which flows into kazakhstan s lake balkhash an even smaller wedge farther north is the emin valley
other major mountain ranges of xinjiang include the pamir mountains and karakoram in the southwest the kunlun mountains in the south along the border with tibet and the altai mountains in the northeast shared with mongolia
the region s highest point is the mountain k an eight thousander located meters ft above sea level in the karakoram mountains on the border with pakistan
much of the tarim basin is dominated by the taklamakan desert
north of it is the turpan depression which contains the lowest point in xinjiang and in the entire prc at meters ft below sea level
the dzungarian basin is slightly cooler and receives somewhat more precipitation than the tarim basin
nonetheless it too has a large gurbant ngg t desert also known as dzoosotoyn elisen in its center
the tian shan mountain range marks the xinjiang kyrgyzstan border at the torugart pass m
the karakorum highway kkh links islamabad pakistan with kashgar over the khunjerab pass
from south to north the mountain passes bordering xinjiang are
xinjiang is geologically young
collision of the indian and the eurasian plates formed the tian shan kunlun shan and pamir mountain ranges said tectonics render it a very active earthquake zone
older geological formations are located in the far north where the junggar block is geologically part of kazakhstan and in the east where is part of the north china craton
xinjiang has within its borders in the dzoosotoyn elisen desert the location in eurasia that is furthest from the sea in any direction a continental pole of inaccessibility n e n e eurasian pole of inaccessibility
it is at least km mi straight line distance from any coastline
in local geographers determined another point within xinjiang n e n e in the southwestern suburbs of r mqi r mqi county to be the center point of asia
a monument to this effect was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction
having hot summer and low precipitation most of xinjiang is endorheic
its rivers either disappear in the desert or terminate in salt lakes within xinjiang itself or in neighboring kazakhstan instead of running towards an ocean
the northernmost part of the region with the irtysh river rising in the altai mountains that flows via kazakhstan and russia toward the arctic ocean is the only exception
but even so a significant part of the irtysh s waters were artificially diverted via the irtysh karamay r mqi canal to the drier regions of southern dzungarian basin
elsewhere most of xinjiang s rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the tian shan
once they enter the populated areas in the mountains foothills their waters are extensively used for irrigation so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs
this is the case even with the main river of the tarim basin the tarim which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the lop lake
in the dzungarian basin a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into lake manas
some of the salt lakes having lost much of their fresh water inflow are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts used e g in the manufacturing of potassium fertilizers this includes the lop lake and the manas lake
xinjiang is in the same time zone as the rest of china beijing time utc
but while xinjiang being about two time zones west of beijing some residents local organizations and governments watch another time standard known as xinjiang time utc
han people tend to use beijing time while uyghurs tend to use xinjiang time as a form of resistance to beijing
but regardless of the time standard preferences most businesses schools open and close two hours later than in the other regions of china
deserts include
gurbant ngg t desert also known as dzoosotoyn elisen
taklamakan desert
kumtag desert east of taklamakandue to water scarcity most of xinjiang s population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region s mountain ranges in areas conducive to irrigated agriculture
it is in these belts where most of the region s cities are found
