whereas logic study logical system used construct valid sound argument metalogic study property logical systems
logic concern truth may derived using logical system metalogic concern truth may derived language system used express truths
basic object metalogical study formal language formal system interpretations
study interpretation formal system branch mathematical logic known model theory study deductive system branch known proof theory
formal language organized set symbol symbol precisely define shape place
language therefore defined without reference meaning expression exist interpretation assigned itthat ha meaning
formal grammar determines symbol set symbol formula formal language
formal language formally defined set string finite sequence fixed alphabet
author including rudolf carnap define language ordered pair a
carnap also requires element must occur least one string a
formation rule also called formal grammar precise description well-formed formula formal language
synonymous set string alphabet formal language constitute well formed formulas
formal system also called logical calculus logical system consists formal language together deductive apparatus also called deductive system
deductive apparatus may consist set transformation rule also called inference rule set axiom both
formal system used derive one expression one expressions
relation understood comprehensive sense primitive sentence formal system taken directly derivable empty set sentences
direct derivability relation sentence finite possibly empty set sentences
formal proof sequence well-formed formula formal language last theorem formal system
theorem syntactic consequence well formed formula precede proof system
well formed formula qualify part proof must result applying rule deductive apparatus formal system previous well formed formula proof sequence
interpretation formal system assignment meaning symbol truth-values sentence formal system
language used make statement object language called metalanguage
logic deal proof formal system expressed formal language metalogic deal proof formal system expressed metalanguage object language
metalogic 'syntax' ha formal language formal system without regard interpretation whereas 'semantics' ha interpretation formal languages
term 'syntactic' ha slightly wider scope 'proof-theoretic' since may applied property formal language without deductive system well formal systems
metalogic word 'use' 'mention' noun verb form take technical sense order identify important distinction
use-mention distinction sometimes referred words-as-words distinction distinction using word phrase mentioning it
usually indicated expression mentioned rather used enclosing quotation mark printing italic setting expression line
enclosing quote expression give u name expression example
article metalogicthe type-token distinction distinction metalogic separate abstract concept object particular instance concept
example particular bicycle garage token type thing known bicycle whereas bicycle garage particular place particular time true bicycle used sentence bicycle ha become popular recently distinction used clarify meaning symbol formal languages
however wa rise formal language late early century investigation foundation logic began flourish
david hilbert observed investigating foundation mathematics logical notion presupposed therefore simultaneous account metalogical metamathematical principle wa required
today metalogic metamathematics largely synonymous substantially subsumed mathematical logic academia
possible alternate le mathematical model may found writing charles sander peirce semioticians
