Nur-Sultan (/ˌnʊərsʊlˈtɑːn/; Kazakh pronunciation: [nʊɾ sʊltɑn]; Kazakh: Нұр-Сұлтан, romanized: Nūr-Sūltan), previously known as Astana (Kazakh pronunciation: [ɑstɑnɑ] (listen), Kazakh: Астана), is the capital city of Kazakhstan
The city acquired its present name on 23 March 2019, following a unanimous vote in Kazakhstan's parliament
It was named after Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan from 1990 to 2019.
The city lies on the banks of the Ishim River in the north-central part of Kazakhstan, within the Akmola Region, though administered as a city with special status separately from the rest of the region
A 2020 official estimate reported a population of 1,136,008 within the city limits, making it the second-largest city in the country, after Almaty, which had been the capital until 1997
The city became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997; since then it has grown and developed economically into one of the most modern cities in Central Asia
In 2021, the government selected Nur-Sultan as one of the 10 priority destinations for tourist development.
Modern Nur-Sultan is a planned city, following the process of other planned capitals
After it became the capital of Kazakhstan, the city dramatically changed its shape
The city's master-plan was designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa
As the seat of the government of Kazakhstan, Nur-Sultan is the site of the Parliament House, the Supreme Court, the Ak Orda Presidential Palace and numerous government departments and agencies
It is home to a range of futuristic buildings, including many skyscrapers.
The settlement was founded in 1830 as Akmola
This name was possibly given after a local landmark—Akmola literally means "white grave" or "holy city" in Kazakh—although this theory is not universally accepted
In 1832, it was granted town status and renamed Akmolinsk
On 10 December 1997, the city replaced Almaty as the capital of Kazakhstan
On 6 May 1998, it was renamed Astana, which means "capital city" in Kazakh
On 20 March 2019, the capital was renamed from Astana to its current name Nur-Sultan in honor of the long-ruling Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, shortly after his resignation
Nur-Sultan (нұр-сұлтан) can be read literally as "radiant sultan" in the Kazakh and Arabic languages.
The city also has an alternative name, known as Tselinograd
The name has been in use since 1961 to mark the city's evolution as a cultural and administrative centre of the Virgin Lands campaign.
Many centuries ago, the Bozok settlement was located on the territory of modern Nur-Sultan
It was a military fortress of the Steppe section of the Great Silk Road
The etymology of the Turkic word "Boz" carries several meanings such as ‘untouched earth’, ‘virgin soil’ and ‘feather grass’
It was a large settlement of the 12-14th centuries
At present, Nur-Sultan is expanding to the territory of ancient Bozok.
The settlement of Akmoly was established on the Ishim River in 1830 as the seat of an okrug
In 1832, the settlement was granted town status and named Akmolinsk
The fairly advantageous position of the town was clear as early as 1863
It describes how picket roads and lines connected this geographic center to Kargaly in the East, Aktau fort in the South and through Atbasar to Kokshetau in the West
In 1838, at the height of the great national and liberation movement headed by Kenesary Khan, Akmolinsk fortress was burned
After the repression of the liberation movement, the fortress was rebuilt
On 16 July 1863, Akmolinsk was officially declared an uyezd town
In 1869, Akmolinsk external district and department were cancelled, and Akmolinsk became the center of the newly established Akmolinsk Oblast
In 1879, Major General Dubelt proposed to build a railway between Tyumen and Akmolinsk to the Ministry of Communications of Russia
In the course of the first 30 years of its existence, the population of Akmola numbered a trifle more than 2,000 people
However, over the next 30 years the city's population increased by three times according to volosts and settlements of the Akmolinsk Oblast
In 1893, Akmolinsk was an uyezd with a 6,428 strong population, 3 churches, 5 schools and colleges and 3 factories.
During World War II, Akmolinsk served as a route for the transport of engineering tools and equipment from evacuated plants in the Ukrainian SSR, Byelorussian SSR, and Russian SFSR located in the oblasts of the Kazakh SSR
Local industries were appointed to respond to war needs, assisting the country to provide the battle and home fronts with all materials needed
In the post-war years, Akmolinsk became a beacon of economic revival in the west of the Soviet Union ruined by the war
Additionally, many Russian-Germans were resettled here after being deported under Joseph Stalin's rule.
In 1954, Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts became a territory of the Virgin Lands Campaign, in order to turn the region into a second grain producer for the Soviet Union
In December 1960, Central Committee made a resolution to create the Tselinniy Krai, which comprised five regions of the Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts
Akmolinsk Oblast was ceased to exist as a separate administrative entity
Its districts were directly subordinated to the new krai administration, and Akmolinsk became the krai capital, as well as the administrative seat of the new Virgin Lands economic region
On 14 March 1961, Khrushchev suggested the city should have a name corresponding to its role in the Virgin Lands Campaign
On 20 March 1961, the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR renamed Akmolinsk Tselinograd
On 24 April 1961, the region was reconstituted as Tselinograd Oblast
In the 1960s, Tselinograd was completely transformed
In 1963, work on the first three new high-rise housing districts began
In addition, the city received a number of new monumental public buildings, including the Virgin Lands Palace, a Palace of Youth, a House of Soviets, a new airport, and several sports venues
In 1971, the Tselinniy Krai was abolished and Tselinograd became the centre of the oblast.
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the consequent independence of Kazakhstan, the city's original name was restored in the modified form Akmola
On 6 July 1994, the Supreme Council of Kazakhstan adopted the decree "On the transfer of the capital of Kazakhstan"
After the capital of Kazakhstan was moved to Akmola on 10 December 1997, the city was consequently renamed Astana in 1998
On 10 June 1998, Astana was presented as the capital internationally
Due to several determined advantages, Astana was chosen as the capital: large urban areas, favorable geographical position, proximity to the major economic centers of the region, considerable demographic capacity, good transportation facilities, and a relatively favorable climate
On 16 July 1999, Astana was awarded the medal and title of the City of Peace by UNESCO
On 19 March 2019, president Nursultan Nazarbayev resigned, and on 23 March the city was renamed Nur-Sultan
While it is officially called Nur-Sultan, many residents still refer to it as Astana.
Nur-Sultan is almost 1,000 km (600 miles) away from the country's largest city and former capital, Almaty
The nearest big cities are Karaganda (200 km) and Omsk in Russia (450 km).
Nur-Sultan (Astana) is located in central Kazakhstan on the Ishim River in a very flat, semi-arid steppe region which covers most of the country's territory

The city encompasses 722.0 square kilometres (278.8 sq mi)
The elevation of Nur-Sultan (Astana) is 347 metres (1,138 ft) above sea level
Nur-Sultan is in a spacious steppe landscape, in the transitional area between the north of Kazakhstan and the extremely thinly settled national centre, because of the Ishim River
The older boroughs lie north of the river, whilst the new boroughs are located south of the Ishim.
The time offset from the UTC used by Nur-Sultan is 6 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+6:00
This is also used by most of Kazakhstan and Almaty.
Nur-Sultan is the second-coldest national capital in the world after Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, a position formerly held by Canada's capital, Ottawa, until Nur-Sultan attained capital city status in 1997
Nur-Sultan has an extreme continental climate with warm summers (featuring occasional brief rain showers) and long, very cold, dry winters
Summer temperatures occasionally reach 35 °C (95 °F) while −30 to −35 °C (−22 to −31 °F) is not unusual between mid-December and early March
Typically, the city's river is frozen over between the second week of November and the beginning of April
Nur-Sultan has a well-deserved reputation among Kazakhs for its frequent high winds, the effects of which are felt particularly strongly on the fast-developing but relatively exposed Left Bank area of the city.
Overall, Nur-Sultan has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb)
The average annual temperature in Nur-Sultan is 3.5 °C (38.3 °F)
