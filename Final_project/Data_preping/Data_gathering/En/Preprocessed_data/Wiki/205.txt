ultra high definition television also known as ultra hd television ultra hd uhdtv uhd and super hi vision today includes k uhd and k uhd which are two digital video formats with an aspect ratio of
these were first proposed by nhk science technology research laboratories and later defined and approved by the international telecommunication union itu
it is a digital television dtv standard and the successor to high definition television hdtv which in turn was the successor to standard definition television sdtv
the consumer electronics association announced on october that ultra high definition or ultra hd would be used for displays that have an aspect ratio of or wider and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of
in the ultra hd forum was created to bring together the end to end video production ecosystem to ensure interoperability and produce industry guidelines so that adoption of ultra high definition television could accelerate
from just in q the forum published a list up to commercial services available around the world offering k resolution
the uhd alliance an industry consortium of content creators distributors and hardware manufacturers announced during a consumer electronics show ces press conference its ultra hd premium specification which defines resolution bit depth color gamut high dynamic range hdr performance required for ultra hd uhdtv content and displays to carry their ultra hd premium logo
ultra high definition television is also known as ultra hd uhd uhdtv and k
in japan k uhdtv will be known as super hi vision since hi vision was the term used in japan for hdtv
in the consumer electronics market companies had previously only used the term k at the ces but that had changed to ultra hd during ces
ultra hd was selected by the consumer electronics association after extensive consumer research as the term has also been established with the introduction of ultra hd blu ray
two resolutions are defined as uhdtv
uhdtv is pixels wide by pixels tall megapixels which is four times as many pixels as the megapixels of current p hdtv full hdtv
also known as p and k uhd
although roughly similar in resolution to k digital cinema formats it should not be confused with other k resolutions such as the dci k cinema k
the total number of pixels of rgb stripe type is mega pixel
uhdtv is pixels wide by pixels tall megapixels also referred to as p and k uhd which is sixteen times as many pixels as current p hdtv which brings it closer to the detail level of mm imax
nhk advertises the k uhdtv format with surround sound as super hi vision the human visual system has a limited ability to discern improvements in resolution when picture elements are already small enough or distant enough from the viewer
at some home viewing distances and current tv sizes hd resolution is near the limits of resolution for the eye and increasing resolution to k has little perceptual impact if consumers are beyond the critical distance lechner distance to appreciate the differences in pixel count between k and hd
one exception is that even if resolution surpasses the resolving ability of the human eye there is still an improvement in the way the image appears due to higher resolutions reducing spatial aliasing
uhdtv provides other image enhancements in addition to pixel density
specifically dynamic range and color are greatly enhanced and these impact saturation and contrast differences that are readily resolved greatly improve the experience of ktv compared to hdtv
uhdtv allows the future use of the new rec
uhdtv color space which can reproduce colors that cannot be shown with the current rec
hdtv color space
in terms of cie color space the rec
color space covers compared to coverage by the dci p digital cinema reference projector color space of just by adobe rgb color space while the rec
color space covers only
uhdtv s increases in dynamic range allow not only brighter highlights but also increased detail in the greyscale
uhdtv also allows for frame rates up to frames per second fps
uhdtv potentially allows rec
higher dynamic range and higher frame rates to work on hd services without increasing resolution to k providing improved quality without as high of an increase in bandwidth demand
the first displays capable of displaying k content appeared in as the ibm t t lcd monitors
nhk researchers built a uhdtv prototype which they demonstrated in
they used an array of hdtv recorders with a total capacity of almost tb that could capture up to minutes of test footage
the camera itself was built with four inch mm ccds each with a resolution of only
using two ccds for green and one each for red and blue they then used a spatial pixel offset method to bring it to
subsequently an improved and more compact system was built using cmos image sensor technology and the cmos image sensor system was demonstrated at expo aichi japan the nab and nab conferences las vegas at ibc and ibc amsterdam netherlands and ces
a review of the nab demo was published in a broadcast engineering e newsletter
individuals at nhk and elsewhere projected that the timeframe for uhdtv to be available in domestic homes varied between and but japan was to get it in the time frame
on november nhk demonstrated a live relay of a uhdtv program over a kilometer distance by a fiber optic network
using dense wavelength division multiplex dwdm gbit s speed was achieved with a total of different wavelength signals
on december nhk demonstrated a live relay of their annual k haku uta gassen over ip from tokyo to a in m screen in osaka
using a codec developed by nhk the video was compressed from gbit s to mbit s and the audio was compressed from mbit s to mbit s
uncompressed a minute broadcast would require roughly tb of storage
the smpte first released standard for uhdtv in
uhdtv was defined as having two levels called uhdtv and uhdtv
in may the nhk did an indoor demonstration at the nhk open house in which a uhdtv signal at fps was compressed to a mbit s mpeg stream
the signal was input to a mhz wide band modulator and broadcast using a mhz qpsk modulation
this on the air transmission had a very limited range less than meters but shows the feasibility of a satellite transmission in the km orbit
in aptina imaging announced the introduction of a new cmos image sensor specifically designed for the nhk uhdtv project
during ibc japan s nhk italy s rai bskyb sony samsung panasonic corporation sharp corporation and toshiba with various partners demonstrated the first ever public live transmission of uhdtv from london to the conference site in amsterdam

on may sharp in collaboration with nhk demonstrated a direct view in cm lcd display capable of pixels at bits per channel
it was the first direct view super hi vision compatible display released
before uhdtv allowed for frame rates of and fps
in an itu r meeting during an additional frame rate was added to uhdtv of fps
on february nhk announced that with shizuoka university they had developed an k sensor that can shoot video at fps
in april panasonic in collaboration with nhk announced a in cm display at fps which has million mm square pixels
in april the four major korean terrestrial broadcasters kbs mbc sbs and ebs announced that in the future they would begin test broadcasts of uhdtv on channel in seoul
at the time of the announcement the uhdtv technical details had not yet been decided
lg electronics and samsung are also involved in uhdtv test broadcasts
in may nhk showed the world s first ultra high definition shoulder mount camera
by reducing the size and weight of the camera the portability had been improved making it more maneuverable than previous prototypes so it could be used in a wide variety of shooting situations
the single chip sensor uses a bayer color filter array where only one color component is acquired per pixel
researchers at nhk also developed a high quality up converter which estimates the other two color components to convert the output into full resolution video
also in may nhk showed the ultra high definition imaging system it has developed in conjunction with shizuoka university which outputs megapixel video at fps with a color depth of bits per component
as ultra high definition broadcasts at full resolution are designed for large wall sized displays there is a possibility that fast moving subjects may not be clear when shot at fps so the option of fps has been standardized for these situations
to handle the sensor output of approximately billion pixels per second with a data rate as high as gbit s a faster analog to digital converter has been developed to process the data from the pixels and then a high speed output circuit distributes the resulting digital signals into parallel channels
this in mm cmos sensor is smaller and uses less power when compared to conventional ultra high definition sensors and it is also the world s first to support the full specifications of the ultra high definition standard
during the summer olympics in great britain the format was publicly showcased by the world s largest broadcaster the bbc which set up meter wide screens in london glasgow and bradford to allow viewers to see the games in ultra high definition

on september david wood deputy director of the ebu technology and development department who chairs the itu working group that created rec told the hollywood reporter that korea plans to begin test broadcasts of k uhdtv next year
wood also said that many broadcasters have the opinion that going from hdtv to k uhdtv is too much of a leap and that it would be better to start with k uhdtv
in the same article masakazu iwaki nhk research senior manager said that the nhk plan to go with k uhdtv is for economic reasons since directly going to k uhdtv would avoid an additional transition from k uhdtv to k uhdtv
