Ultra high definition television also known as Ultra HD television Ultra HD UHDTV UHD and Super Hi Vision today includes K UHD and K UHD which are two digital video formats with an aspect ratio of These were first proposed by NHK Science Technology Research Laboratories and later defined and approved by the International Telecommunication Union ITU It is a digital television DTV standard and the successor to high definition television HDTV which in turn was the successor to standard definition television SDTV
The Consumer Electronics Association announced on October that Ultra High Definition or Ultra HD would be used for displays that have an aspect ratio of or wider and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of × In the Ultra HD Forum was created to bring together the end to end video production ecosystem to ensure interoperability and produce industry guidelines so that adoption of ultra high definition television could accelerate From just in Q the forum published a list up to commercial services available around the world offering K resolution
The UHD Alliance an industry consortium of content creators distributors and hardware manufacturers announced during a Consumer Electronics Show CES press conference its Ultra HD Premium specification which defines resolution bit depth color gamut high dynamic range HDR performance required for Ultra HD UHDTV content and displays to carry their Ultra HD Premium logo
Ultra high definition television is also known as Ultra HD UHD UHDTV and K In Japan K UHDTV will be known as Super Hi Vision since Hi Vision was the term used in Japan for HDTV In the consumer electronics market companies had previously only used the term K at the CES but that had changed to Ultra HD during CES Ultra HD was selected by the Consumer Electronics Association after extensive consumer research as the term has also been established with the introduction of Ultra HD Blu ray
UHDTV is pixels wide by pixels tall megapixels which is four times as many pixels as the × megapixels of current p HDTV full HDTV
Also known as p and K UHD Although roughly similar in resolution to K digital cinema formats it should not be confused with other K resolutions such as the × DCI KCinema K The total number of pixels of RGB stripe type is mega pixel
UHDTV is pixels wide by pixels tall megapixels also referred to as p and K UHD which is sixteen times as many pixels as current p HDTV which brings it closer to the detail level of mm IMAX NHK advertises the K UHDTV format with surround sound as Super Hi VisionThe human visual system has a limited ability to discern improvements in resolution when picture elements are already small enough or distant enough from the viewer At some home viewing distances and current TV sizes HD resolution is near the limits of resolution for the eye and increasing resolution to K has little perceptual impact if consumers are beyond the critical distance Lechner distance to appreciate the differences in pixel count between K and HD One exception is that even if resolution surpasses the resolving ability of the human eye there is still an improvement in the way the image appears due to higher resolutions reducing spatial aliasing
UHDTV provides other image enhancements in addition to pixel density Specifically dynamic range and color are greatly enhanced and these impact saturation and contrast differences that are readily resolved greatly improve the experience of KTV compared to HDTV UHDTV allows the future use of the new Rec UHDTV color space which can reproduce colors that cannot be shown with the current Rec HDTV color space
In terms of CIE color space the Rec color space covers compared to coverage by the DCI P digital cinema reference projector color space of just by Adobe RGB color space while the Rec color space covers only UHDTV's increases in dynamic range allow not only brighter highlights but also increased detail in the greyscale UHDTV also allows for frame rates up to frames per second fps
UHDTV potentially allows Rec higher dynamic range and higher frame rates to work on HD services without increasing resolution to K providing improved quality without as high of an increase in bandwidth demand
The first displays capable of displaying K content appeared in as the IBM TT LCD monitors
NHK researchers built a UHDTV prototype which they demonstrated in They used an array of HDTV recorders with a total capacity of almost TB that could capture up to minutes of test footage The camera itself was built with four inch mm CCDs each with a resolution of only × Using two CCDs for green and one each for red and blue they then used a spatial pixel offset method to bring it to × Subsequently an improved and more compact system was built using CMOS image sensor technology and the CMOS image sensor system was demonstrated at Expo Aichi Japan the NAB and NAB conferences Las Vegas at IBC and IBC Amsterdam Netherlands and CES A review of the NAB demo was published in a broadcast engineering e newsletter Individuals at NHK and elsewhere projected that the timeframe for UHDTV to be available in domestic homes varied between and but Japan was to get it in the time frame

Also in May NHK showed the ultra high definition imaging system it has developed in conjunction with Shizuoka University which outputs megapixel video at fps with a color depth of bits per component As ultra high definition broadcasts at full resolution are designed for large wall sized displays there is a possibility that fast moving subjects may not be clear when shot at fps so the option of fps has been standardized for these situations To handle the sensor output of approximately billion pixels per second with a data rate as high as Gbits a faster analog to digital converter has been developed to process the data from the pixels and then a high speed output circuit distributes the resulting digital signals into parallel channels This in mm CMOS sensor is smaller and uses less power when compared to conventional ultra high definition sensors and it is also the world's first to support the full specifications of the ultra high definition standard
