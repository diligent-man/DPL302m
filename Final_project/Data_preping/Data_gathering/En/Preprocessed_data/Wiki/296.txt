cultural appropriation is the inappropriate or unacknowledged adoption of an element or elements of one culture or identity by members of another culture or identity
this can be controversial when members of a dominant culture appropriate from minority cultures
according to critics of the practice cultural appropriation differs from acculturation assimilation or equal cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of colonialism
when cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture the practice is often received negatively
cultural appropriation is considered harmful by various groups and individuals including indigenous people working for cultural preservation those who advocate for collective intellectual property rights of the originating minority cultures and those who have lived or are living under colonial rule
cultural appropriation can include exploitation of another culture s religious and cultural traditions dance steps fashion symbols language and music
those who see this appropriation as exploitative state that cultural elements are lost or distorted when they are removed from their originating cultural contexts and that such displays are disrespectful or even a form of desecration
cultural elements that may have deep meaning to the original culture may be reduced to exotic fashion or toys by those from the dominant culture
kjerstin johnson has written that when this is done the imitator who does not experience that oppression is able to play temporarily an exotic other without experiencing any of the daily discriminations faced by other cultures
the academic musician and journalist greg tate argues that appropriation and the fetishising of cultures in fact alienates those whose culture is being appropriated
the concept of cultural appropriation has also been heavily criticized
critics note that the concept is often misunderstood or misapplied by the general public and that charges of cultural appropriation are at times misapplied to situations such as trying food from a different culture or learning about different cultures
others state that the act of cultural appropriation as it is usually defined does not meaningfully constitute social harm or the term lacks conceptual coherence
additionally the term can set arbitrary limits on intellectual freedom artists self expression reinforce group divisions or promote a feeling of enmity or grievance rather than of liberation
cultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas symbols artifacts or other aspects of human made visual or non visual culture
as a concept that is controversial in its applications the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate
opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social political economic or military status to the dominant culture or when there are other issues involved such as a history of ethnic or racial conflict
linda mart n alcoff writes that this is often seen in cultural outsiders use of an oppressed culture s symbols or other cultural elements such as music dance spiritual ceremonies modes of dress speech and social behaviour when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion rather than respected within their original cultural context
opponents view the issues of colonialism context and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation
they argue that mutual exchange happens on an even playing field whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from and who lack the cultural context to properly understand respect or utilize these elements
another view of cultural appropriation is that calling upon it to criticise is a deeply conservative project despite progressive roots that first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries to prevent others from interacting with that culture
for example the film star wars used elements from akira kurosawa s the hidden fortress which itself used elements from shakespeare culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation
fusion between cultures has produced such foods as american chinese cuisine modern japanese sushi and b nh m each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture s identity

cultural and racial theorist george lipsitz has used the term strategic anti essentialism to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form outside of one s own to define oneself or one s group
strategic anti essentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures and is not confined only to the use of the other
however lipsitz argues when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti essentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture it must take great care to recognize the specific socio historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs
minority unequal power relations
a common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the iconography of another culture and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that culture s mores
examples include sports teams using native american tribal names or images as mascots people not from the originating culture wearing jewelry or fashion that incorporates religious symbols such as the medicine wheel or cross without any belief in the religion behind them or wearing items of deep cultural significance and status that must be earned such as a war bonnet without having earned the right
copying iconography from another culture s history such as polynesian tribal tattoos chinese characters or celtic art worn without regard to their original cultural significance may also be considered appropriation
critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as kitsch risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions
in australia aboriginal artists have discussed an authenticity brand to ensure consumers are aware of artworks claiming false aboriginal significance

there are modern groups such as the coalition of hindus of north america that are seeking to reverse or reclaim the hold that the hakenkreuz has over the swastika in the west
the celtic cross has been similarly taken over by some white supremacists

cornel pewewardy professor and director of indigenous nations studies at portland state university cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which by placing images of native american or first nations people into an invented media context continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture
it is argued that such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture and can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism

in writing about indigenous intellectual property for the native american rights fund narf board member professor rebecca tsosie stresses the importance of these property rights being held collectively not by individuals
the long term goal is to actually have a legal system and certainly a treaty could do that that acknowledges two things
number one it acknowledges that indigenous peoples are peoples with a right to self determination that includes governance rights over all property belonging to the indigenous people
and number two it acknowledges that indigenous cultural expressions are a form of intellectual property and that traditional knowledge is a form of intellectual property but they are collective resources so not any one individual can give away the rights to those resources
the tribal nations actually own them collectively a popularly known example of the appropriation of east asian culture is in relation to the famous tweet my culture is not your goddamn prom dress this was written by jeremy lam regarding the photographs posted by a young woman named keziah daum from utah who wore a qipao which is a chinese traditional dress to her school s prom

during halloween some people buy wear and sell halloween costumes based on cultural or racial stereotypes
