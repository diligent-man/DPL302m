Three cities submitted bids to host the event Albena Tallinn and Baku
The final decision was made at the rd FIDE Congress in September in Istanbul
Out of the three bidding cities the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting
Thereafter discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised
The first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan who stated that the Armenian chess players would find it difficult to play in Baku since the two nations were in armed conflict
The second concern was related to the difficulties that the participants may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country
In his speech during the congress Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met and no incident was ever recorded
He also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win
With regard to the visa issue Rahimov mentioned the positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest where all participants received their visas on arrival at the airport without any problem
He also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily
The next speaker was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov who suggested that the nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event
His proposal was supported by the delegates and the FIDE Congress awarded the Chess Olympiad to Baku and the Chess World Cup for the year before

He is by no means a young man by now and he

The official mascot was revealed on a press-conference dedicated to days before the Chess Olympiad held in Baku on May
The name of the mascot is Chess Mate and it represents a boy clad in a national dress
The author of the mascot is Musa Changiev whose suggestion was selected out of received in the national competition launched by the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee in March

He came up with the image of a young chess player with black hair and brows that are typical for the Azerbaijani people
The youngster wears glasses and is clad in a combination of national and modern features

There were multiple side events that took place in order to promote the Chess Olympiad and the game of chess such as the operation of chess buses D street art on chess topics display of painted chess pieces Chess Queen street performances chess photography exhibitions and parallel chess tournaments
In August the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee branded two double-decker buses of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to operate in the city in the run-up and during the Olympiad
They were officially launched in late August with a ceremony during which members of the Azerbaijani national team were playing chess inside
The buses operated free of charge and took passengers to Baku's main sights
The passengers have the chance to play chess inside the buses and obtain information about the Olympiad
The Operating Committee invited the famous Ukrainian D street artist Alex Maksiov to create a D image dedicated to the nd Chess Olympiad

Mindful particularly of the cheating incident of Sbastien Feller at the th Chess Olympiad combined with the general increase of cheating incidents the World Chess Federation FIDE strove to have greatly enhanced security in Baku
Some of these were already introduced at the Chess World Cup also in Baku which included transmission delay of some games random security checks of players ban for bringing pens and watches into the playing hall and installment of electronic checkpoints for players at the entrance of the playing hall see below
In an interview during the preparations May for the Olympiad Israel Gelfer the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee said that the issue of anti-cheating became important in the last couple of years with the development of telecommunication technologies mobile phones watches and even glasses that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored
Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world
The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed while novel procedures included having a special anti-cheating arbiter Klaus Deventer with approximately arbiters under his authority one of whose charges was to carry out checks during the round and that players must inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area
Despite the aforementioned anti-cheating protocols some participants felt that this was merely a display without effect
Mobile phones were commonly heard going off particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov
It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them
In the fourth round a Japanese player Tang Tang was forfeited after he was caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue
The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss which also resulted in a change in the match score
Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter
He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device as possession already violated the rules leading to an automatic forfeiture
Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running
Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment
The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanoviƒá later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar ƒåoloovi·∏±
During the game of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao the former was returning from the toilet with about minutes to make moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices
Short did not heed the request and sat back down to play
After the game Klaus Deventer the head of the anti-cheating arbiters reprimanded Short with a warning
Short discussed the incident extensively after the event indicating that he did not think the cost of annoyance to the player even when returning from outside the playing area was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection some for refusal others for being caught with a device
Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question Jamie Kenmure an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands have a political past and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer as per the regulations
Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters asking him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search while in time trouble and playing a do-or-die position though these details now seem discredited
A significant petition was circulated by Jonathan Speelman and others regarding the mandatory notification of the arbiter when leaving the playing area the petition concentrated on toilet visits
Reasons given for this protesting against this noxious rule included the FIDE rule that the toilet is part of the playing area an indication it was humiliating for players to discuss bodily functions with arbiters and embarrassing for the arbiters a note that the Match Arbiter the indicated person to be notified was not always available rendering it difficult to always comply with the rule an argument that frequent toilet trips did not indicate cheating and a request that players not be penalised merely for this and an argument that the opponent might gain information from seeing a player notify the arbiter by moving as soon as they left for the bathroom visit
The response by Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov noted only that the third complaint was legitimate and that common sense should apply
Multiple post-event comments by captains and players continued to report the annoyance of the anti-cheating measures noting that a better balance between security and enjoyment could be found by FIDE
Baadur Jobava was prominent on the other side of the issue opining that the anti-cheating measures would help solve the non-stop screaming about this great headache for the st century chess player
Due to a small number of embassies Azerbaijan can be more difficult to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad
This issue was briefly raised during the rd FIDE Congress and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem
In a similar manner in April the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports
A number of African nations did not show up in time for various reasons such as difficulties flying through Istanbul and finalisation of monetary arrangements teams must pay first and then get reimbursed later
Former Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image
On September the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel
Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that out of the planned federations were on a travel subsidy including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds though
He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be reimbursed upon arrival
Finally Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in
In the end African nations did not arrive Kenya Cameroon Mali Rwanda Sierra Leone Burundi Liberia Seychelles Senegal Central African Republic
Armenia's participation in a Chess Olympiad hosted in Azerbaijan was raised as a concern at the rd FIDE Congress in Istanbul in during discussions about Baku's nomination to host the Olympiad in with the Armenian representative protesting since Armenian chess players would find it quite difficult to play in Baku
Historically this is nothing new as the tense relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years resulting in the absence of players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events
For example the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship was ultimately moved completely from Baku to Kazan with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan
More recently Azerbaijan chose not to play in the World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship in Yerevan
Nevertheless Armenian players including Levon Aronian did play at the Chess World Cup in Baku giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad
In May during his visit to Yerevan FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that after talking to the Armenian Chess Federation chairman Serzh Sargsyan also President of Armenia he heard no refusal about their participation
The vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation Smbat Lputian responded that Armenia was still discussing the matter and had not decided on the matter yet
In July Lputian announced that based upon discussion within the federation the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad
Israel participated without Boris Gelfand Emil Sutovsky and Ilya Smirin due to a dispute with the Israel Chess Federation management
The hardships were already evident in when the country failed to send a team at the European Team Chess Championship due to monetary difficulties
Boris Gelfand who played on board one for Israel at nine consecutive Olympiads said the management of the Israel Chess Federation have absolutely forgotten about such things as the prestige of the country
Emil Sutovsky claimed on his Facebook page that the dispute was about showing who's boss rather than money
Bulgaria played without Ivan Cheparinov and Kiril Georgiev the former due to monetary disputes and the latter because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned
At one point the entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming similarly they were absent from the European Team Chess Championship as was Greece
One week before the Olympiad started the Pakistani Sports Board dealing with three separate claimants to status of official national federation refused to issue No Objection Certificates NOCs
A spokesman said we have refused to issue NOCs to around men and women chess players and two officials as currently no chess federation is recognised by us
Issuing them NOCs will mean we've accepted an illegal body In the end a team from Pakistan with its top players did attend and finished slightly above average
Kenya has had a long running dispute within its federation and due to this and other reasons the open team ended up not showing up for the event and the women's team began play only in round
