the consulate french le consulat was the top level government of france from the fall of the directory in the coup of brumaire on november until the start of the napoleonic empire on may
by extension the term the consulate also refers to this period of french history
during this period napoleon bonaparte as first consul premier consul established himself as the head of a more authoritarian autocratic and centralized republican government in france while not declaring himself sole ruler
due to the long lasting institutions established during these years robert b
holtman has called the consulate one of the most important periods of all french history napoleon brought authoritarian personal rule which has been viewed as military dictatorship
french military disasters in and had shaken the directory and eventually shattered it in november
historians sometimes date the start of the political downfall of the directory to june coup of prairial vii by the french republican calendar
this was when anti jacobin director emmanuel joseph siey s after only a month in office with the help of the directory s only surviving original member paul barras also an anti jacobin successfully rid himself of the other three then sitting directors
the march april elections to the two councils had produced a new neo jacobin majority in the two bodies and being unhappy with the existing five man directory by june these councils had found an irregularity in the election of the director jean baptiste treilhard who thus retired in favor of louis j r me gohier a jacobin more in tune with the feelings in the two councils
the very next day june the anti jacobins philippe antoine merlin merlin de douai and louis marie de la revelli re l peaux were also driven to resign although one long time anti jacobin popularly known for his cunning survived the day s coup they were replaced by the jacobin baron jean fran ois auguste moulin and by the non jacobin or weak jacobin roger ducos
the three new directors were generally seen by the anti jacobin elite of france as non entities a put down if ever there was one but that same elite could take some comfort in knowing that the five man directory was still in anti jacobin hands but with a reduced majority
a few more military disasters royalist insurrections in the south chouan disturbances in a dozen departments of the western part of france mainly in brittany maine and eventually normandy orl anist intrigues and the end became certain
in order to soothe the populace and protect the frontier more than the french revolution s usual terrorist measures such as the law of hostages was necessary
the new directory government led by the anti jacobin siey s decided that the necessary revision of the constitution would require a head his own and a sword a general to back him
jean victor moreau being unattainable as his sword siey s favoured barth lemy catherine joubert but when joubert was killed at the battle of novi august he turned to general napoleon bonaparte
although guillaume marie anne brune and andr mass na won the battles of bergen and of z rich and although the allies of the second coalition lingered on the frontier as they had done after the battle of valmy still the fortunes of the directory were not restored
success was reserved for bonaparte suddenly landing at fr jus with the prestige of his victories in the east and now after hoche s death appearing as sole master of the armies
in the coup of brumaire year viii november napoleon seized french parliamentary and military power in a two fold coup d tat forcing the sitting directors of the government to resign
on the night of the brumaire november a remnant of the council of ancients abolished the constitution of the year iii ordained the consulate and legalised the coup d etat in favour of bonaparte with the constitution of the year viii
the initial brumaire coup seemed to be a victory for siey s rather than for bonaparte
siey s was a proponent of a new system of government for the republic and the coup initially seemed certain to bring his system into force
bonaparte s cleverness lay in counterposing pierre claude fran ois daunou s plan to that of siey s and in retaining only those portions of each which could serve his ambition
the new government was composed of three parliamentary assemblies the council of state which drafted bills the tribunate which could not vote on the bills but instead debated them and the corps l gislatif whose members could not discuss the bills but voted on them after reviewing the tribunate s debate record
the s nat conservateur was a governmental body equal to the three aforementioned legislative assemblies and verified the draft bills and directly advised the first consul on the implications of such bills
ultimate executive authority was vested in three consuls who were elected for ten years
popular suffrage was retained though mutilated by the lists of notables on which the members of the assemblies were to be chosen by the senate
the four aforementioned governmental organs were retained under the constitution of the year xii which recognized napoleon as the french sovereign emperor but their respective powers were greatly diminished
napoleon vetoed siey s original idea of having a single grand elector as supreme executive and head of state
siey s had intended to reserve this important position for himself and by denying him the job napoleon helped reinforce the authority of the consuls an office which he would assume
nor was napoleon content simply to be part of an equal triumvirate
as the years would progress he would move to consolidate his own power as first consul and leave the two other consuls jean jacques r gis de cambac r s and charles fran ois lebrun as well as the assemblies weak and subservient
by consolidating power bonaparte was able to transform the aristocratic constitution of siey s into an unavowed dictatorship
on february a public referendum confirmed the new constitution
it vested all of the real power in the hands of the first consul leaving only a nominal role for the other two consuls
a full of voters approved the motion according to the released results
while this near unanimity is certainly open to question napoleon was genuinely popular among many voters and after a period of strife many in france were reassured by his dazzling but unsuccessful offers of peace to the victorious second coalition his rapid disarmament of la vend e and his talk of stability of government order justice and moderation
he gave everyone a feeling that france was governed once more by a real statesman and that a competent government was finally in charge
bonaparte had to now rid himself of siey s and of those republicans who had no desire to hand over the republic to one man particularly of moreau and mass na his military rivals
the victory of marengo june momentarily in the balance but secured by desaix and kellermann offered a further opportunity to his ambition by increasing his popularity
the royalist plot of the rue saint nicaise on december allowed him to make a clean sweep of the democratic republicans who despite their innocence were deported to french guiana
he annulled the assemblies and made the senate omnipotent in constitutional matters
the treaty of lun ville signed in february with austria which had been disarmed by moreau s victory at hohenlinden restored peace to europe gave nearly the whole of italy to france and permitted bonaparte to eliminate from the assemblies all the leaders of the opposition in the discussion of the civil code
the concordat of drawn up not in the church s interest but in that of his own policy by giving satisfaction to the religious feeling of the country allowed him to put down the constitutional democratic church to rally round him the consciences of the peasants and above all to deprive the royalists of their best weapon
the articles organiques hid from the eyes of his companions in arms and councillors a reaction which in fact if not in law restored to a submissive church despoiled of her revenues her position as the religion of the state
the peace of amiens march with the united kingdom of which france s allies spain and the batavian republic paid all the costs finally gave the peacemaker a pretext for endowing himself with a consulate not for ten years but for life as a recompense from the nation
the rubicon was crossed on that day bonaparte s march to empire began with the constitution of the year x dated thermidor or august
on august thermidor an x a second national referendum was held this time to confirm napoleon as first consul for life once again a vote claimed approval
as napoleon increased his power he borrowed many techniques of the ancien r gime in his new form of one man government
like the old monarchy he re introduced plenipotentiaries over centralised strictly utilitarian administrative and bureaucratic methods and a policy of subservient pedantic scholasticism towards the nation s universities
he constructed or consolidated the funds necessary for national institutions local governments a judiciary system organs of finance banking codes traditions of conscientious well disciplined labour force
france enjoyed a high level of peace and order under napoleon that helped to raise the standard of comfort
prior to this paris had often suffered from hunger and thirst and lacked fire and light but under napoleon provisions became cheap and abundant while trade prospered and wages ran high
the pomp and luxury of the nouveaux riches were displayed in the salons of the good jos phine the beautiful madame tallien and the divine juliette r camier
in strengthening the machinery of state napoleon created the elite order of the l gion d honneur the legion of honour the concordat and restored indirect taxes an act seen as a betrayal of the revolution
napoleon was largely able to quell dissent within government by expelling his more vocal critics such as benjamin constant and madame de sta l
the expedition to san domingo reduced the republican army to a nullity
constant war helped demoralise and scatter the military s leaders who were jealous of their comrade bonaparte
the last major challenge to napoleon s authority came from moreau who was compromised in a royalist plot he too was sent into exile
in contradistinction to the opposition of senators and republican generals the majority of the french populace remained uncritical of bonaparte s authority
no suggestion of the possibility of his death was tolerated
the napoleonic age began here when he became officer of the french state and established the consulate
because napoleon s hold on political power was still tenuous french royalists devised a plot that involved kidnapping and assassinating him and inviting louis antoine de bourbon the duke of enghien to lead a coup d tat that would precede the restoration of the bourbon monarchy with louis xviii on the throne
the british government of william pitt the younger had contributed to this royalist conspiracy by financing one million pounds and providing naval transport with the ship of captain john wesley wright to the conspirators georges cadoudal and general charles pichegru for their return to france from england
pichegru met jean victor marie moreau one of napoleon s generals and a former protege of pichegru on january
the next day a british secret agent named courson was arrested and he under torture confessed that pichegru moreau and cadoudal were conspiring to overthrow the consulate
the french government sought more details of this plot by arresting and torturing louis picot cadoudal s servant
joachim murat ordered the city gates of paris to be closed from pm to am while pichegru and moreau were arrested during the next month
these further arrests revealed that the royalist conspiracy would eventually involve the active participation of the duke of enghien who was a relatively young bourbon prince and thus another possible heir to a restored bourbon monarchy
the duke at that time was living as a french migr in the future grand duchy of baden but then still the electorate of baden but he also kept a rented house in ettenheim which was close to the french border
perhaps at the urging of talleyrand napoleon s foreign minister and fouch napoleon s minister of police who had warned that the air is full of daggers the first consul came to the political conclusion that the duke must be dealt with
two hundred french soldiers crossed the border surrounded the duke s home in baden and arrested him
on the way back to france d enghien stated that he had sworn implacable hatred against bonaparte as well as against the french he would take every occasion to make war on them
after three plots to assassinate him and the further financing of a supposed insurrection in strasbourg napoleon had enough
based on d enghien s who were seized at his home in germany and the material from the police d enghien was charged as a conspirator in time of war and was subject to a military court
he was ordered to be tried by a court of seven colonels at vincennes
d enghien during his questioning at the court told them that he was being paid per year by england in order to combat not france but a government to which his birth had made him hostile further he stated that i asked england if i might serve in her armies but she replied that that was impossible i must wait on the rhine where i would have a part to play immediately and i was in fact waiting
d enghien was found guilty of being in violation of article of a law of october to wit any conspiracy and plot aimed at disturbing the state by civil war and arming the citizens against one another or against lawful authority will be punished by death he was executed in the ditch of the fortress of vincennes
the aftermath caused hardly a ripple in france but abroad it produced a storm of anger
many of those who had favored or been neutral to napoleon now turned against him
but napoleon always assumed full responsibility for allowing the execution and continued to believe that on balance he had done the right thing
