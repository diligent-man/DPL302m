Vaisheshika or Vaiśeṣika (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक) is one of the six schools of Indian philosophy (Vedic systems) from ancient India
In its early stages, the Vaiśeṣika was an independent philosophy with its own metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, and soteriology
Over time, the Vaiśeṣika system became similar in its philosophical procedures, ethical conclusions and soteriology to the Nyāya school of Hinduism, but retained its difference in epistemology and metaphysics.
The epistemology of the Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism, like Buddhism, accepted only two reliable means to knowledge: perception and inference
the Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.
The Vaisheshika school is known for its insights in naturalism
 It is a form of atomism in natural philosophy
It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to paramāṇu (atoms), and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence
Everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces
Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms which was later adapted in the Vaiśeṣika  school.
According to the Vaiśeṣika school, knowledge and liberation were achievable by a complete understanding of the world of experience.
Vaiśeṣika darshana was founded by Kaṇāda Kashyapa around the 6th to 2nd century BC.
Although the Vaisheshika system developed independently from the Nyaya school of Hinduism, the two became similar and are often studied together
In its classical form, however, the Vaishesika school differed from the Nyaya in one crucial respect: where Nyaya accepted four sources of valid knowledge, the Vaishesika accepted only two.
The epistemology of Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism accepted only two reliable means to knowledge – perception and inference.
Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism, that the reality is composed of five substances (examples are earth, water, air, fire, and space)
Each of these five are of two types, explains Ganeri,  (paramāṇu) and composite
A paramāṇu is that which is indestructible, indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu)
A composite is that which is divisible into paramāṇu
Whatever human beings perceive is composite, and even the smallest perceptible thing, namely, a fleck of dust, has parts, which are therefore invisible
The Vaiśeṣikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a “triad” (tryaṇuka) with three parts, each part with a “dyad” (dyaṇuka)
Vaiśeṣikas believed that a dyad has two parts, each of which is an atom
Size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of parmanus, their number and their spatial arrangements.
Parama means "most distant, remotest, extreme, last" and aṇu means "atom, very small particle", hence paramāṇu is essentially "the most distant or last small (i.e
smallest) particle".
Vaisheshika postulated that what one experiences is derived from dravya (substance: a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), guna (quality), karma (activity), samanya (commonness), vishesha (particularity) and samavaya (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).
Hinduism identifies six Pramāṇas as epistemically reliable means to accurate knowledge and to truths: Pratyakṣa (perception), Anumāna (inference), Upamāna (comparison and analogy), Arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), Anupalabdhi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and Śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts)
Of these Vaiśeṣika epistemology considered only pratyakṣa (perception) and anumāna (inference) as reliable means of valid knowledge
Nyaya school, related to Vaiśeṣika, accepts four out of these six.
Pratyakṣa (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception
It is of two types: external and internal
External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind
The ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism identify four requirements for correct perception: Indriyarthasannikarsa (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), Avyapadesya (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), Avyabhicara (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and Vyavasayatmaka (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe)
Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as pramāṇa and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars
The internal perception concepts included pratibha (intuition), samanyalaksanapratyaksa (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and jnanalaksanapratyaksa (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state)
Further, the texts considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from Pratyakṣa-pranama, so as to contrast nirnaya (definite judgment, conclusion) from anadhyavasaya (indefinite judgment).
Anumāna (अनुमान) means inference
It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason
Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of Anumana
In all except one Hindu philosophies, this is a valid and useful means to knowledge
The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: pratijna (hypothesis), hetu (a reason), and drshtanta (examples)
The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: sadhya (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and paksha (the object on which the sadhya is predicated)
The inference is conditionally true if sapaksha (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if vipaksha (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent
For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps
For example, they demand Vyapti - the requirement that the hetu (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both sapaksha and vipaksha
A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a nigamana (conclusion).The syllogism of the Vaiśeṣika school was similar to that of the Nyāya school of Hinduism, but the names given by Praśastapāda to the 5 members of syllogism are different.
The earliest systematic exposition of the Vaisheshika is found in the Vaiśeṣika Sūtra of Kaṇāda (or Kaṇabhaksha)
This treatise is divided into ten books
The two commentaries on the Vaiśeṣika Sūtra, Rāvaṇabhāṣya and Bhāradvājavṛtti are no more extant
Praśastapāda’s Padārthadharmasaṁgraha (c
4th century) is the next important work of this school
Though commonly known as bhāṣya of Vaiśeṣika Sūtra, this treatise is basically an independent work on the subject
The next Vaisheshika treatise, Candra’s Daśapadārthaśāstra (648) based on Praśastapāda’s treatise is available only in Chinese translation
The earliest commentary available on Praśastapāda’s treatise is Vyomaśiva’s Vyomavatī (8th century)
The other three commentaries are Śridhara’s Nyāyakandalī (991), Udayana’s Kiranāvali (10th century) and Śrivatsa’s Līlāvatī (11th century)
Śivāditya’s  Saptapadārthī which also belongs to the same period, presents the Nyāya and the  Vaiśeṣika principles as a part of one whole
Śaṁkara Miśra’s Upaskāra on Vaiśeṣika Sūtra is also an important work.
According to the Vaisheshika school, all things that exist, that can be cognized and named are padārthas (literal meaning: the meaning of a word), the objects of experience
All objects of experience can be classified into six categories, dravya (substance), guṇa (quality), karma (activity), sāmānya (generality),  viśeṣa (particularity) and samavāya (inherence)
Later Vaiśeṣikas (Śrīdhara and Udayana and Śivāditya) added one more category abhava (non-existence)
The first three categories are defined as artha (which can perceived) and they have real objective existence
The last three categories are defined as budhyapekṣam (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories.
Dravya (substance): The substances are conceived as 9 in number
They are, pṛthvī (earth), ap (water), tejas (fire), vāyu (air),  ākaśa (ether),  kāla (time), dik (space), ātman (self or soul) and manas (mind)
The first five are called bhūtas, the substances having some specific qualities so that they could be perceived by one or the other external senses.
Guṇa (quality): The Vaiśeṣika Sūtra mentions 17 guṇas (qualities), to which Praśastapāda added another 7
While a substance is capable of existing independently by itself, a guṇa (quality) cannot exist so
The original 17 guṇas (qualities) are, rūpa (colour), rasa (taste), gandha (smell), sparśa (touch), saṁkhyā (number),  parimāṇa  (size/dimension/quantity), pṛthaktva (individuality), saṁyoga (conjunction/accompaniments), vibhāga (disjunction), paratva (priority), aparatva (posteriority), buddhi (knowledge), sukha (pleasure), duḥkha (pain), icchā (desire),  dveṣa (aversion) and prayatna (effort)
To these Praśastapāda added gurutva (heaviness), dravatva (fluidity), sneha (viscosity), dharma (merit), adharma (demerit), śabda (sound) and saṁskāra (faculty).
Karma (activity): The karmas (activities) like guṇas (qualities) have no separate existence, they belong to the substances
But while a quality is a permanent feature of a substance, an activity is a transient one
Ākāśa (ether), kāla (time), dik (space) and ātman (self), though substances, are devoid of karma (activity).
Sāmānya (generality): Since there are plurality of substances, there will be relations among them
When a property is found common to many substances, it is called sāmānya.
Viśeṣa (particularity): By means of viśeṣa, we are able to perceive substances as different from one another
As the ultimate atoms are innumerable so are the viśeṣas.
Samavāya (inherence): Kaṇāda  defined samavāya as the relation between the cause and the effect
 Praśastapāda  defined it as the relationship existing between the substances that are inseparable, standing to one another in the relation of the container and the contained
The relation of samavāya is not perceivable but only inferable from the inseparable connection of the substances.According to the Vaiśeṣika school, the trasareṇu are the smallest mahat (perceivable) particles and defined as tryaṇukas (triads)
These are made of three parts, each of which are defined as dvyaṇuka (dyad)
The  dvyaṇukas are conceived as made of two parts, each of which are defined as paramāṇu (atom)
The paramāṇus (atoms) are indivisible and eternal, they can neither be created nor destroyed
Each paramāṇu (atom) possesses its own distinct viśeṣa (individuality) and have an inhering relation which is responsible for change and motion.
The measure of the partless atoms is known as parimaṇḍala parimāṇa
It is eternal and it cannot generate the measure of any other substance
Its measure is its own absolutely.
