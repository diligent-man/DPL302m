Vaisheshika or Vai e ika Sanskrit is one of the six schools of Indian philosophy Vedic systems from ancient India In its early stages the Vai e ika was an independent philosophy with its own metaphysics epistemology logic ethics and soteriology Over time the Vai e ika system became similar in its philosophical procedures ethical conclusions and soteriology to the Ny ya school of Hinduism but retained its difference in epistemology and metaphysics
The epistemology of the Vai e ika school of Hinduism like Buddhism accepted only two reliable means to knowledge perception and inference the Vai e ika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vai e ikas were the Vedas
The Vaisheshika school is known for its insights in naturalism It is a form of atomism in natural philosophy It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to param u atoms and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance a function of atoms their number and their spatial arrangements quality activity commonness particularity and inherence Everything was composed of atoms qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms which was later adapted in the Vai e ika school
According to the Vai e ika school knowledge and liberation were achievable by a complete understanding of the world of experience
Vai e ika darshana was founded by Ka da Kashyapa around the th to nd century BC
Although the Vaisheshika system developed independently from the Nyaya school of Hinduism the two became similar and are often studied together In its classical form however the Vaishesika school differed from the Nyaya in one crucial respect where Nyaya accepted four sources of valid knowledge the Vaishesika accepted only two
The epistemology of Vai e ika school of Hinduism accepted only two reliable means to knowledge perception and inference
Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism that the reality is composed of five substances examples are earth water air fire and space Each of these five are of two types explains Ganeri param u and composite A param u is that which is indestructible indivisible and has a special kind of dimension called small a u A composite is that which is divisible into param u Whatever human beings perceive is composite and even the smallest perceptible thing namely a fleck of dust has parts which are therefore invisible The Vai e ikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a triad trya uka with three parts each part with a dyad dya uka Vai e ikas believed that a dyad has two parts each of which is an atom Size form truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of parmanus their number and their spatial arrangements
Parama means most distant remotest extreme last and a u means atom very small particle hence param u is essentially the most distant or last small i e smallest particle
Vaisheshika postulated that what one experiences is derived from dravya substance a function of atoms their number and their spatial arrangements guna quality karma activity samanya commonness vishesha particularity and samavaya inherence inseparable connectedness of everything
Hinduism identifies six Pram as as epistemically reliable means to accurate knowledge and to truths Pratyak a perception Anum na inference Upam na comparison and analogy Arth patti postulation derivation from circumstances Anupalabdhi non perception negative cognitive proof and abda word testimony of past or present reliable experts Of these Vai e ika epistemology considered only pratyak a perception and anum na inference as reliable means of valid knowledge Nyaya school related to Vai e ika accepts four out of these six
Pratyak a means perception It is of two types external and internal External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense the mind The ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism identify four requirements for correct perception Indriyarthasannikarsa direct experience by one's sensory organ s with the object whatever is being studied Avyapadesya non verbal correct perception is not through hearsay according to ancient Indian scholars where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception Avyabhicara does not wander correct perception does not change nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting defective suspect and Vyavasayatmaka definite correct perception excludes judgments of doubt either because of one's failure to observe all the details or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe or not observing what one does not want to observe Some ancient scholars proposed unusual perception as pram a and called it internal perception a proposal contested by other Indian scholars The internal perception concepts included pratibha intuition samanyalaksanapratyaksa a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal and jnanalaksanapratyaksa a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state Further the texts considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from Pratyak a pranama so as to contrast nirnaya definite judgment conclusion from anadhyavasaya indefinite judgment
Anum na means inference It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of Anumana In all except one Hindu philosophies this is a valid and useful means to knowledge The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts pratijna hypothesis hetu a reason and drshtanta examples The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts state the ancient Indian scholars sadhya that idea which needs to proven or disproven and paksha the object on which the sadhya is predicated The inference is conditionally true if sapaksha positive examples as evidence are present and if vipaksha negative examples as counter evidence are absent For rigor the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps For example they demand Vyapti the requirement that the hetu reason must necessarily and separately account for the inference in all cases in both sapaksha and vipaksha A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a nigamana conclusion The syllogism of the Vai e ika school was similar to that of the Ny ya school of Hinduism but the names given by Pra astap da to the members of syllogism are different
The earliest systematic exposition of the Vaisheshika is found in the Vai e ika S tra of Ka da or Ka abhaksha This treatise is divided into ten books The two commentaries on the Vai e ika S tra R va abh ya and Bh radv jav tti are no more extant Pra astap da s Pad rthadharmasa graha c th century is the next important work of this school Though commonly known as bh ya of Vai e ika S tra this treatise is basically an independent work on the subject The next Vaisheshika treatise Candra s Da apad rtha stra based on Pra astap da s treatise is available only in Chinese translation The earliest commentary available on Pra astap da s treatise is Vyoma iva s Vyomavat th century The other three commentaries are ridhara s Ny yakandal Udayana s Kiran vali th century and rivatsa s L l vat th century iv ditya s Saptapad rth which also belongs to the same period presents the Ny ya and the Vai e ika principles as a part of one whole a kara Mi ra s Upask ra on Vai e ika S tra is also an important work
According to the Vaisheshika school all things that exist that can be cognized and named are pad rthas literal meaning the meaning of a word the objects of experience All objects of experience can be classified into six categories dravya substance gu a quality karma activity s m nya generality vi e a particularity and samav ya inherence Later Vai e ikas r dhara and Udayana and iv ditya added one more category abhava non existence The first three categories are defined as artha which can perceived and they have real objective existence The last three categories are defined as budhyapek am product of intellectual discrimination and they are logical categories
Dravya substance The substances are conceived as in number They are p thv earth ap water tejas fire v yu air ka a ether k la time dik space tman self or soul and manas mind The first five are called bh tas the substances having some specific qualities so that they could be perceived by one or the other external senses
Gu a quality The Vai e ika S tra mentions gu as qualities to which Pra astap da added another While a substance is capable of existing independently by itself a gu a quality cannot exist so The original gu as qualities are r pa colour rasa taste gandha smell spar a touch sa khy number parim a size dimension quantity p thaktva individuality sa yoga conjunction accompaniments vibh ga disjunction paratva priority aparatva posteriority buddhi knowledge sukha pleasure du kha pain icch desire dve a aversion and prayatna effort To these Pra astap da added gurutva heaviness dravatva fluidity sneha viscosity dharma merit adharma demerit abda sound and sa sk ra faculty
Karma activity The karmas activities like gu as qualities have no separate existence they belong to the substances But while a quality is a permanent feature of a substance an activity is a transient one k a ether k la time dik space and tman self though substances are devoid of karma activity
S m nya generality Since there are plurality of substances there will be relations among them When a property is found common to many substances it is called s m nya
Vi e a particularity By means of vi e a we are able to perceive substances as different from one another As the ultimate atoms are innumerable so are the vi e as
Samav ya inherence Ka da defined samav ya as the relation between the cause and the effect Pra astap da defined it as the relationship existing between the substances that are inseparable standing to one another in the relation of the container and the contained The relation of samav ya is not perceivable but only inferable from the inseparable connection of the substances According to the Vai e ika school the trasare u are the smallest mahat perceivable particles and defined as trya ukas triads These are made of three parts each of which are defined as dvya uka dyad The dvya ukas are conceived as made of two parts each of which are defined as param u atom The param us atoms are indivisible and eternal they can neither be created nor destroyed Each param u atom possesses its own distinct vi e a individuality and have an inhering relation which is responsible for change and motion
The measure of the partless atoms is known as parima ala parim a It is eternal and it cannot generate the measure of any other substance Its measure is its own absolutely
