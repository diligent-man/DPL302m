the national palace museum simplified chinese traditional chinese pinyin gu l g g ng b w yu n is a museum in taipei republic of china taiwan
established in in beijing it has a permanent collection of nearly pieces of chinese artifacts and artworks many of which were moved from the palace museum as well as five other institutions throughout mainland china during the roc retreat making it one of the largest of its type in the world
the museum s collection encompasses items spanning years of chinese history from the neolithic age to the modern period
most of the collection are high quality pieces collected by chinese emperors
the national palace museum shares its roots with the palace museum in the forbidden city of beijing whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts were built upon the imperial collections of the ming and qing dynasties
the national palace museum was originally established as the palace museum in the forbidden city on october shortly after the expulsion of puyi the last emperor of china from the forbidden city by warlord feng yuxiang
the articles in the museum consisted of the valuables of the former imperial family
in shortly after the mukden incident generalissimo chiang kai shek s nationalist government ordered the museum to make preparations to evacuate its most valuable pieces out of the city to prevent them from falling into the hands of the imperial japanese army
as a result from february to may the palace museum s crates and crates of objects from the exhibition office of ancient artifacts the summer palace and the imperial hanlin academy were moved in five groups to shanghai
in the collection was moved to nanking after the construction of the storage in the taoist monastery chaotian palace was complete
as the imperial japanese army advanced farther inland during the second sino japanese war which merged into the greater conflict of world war ii the collection was moved westward via three routes to several places including anshun and leshan until the surrender of japan in
in it was shipped back to the nanjing warehouse
the chinese civil war resumed following the surrender of the japanese ultimately resulting in generalissimo chiang kai shek s decision to evacuate the arts to taiwan which had been handed over to the roc in
when the fighting worsened in between the communist and nationalist armies the national beijing palace museum and other five institutions made the decision to send some of the most prized items to taiwan
hang li wu later director of the museum supervised the transport of some of the collection in three groups from nanking to the harbor in keelung taiwan between december and february
by the time the items arrived in taiwan the communist army had already seized control of the national beijing palace museum collection so not all of the collection could be sent to taiwan
a total of crates of artifacts from the forbidden city moved to taiwan accounted for only of the crates originally transported south although the pieces represented some of the very best of the collection
the collection from the national beijing palace museum the preparatory office of the national central museum the national central library and the national beiping library was stored in a railway warehouse in yangmei following transport across the taiwan strait and was later moved to storage in a cane sugar mill near taichung
in the executive yuan created the joint managerial office for the national beijing palace museum the preparatory office of the national central museum and the national central library to oversee the organization of the collection
for security reasons the joint managerial office chose the mountain village of beigou located in wufeng taichung as the new storage site for the collection
the following year the collection stored at the cane sugar mill was transported to the new site in beigou
with the national central library s reinstatement in the collection from the national beijing library was simultaneously incorporated into the national central library
the joint managerial office of the national beijing palace museum and the preparatory office of the national central museum stayed in beigou for another ten years
during the decade the office obtained a grant from the asia foundation to construct a small scale exhibition hall in the spring of
the exhibition hall opened in march was divided into four galleries in which it was possible to exhibit more than items
in the autumn of the office received a grant of nt million from aid
the republic of china roc government also contributed more than nt million to establish a special fund for the construction of a museum in the taipei suburb of waishuanxi
the construction of the museum in waishuanxi was completed in august

since then the museum in taipei has managed conserved and exhibited the collections of the national beiping palace museum and the preparatory office of the national central museum
during the s and s the national palace museum was used by the kuomintang to support its claim that the republic of china was the sole legitimate government of all china in that it was the sole preserver of traditional chinese culture amid social change and the cultural revolution in mainland china and tended to emphasize chinese nationalism
the people s republic of china prc government has long said that the collection was stolen and that it legitimately belongs in china but taiwan has defended its collection as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction especially during the cultural revolution
however relations regarding this treasure have warmed in recent years and the palace museum in beijing has agreed to lend relics to the national palace museum for exhibitions since
the palace museum curator zheng xinmiao has said that the artifacts in both mainland and taiwan museums are china s cultural heritage jointly owned by people across the taiwan strait

among the artifacts were a white marble tablet from the tang dynasty gold nails and bands made out of metal
it was not until after ma died that his wife went to taiwan in from america to bring the artifacts to chiang kai shek who turned them over to the national palace museum
