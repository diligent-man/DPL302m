the steel helmet confronts american racism when a north korean communist prisoner baits a black soldier in conversation with accounts of american society s jim crow rules
moreover the korean soldier makes the first ever mention in a hollywood film of the internment of japanese americans in world war ii
the film infuriated the military who had provided assistance in the form of military stock footage
army personnel summoned fuller for a conference on the film
the u s
army was upset over zack s shooting of a prisoner of war
fuller replied that in his world war ii service it frequently happened and had his former commanding officer brigadier general george a
taylor telephone the pentagon to confirm it
the communist newspaper the daily worker condemned the steel helmet as a right wing fantasy
fuller cast gene evans refusing a major studio s interest in filming the steel helmet with john wayne as sergeant zack
fuller threatened to quit when the producers wanted evans replaced by larry parks
mickey knox claimed to have been fuller s first choice for zack but he turned the film down
the steel helmet was met with critical acclaim with much praise going to fuller s directing
the film has a perfect rating of on rotten tomatoes based on reviews
bosley crowther of the new york times opened his review by stating for an obviously low budget picture that was shot in a phenomenally short time samuel fuller s metallic the steel helmet has some surprisingly good points crowther praised fuller for having sidestepped the romantic war clich s and making a good effort to create something like the reported climate of the korean war but did fault the staging and sets as patently artificial
the reviewer at variety magazine wrote of the film the steel helmet pinpoints the korean fighting in a grim hardhitting tale that is excellently told and went on to say that it also serves to introduce gene evans as the sergeant a vet of world war ii a tough man who is interested in staying alive and hardened to the impact of warfare
robert hutton conscientious objector in the last war but now willing to fight against communism steve brodie the lieutenant who used pull to stay out of combat previously james edwards the negro medic and richard loo a heroic nisei are the other principals who add to the rugged realism
harrison s reports wrote that the film was destined to take its place among the best war pictures ever produced
it has been directed by samuel fuller so skillfully that the spectator s attention is held in a vise from the beginning to the end
john mccarten of the new yorker was less enthusiastic about the film than most other critics deeming it no better and no worse than the usual hollywood treatment of such matters the monthly film bulletin in the uk was also dismissive calling it inevitably a rough job
much of the film bears evidence of having been shot in the studio and the jungle sequences in particular fail to ring true
among more recent assessments dave kehr of the chicago reader wrote that sam fuller s first major accomplishment is a grim piece of agitprop set in the korean war where a battle worn american sergeant gene evans forms a survival pact with a korean orphan
fuller s powerful direction turns a trite story into a vivid study of national and personal identity in jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader included the film in his unranked list of the best american films not included on the afi top
the critics of time out magazine said the film is a characteristically hard hitting war movie from fuller charting the fortunes of gene evans sergeant zack sole survivor of a pow massacre in korea
saved by a korean orphan and joining up with other gis cut off from their units evans cynical veteran embodies the writer director s abiding thesis that to survive the madness of war a ruthless individualism is necessary
fuller glamorises neither his loner protagonist nor the war itself if he clearly supports the us presence in korea battle is still a chaotic deadly affair and nobody has much idea of why they fight
the action scenes are terrific belying the movie s very low budget
leonard maltin of turner classic movies online in his glowing review awarded the film with out of stars and said samuel fuller
gene evans robert hutton steve brodie james edwards richard loo sid melton
evans is a gutsy american sergeant caught in dizzying turn of events in early days of korean war it s a solid melodrama written by fuller with surprisingly contemporary view of war itself sean axmaker also of turner classic movies online wrote that the steel helmet is the first american film about the korean war and one of the greatest war films ever made
