A US Army unit surrenders to the North Koreans they are then bound and summarily executed Only Sergeant Zack survives the massacre saved when the bullet meant for him is deflected by his helmet He is freed by a South Korean orphan who he dubs Short Round who tags along despite Zack's annoyance Short Round confronts American racial attitudes when he demands that Zack refer to him as South Korean not a gook
They come across Corporal Thompson a black th Infantry medic and also the sole survivor of his platoon Then they encounter a patrol led by inexperienced Lieutenant Driscoll The racial angle arises when white soldiers suggest that the black medic was a deserter But soon after a battlefield emergency demands interracial unity when the men are pinned down by snipers Together Zack and Sergeant Tanaka dispatch the snipers Zack reluctantly agrees to help the unit establish an observation post at a Buddhist temple One GI is shortly thereafter killed by a booby trap
They reach the apparently deserted temple without further incident but Joe is killed that night by a North Korean major hiding there The officer is eventually captured He tries without success to subvert first Thompson then Tanaka by pointing out the racism they face in s America Sergeant Zack prepares to take his prize back for questioning cynically looking forward to a furlough as a reward Before he leaves Driscoll asks to exchange helmets for luck but Zack turns him down Then Short Round is killed by another sniper After the major mocks the wish the boy had written down a prayer to Buddha to have Zack like him Zack loses control and shoots the prisoner who dies soon after
Then the unit spots the North Koreans on the move and calls down devastating artillery strikes When the enemy realize the artillery is being directed from the temple they attack in large numbers supported by a tank The attack is repelled but only Zack Tanaka Thompson and the radio operator survive When they are relieved Zack responds to the question What outfit are you with the statement US infantry As they leave the temple Zack goes to Driscoll's grave and exchanges his helmet with the one marking the man's grave

The Steel Helmet was met with critical acclaim with much praise going to Fuller's directing The film has a perfect rating of on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews
Bosley Crowther of The New York Times opened his review by stating For an obviously low budget picture that was shot in a phenomenally short time Samuel Fuller's metallic The Steel Helmet has some surprisingly good points Crowther praised Fuller for having sidestepped the romantic war clich√©s and making a good effort to create something like the reported climate of the Korean War but did fault the staging and sets as patently artificial
The reviewer at Variety magazine wrote of the film The Steel Helmet pinpoints the Korean fighting in a grim hardhitting tale that is excellently told and went on to say that it also serves to introduce Gene Evans as the sergeant a vet of World War II a tough man who is interested in staying alive and hardened to the impact of warfare Robert Hutton conscientious objector in the last war but now willing to fight against communism Steve Brodie the lieutenant who used pull to stay out of combat previously James Edwards the Negro medic and Richard Loo a heroic Nisei are the other principals who add to the rugged realism
Harrison's Reports wrote that the film was destined to take its place among the best war pictures ever produced It has been directed by Samuel Fuller so skillfully that the spectator's attention is held in a vise from the beginning to the end
John McCarten of The New Yorker was less enthusiastic about the film than most other critics deeming it no better and no worse than the usual Hollywood treatment of such matters The Monthly Film Bulletin in the UK was also dismissive calling it inevitably a rough job Much of the film bears evidence of having been shot in the studio and the jungle sequences in particular fail to ring true
Among more recent assessments Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote that Sam Fuller's first major accomplishment is a grim piece of agitprop set in the Korean War where a battle worn American sergeant Gene Evans forms a survival pact with a Korean orphan Fuller's powerful direction turns a trite story into a vivid study of national and personal identity In Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top
The critics of Time Out magazine said the film is A characteristically hard hitting war movie from Fuller charting the fortunes of Gene Evans' Sergeant Zack sole survivor of a POW massacre in Korea Saved by a Korean orphan and joining up with other GIs cut off from their units Evans' cynical veteran embodies the writer director's abiding thesis that to survive the madness of war a ruthless individualism is necessary Fuller glamorises neither his loner protagonist nor the war itself if he clearly supports the US presence in Korea battle is still a chaotic deadly affair and nobody has much idea of why they fight The action scenes are terrific belying the movie's very low budget
Leonard Maltin of Turner Classic Movies Online in his glowing review awarded the film with out of stars and said Samuel Fuller Gene Evans Robert Hutton Steve Brodie James Edwards Richard Loo Sid Melton Evans is a gutsy American sergeant caught in dizzying turn of events in early days of Korean war it's a solid melodrama written by Fuller with surprisingly contemporary view of war itself Sean Axmaker also of Turner Classic Movies Online wrote that The Steel Helmet is The first American film about the Korean War and one of the greatest war films ever made
