reuters has a policy of taking a value neutral approach which extends to not using the word terrorist in its stories
the practice attracted criticism following the september attacks
reuters editorial policy states reuters may refer without attribution to terrorism and counterterrorism in general but do not refer to specific events as terrorism
nor does reuters use the word terrorist without attribution to qualify specific individuals groups or events by contrast the associated press does use the term terrorist in reference to non governmental organizations who carry out attacks on civilian populations

there has been no change in our editorial policy
subsequently climate blogger joe romm cited a reuters article on climate as employing false balance and quoted dr
stefan rahmstorf co chair of earth system analysis at the potsdam institute that s imply a lot of unrelated climate sceptics nonsense has been added to this reuters piece
in the words of the late steve schneider this is like adding some nonsense from the flat earth society to a report about the latest generation of telecommunication satellites
it is absurd romm opined we can t know for certain who insisted on cramming this absurd and non germane climate sceptics nonsense into the piece but we have a strong clue
if it had been part of the reporter s original reporting you would have expected direct quotes from actual sceptics because that is journalism
the fact that the blather was all inserted without attribution suggests it was added at the insistence of an editor
according to ynetnews reuters was accused of bias against israel in its coverage of the israel lebanon conflict after the wire service used two doctored photos by a lebanese freelance photographer adnan hajj

in march the brazilian affiliate of reuters released a excerpt from an interview with brazilian ex president fernando henrique cardoso about the ongoing petrobras scandal

attached was a comment between parenthesis podemos tirar se achar melhor we can take it out if you think better which was removed from the current version of the text
this had the effect of confusing readers and suggests that the former president was involved in corruption and the comment was attributed to him

in november the uk foreign office released archive documents confirming that it had provided funding to reuters during the s and s so that reuters could expand its coverage in the middle east
an agreement was made between the information research department ird and reuters for the uk treasury to provide over years to fund reuters expansion
the uk government had already been funding the latin american department of reuters through a shell company however this method was discounted for the middle east operation due to the accounting of the shell company looking suspicious with the ird stating that the company already looks queer to anyone who might wish to investigate why such an inactive and unprofitable company continues to run instead the bbc was used to fund the project by paying for enhanced subscriptions to the news organisation for which the treasury would reimburse the bbc at a later date
the ird acknowledged that this agreement would not give them editorial control over reuters although the ird believed it would give them political influence over reuters work stating this influence would flow at the top level from reuters willingness to consult and to listen to views expressed on the results of its work
