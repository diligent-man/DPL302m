the anti globalization movement or counter globalization movement is a social movement critical of economic globalization
the movement is also commonly referred to as the global justice movement alter globalization movement anti globalist movement anti corporate globalization movement or movement against neoliberal globalization
there are many definitions of anti globalization
participants base their criticisms on a number of related ideas
what is shared is that participants oppose large multinational corporations having unregulated political power exercised through trade agreements and deregulated financial markets
specifically corporations are accused of seeking to maximize profit at the expense of work safety conditions and standards labour hiring and compensation standards environmental conservation principles and the integrity of national legislative authority independence and sovereignty
as of january some commentators have characterized changes in the global economy as turbo capitalism edward luttwak market fundamentalism george soros casino capitalism susan strange and as mcworld benjamin barber
supporters believe that by the late th century those they characterized as ruling elites sought to harness the expansion of world markets for their own interests this combination of the bretton woods institutions states and multinational corporations has been called globalization or globalization from above in reaction various social movements emerged to challenge their influence these movements have been called anti globalization or globalization from below
people opposing globalization believe that international agreements and global financial institutions such as the international monetary fund imf and the world trade organization undermine local decision making
corporations that use these institutions to support their own corporate and financial interests can exercise privileges that individuals and small businesses cannot including the ability to
move freely across borders
extract desired natural resources
use a wide variety of human resourcesthe movement aims for an end to the legal status of corporate personhood and the dissolution of free market fundamentalism and the radical economic privatization measures of the world bank the imf and the world trade organization
activists are especially opposed to the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by globalization and the international institutions that they say promote neoliberalism without regard to ethical standards or environmental protection
common targets include the world bank wb international monetary fund imf the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd and the world trade organization wto and free trade treaties like the united states mexico canada agreement usmca free trade area of the americas ftaa the trans pacific trade agreement tppa the multilateral agreement on investment mai and the general agreement on trade in services gats
in light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries adherents of the movement claim that free trade without measures to protect the environment and the health and wellbeing of workers will merely increase the power of industrialized nations often termed the north in opposition to the developing world s south
proponents of this line of thought refer to the process as polarization and argue that current neo liberal economic policies have given wealthier states an advantage over developing nations enabling their exploitation and leading to a widening of the global wealth gap
a report by jean ziegler un special rapporteur on the right to food notes that millions of farmers are losing their livelihoods in the developing countries but small farmers in the northern countries are also suffering and concludes that the current inequities of the global trading system are being perpetuated rather than resolved under the wto given the unequal balance of power between member countries activists point to the unequal footing and power between developed and developing nations within the wto and with respect to global trade most specifically in relation to the protectionist policies towards agriculture enacted in many developed countries
these activists also point out that heavy subsidization of developed nations agriculture and the aggressive use of export subsidies by some developed nations to make their agricultural products more attractive on the international market are major causes of declines in the agricultural sectors of many developing nations
through the internet a movement began to develop in opposition to the doctrines of neoliberalism which were widely manifested in the s when the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd proposed liberalization of cross border investment and trade restrictions through its multilateral agreement on investment mai
this treaty was prematurely exposed to public scrutiny and subsequently abandoned in november in the face of strenuous protest and criticism by national and international civil society representatives
the neoliberal position argued that free trade and reduction of public sector regulation would bring benefits to poor countries and to disadvantaged people in rich countries
anti globalization advocates urge that preservation of the natural environment human rights especially workplace rights and conditions and democratic institutions are likely to be placed at undue risk by globalization unless mandatory standards are attached to liberalization
noam chomsky stated in that
by many parts of the movement showed wide opposition to the impending invasion of iraq
many participants were among those million or more protesters that on the weekend of february participated in global protests against the imminent iraq war
other anti war demonstrations were organized by the antiglobalization movement see for example the large demonstration organized against the impending war in iraq which closed the first european social forum in november in florence italy
anti globalization militants worried for a proper functioning of democratic institutions as the leaders of many democratic countries spain italy poland and the united kingdom were acting against the wishes of the majorities of their populations in supporting the war
chomsky asserted that these leaders showed their contempt for democracy
critics of this type of argument have tended to point out that this is just a standard criticism of representative democracy a democratically elected government will not always act in the direction of greatest current public support and that therefore there is no inconsistency in the leaders positions given that these countries are parliamentary democracies
the economic and military issues are closely linked in the eyes of many within the movement
the movement has no singular name chiefly because it has no singular leader or consensus to give it one
it has been called a variety of names based on its general advocation for social change justice and radical activism and its general opposition to capitalism neoliberalism and corporate globalization
activists also resisted using a name conferred by corporate media to smear the intention of their protests
some activists were also not necessarily against globalization
many participants see noam chomsky s quotes above consider the term anti globalization to be a misnomer
the term suggests that its followers support protectionism and or nationalism which is not always the case in fact some supporters of anti globalization are strong opponents of both nationalism and protectionism for example the no border network argues for unrestricted migration and the abolition of all national border controls
hamed hosseini an australian sociologist and expert in global social movement studies argues that the term anti globalization can be ideal typically used only to refer to only one ideological vision he detects alongside three other visions the anti globalist the alter globalist and the alter globalization
he argues that the three latter ideal typical visions can be categorized under the title of global justice movement
according to him while the first two visions the alter globalism and the anti globalism represent the reconstructed forms of old and new left ideologies respectively in the context of current globalization only the third one has shown the capacity to respond more effectively to the intellectual requirements of today s global complexities
underlying this vision is a new conception of justice coined accommodative justice by hosseini a new approach towards cosmopolitanism transversal cosmopolitanism a new mode of activist knowledge accommodative consciousness and a new format of solidarity interactive solidarity
some activists notably david graeber see the movement as opposed instead to neoliberalism or corporate globalization
he argues that the term anti globalization is a term coined by the media and that radical activists are actually more in favor of globalization in the sense of effacement of borders and the free movement of people possessions and ideas than are the imf or wto
he also notes that activists use the terms globalization movement and anti globalization movement interchangeably indicating the confusion of the terminology
the term alter globalization has been used to make this distinction clear
while the term anti globalization arose from the movement s opposition to free trade agreements which have often been considered part of something called globalization various participants contend they are opposed to only certain aspects of globalization and instead describe themselves at least in french speaking organizations as anti capitalist anti plutocracy or anti corporate le monde diplomatique s editor ignacio ramonet s expression of the one way thought pens e unique became slang against neoliberal policies and the washington consensus
the term anti globalization does not distinguish the international leftist anti globalization position from a strictly nationalist anti globalization position
many nationalist movements such as the french national front austrian freedom party the italian lega nord the greek golden dawn or the national democratic party of germany are opposed to globalization but argue that the alternative to globalization is the protection of the nation state
other groups influenced by the third position are also classifiable as anti globalization
however their overall world view is rejected by groups such as peoples global action and anti fascist movements such as antifa
in response the nationalist movements against globalization argue that the leftist anti globalization position is actually support for alter globalization
several influential critical works have inspired the anti globalization movement
no logo the book by the canadian journalist naomi klein who criticized the production practices of multinational corporations and the omnipresence of brand driven marketing in popular culture has become manifesto of the movement presenting in a simple way themes more accurately developed in other works
in india some intellectual references of the movement can be found in the works of vandana shiva an ecologist and feminist who in her book biopiracy documents the way that the natural capital of indigenous peoples and ecoregions is converted into forms of intellectual capital which are then recognized as exclusive commercial property without sharing the private utility thus derived
the writer arundhati roy is famous for her anti nuclear position and her activism against india s massive hydroelectric dam project sponsored by the world bank
in france the well known monthly paper le monde diplomatique has advocated the antiglobalization cause and an editorial of its director ignacio ramonet brought about the foundation of the association attac
susan george of the transnational institute has also been a long term influence on the movement as the writer of books since on hunger debt international financial institutions and capitalism
the works of jean ziegler christopher chase dunn and immanuel wallerstein have detailed underdevelopment and dependence in a world ruled by the capitalist system
pacifist and anti imperialist traditions have strongly influenced the movement
critics of united states foreign policy such as noam chomsky susan sontag and anti globalist pranksters the yes men are widely accepted inside the movement
although they may not recognize themselves as antiglobalists and are pro capitalism some economists who don t share the neoliberal approach of international economic institutions have strongly influenced the movement
amartya sen s development as freedom nobel prize in economics argues that third world development must be understood as the expansion of human capability not simply the increase in national income per capita and thus requires policies attuned to health and education not simply gdp
james tobin s winner of the nobel prize in economics proposal for a tax on financial transactions called after him the tobin tax has become part of the agenda of the movement
also george soros joseph e
stiglitz another economic sciences nobel prize winner formerly of the world bank author of globalization and its discontents and david korten have made arguments for drastically improving transparency for debt relief land reform and restructuring corporate accountability systems
korten and stiglitz s contribution to the movement include involvement in direct actions and street protest
in some roman catholic countries such as italy there have been religious influences especially from missionaries who have spent a long time in the third world the most famous being alex zanotelli
internet sources and free information websites such as indymedia are a means of diffusion of the movement s ideas
the vast array of material on spiritual movements anarchism libertarian socialism and the green movement that is now available on the internet has been perhaps more influential than any printed book
although over the past years more emphasis has been given to the construction of grassroots alternatives to capitalist globalization the movement s largest and most visible mode of organizing remains mass decentralized campaigns of direct action and civil disobedience
this mode of organizing sometimes under the banner of the peoples global action network tries to tie the many disparate causes together into one global struggle
in many ways the process of organizing matters overall can be more important to activists than the avowed goals or achievements of any component of the movement
at corporate summits the stated goal of most demonstrations is to stop the proceedings
although the demonstrations rarely succeed in more than delaying or inconveniencing the actual summits this motivates the mobilizations and gives them a visible short term purpose
this form of publicity is expensive in police time and the public purse
rioting has occurred at some protests for instance in genoa seattle and london and extensive damage was done to the area especially targeting corporations including mcdonald s and starbucks restaurants
despite or perhaps because of the lack of formal coordinating bodies the movement manages to successfully organize large protests on a global basis using information technology to spread information and organize
protesters organize themselves into affinity groups typically non hierarchical groups of people who live close together and share a common political goal
affinity groups will then send representatives to planning meetings
however because these groups can be infiltrated by law enforcement intelligence important plans of the protests are often not made until the last minute
one common tactic of the protests is to split up based on willingness to break the law
this is designed with varying success to protect the risk averse from the physical and legal dangers posed by confrontations with law enforcement
for example in prague during the anti imf and world bank protests in september demonstrators split into three distinct groups approaching the conference center from three directions one engaging in various forms of civil disobedience the yellow march one the pink silver march advancing through tactical frivolity costume dance theatre music and artwork and one the blue march engaging in violent conflicts with the baton armed police with the protesters throwing cobblestones lifted from the street
these demonstrations come to resemble small societies in themselves
many protesters take training in first aid and act as medics to other injured protesters
in the us some organizations like the national lawyer s guild and to a lesser extent the american civil liberties union provide legal witnesses in case of law enforcement confrontation
protesters often claim that major media outlets do not properly report on them therefore some of them created the independent media center a collective of protesters reporting on the actions as they happen

the western cape anti eviction campaign in south africathe annual meetings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank that took place in west berlin in saw strong protests that can be categorized as a precursor of the anti globalization movement
one of the main and failed objectives as it was to be so many times in the future was to derail the meetings
a counter summit against g was organized in paris in july
the event was called a suffit comme a that is enough and principally aimed at cancelling the debt contracted by southern countries
a demonstration gathered people and an important concert was held in la bastille square with people
it was the first anti g event fourteen years before that of washington
the main political consequence was that france took position to favor debt cancellation
the th anniversary of the imf and the world bank which was celebrated in madrid in october was the scene of a protest by an ad hoc coalition of what would later be called anti globalization movements
starting from the mid s annual meetings of the imf and the world bank group have become center points for anti globalization movement protests
they tried to drown the bankers parties in noise from outside and held other public forms of protest under the motto years is enough
while spanish king juan carlos was addressing the participants in a huge exhibition hall two greenpeace activists climbed to the top and showered the attendants with fake dollar bills carrying the slogan no s for ozone layer destruction
a number of the demonstrators were sent to the notorious carabanchel prison
one of the first international anti globalization protests was organized in dozens of cities around the world on june with those in london and eugene oregon most often noted
the drive was called the carnival against capital or j for short
the day coincided with the th g summit in cologne germany
the protest in eugene turned into a riot where local anarchists drove police out of a small park
one anarchist robert thaxton was arrested and convicted of throwing a rock at a police officer
the second major mobilization of the movement known as n occurred on november when protesters blocked delegates entrance to wto meetings in seattle washington usa
the protests forced the cancellation of the opening ceremonies and lasted the length of the meeting until december
there was a large permitted march by members of the afl cio and other unauthorized marches by assorted affinity groups who converged around the convention center
the protesters and seattle riot police clashed in the streets after police fired tear gas at demonstrators who blocked the streets and refused to disperse
over protesters were arrested and thousands were injured
three policemen were injured by friendly fire and one by a thrown rock
some protesters destroyed the windows of storefronts of businesses owned or franchised by targeted corporations such as a large nike shop and many starbucks windows
the mayor put the city under the municipal equivalent of martial law and declared a curfew
as of the city of seattle had paid over in settlements of lawsuits filed against the seattle police department for assault and wrongful arrest with a class action lawsuit still pending
in april around to protesters demonstrated at the imf and world bank meeting official numbers are not tallied
international forum on globalization ifg held training at foundry united methodist church
police raided the convergence center which was the staging warehouse and activists meeting hall on florida avenue on april
the day before the larger protest scheduled on april a smaller group of protesters demonstration against the prison industrial complex in the district of columbia
mass arrests were conducted people were arrested on april
three time pulitzer prize winning the washington post photographer carol guzy was detained by police and arrested on april and two journalists for the associated press also reported being struck by police with batons
on april and the demonstrations and street actions around the imf that followed the number of those arrested grew to people
a class action lawsuit was filed for false arrest
in june the class action suit for the april events called becker et al
district of columbia et al were settled with million damages awarded
in september estimated number of to people gathered to demonstrate against the annual meetings of imf and world bank in the streets of washington d c
protesting groups included the anti capitalist convergence the mobilization for global justice
people were reported arrested five were charged with destruction of property while the others were charged with parading without a permit or failing to obey police orders to disperse
at least reporters were in the round up
protestors sued in federal court about the arrests
the d c
attorney general had outside counsel investigate apparent destruction of evidence and forensic investigations continue and the testimony of the chief of police
in the city agreed to pay million to almost protesters and bystanders to end a class action lawsuit over kettling and mass arrests in pershing park during world bank protests
although local police were surprised by the size of n law enforcement agencies have since reacted worldwide to prevent the disruption of future events by a variety of tactics including sheer weight of numbers infiltrating the groups to determine their plans and preparations for the use of force to remove protesters
at the site of some of the protests police have used tear gas pepper spray concussion grenades rubber and wooden bullets night sticks water cannons dogs and horses to repel the protesters
after the november g protest in montreal at which many protesters were beaten trampled and arrested in what was intended to be a festive protest the tactic of dividing protests into green permitted yellow not officially permitted but with little confrontation and low risk of arrest and red involving direct confrontation zones was introduced
in quebec city municipal officials built a metre ft high wall around the portion of the city where the summit of the americas was being held which only residents delegates to the summit and certain accredited journalists were allowed to pass through
on june and a strong demonstration took place in g teborg during the meeting of the european council in the swedish city
clashes between police and protesters were exacerbated by the numerous vandalism of the extreme fringes of the demonstrators the so called black blocs
images of devastation bounced through the mass media putting a negative shadow on the movement and increasing a sense of fear through common people
the genoa group of eight summit protest from july to was one of the bloodiest protests in western europe s recent history as evidenced by the wounding of hundreds of policemen and civilians forced to lock themselves inside of their homes and the death of a young genoese anarchist named carlo giuliani who was shot while trying to throw a fire extinguisher on a policeman during two days of violence and rioting by groups supported by the nonchalance of more consistent and peaceful masses of protesters and the hospitalization of several of those peaceful demonstrators just mentioned
police have subsequently been accused of brutality torture and interference with the non violent protests as a collateral damage provoked by the clash between the law enforcement ranks themselves and the more violent and brutal fringes of protesters who repeatedly hid themselves amongst peaceful protesters of all ages and backgrounds
several hundred peaceful demonstrators rioters and police were injured and hundreds were arrested during the days surrounding the g meeting most of those arrested have been charged with some form of criminal association under italy s anti mafia and anti terrorist laws
the first world social forum wsf in was an initiative of oded grajew pt chico whitaker and bernard cassen
it was supported by the city of porto alegre where it took place and the brazilian worker s party
the motivation was to constitute a counter event to the world economic forum held in davos at the same time
the slogan of the wsf is another world is possible
an international council ic was set up to discuss and decide major issues regarding the wsf while the local organizing committee in the host city is responsible for the practical preparations of the event
in june the ic adopted the world social forum charter of principles which provides a framework for international national and local social forums worldwide
the wsf became a periodic meeting in and it was held again in porto alegre and became a rallying point for worldwide protest against the american invasion of iraq
in it was moved to mumbai india to make it more accessible to the populations of asia and africa
this forum had delegates
in it was held in three cities caracas venezuela bamako mali and karachi pakistan
in the forum was hosted in nairobi kenya in it was in bel m brazil and in it was in dakar senegal
in the wsf returned to porto alegre
the idea of creating a meeting place for organizations and individuals opposed to neoliberalism was soon replicated elsewhere
the first european social forum esf was held in november in florence
the slogan was against the war against racism and against neo liberalism
it saw the participation of delegates and ended with a huge demonstration against the war people according to the organizers
the following esfs took place in paris london athens malm and the latest esf in istanbul
in many countries social forums of national and local scope were also held
recently there has been some discussion behind the movement about the role of the social forums
some see them as a popular university an occasion to make many people aware of the problems of globalization
others would prefer that delegates concentrate their efforts on the coordination and organization of the movement and on the planning of new campaigns
however it has often been argued that in the dominated countries most of the world the wsf is little more than an ngo fair driven by northern ngos and donors most of which are hostile to popular movements of the poor
after the second world war north korea followed a policy of anti globalization
however in recent decades have shown a distinctive rise in globalization movements in north korea
north korea introduced a number of reforms in areas such as technology and trade
the reform that had the most significance to north korea was trade
north korea saw a change in trading partnerships
they now not only traded with themselves but also with south korea and china
north korea introduced these reforms because they were lacking in areas of technology and trade and they realized that they could not maintain themselves as a society without help from other nations
but even with these new reforms north korea still remains the most isolated society in the world
the global justice movement has been quite successful in achieving some of its key aims according to academic and global justice movement activist david graeber
for example many countries no longer rely on imf loans and so by the mid s imf lending was at its lowest share of world gdp since the s
the anti globalization movement has been criticized by politicians members of conservative think tanks and many mainstream economists
critics assert that the empirical evidence does not support the views of the anti globalization movement
these critics point to statistical trends which are interpreted to be results of globalization capitalism and the economic growth they encourage
there has been an absolute decrease in the percentage of people in developing countries living below per day in east asia adjusted for inflation and purchasing power
sub saharan africa as an area that felt the consequences of poor governance and was less responsive to globalization has seen an increase in poverty while all other areas of the world have seen no change in rates
the world income per head has increased by more over period than during any other period on the record
the increase in universal suffrage from no nations in to of all nations in
there are similar trends for electric power cars radios and telephones per capita as well as the percentage of the population with access to clean water however billion of the world s population in lacked access to proper sanitation and billions of people around in people still live without clean drinking water as of members of the anti globalization movement argue that positive data from countries which largely ignored neoliberal prescriptions notably china discredits the evidence that pro globalists present
concerning the parameter of per capita income growth development economist ha joon chang argues that considering the record of the last two decades the argument for continuing neoliberal policy prescriptions are simply untenable and commented it depends on the data we use but roughly speaking per capita income in developing countries grew at per year between and but has grown only at about between and
and even this will be reduced to if we take out india and china which have not pursued liberal trade and industrial policies recommended by the developed countries economist and political scientist mark pennington and nyu professor of economics william easterly have individually accused chang of employing strawman arguments ignoring counter data and failing to employ basic scientific controls to his claims
economist jagdish bhagwati argues that reforms that opened up the economies of china and india contributed to their higher growth in s and s
from to their gdp grew at average rate of and percent respectively
this was accompanied by reduction of poverty from percent in to percent in in china and from percent in to percent in in india
speaking not only on china but east asia in general economist joseph stiglitz commented the countries that have managed globalization on their own such as those in east asia have by and large ensured that they reaped huge benefits and that those benefits were equitably shared they were able substantially to control the terms on which they engaged with the global economy
by contrast the countries that have by and large had globalization managed for them by the international monetary fund and other international economic institutions have not done so well according to the heritage foundation development in china was anticipated by milton friedman who predicted that even a small progress towards economic liberalization would produce dramatic and positive effects
china s economy had grown together with its economic freedom
critics of corporate led globalization have expressed concern about the methodology used in arriving at the world bank s statistics and argue that more detailed variables measuring poverty should be studied
according to the center for economic and policy research the period from to has seen diminished progress in terms of economic growth life expectancy infant and child mortality and to a lesser extent education
one of the most common criticisms of the movement which does not necessarily come from its opponents is simply that the anti globalization movement lacks coherent goals and that the views of different protesters are often in opposition to each other
many members of the movement are also aware of this and argue that as long as they have a common opponent they should march together even if they don t share exactly the same political vision
writers michael hardt and antonio negri have together in their books empire and multitude expanded on this idea of a disunified multitude humans coming together for shared causes but lacking the complete sameness of the notion of the people
one argument often made by the opponents of the anti globalization movement especially by the economist is that one of the major causes of poverty amongst third world farmers are the trade barriers put up by rich nations and poor nations alike
the wto is an organization set up to work towards removing those trade barriers
therefore it is argued people really concerned about the plight of the third world should actually be encouraging free trade rather than attempting to fight it
specifically commodities such as sugar are heavily distorted by subsidies on behalf of powerful economies the united states europe and japan which have a disproportionate influence in the wto
as a result producers in these countries often receive two to three times the world market price
as amani elobeid and john beghin note the world price might decline by as much as by baselines were these distortions to be removed
many supporters of globalization think that policies different from those of today should be pursued although not necessarily those advocated by the anti globalization movement
for example some see the world bank and the imf as corrupt bureaucracies which have given repeated loans to dictators who never do any reforms
some like hernando de soto argue that much of the poverty in the third world countries is caused by the lack of western systems of laws and well defined and universally recognized property rights
de soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth
critics have asserted that people from poor and developing countries have been relatively accepting and supportive of globalization while the strongest opposition to globalization has come from activists unions and ngos in wealthier developed countries
alan shipman author of the globalization myth accuses the anti globalization movement of defusing the western class war by shifting alienation and exploitation to developing country sweatshops he later goes on to claim that the anti globalization movement has failed to attract widespread support from poor and working people from the developing nations and that its strongest and most uncomprehending critics had always been the workers whose liberation from employment they were trying to secure
these critics assert that people from the third world see the anti globalization movement as a threat to their jobs wages consuming options and livelihoods and that a cessation or reversal of globalization would result in many people in poor countries being left in greater poverty
jes s f
reyes heroles the former mexican ambassador to the us stated that in a poor country like ours the alternative to low paid jobs isn t well paid ones it s no jobs at all
egypt s ambassador to the un has also stated the question is why all of a sudden when third world labor has proved to be competitive why do industrial countries start feeling concerned about our workers when all of a sudden there is a concern about the welfare of our workers it is suspicious
on the other hand there have been notable protests against certain globalization policies by workers in developing nations as in the cause of indian farmers protesting against patenting seeds
in the last few years many developing countries esp
in latin america and caribbean created alter globalization organizations as economic blocs mercosur and unasur political community celac or bank of the south which are supporting development of low income countries without involvement from imf or world bank
