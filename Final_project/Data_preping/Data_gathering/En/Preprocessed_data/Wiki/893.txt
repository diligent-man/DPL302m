following the american conquest of california the rancho was patented to ontiveros by public land commission
in ontiveros sold acres out of his more than acre estate to german american families for the founding of anaheim
the city of anaheim was founded in by german americans who were residents of san francisco and whose families had originated in rothenburg ob der tauber franconia in bavaria

in ku klux klan members were elected to the anaheim city council on a platform of political reform
up until that point the city had been controlled by a long standing business and civic elite that was mostly german american
given their tradition of moderate social drinking the german americans did not strongly support prohibition laws of the day
the mayor himself was a former saloon keeper
led by the minister of the first christian church the klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non ethnic germans who denounced the elite as corrupt undemocratic and self serving
the klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model orderly community one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly enforced
at the time the kkk had about members in orange county
the economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous
klan members were protestants as were the majority of their opponents however the opposition to the klan also included many catholic germans
individuals who joined the klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents and many of the individuals in orange county who joined the klan did so out of a sense of civic activism
upon easily winning the local anaheim election in april the klan representatives promptly fired city employees who were known to be catholic and replaced them with klan appointees
the new city council tried to enforce prohibition

the city of anaheim eager for tax revenue these hotels would generate did little to obstruct their construction
