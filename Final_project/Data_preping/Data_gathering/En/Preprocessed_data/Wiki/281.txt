team hp lab claimed found chua's missing memristor based analysis thin film titanium dioxide thus connecting operation reram device memristor concept
according hp lab memristor would operate following way memristor's electrical resistance constant depends current previously flowed device ie present resistance depends much electric charge ha previously flowed direction device remembers historythe so-called non-volatility property
electric power supply turned memristor remembers recent resistance turned again
hp lab result wa published scientific journal nature
following claim leon chua ha argued memristor definition could generalized cover form two-terminal non-volatile memory device based resistance switching effects
chua also argued memristor oldest known circuit element effect predating resistor capacitor inductor
however serious doubt whether genuine memristor actually exist physical reality
additionally experimental evidence contradicts chua's generalization since non-passive nanobattery effect observable resistance switching memory

meuffels schroeder noted one early memristor paper included mistaken assumption regarding ionic conduction
meuffels soni discussed fundamental issue problem realization memristors
indicated inadequacy electrochemical modeling presented nature article missing memristor found impact concentration polarization effect behavior metaltioxmetal structure voltage current stress wa considered
kind thought experiment meuffels soni furthermore revealed severe inconsistency current-controlled memristor so-called non-volatility property exists physical reality behavior would violate landauer's principle place limit minimum amount energy required change information state system
critique wa finally adopted di ventra pershin in
within context meuffels soni pointed fundamental thermodynamic principle non-volatile information storage requires existence free-energy barrier separate distinct internal memory state system otherwise one would faced indifferent situation system would arbitrarily fluctuate one memory state another influence thermal fluctuations
unprotected thermal fluctuation internal memory state exhibit diffusive dynamic cause state degradation
free-energy barrier must therefore high enough ensure low bit-error probability bit operation
consequently always lower limit energy requirement depending required bit-error probability intentionally changing bit value memory device
general concept memristive system defining equation see theory
displaystyle beginalignedytgmathbf x ututdot mathbf x fmathbf x utendaligned
vector x represents set n state variable describing different internal memory state device
one want go beyond mere curve fitting aim real physical modeling non-volatile memory element eg resistive random-access memory device one ha keep eye aforementioned physical correlations
check adequacy proposed model resulting state equation input signal ut superposed stochastic term take account existence inevitable thermal fluctuations
displaystyle dot mathbf x fmathbf x utxi tt
base analytical numerical analysis time-dependent response system towards noise decision physical validity modeling approach made eg would system able retain memory state power-off mode
analysis wa performed di ventra pershin regard genuine current-controlled memristor
proposed dynamic state equation provides physical mechanism enabling memristor cope inevitable thermal fluctuation current-controlled memristor would erratically change state course time influence current noise
di ventra pershin thus concluded memristors whose resistance memory state depend solely current voltage history would unable protect memory state unavoidable johnson-nyquist noise permanently suffer information loss so-called stochastic catastrophe
current-controlled memristor thus exist solid-state device physical reality
above-mentioned thermodynamic principle furthermore implies operation terminal non-volatile memory device eg
resistance-switching memory device reram cannot associated memristor concept ie device cannot remember current voltage history
transition distinct internal memory resistance state probabilistic nature
probability transition state state j depends height free-energy barrier states
transition probability thus influenced suitably driving memory device ie lowering free-energy barrier transition j mean example externally applied bias
resistance switching event simply enforced setting external bias value certain threshold value
trivial case ie free-energy barrier transition j reduced zero
case one applies bias threshold value still finite probability device switch course time triggered random thermal fluctuation one dealing probabilistic process impossible predict switching event occur
basic reason stochastic nature observed resistance-switching reram processes
free-energy barrier high enough memory device even switch without anything
terminal non-volatile memory device found distinct resistance state j exists therefore physical one-to-one relationship present state foregoing voltage history
switching behavior individual non-volatile memory device thus cannot described within mathematical framework proposed memristormemristive systems
extra thermodynamic curiosity arises definition memristorsmemristive device energetically act like resistors
instantaneous electrical power entering device completely dissipated joule heat surrounding extra energy remains system ha brought one resistance state xi another one xj
thus internal energy memristor device state xi uv xi would state xj uv xj even though different state would give rise different device's resistance must caused physical alteration device's material
researcher noted memristor model based assumption linear ionic drift account asymmetry set time high-to-low resistance switching reset time low-to-high resistance switching provide ionic mobility value consistent experimental data
article researcher reram concluded strukov's hp's initialbasic memristor modeling equation reflect actual device physic well whereas subsequent physics-based model pickett's model menzel's ecm model menzel co-author article adequate predictability computationally prohibitive
search continues model balance issue article identifies chang's yakopcic's model potentially good compromises
