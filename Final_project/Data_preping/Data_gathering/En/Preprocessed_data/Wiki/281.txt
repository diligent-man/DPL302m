a memristor m mr st r a portmanteau of memory resistor is a non linear two terminal electrical component relating electric charge and magnetic flux linkage
it was described and named in by leon chua completing a theoretical quartet of fundamental electrical components which comprises also the resistor capacitor and inductor
chua and kang later generalized the concept to memristive systems
such a system comprises a circuit of multiple conventional components which mimics key properties of the ideal memristor component and is also commonly referred to as a memristor
several such memristor system technologies have been developed notably reram
the identification of memristive properties in electronic devices has attracted controversy
experimentally the ideal memristor has yet to be demonstrated
chua in his paper identified a theoretical symmetry between the non linear resistor voltage vs
current non linear capacitor voltage vs
charge and non linear inductor magnetic flux linkage vs
current
from this symmetry he inferred the characteristics of a fourth fundamental non linear circuit element linking magnetic flux and charge which he called the memristor
in contrast to a linear or non linear resistor the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage including a memory of past voltages or currents
other scientists had proposed dynamic memory resistors such as the memistor of bernard widrow but chua introduced a mathematical generality
the memristor was originally defined in terms of a non linear functional relationship between magnetic flux linkage m t and the amount of electric charge that has flowed q t
displaystyle f mathrm phi mathrm m t q t
the magnetic flux linkage m is generalized from the circuit characteristic of an inductor
it does not represent a magnetic field here
its physical meaning is discussed below
the symbol m may be regarded as the integral of voltage over time
in the relationship between m and q the derivative of one with respect to the other depends on the value of one or the other and so each memristor is characterized by its memristance function describing the charge dependent rate of change of flux with charge
displaystyle m q frac mathrm d phi rm m mathrm d q
substituting the flux as the time integral of the voltage and charge as the time integral of current the more convenient forms are
displaystyle m q t cfrac mathrm d phi rm mathrm d t mathrm d q mathrm d t frac v t i t
to relate the memristor to the resistor capacitor and inductor it is helpful to isolate the term m q which characterizes the device and write it as a differential equation
the above table covers all meaningful ratios of differentials of i q m and v
no device can relate di to dq or d m to dv because i is the derivative of q and m is the integral of v
it can be inferred from this that memristance is charge dependent resistance
if m q t is a constant then we obtain ohm s law r t v t i t
if m q t is nontrivial however the equation is not equivalent because q t and m q t can vary with time
solving for voltage as a function of time produces
displaystyle v t m q t i t
this equation reveals that memristance defines a linear relationship between current and voltage as long as m does not vary with charge
nonzero current implies time varying charge
alternating current however may reveal the linear dependence in circuit operation by inducing a measurable voltage without net charge movement as long as the maximum change in q does not cause much change in m
furthermore the memristor is static if no current is applied
if i t we find v t and m t is constant
this is the essence of the memory effect
analogously we can define a
displaystyle w phi t
as menductance
displaystyle i t w phi t v t
the power consumption characteristic recalls that of a resistor ir
displaystyle p t i t v t i t m q t
as long as m q t varies little such as under alternating current the memristor will appear as a constant resistor
if m q t increases rapidly however current and power consumption will quickly stop
m q is physically restricted to be positive for all values of q assuming the device is passive and does not become superconductive at some q
a negative value would mean that it would perpetually supply energy when operated with alternating current
in order to understand the nature of memristor function some knowledge of fundamental circuit theoretic concepts is useful starting with the concept of device modelling
engineers and scientists seldom analyze a physical system in its original form
instead they construct a model which approximates the behaviour of the system
by analyzing the behaviour of the model they hope to predict the behaviour of the actual system
the primary reason for constructing models is that physical systems are usually too complex to be amenable to a practical analysis
in the th century work was done on devices where researchers did not recognize the memristive characteristics
this has raised the suggestion that such devices should be recognised as memristors
pershin and di ventra have proposed a test that can help to resolve some of the long standing controversies about whether an ideal memristor does actually exist or is a purely mathematical concept
the rest of this article primarily addresses memristors as related to reram devices since the majority of work since has been concentrated in this area
paul penfield in a mit technical report mentions the memristor in connection with josephson junctions
this was an early use of the word memristor in the context of a circuit device
one of the terms in the current through a josephson junction is of the form
displaystyle begin aligned i m v epsilon cos phi v w phi v end aligned
where
displaystyle epsilon
is a constant based on the physical superconducting materials
displaystyle v
is the voltage across the junction and
displaystyle i m
is the current through the junction
through the late th century research regarding this phase dependent conductance in josephson junctions was carried out
a more comprehensive approach to extracting this phase dependent conductance appeared with peotta and diventra s seminal paper in
due to the practical difficulty of studying the ideal memristor we will discuss other electrical devices which can be modelled using memristors
for a mathematical description of a memristive device systems see theory
a discharge tube can be modelled as a memristive device with resistance being a function of the number of conduction electrons
displaystyle n e
displaystyle begin aligned v m r n e i m frac dn e dt beta n alpha r n e i m end aligned
displaystyle v m
is the voltage across the discharge tube
displaystyle i m
is the current flowing through it and
displaystyle n e
is the number of conduction electrons
a simple memristance function is
displaystyle r n e frac f n e
displaystyle alpha beta
displaystyle f
are parameters depending on the dimensions of the tube and the gas fillings
an experimental identification of memristive behaviour is the pinched hysteresis loop in the
displaystyle v i

for an experiment that shows such a characteristic for a common discharge tube see a physical memristor lissajous figure youtube
the video also illustrates how to understand deviations in the pinched hysteresis characteristics of physical memristors
thermistors can be modelled as memristive devices

a fundamental phenomenon that has hardly been studied is memristive behaviour in pn junctions
the memristor plays a crucial role in mimicking the charge storage effect in the diode base and is also responsible for the conductivity modulation phenomenon that is so important during forward transients
in a team at hp labs claimed to have found chua s missing memristor based on an analysis of a thin film of titanium dioxide thus connecting the operation of reram devices to the memristor concept
according to hp labs the memristor would operate in the following way the memristor s electrical resistance is not constant but depends on the current that had previously flowed through the device i e its present resistance depends on how much electric charge has previously flowed through it and in what direction the device remembers its history the so called non volatility property
when the electric power supply is turned off the memristor remembers its most recent resistance until it is turned on again
the hp labs result was published in the scientific journal nature
following this claim leon chua has argued that the memristor definition could be generalized to cover all forms of two terminal non volatile memory devices based on resistance switching effects
chua also argued that the memristor is the oldest known circuit element with its effects predating the resistor capacitor and inductor
there are however some serious doubts as to whether a genuine memristor can actually exist in physical reality
additionally some experimental evidence contradicts chua s generalization since a non passive nanobattery effect is observable in resistance switching memory
a simple test has been proposed by pershin and di ventra to analyze whether such an ideal or generic memristor does actually exist or is a purely mathematical concept
up to now there seems to be no experimental resistance switching device reram which can pass the test
these devices are intended for applications in nanoelectronic memory devices computer logic and neuromorphic neuromemristive computer architectures
in hewlett packard cto martin fink suggested that memristor memory may become commercially available as early as
in march a team of researchers from hrl laboratories and the university of michigan announced the first functioning memristor array built on a cmos chip
according to the original definition the memristor is the fourth fundamental circuit element forming a non linear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage
in chua argued for a broader definition that includes all terminal non volatile memory devices based on resistance switching
williams argued that mram phase change memory and reram are memristor technologies
some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood and skin fit the definition
others argued that the memory device under development by hp labs and other forms of reram are not memristors but rather part of a broader class of variable resistance systems and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored hp s memristor patents
in meuffels and schroeder noted that one of the early memristor papers included a mistaken assumption regarding ionic conduction
in meuffels and soni discussed some fundamental issues and problems in the realization of memristors
they indicated inadequacies in the electrochemical modeling presented in the nature article the missing memristor found because the impact of concentration polarization effects on the behavior of metal tio x metal structures under voltage or current stress was not considered
this critique was referred to by valov et al
in a kind of thought experiment meuffels and soni furthermore revealed a severe inconsistency if a current controlled memristor with the so called non volatility property exists in physical reality its behavior would violate landauer s principle which places a limit on the minimum amount of energy required to change information states of a system
this critique was finally adopted by di ventra and pershin in
within this context meuffels and soni pointed to a fundamental thermodynamic principle non volatile information storage requires the existence of free energy barriers that separate the distinct internal memory states of a system from each other otherwise one would be faced with an indifferent situation and the system would arbitrarily fluctuate from one memory state to another just under the influence of thermal fluctuations
when unprotected against thermal fluctuations the internal memory states exhibit some diffusive dynamics which causes state degradation
the free energy barriers must therefore be high enough to ensure a low bit error probability of bit operation
consequently there is always a lower limit of energy requirement depending on the required bit error probability for intentionally changing a bit value in any memory device
in the general concept of memristive system the defining equations are see theory
displaystyle begin aligned y t g mathbf x u t u t dot mathbf x f mathbf x u t end aligned
where u t is an input signal and y t is an output signal
the vector x represents a set of n state variables describing the different internal memory states of the device
is the time dependent rate of change of the state vector x with time
when one wants to go beyond mere curve fitting and aims at a real physical modeling of non volatile memory elements e g resistive random access memory devices one has to keep an eye on the aforementioned physical correlations
to check the adequacy of the proposed model and its resulting state equations the input signal u t can be superposed with a stochastic term t which takes into account the existence of inevitable thermal fluctuations
the dynamic state equation in its general form then finally reads
displaystyle dot mathbf x f mathbf x u t xi t t
where t is e g white gaussian current or voltage noise
on base of an analytical or numerical analysis of the time dependent response of the system towards noise a decision on the physical validity of the modeling approach can be made e g would the system be able to retain its memory states in power off mode
such an analysis was performed by di ventra and pershin with regard to the genuine current controlled memristor
as the proposed dynamic state equation provides no physical mechanism enabling such a memristor to cope with inevitable thermal fluctuations a current controlled memristor would erratically change its state in course of time just under the influence of current noise
di ventra and pershin thus concluded that memristors whose resistance memory states depend solely on the current or voltage history would be unable to protect their memory states against unavoidable johnson nyquist noise and permanently suffer from information loss a so called stochastic catastrophe
a current controlled memristor can thus not exist as a solid state device in physical reality
the above mentioned thermodynamic principle furthermore implies that the operation of terminal non volatile memory devices e g
resistance switching memory devices reram cannot be associated with the memristor concept i e such devices cannot by itself remember their current or voltage history
transitions between distinct internal memory or resistance states are of probabilistic nature
the probability for a transition from state i to state j depends on the height of the free energy barrier between both states
the transition probability can thus be influenced by suitably driving the memory device i e by lowering the free energy barrier for the transition i j by means of for example an externally applied bias
a resistance switching event can simply be enforced by setting the external bias to a value above a certain threshold value
this is the trivial case i e the free energy barrier for the transition i j is reduced to zero
in case one applies biases below the threshold value there is still a finite probability that the device will switch in course of time triggered by a random thermal fluctuation but as one is dealing with probabilistic processes it is impossible to predict when the switching event will occur
that is the basic reason for the stochastic nature of all observed resistance switching reram processes
if the free energy barriers are not high enough the memory device can even switch without having to do anything
when a terminal non volatile memory device is found to be in a distinct resistance state j there exists therefore no physical one to one relationship between its present state and its foregoing voltage history
the switching behavior of individual non volatile memory devices thus cannot be described within the mathematical framework proposed for memristor memristive systems
an extra thermodynamic curiosity arises from the definition that memristors memristive devices should energetically act like resistors
the instantaneous electrical power entering such a device is completely dissipated as joule heat to the surrounding so no extra energy remains in the system after it has been brought from one resistance state xi to another one xj
thus the internal energy of the memristor device in state xi u v t xi would be the same as in state xj u v t xj even though these different states would give rise to different device s resistances which itself must be caused by physical alterations of the device s material
other researchers noted that memristor models based on the assumption of linear ionic drift do not account for asymmetry between set time high to low resistance switching and reset time low to high resistance switching and do not provide ionic mobility values consistent with experimental data
non linear ionic drift models have been proposed to compensate for this deficiency
a article from researchers of reram concluded that strukov s hp s initial basic memristor modeling equations do not reflect the actual device physics well whereas subsequent physics based models such as pickett s model or menzel s ecm model menzel is a co author of that article have adequate predictability but are computationally prohibitive
as of the search continues for a model that balances these issues the article identifies chang s and yakopcic s models as potentially good compromises
martin reynolds an electrical engineering analyst with research outfit gartner commented that while hp was being sloppy in calling their device a memristor critics were being pedantic in saying that it was not a memristor
chua suggested experimental tests to determine if a device may properly be categorized as a memristor
the lissajous curve in the voltage current plane is a pinched hysteresis loop when driven by any bipolar periodic voltage or current without respect to initial conditions
the area of each lobe of the pinched hysteresis loop shrinks as the frequency of the forcing signal increases
as the frequency tends to infinity the hysteresis loop degenerates to a straight line through the origin whose slope depends on the amplitude and shape of the forcing signal according to chua all resistive switching memories including reram mram and phase change memory meet these criteria and are memristors
however the lack of data for the lissajous curves over a range of initial conditions or over a range of frequencies complicates assessments of this claim
experimental evidence shows that redox based resistance memory reram includes a nanobattery effect that is contrary to chua s memristor model
this indicates that the memristor theory needs to be extended or corrected to enable accurate reram modeling
in researchers from hp labs introduced a model for a memristance function based on thin films of titanium dioxide
for ron roff the memristance function was determined to be
displaystyle m q t r mathrm off cdot left frac mu v r mathrm on d q t right
where roff represents the high resistance state ron represents the low resistance state v represents the mobility of dopants in the thin film and d represents the film thickness
the hp labs group noted that window functions were necessary to compensate for differences between experimental measurements and their memristor model due to non linear ionic drift and boundary effects
for some memristors applied current or voltage causes substantial change in resistance
such devices may be characterized as switches by investigating the time and energy that must be spent to achieve a desired change in resistance
this assumes that the applied voltage remains constant
solving for energy dissipation during a single switching event reveals that for a memristor to switch from ron to roff in time ton to toff the charge must change by q qon qoff
displaystyle e mathrm switch v int t mathrm off t mathrm on frac mathrm d t m q t v int q mathrm off q mathrm on frac mathrm d q i q m q v int q mathrm off q mathrm on frac mathrm d q v q v delta q
substituting v i q m q and then dq v q v for constant vto produces the final expression
this power characteristic differs fundamentally from that of a metal oxide semiconductor transistor which is capacitor based
unlike the transistor the final state of the memristor in terms of charge does not depend on bias voltage
the type of memristor described by williams ceases to be ideal after switching over its entire resistance range creating hysteresis also called the hard switching regime
another kind of switch would have a cyclic m q so that each off on event would be followed by an on off event under constant bias
such a device would act as a memristor under all conditions but would be less practical
in the more general concept of an n th order memristive system the defining equations are
displaystyle begin aligned y t g textbf x u t u t dot textbf x f textbf x u t end aligned
where u t is an input signal y t is an output signal the vector x represents a set of n state variables describing the device and g and f are continuous functions
for a current controlled memristive system the signal u t represents the current signal i t and the signal y t represents the voltage signal v t
for a voltage controlled memristive system the signal u t represents the voltage signal v t and the signal y t represents the current signal i t
the pure memristor is a particular case of these equations namely when x depends only on charge x q and since the charge is related to the current via the time derivative dq dt i t
thus for pure memristors f i e
the rate of change of the state must be equal or proportional to the current i t
one of the resulting properties of memristors and memristive systems is the existence of a pinched hysteresis effect
for a current controlled memristive system the input u t is the current i t the output y t is the voltage v t and the slope of the curve represents the electrical resistance
the change in slope of the pinched hysteresis curves demonstrates switching between different resistance states which is a phenomenon central to reram and other forms of two terminal resistance memory
at high frequencies memristive theory predicts the pinched hysteresis effect will degenerate resulting in a straight line representative of a linear resistor
it has been proven that some types of non crossing pinched hysteresis curves denoted type ii cannot be described by memristors
some researchers have raised the question of the scientific legitimacy of hp s memristor models in explaining the behavior of reram
and have suggested extended memristive models to remedy perceived deficiencies
one example attempts to extend the memristive systems framework by including dynamic systems incorporating higher order derivatives of the input signal u t as a series expansion
displaystyle begin aligned y t g textbf x u u t g textbf x u operatorname d u over operatorname d t g textbf x u operatorname d u over operatorname d t ldots g m textbf x u operatorname d m u over operatorname d t m dot textbf x f textbf x u end aligned
where m is a positive integer u t is an input signal y t is an output signal the vector x represents a set of n state variables describing the device and the functions g and f are continuous functions
this equation produces the same zero crossing hysteresis curves as memristive systems but with a different frequency response than that predicted by memristive systems
another example suggests including an offset value
displaystyle a
to account for an observed nanobattery effect which violates the predicted zero crossing pinched hysteresis effect

interest in the memristor revived when an experimental solid state version was reported by r
stanley williams of hewlett packard in
the article was the first to demonstrate that a solid state device could have the characteristics of a memristor based on the behavior of nanoscale thin films
the device neither uses magnetic flux as the theoretical memristor suggested nor stores charge as a capacitor does but instead achieves a resistance dependent on the history of current
although not cited in hp s initial reports on their tio memristor the resistance switching characteristics of titanium dioxide were originally described in the s
the hp device is composed of a thin nm titanium dioxide film between two nm thick electrodes one titanium the other platinum
initially there are two layers to the titanium dioxide film one of which has a slight depletion of oxygen atoms
the oxygen vacancies act as charge carriers meaning that the depleted layer has a much lower resistance than the non depleted layer
when an electric field is applied the oxygen vacancies drift see fast ion conductor changing the boundary between the high resistance and low resistance layers
thus the resistance of the film as a whole is dependent on how much charge has been passed through it in a particular direction which is reversible by changing the direction of current
since the hp device displays fast ion conduction at nanoscale it is considered a nanoionic device
memristance is displayed only when both the doped layer and depleted layer contribute to resistance
when enough charge has passed through the memristor that the ions can no longer move the device enters hysteresis
it ceases to integrate q i dt but rather keeps q at an upper bound and m fixed thus acting as a constant resistor until current is reversed
memory applications of thin film oxides had been an area of active investigation for some time
ibm published an article in regarding structures similar to that described by williams
samsung has a u s
patent for oxide vacancy based switches similar to that described by williams
williams also has a u s
patent application related to the memristor construction
in april hp labs announced that they had practical memristors working at ns ghz switching times and nm by nm sizes which bodes well for the future of the technology
at these densities it could easily rival the current sub nm flash memory technology
in krieger and spitzer described dynamic doping of polymer and inorganic dielectric like materials that improved the switching characteristics and retention required to create functioning nonvolatile memory cells
they used a passive layer between electrode and active thin films which enhanced the extraction of ions from the electrode
it is possible to use fast ion conductor as this passive layer which allows a significant reduction of the ionic extraction field
in july erokhin and fontana claimed to have developed a polymeric memristor before the more recently announced titanium dioxide memristor
in alibart gamrat vuillaume et al
introduced a new hybrid organic nanoparticle device the nomfet nanoparticle organic memory field effect transistor which behaves as a memristor and which exhibits the main behavior of a biological spiking synapse
this device also called a synapstor synapse transistor was used to demonstrate a neuro inspired circuit associative memory showing a pavlovian learning
in crupi pradhan and tozer described a proof of concept design to create neural synaptic memory circuits using organic ion based memristors
the synapse circuit demonstrated long term potentiation for learning as well as inactivity based forgetting
using a grid of circuits a pattern of light was stored and later recalled
this mimics the behavior of the v neurons in the primary visual cortex that act as spatiotemporal filters that process visual signals such as edges and moving lines
in erokhin and co authors have demonstrated a stochastic three dimensional matrix with capabilities for learning and adapting based on polymeric memristor
in bessonov et al
reported a flexible memristive device comprising a moox mos heterostructure sandwiched between silver electrodes on a plastic foil
the fabrication method is entirely based on printing and solution processing technologies using two dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides tmds
the memristors are mechanically flexible optically transparent and produced at low cost
the memristive behaviour of switches was found to be accompanied by a prominent memcapacitive effect
high switching performance demonstrated synaptic plasticity and sustainability to mechanical deformations promise to emulate the appealing characteristics of biological neural systems in novel computing technologies
atomristor is defined as the electrical devices showing memristive behavior in atomically thin nanomaterials or atomic sheets
in ge and wu et al
first reported a universal memristive effect in single layer tmd mx m mo w and x s se atomic sheets based on vertical metal insulator metal mim device structure
these atomristors offer forming free switching and both unipolar and bipolar operation
the switching behavior is found in single crystalline and poly crystalline films with various metallic electrodes gold silver and graphene
atomically thin tmd sheets are prepared via cvd mocvd enabling low cost fabrication
afterwards taking advantage of the low on resistance and large on off ratio a high performance zero power rf switch is proved based on mos atomristors indicating a new application of memristors
the ferroelectric memristor is based on a thin ferroelectric barrier sandwiched between two metallic electrodes
switching the polarization of the ferroelectric material by applying a positive or negative voltage across the junction can lead to a two order of magnitude resistance variation roff ron an effect called tunnel electro resistance
in general the polarization does not switch abruptly
the reversal occurs gradually through the nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domains with opposite polarization
during this process the resistance is neither ron or roff but in between
when the voltage is cycled the ferroelectric domain configuration evolves allowing a fine tuning of the resistance value
the ferroelectric memristor s main advantages are that ferroelectric domain dynamics can be tuned offering a way to engineer the memristor response and that the resistance variations are due to purely electronic phenomena aiding device reliability as no deep change to the material structure is involved
in ageev blinov et al
reported observing memristor effect in structure based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes studying bundles of cnt by scanning tunneling microscope
later it was found that cnt memristive switching is observed when a nanotube has a non uniform elastic strain l
it was shown that the memristive switching mechanism of strained nt is based on the formation and subsequent redistribution of non uniform elastic strain and piezoelectric field edef in the nanotube under the influence of an external electric field e x t
biomaterials have been evaluated for use in artificial synapses and have shown potential for application in neuromorphic systems
in particular the feasibility of using a collagen based biomemristor as an artificial synaptic device has been investigated whereas a synaptic device based on lignin demonstrated rising or lowering current with consecutive voltage sweeps depending on the sign of the voltage furthermore a natural silk fibroin demonstrated memristive properties spin memristive systems based on biomolecules are also being studied
in sandro carrara and co authors have proposed the first biomolecular memristor with aims to realize highly sensitive biosensors
since then several memristive sensors have been demonstrated
chen and wang researchers at disk drive manufacturer seagate technology described three examples of possible magnetic memristors
in one device resistance occurs when the spin of electrons in one section of the device points in a different direction from those in another section creating a domain wall a boundary between the two sections
electrons flowing into the device have a certain spin which alters the device s magnetization state
changing the magnetization in turn moves the domain wall and changes the resistance
the work s significance led to an interview by ieee spectrum
a first experimental proof of the spintronic memristor based on domain wall motion by spin currents in a magnetic tunnel junction was given in
the magnetic tunnel junction has been proposed to act as a memristor through several potentially complementary mechanisms both extrinsic redox reactions charge trapping detrapping and electromigration within the barrier and intrinsic spin transfer torque
based on research performed between and bowen et al
published experiments in on a magnetic tunnel junction mtj endowed with bi stable spin dependent states resistive switching
the mtj consists in a srtio sto tunnel barrier that separates half metallic oxide lsmo and ferromagnetic metal cocr electrodes
the mtj s usual two device resistance states characterized by a parallel or antiparallel alignment of electrode magnetization are altered by applying an electric field
when the electric field is applied from the cocr to the lsmo electrode the tunnel magnetoresistance tmr ratio is positive
when the direction of electric field is reversed the tmr is negative
in both cases large amplitudes of tmr on the order of are found
since a fully spin polarized current flows from the half metallic lsmo electrode within the julliere model this sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the sto cocr interface
the origin to this multistate effect lies with the observed migration of cr into the barrier and its state of oxidation
the sign change of tmr can originate from modifications to the sto cocr interface density of states as well as from changes to the tunneling landscape at the sto cocr interface induced by crox redox reactions
reports on mgo based memristive switching within mgo based mtjs appeared starting in
while the drift of oxygen vacancies within the insulating mgo layer has been proposed to describe the observed memristive effects another explanation could be charge trapping detrapping on the localized states of oxygen vacancies
and its impact on spintronics
this highlights the importance of understanding what role oxygen vacancies play in the memristive operation of devices that deploy complex oxides with an intrinsic property such as ferroelectricity or multiferroicity
the magnetization state of a mtj can be controlled by spin transfer torque and can thus through this intrinsic physical mechanism exhibit memristive behavior
this spin torque is induced by current flowing through the junction and leads to an efficient means of achieving a mram
however the length of time the current flows through the junction determines the amount of current needed i e charge is the key variable
the combination of intrinsic spin transfer torque and extrinsic resistive switching mechanisms naturally leads to a second order memristive system described by the state vector x x x where x describes the magnetic state of the electrodes and x denotes the resistive state of the mgo barrier
in this case the change of x is current controlled spin torque is due to a high current density whereas the change of x is voltage controlled the drift of oxygen vacancies is due to high electric fields
the presence of both effects in a memristive magnetic tunnel junction led to the idea of a nanoscopic synapse neuron system
a fundamentally different mechanism for memristive behavior has been proposed by pershin and di ventra
the authors show that certain types of semiconductor spintronic structures belong to a broad class of memristive systems as defined by chua and kang
the mechanism of memristive behavior in such structures is based entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the ionic transport in nanostructures
when an external control parameter such as voltage is changed the adjustment of electron spin polarization is delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation processes causing hysteresis
this result was anticipated in the study of spin extraction at semiconductor ferromagnet interfaces but was not described in terms of memristive behavior
on a short time scale these structures behave almost as an ideal memristor
this result broadens the possible range of applications of semiconductor spintronics and makes a step forward in future practical applications
in dr kris campbell formally introduced the self directed channel sdc memristor
the sdc device is the first memristive device available commercially to researchers students and electronics enthusiast worldwide
the sdc device is operational immediately after fabrication
in the ge se active layer ge ge homopolar bonds are found and switching occurs
the three layers consisting of ge se ag ge se directly below the top tungsten electrode mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver source layer
a layer of snse is between these two layers ensuring that the silver source layer is not in direct contact with the active layer
since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature of about c f the device has significantly higher processing and operating temperatures at c f and at least c f respectively
these processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion conducting chalcogenide device types including the s based glasses e g
ges that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed
these factors allow the sdc device to operate over a wide range of temperatures including long term continuous operation at c f
memristors remain a laboratory curiosity as yet made in insufficient numbers to gain any commercial applications
despite this lack of mass availability according to allied market research the memristor market was worth million in and will be worth million by
a potential application of memristors is in analog memories for superconducting quantum computers
memristors can potentially be fashioned into non volatile solid state memory which could allow greater data density than hard drives with access times similar to dram replacing both components
hp prototyped a crossbar latch memory that can fit gigabits in a square centimeter and proposed a scalable d design consisting of up to layers or petabit per cm
in may hp reported that its device reaches currently about one tenth the speed of dram
the devices resistance would be read with alternating current so that the stored value would not be affected
in may it was reported that the access time had been improved to nanoseconds which is nearly one hundred times faster than the contemporaneous flash memory
at the same time the energy consumption was just one percent of that consumed by flash memory
memristor have applications in programmable logic signal processing super resolution imaging physical neural networks control systems reconfigurable computing in memory computing brain computer interfaces and rfid
memristive devices are potentially used for stateful logic implication allowing a replacement for cmos based logic computation several early works have been reported in this direction
in a simple electronic circuit consisting of an lc network and a memristor was used to model experiments on adaptive behavior of unicellular organisms
it was shown that subjected to a train of periodic pulses the circuit learns and anticipates the next pulse similar to the behavior of slime molds physarum polycephalum where the viscosity of channels in the cytoplasm responds to periodic environment changes
applications of such circuits may include e g pattern recognition
the darpa synapse project funded hp labs in collaboration with the boston university neuromorphics lab has been developing neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memristive systems
in versace and chandler described the moneta modular neural exploring traveling agent model
moneta is the first large scale neural network model to implement whole brain circuits to power a virtual and robotic agent using memristive hardware
application of the memristor crossbar structure in the construction of an analog soft computing system was demonstrated by merrikh bayat and shouraki
in they showed how memristor crossbars can be combined with fuzzy logic to create an analog memristive neuro fuzzy computing system with fuzzy input and output terminals
learning is based on the creation of fuzzy relations inspired from hebbian learning rule
in leon chua published a tutorial underlining the broad span of complex phenomena and applications that memristors span and how they can be used as non volatile analog memories and can mimic classic habituation and learning phenomena
the memistor and memtransistor are transistor based devices which include memristor function
in di ventra pershin and chua extended the notion of memristive systems to capacitive and inductive elements in the form of memcapacitors and meminductors whose properties depend on the state and history of the system further extended in by di ventra and pershin
in september mohamed salah abdelouahab rene lozi and leon chua published a general theory of st nd rd and nth order memristive elements using fractional derivatives
sir humphry davy is said by some to have performed the first experiments which can be explained by memristor effects as long ago as
however the first device of a related nature to be constructed was the memistor i e
memory resistor a term coined in by bernard widrow to describe a circuit element of an early artificial neural network called adaline
a few years later in argall published an article showing the resistance switching effects of tio which was later claimed by researchers from hewlett packard to be evidence of a memristor
leon chua postulated his new two terminal circuit element in
it was characterized by a relationship between charge and flux linkage as a fourth fundamental circuit element
five years later he and his student sung mo kang generalized the theory of memristors and memristive systems including a property of zero crossing in the lissajous curve characterizing current vs
voltage behavior
on may strukov snider stewart and williams published an article in nature identifying a link between the terminal resistance switching behavior found in nanoscale systems and memristors
on january di ventra pershin and chua extended the notion of memristive systems to capacitive and inductive elements namely capacitors and inductors whose properties depend on the state and history of the system
in july the memosat labosat group composed of researchers from universidad nacional de general san mart n argentina inti cnea and conicet put memory devices into orbit for their study at leo
since then seven missions with different devices are performing experiments in low orbit onboard satellogic s u sat satellites
on july knowm inc announced self directed channel sdc memristors commercially
these devices remain available in small numbers
on july memsat memristor satellite was launched to fly a memristor evaluation payload
in jennifer rupp and martin bazant of mit started a lithionics research programme to investigate applications of lithium beyond their use in battery electrodes including lithium oxide based memristors in neuromorphic computing
