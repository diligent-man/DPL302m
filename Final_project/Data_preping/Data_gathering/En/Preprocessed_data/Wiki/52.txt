Baruch ben Neriah (Hebrew: ברוך בן נריה Bārūḵ ben Nərīyā; c
6th century BC) was the scribe, disciple, secretary, and devoted friend of the Biblical prophet Jeremiah
He is traditionally credited with authoring the Book of Baruch.
According to Josephus, Baruch was a Jewish aristocrat, a son of Neriah and brother of Seraiah ben Neriah, chamberlain of King Zedekiah of Judah.
Baruch became the scribe of the prophet Jeremiah and wrote down the first and second editions of his prophecies as they were dictated to him
Baruch remained true to the teachings and ideals of the great prophet, although like his master he was at times almost overwhelmed with despondency
While Jeremiah was in hiding to avoid the wrath of King Jehoakim, he commanded Baruch to read his prophecies of warning to the people gathered in the Temple in Jerusalem on a day of fasting
The task was both difficult and dangerous, but Baruch performed it without flinching and it was probably on this occasion that the prophet gave him the personal message (Jeremiah 45).
Both Baruch and Jeremiah witnessed the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem of 587–586 BC
In the middle of the siege of Jerusalem, Jeremiah purchased an estate in Anathoth on which the Babylonian armies had encamped (as a symbol of faith in the eventual restoration of Jerusalem; Jeremiah 32) and, according to Josephus, Baruch continued to reside with him at Mizpah
 Reportedly, Baruch had influence on Jeremiah; on his advice Jeremiah urged the Israelites to remain in Judah after the murder of Gedaliah.
He was carried with Jeremiah to Egypt, where, according to a tradition preserved by Jerome, he soon died
 Two other traditions state that he later went, or was carried, to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar II after the latter's conquest of Egypt.
Baruch's prominence, by reason of his intimate association with Jeremiah, led later generations to exalt his reputation still further
To him were attributed the Book of Baruch and two other Jewish books.
In 1975, a clay bulla purportedly containing Baruch's seal and name appeared on the antiquities market
Its purchaser, a prominent Israeli collector, permitted Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad to publish the bulla
Although its source is not definitively known, it has been identified as coming from the "burnt house" excavated by Yigal Shiloh
The bulla is now in the Israel Museum
It measures 17 by 16 millimetres (0.67 by 0.63 in), and is stamped with an oval seal, 13 by 11 millimetres (0.51 by 0.43 in)
The inscription, written in the ancient Hebrew alphabet, reads:
In 1996, a second clay bulla emerged with an identical inscription; presumably stamped with the same seal
This bulla also was imprinted with a fingerprint; Hershel Shanks, among others, speculated that the fingerprint might be that of Baruch himself; the authenticity of these bullae however has been disputed.
In the second edition of Richard Elliott Friedman's book Who Wrote the Bible?, in which he defended the documentary hypothesis, he put forth the claim that the Deuteronomist, who is generally thought to have either written or edited the books from Deuteronomy to II Kings, was Baruch ben Neriah
He defended this assertion by comparing a number of different phrases in the Book of Jeremiah with phrases in other books
Some reject this claim on the grounds that it goes beyond the evidence.
The rabbis described Baruch as a faithful helper and blood-relative of Jeremiah
According to rabbinic literature, both Baruch and Jeremiah, being kohanim and descendants of the proselyte Rahab, served as a humiliating example to their contemporaries, inasmuch as they belong to the few who harkened to the word of God
A Midrash in the Sifre regarded Baruch as identical with the Ethiopian Ebed-melech, who rescued Jeremiah from the dungeon; and states that he received his appellation Baruch ("blessed") because of his piety, which contrasted with the loose life of the court, as the skin of an Ethiopian contrasts with that of a white person
According to a Syriac account, because his piety might have prevented the destruction of the Temple, God commanded him to leave Jerusalem before the catastrophe, so as to remove his protective presence
According to the account, Baruch then saw, from Abraham's oak at Hebron, the Temple set on fire by angels, who previously had hidden the sacred vessels.
The Tannaim are much divided on the question whether Baruch is to be classed among the Prophets
According to Mekhilta, Baruch complained because the gift of prophecy had not been given to him
"Why," he said, "is my fate different from that of all the other disciples of the Prophets? Joshua served Moses, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him; Elisha served Elijah, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him
Why is it otherwise with me?" God answered him: "Baruch, of what avail is a hedge where there is no vineyard, or a shepherd where there are no sheep?" Baruch, therefore, found consolation in the fact that when Israel was exiled to Babylonia there was no longer occasion for prophecy.
The Seder Olam (xx.), however, and the Talmud, include Baruch among the Prophets, and state that he prophesied in the period following the destruction
It was in Babylonia also that Ezra studied the Torah with Baruch
Nor did he think of returning to Judea during his teacher's lifetime, since he considered the study of the Torah more important than the rebuilding of the Temple; and Baruch could not join the returning exiles by reason of his age.
Some Christian legends (especially from Syria and Arabia) identify Baruch with Zoroaster, and give much information concerning him
Baruch, angry because the gift of prophecy had been denied him, and on account of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, left Israel to found the religion of Zoroaster
The prophecy of the Virgin birth of Jesus, and of the Adoration of the Magi, is also ascribed to Baruch-Zoroaster
It is difficult to explain the origin of this curious identification of a prophet with a magician, such as Zoroaster was held to be, among the Jews, Christians, and Arabs
De Sacy explains it on the ground that in Arabic the name of the prophet Jeremiah is almost identical with that of the city of Urmiah, where, it is said, Zoroaster lived.
However, this may be, the Jewish legend mentioned above (under Baruch in Rabbinical Literature), according to which the Ethiopian in Jeremiah 38:7 is undoubtedly identical with Baruch, is connected with this Arabic–Christian legend
In the Clementine Recognitions Zoroaster was believed to be a descendant of Ham; and, according to Genesis 10:6, Cush, the Ethiopian, is a son of Ham
According to the "Recognitions", the Persians believed that Zoroaster had been taken into heaven in a chariot ("ad cœlum vehiculo sublevatum"); and according to the Jewish legend, the above-mentioned Ethiopian was transported alive into paradise, an occurrence that, like the translation of Elijah, must have taken place by means of a "vehiculum." Another reminiscence of the Jewish legend is found in Baruch-Zoroaster's words concerning Jesus: "He shall descend from my family", since, according to the Haggadah, Baruch was a priest; and Maria, the mother of Jesus, was of priestly family.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church Baruch is venerated as a saint, and as such is commemorated on September 28 (which, for those who follow the traditional Julian Calendar, falls on October 11 of the Gregorian Calendar).
The Catholic Church considers Baruch as a Saint along with other biblical prophets.
Baruch's grave became the subject of later legends
According to a Muslim tradition reported by sources including Petachiah of Ratisbon, an Arabian king once ordered it to be opened; but all who touched it fell dead
The king thereupon commanded the Jews to open it; and they, after preparing themselves by a three days' fast, succeeded without a mishap
Baruch's body was found intact in a marble coffin, and appeared as if he had just died
The king ordered that it should be transported to another place; but, after having dragged the coffin a little distance, the horses and camels were unable to move it another inch
The king, greatly excited by these wonders, went with his retinue to Muhammad to ask his advice
Arrived at Mecca, his doubts of the truth of the teachings of Islam greatly increased, and he and his courtiers finally accepted Judaism
The king then built a "bet ha-midrash" on the spot from which he had been unable to move Baruch's body; and this academy served for a long time as a place of pilgrimage.
Baruch's tomb is a mile away from that of Ezekiel, near Mashhad Ali; and a Jewish rabbinic source reported that a strange plant, the leaves of which are sprinkled with gold dust, grows on it
According to the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch, he was translated to paradise in his mortal body
The same is stated in Derekh Eretz Zuta (i.) of Ebed-Melech
Those who regard Baruch and Ebed-melech as identical find this deduction is evident.
