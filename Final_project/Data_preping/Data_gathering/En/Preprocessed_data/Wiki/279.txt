Dr D P Lewis C Chem Soton MRSC The original Victorian school buildings occupied a plot in Porchester Road Adjacent to the main school was the purpose built boarding house pictured in which the headmaster and a select number of boarders lived at an annual fee of guineas As the number of students increased in in in so too did the accommodation the school encompassed a former Royal Victoria Hospital in for lower school classes which was situated in the nearby Lowther Road The two sites were known within the school as Porchester and Lowther
In planning for new school buildings on the northern fringe of Charminster began Various proposals were considered and the Council decided to allocate acres for the new school in East Way Building operations were begun early in and the Foundation Stones were laid on May They were erected from the designs and under the supervision of Mr W L Clowes M Inst M and Cy E Borough Engineer and Architect and a well known Bournemouth Rotarian from onwards
They opened in and were first occupied by the boys from Porchester and Lowther in conjunction with evacuees from Taunton's School in Southampton Soon after HORSA huts were erected to the north of the main buildings to house more classrooms Further extensions to the buildings were made in subsequent years with the canteen previously above the Old Gym built in a new physics laboratory built in Rooms and now and in a new chemistry laboratory in a steel framed structure above the single storey north eastern section at the time of building notorious for rocking in the wind in the early s and office space for Housemasters and admin staff later in at the time the present House system was introduced Larger scale building works include the Sixth Form Block in the Art Technology blocks in the s replacing the HORSA huts the Maths Blocks which at the time of construction between was used for Religious Studies and Mathematics but now the classrooms are exclusively purposed for the latter and the Sir David English Centre in replacing the increasingly neglected vandalised and subsequently demolished pavilions that were used for physical education and sports events The Sixth Form Block made no provision for social space and so the Sixth Form Memorial Hall now an unused Drama Studio was opened in to provide a common room for use by the students What was formerly a bike shed beneath the Junior Playground and then a woodwork room now forms the Sixth Form common room
In the school hall burnt down Evidence of the fire can be seen in the wooden flooring tiles in the doorway of Room The new hall was opened in Its floorpan encompassed what had previously been two corridors running along either side of the old hall thereby making much better use of space Furthermore the old hall had no electricity supply or dressing rooms meaning that despite the short term disruption Bournemouth School now enjoys a larger and much better equipped facility for assemblies productions and other events
The old sites in Porchester Road and Lowther Road were used by Portchester School from until when it moved to Harewood Avenue The boarding house was demolished to make way for the Wessex Way Lowther was demolished in the s the site being redeveloped into the new Malmesbury Park Primary School and Porchester was redeveloped in into Fenwick Court a housing estate Nothing therefore of the pre East Way buildings remains
In the summer of the school started work on a new building planned to accommodate for the increasing number of pupils It is set to be completed for September The school has also been granted permission for fencing to be placed around the copse to secure the safety of students
From the mid s 'grammar streams' were introduced into all Bournemouth secondary modern schools and they effectively became bilateral schools This idea was pioneered by the Chief Education Officer of the County Borough of Bournemouth from Walter Smedley who died aged in June who was a former technical college lecturer and allowed easier movement between the 'grammar streams' in these schools and the grammar schools The system was nationally recognised as it allowed greater flexibility as is possible in comprehensive schools but allowed academic standards to be maintained people's ability was still recognised Movement was down as well as up The system was well supported by parents The rate of pupils staying on at school in the sixth form was higher than the national average in the s Selection to the grammar schools from was not assessed by a single exam but continuously In the late s Bournemouth's schools were producing GCE results better than comprehensives in London's ILEA
However in Edward Short Baron Glenamara the Labour education secretary condemned Bournemouth's education system Once Smedley left in the bilateral schools later became comprehensives The last school of this type was Oakmead College of Technology Entrance exams for the grammar schools were also reintroduced Bournemouth LEA still gets very good exam results especially at A level Dorset County Council took over from
In Bournemouth School ceased to hold its selective grammar school status as it became an academy The school kept its original name as well as its uniform and entrance examination through the change however the school is now directly funded and overseen by the government rather than a local education authority
The school shares playing fields with Bournemouth School for Girls and co operates with them in theatre productions Sixth form students often visit local primary schools to aid with teaching
All Bournemouth School students use the Sir David English Sports Centre for physical education lessons The students enjoy two changing rooms an indoor sports hall four tennis and netball courts and three artificial turf football pitches
The annual sports day acting as the climax of the House Competition takes place at the King's Park athletics stadium
Until September there were six houses named Avon Forest Hambledon Portchester Romsey and Twynham There were previous forms of the house system before the school moved to East Way at one stage being named Trojans Spartans Romans and Corinthians
However the current houses were introduced in when the Headmaster Col Allan Petrie restructured the house system by creating five new ones and appointing five new house masters and building the current house offices The first house masters named their respective house after an influential figure in their teaching subject Dr Waite Chemistry chose Darwin Mrs Bentley Geography chose Scott Mr Clench Art chose Turner and Mr Sanders Mathematics chose Newton The exception to the rule is Elgar named by Mr Beardshaw R S
All forms are delineated by house affiliation and as such pupils from year to year remain in the same form in the sixth form the pupils from each house are distributed between two previously three forms to encourage a better relationship between lower and upper sixth Although their 'form tutor' and 'form room' usually change every year their house remains the same for the entirety of the school It has become convention for siblings to be placed in the same house however some sixth form students that were in the school from year onwards have changed to the newly formed Moore house The houses compete in school competitions ranging from sports to educational competitions
In September the school welcomed a sixth house that accommodated new students in Year and sixth form Moore house named after world cup winner England football captain Bobby Moore This was decided by a school wide poll beating out the names of Bannister Hawking among others Since then Moore house has continued and will continue to welcome new year students into the house and now boasts year and sixth form students in years and
Students can first apply to be a prefect at the end of Year House masters normally choose six of the applicants from each form to become house prefects awarding them prefect badges Students can also apply at the beginning of lower sixth Typically the number of prefects doubles during this process Students remain house prefects until they can apply to become a school prefect being awarded a prefect tie clip or a senior prefect being awarded a tie with the school crest woven into the fabric during Year The senior prefect team has an application process consisting of an interview with the headmaster a Dragon's Den task a pupil vote and a teacher vote It consists of the school captain four deputy school captains and the captains of the six houses Privileges of the senior prefect team include invitations to the annual Old Bournemouthians' dinner
From the late s until the school became an academy in September Bournemouth School was designated a specialist Language College such accreditation is not available to schools with Foundation status Languages offered to both pupils and communities at large included French German Spanish Italian Portuguese Latin Japanese Mandarin Chinese and Arabic In all but three of these French German and Spanish were cut for financial reasons as the status was renounced
To allow pupils to extend their language skills there is a student exchange programme The language college has two computer suites interactive whiteboards and extra staff The school also provides services for primary schools in the area teaching languages to their pupils
The school also has an active Combined Cadet Force CCF a rarity for a state funded school The CCF has over members split into the three sections of Royal Navy Army
