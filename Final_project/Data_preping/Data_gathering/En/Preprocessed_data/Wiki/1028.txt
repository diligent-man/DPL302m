foam peanuts also known as foam popcorn packing peanuts or packing noodles are a common loose fill packaging and cushioning material used to prevent damage to fragile objects during shipping
they are shaped to interlock when compressed and free flow when not compressed
they are roughly the size and shape of an unshelled peanut and commonly made of expanded polystyrene foam
millimetres in of peanuts are typically used for cushioning and void filling packaging applications
the original patent was filed for by robert e
holden in and was granted in
polystyrene based packing peanuts were developed and patented by tektronix inc
they were made commercially available circa by dow chemical
originally made from virgin polystyrene resin peanuts made from recycled polystyrene have been commercially available since the mid s
the color and shape sometimes indicate what it is made of and who made it
often green is or possibly more recycled polystyrene white is or more virgin resin and pink means an antistatic agent has been applied although there are some variations
the most common shapes are similar to a s figure or w
foam peanuts are very light usually around grams per litre to lb per cu ft and easy to use
polystyrene peanuts may be used and reused many times with little or no loss in protection for the product shipped
they may be reused and recycled at many packing and shipping stores
because of their build up polystyrene peanuts may also be used for various methods of home insulation although it is not recommended because they are not flame retardant
in the early s starch based packing peanuts were developed as a more environment friendly alternative
the starch in the peanuts comes from crop based sources rather than petroleum based polystyrene and is non toxic
one of the first brands of biodegradable peanuts biofoam is made from the grain sorghum other brands are made from corn starch
biodegradable foam peanuts have no electrostatic charge another benefit over polystyrene
being biodegradable and nontoxic they are also safe for humans and pets if ingested accidentally
however they are not produced in food safe conditions and are not recommended for eating
also during the manufacturing process the nutritional value is removed from starch based packing peanuts
this removes edible components such as sugars that would otherwise attract rodents and bugs
their main drawbacks compared with polystyrene are lower resilience higher weight to g per litre to lb per cubic foot dust creation potential attraction of rodents and higher price
while polystyrene peanuts are soluble in acetone starch based peanuts are soluble in water so starch based products can be disposed with down the sink dissolving on contact with water
