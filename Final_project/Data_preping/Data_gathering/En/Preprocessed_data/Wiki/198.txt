manfred edward clynes august january was an austrian born scientist inventor and musician
he is best known for his innovations and discoveries in the interpretation of music and for his contributions to the study of biological systems and neurophysiology
manfred clynes work combines music and science more particularly neurophysiology and neuroscience
clynes musical achievements embrace performance and interpretation exploring and clarifying the function of time forms in the expression of music and of emotions generally in connection with brain function in its electrical manifestations
as a concert pianist he has recorded versions of bach s goldberg variations and of beethoven s diabelli variations
as an inventor his inventions about patents include besides the cat computer for electrical brain research the online auto and cross correlator and inventions in the field of ultrasound clynes invented color ultrasound as well as telemetering data recording and wind energy
the creative process of computer realizations of classical music with superconductor is based on his discoveries of fundamental principles of musicality
clynes was the subject of a front page article in the wall street journal september
clynes concentrated on what he saw as the natural and unalterable interlocking of the central nervous system with basic expressive time forms and on the innate power of those forms to generate specific basic emotions
he recognized that we are all familiar with this interlocking in our experiences of laughter and of yawning although its scientific importance had been largely swept under the carpet by a skinnerian bias and still largely is
according to clynes s experimental research these time forms sentic forms as embodied in the central nervous system are primary to the varied modes in which they find expression such as sound touch and gesture
clynes was able to prove this by systematically deriving sounds from subjects expressions of emotions through touch and then playing those sounds to hearers culturally remote from the original subjects
in one trial for example aborigines in central australia were able to correctly identify the specific emotional qualities of sounds derived from the touch of white urban americans
this experiment was featured on nova what is music in
clynes found in this a confirmation of the existence of biologically fixed universal primary dynamic forms that determine expressions of emotion that give rise to much of the experience within human societies
in he co authored a publication with dr alicia heraz in the journal of internet medical research that demonstrate similar emotional patterns on mobile phones with force sensitivity
some of these dynamic forms appear to be shared by those animals that have time consciousnesses at a similar rate to humans hence the intuition of pet owners that their dog or cat understands tone of voice and the emotional form of touch
anger love and grief for example according to clynes have clearly different dynamic expressive forms
importantly a cardinal property of this inherent biologic communication language in clynes findings is that the more closely an expression follows the precise dynamic form the more powerful is the generation of the corresponding emotion in both the person expressing and in the perceiver of the expression
hence presumably such phenomena as charisma in persons whose performance of emotional expressions closely follows the universal form
his experience with pablo casals confirmed for clynes the importance of this faithfulness to the natural dynamic form in generating emotionally significant meaning in musical performance
drawing on these findings clynes also developed an application a simple touch art form in which without music subjects expressed through repeated finger pressure a sequence of emotions timed according to the natural requirements of the sentic forms
the minute sequence called the sentic cycle comprises no emotion anger hate grief love sexual desire joy and reverence
subjects reported experiencing calmness and energy
many also evidenced progress in the alleviation of depression and to some degree tobacco and alcohol addictions as a result of repeated application of this process
thousands of people have by now experienced sentic cycles some for years some even decades
in the s especially clynes taught various groups to conduct sentic cycles on their own
nowadays the sentic cycle kit is available on the internet
early work developing sentic cycles in the s had convinced clynes also that it is easy with it for most people to proceed from experiencing one emotion to another quite rapidly
after three or four minutes of one emotion a person tended to be being satiated with the current emotion
the ready switching to the next emotion with quite fresh experience pointed to the existence of specific receptors in the brain he suggested that become satiated with particular neurohormones this was later confirmed by the identification of a number of such receptors
this finding links well with the historic tendency of composers to vary emotions every minutes or so in their compositions
the human need for variety is based on brain receptor properties
as anyone who has seen more than three charlie chaplin movies in a row can testify laughter too palls after prolonged exposure and it seems to be for the same reason
clynes also studied laughter nature s arrow from appearance to reality
in nonderisive laughter according to clynes a small element of disorder is suddenly understood to be only apparently disordered within an actual larger order
he then predicted the existence of soundless laughter in which the sound production is replaced by tactile pressure at the same temporal pattern
in studies at ucsd the mean repetitions of the ha s was found to be approximately per second
clynes further hypothesized that couples with unmatched speeds of laughter might not be as readily compatible as those whose laughter was harmoniously coordinated
clynes enthusiastically published his realization that love joy and reverence were always there to be experienced capable of being generated through precise expression and accessible by simple means due to the connection to their biologic roots
music had always been a special means for this but now with this touch artform it was universally accessible
by this means even negative emotions such as grief anger could be enjoyed in a compassionate non destructive framework
in the s and in the s clynes had started to write poems a few of which had found their way into his book sentics
later marvin minsky quoted from them in his book the society of mind
in the late s and in the s he wrote his animal poems
boundaries of compassion is a substantial set of poems growing out of his experience in germany while doing experimental work at the luedenscheid hospital in the summer of poems in regard to what germans call the jewish question
clynes is credited with developing and coining the term cyborg which refers to beings with both biological and artificial parts
in other words cyborgs are beings whose abilities have been enhanced due to the presence and advancement of technology
the term cyborg has become an important concept to technoself studies an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society focusing on the changing nature of relationships between the human and technology
manfred clynes was born on august in vienna austria the son of olga and marcel clynes
his family was jewish
his parents emigrated to melbourne in september to escape nazism
in australia at fifteen in his last year at high school having newly learned calculus he invented the inertial guidance method for aircraft using piezoelectric crystals and repeated electronic integration but australian authorities denied that it would work
in fact the same system clynes had invented was later used with great success during the last part of the second world war
the detailed descriptions of this invention as written by the fifteen year old clynes are rigorous it was the first of his many inventions to come that worked
clynes earlier attempt at the age of thirteen to create a perpetual motion device was naturally a failure
in clynes graduated from the university of melbourne having studied both engineering science and music
around this time he also had lessons with the polish virtuoso ignaz friedman then resident in sydney
having seen friedman play in concert several times clynes approached him by letter and was accepted sight unseen
he hitchhiked from melbourne as he could not afford the train fare let alone the fee charged by friedman
his musical talent was recognized by a series of awards concerto performances and prizes one of which provided a three year graduate fellowship to the juilliard school
at juilliard he was a piano student of olga samaroff and sascha gorodnitzki
he received his ms degree from juilliard in after having performed beethoven s piano concerto no
at the tanglewood music festival in then under the direction of serge koussevitzky in a performance of which the pianist gerson yessin who was present recently recalled as monumental yessin manfred played beautifully outstandingly
after graduating from juilliard it gave no doctorates then clynes retreated to a small log cabin at six thousand feet altitude in the solitude of wrightwood california
there he learned bach s goldberg variations and other works
he performed them for the first time in october in ojai at jiddu krishnamurti s school and in along with other works in all the capital cities of australia to great acclaim
he soon became regarded as one of australia s outstanding pianists
in he was invited to princeton university as a graduate student in the music department and issued a green card to pursue his studies in the psychology of music with a fulbright and smith mundt award
there he became aware of the work of g
becking who in had published a sensitive if nonscientific study of distinctive motor patterns associated in following the music of individual composers
it was this work that led in the late s to clynes scientific sentographic studies of what he termed composers pulses as their motor manifestation in which pablo casals and rudolf serkin were to be his first subjects
young clynes had a personal letter of introduction to albert einstein from an elderly lady in australia with whom in her youth einstein had exchanged poems
soon einstein invited him repeatedly to dinner at his home and a friendship sprang up between the two men
clynes played for einstein on his fine bechstein piano especially beethoven mozart and schubert
he loved clynes playing of mozart and schubert calling clynes a blessed artist ein begnadeter k nstler in may einstein wrote clynes a personal letter by hand to help him in his forthcoming european tour
translation of einstein s letter dated princeton may dear mr
clynes i am truly grateful to you for the great enjoyment that your piano playing has given me
your performance combines a clear insight into the inner structure of the work of art with a rare spontaneity and freshness of conception
with all the secure mastery of your instrument your technique never supplants the artistic content as unfortunately so often is the case in our time
i am convinced that you will find the appreciation to which your achievement entitles you
with friendly greetings yours a
einstein
in helped by the letter from einstein clynes toured europe with great critical success playing the goldberg variations
the tour ended with a solo concert before an audience of at london s royal festival hall which had just been built
in to provide for his parents and to raise funds necessary to underwrite his musical career clynes on the basis of his scientific training took a job working with a new analog computer a device about which at the time both he and his interviewer were ignorant
in short order however clynes mastered that computer and then within a year created a new analytic method of stabilizing dynamical systems which he published as a paper in the ieee transactions
bogue the company he was working for doubled his salary after a year unasked
only in america was clynes reaction
he became a citizen in
in at clynes suggestion bogue employed his father then aged from australia as a naval architect the elder clynes had not been permitted to work in his profession in australia because he was not british born
for a time clynes father and son went to work together every morning to clynes rejoicing
as the result of a chance meeting in dr nathan s
kline director of the research center of rockland state hospital a large mental hospital offered clynes a substantial research job at the center where he in became chief research scientist
kline was to become the recipient of two lasker awards and had built up that research center to formidable renown
it is now called the nathan s
kline psychiatric center
an autodidact in physiology clynes applied dynamic systems analysis to the homeostatic and other control processes of the body so successfully in the next three years that he received a series of awards including for the best paper published in clynes annus mirabilis miracle year the ire w r g
baker award
in he invented the cat computer computer of average transients a portable computer permitting the extraction of responses from ongoing electric activity the needle in the haystack
the cat quickly came into use in research labs all over the world marketed by technical measurements corp advancing the study of the electric activity of the brain enabling for example the clinical detection of deafness in newborns
in this way clynes made his fortune by age
also in he discovered a biologic law unidirectional rate sensitivity the subject in of a two day symposium held by the new york academy of science
this law related to biologic communication channels of control and information is basically the consequence of the fact realized by clynes that molecules can only arrive in positive numbers unlike engineering electric signals which can be positive or negative
this fact imposes radical limitations on the methods of control that biology can use
it cannot for example simply cancel a signal by sending a signal of opposite polarity since there is no simple opposite polarity
to cancel a second channel involving other different molecules chemicals is required
this law explains among other things why the sensations of hot and cold need to operate through two separate sensing channels in the body why we do not actively sense the disappearance of a smell and why we continue to feel shocked after a near miss accident also in in collaboration with nathan s
kline clynes published the cyborg concept and its corollary participant evolution
cyborg became a household word and was misapplied much to the dismay of clynes in films such as terminator
cyborgology is now a field taught at numerous universities
in the university of melbourne awarded clynes the degree of d sc a degree superior to phd and rarely given by british universities
already in the new york times had noted clynes remarkable double stranded gifts
in he began to offer concerts at his newly acquired home on the hudson which had a real pipe organ in the living room and acres ha of land
with the financial stability resulting from his scientific discoveries it became possible for clynes to return to music
an ardent admirer of the great master musician pablo casals since early childhood clynes now attended all casals master classes many with his family
in clynes played both the diabelli variations of beethoven and bach s goldberg variations for casals and was invited to join casals in puerto rico for several months to take part in his music and to accompany some of the master classes at the casals home in santurce
clynes considered this contact with casals to be a fulfilment of his most cherished lifelong dream
casals exceeded his expectations in every way and clynes considered his friendship with casals to have been the highpoint of his life
as no one else casals had by clynes estimation an immediate contact with the profound in music
after his return to new york city clynes performed beethoven s fourth piano concerto and also gave several concerts at his mansion for invited audiences that included erich fromm
with his new cat computer clynes studied the relation of color processing in the brain and the dynamics to sound and jointly with m kohn to color of the pupil of the eye
he showed that brain electrical responses to the color red from previous black produced similar patterns from several distinct brain sites for all subjects
other colors produced their own distinct patterns
these results from went a long way to help dispel the skinnerian notion of tabula rasa
by he was able to show that it was possible to distinguish which of different objects a person was looking at from his electrical brain responses alone with repeated presentations
in other experiments in he described what he called the r m function from rest to motion detectable at the apex of the brain for various modalities of stimulation showing how two sets of unidirectionally rate sensitive urs channels in series could produce an effect corresponding to the mental concepts rest and motion
what could three urs channel sets do in combination he never found out
but here were the beginnings of the embodiments of mental concepts in a wordless manner a way of representing intuitive concepts to the brain wordlessly
his work until around had been concerned with the brain as an input device i e
for perception now he began to study it as an output device
he turned first to the question of the characteristic pulse in the music of various composers which had been on his mind since his princeton years
in clynes designed an instrument he called the sentograph to measure the motoric pulse
the experiments required outstanding musicians to conduct music on a pressure sensitive finger rest as they were thinking the music without sound
rudolf serkin and pablo casals were his first subjects
soon it became apparent that the pulse shapes for beethoven mozart schubert and mendelssohn were consistently different from each another but similar across their different pieces when normalized according to selection of similar tempo
encouraged by these positive findings relating outputs to specific inner states of the brain first presented at a smithsonian conference in at santa inez clynes then proceeded to measure the expressive form of specific emotions in a similar way by having subjects generate them by repeatedly expressing them on the finger rest thus finding specific signatures for the emotions which he called sentic forms
as in the case of composers pulses the form associated with each emotion consistently appeared for that emotion and was distinct from the forms of other emotions
in clynes whose work had long been supported by nih grants received a grant from the wenner gren foundation in sweden allowing him to collect data in central mexico japan and bali using the sentograph to investigate emotional expression cross culturally
though considerably more limited in scope than the nature of that inquiry would demand the data were largely confirmatory of clynes theories of universal biologically determined time forms for each emotion
at the invitation of the ny academy of sciences clynes wrote an extensive monograph on his findings and theories to date which the academy published in
that same year he accepted a visiting professorship in the music department of the university of california at san diego where he completed his book sentics the touch of emotion which he had begun in
in it he summarized the theories and findings on sentics and outlined hopes for the future that his work contained
in and the american association for the advancement of science held two symposia on sentics
since the sentic cycles suddenly helped individuals feel better without drugs clynes work was now deemed contrary to the line of research sponsored at the rockland state research center headed by nathan kline whose supporters were the major drug companies
as a result clynes was unable to continue the work at that facility
in his new environment there was no laboratory in which to amass new data
although dismissed by the ny times sentics was lauded extravagantly in other publications
the book is considered a classic today
it was read in manuscript with great approval and excitement by several authorities yehudi menuhin volunteered a foreword itself a remarkable document welcoming clynes as a brother rex hobcroft the director of the new south wales state conservatory in sydney the foremost musical institution in australia compared it to beethoven s opus the last of beethoven s sonatas and held to be his most profound work
hobcroft s endorsement appears on the jacket maharishi mahesh yogi s resident psychiatrist dr
bloomfield joined in
during his three years at ucsd in la jolla clynes gave a concert at brubecker hall playing the beethoven diabelli variations as well as a first performance of a group of songs he composed called sentone songs employing the remarkable vocal range of linda vickerman who performed them
the songs in his own avant garde style contained many varied syllables but no known words of any language
he did studies of laughter at the brain institute of ucla at that time unsuccessfully attempting to measure the electric counterpart in the brain of the moment that initiates laughter
he was the first to discover in studying voice recognition in that a speaker s identity though unimpeded by changes in speed tempo was masked by transposition of as little as a semitone in pitch
this seemed to indicate that perfect pitch was involved far more universally than thought possible
he began work on a book on laughter which however was only two thirds completed
in rex hobcroft director of sydney s new south wales state conservatory who had praised clynes sentics offered clynes a substantial position at the conservatory initially connected with the international piano competition held at the time in sydney
accordingly clynes moved to sydney in what proved to be the beginning of ten fruitful years of research and music making
in clynes gave performances of both the goldberg variations and the diabelli as well as works of mozart at the verbruggen hall in sydney
these performances were recorded live and are today regarded as unsurpassed
from a concertizing point of view there were unusual difficulties clynes two big city performances had not been preceded by the usual shake down cruise of smaller venues clynes had only one chance to get it right and did
hobcroft and the government of new south wales provided clynes with a music research center and staff at the conservatory for his work supplied be the state of nsw ministry of education
the staff were mostly enthusiasts of clynes work from the united states
the following year at the occasion of the th international congress on acoustics in sydney clynes and his staff presented no fewer than four papers
with the aid of his new dec pdp computer and associated oscillator gear he discovered the principle of predictive amplitude shaping a precise rule for how the shaping of each note is influenced by what note is next and when it will occur applicable to music in general a result he presented at an international conference in stockholm at their invitation
encouraged by the enthusiastic reception of this work in stockholm clynes on his return to sydney now made the major leap to discern how a composer s unique pulse is manifest in each note
it had been known leopold mozart c p e
bach that in the work of many composers of the classic period a group of say four notes when notated equally were not meant to be played equally
the leap was in treating the four durations and loudnesses not as separate entities but as a group an interconnected organism a face in which each component played a unique role but all combined together to form a gestalt
to find this gestalt and how it worked organically in the music he intuited a specific combined amplitude and timing warp so that each such group has a configuration a gestalt that is characteristic of the particular composer
now there was also a link to the motoric pulse previously identified which had contained no information about single notes but gave a motoric identity to the output of the brain in conducting music of a particular composer
the identification of composers pulse and its use in interpreting classical works via computer was later extended by clynes according to his knowledge and experience with dynamic forms to comprise several levels of time structure
shortly after this in clynes with the programming help of n
nettheim found a method of allowing computers to design vibrato suitable for each note depending on the musical structure also sometimes anticipating next events
further all these principles could be easily generically adjusted for the requirements of each musical piece
of course a work s interpretation was not robotically created the computer needed to get adjustments to correspond to the concept of the interpreter
the computer did not replace the human sensitivity it empowered it instead
when clynes longtime close friend and supporter hephzibah menuhin had launched his book sentics in in australia small symptoms of her developing throat cancer had made their first appearance
menuhin died in and clynes gave a memorial concert for her in the verbruggen hall of the last three sonatas of beethoven op and
he had learned beethoven s opus especially for that occasion never having performed it before
intensive practice resulted in his losing an exquisite living place in vaucluse and his subsequent relocation to an apartment in point piper an adjacent suburb in sydney
in clynes undertook further extensive studies on the nature of the expression of emotions through touch
subjects were touched on the palm of the hand from behind a screen with specific emotional expressions to discover whether they could identify the emotion
in fact they could
clynes and walker extended this work in a research trip to central australia to the yuendumu reservation to test if aborigines would recognize emotions expressed by touch of white urban dwellers when transformed into sounds that conserved the dynamic shape of the touch
the test was highly positive the aborigines did in fact successfully identify the emotions expressed by the touch of white urban subjects from which were produced through a simple transformation preserving the dynamic shape the sounds they heard
the american television program nova reenacted this experiment in effectively linking the expression of emotions through touch to musical expression using beethoven s eroica funeral march to exemplify grief and a haydn sonata for joy
in clynes gave his or anyone s first classical concert played entirely by computer according to the three principles he had discovered to a full house in a free concert at the joseph post hall of the sydney conservatory
as a result of the application of those principles the music ranging from bach to beethoven to robert schumann and felix mendelssohn was musically expressive and meaningful even though all sounds except for the piano were produced by computer controlled oscillators and so did not represent familiar instruments the real time expressive modification of the canonical orchestral sounds remained elusive until
in the fairlight company a maker of top of the line synthesizers in the hundred thousand dollar range immediately opted to license what they called the best sequencer in the world clynes at that time did not even know what a sequencer was
fairlight started paying royalties on the patent however not long afterwards the company went bankrupt having lost government subsidies through a change of government before bringing the product to market
reaching retirement age in sydney clynes left to be professorial associate in the psychology department at melbourne university and became sugden fellow at queen s college which he had attended as an undergraduate
he stayed for three years
during that time he found an analytic equation for an egg incorporating fractals which also provided with some modification of the equation beautiful shapes of flowers and of vases
he also performed as pianist in a sunday series at queens college twelve of the beethoven sonatas lecturing to the physics department on time starting with a poem beginning what time is it and to the medical faculty on the biologic nature of dynamic expressive forms
also during this period clynes undertook a large statistical study with various groups of the perception of composer s pulse
in the study clynes played four different pieces by computer by each of four different composers sixteen in all with what his studies had determined to be the composer s own pulse and three times the same with a wrong composer s pulse to see which one subjects actually preferred
there were four groups of subjects internationally well known pianists juilliard graduate students students at the manhattan school of music and college students at the university of melbourne altogether some subjects
the results published in the journal cognition showed that the correct pulse was preferred in all groups more pronouncedly so the higher the musical standing of the subjects
among the famous pianist subjects were friends of clynes vladimir ashkenazy and paul badura skoda
clynes returned to the united states in and settled in sonoma california
not long after his return he was featured in a large front page article of the wall street journal an outgrowth of his invitation to a canadian meeting on music
this highly favorable article opened many doors
two vice presidents from hewlett packard flew separately to clynes home to learn about his findings
when they arrived clynes played versions of the same mozart sonata k by six famous artists including vladimir horowitz alicia de larrocha claudio arrau and mitsuko uchida and included the computer performance at a random position among them
the visitors from hp not only could not identify the computer version but they rated it second best of the seven
midi versions were considered too musically crude to be included
as a result clynes received a development contract that would for the first time enable the expressive implementation of real instrumental sounds other than the piano using a workstation made available to him by hp a computer which was at mhz barely fast enough to do this
clynes enlisted his gifted son darius as software engineer on the hp team to help make it possible
nine months later a critical demonstration took place to show that the principles clynes had discovered would work well with real instruments not just with oscillators to enable music played with meaningful phrasing and expression
clynes and the assembled hp researchers first heard the sound of flute violin and cello from the hp workstation performing a haydn trio expressively in real time over the loudspeakers of the vast halls of the hp research building
the inanities of midi had been conquered
once clynes had successfully developed a real time implementation of his principles for musical interpretation via computer using unix hp gave clynes company microsound intl a second development contract to bring this capacity into the burgeoning world of personal computers pcs which in functioned at mhz
a french division of hp then in charge of pc development supported this enthusiastically
clynes was fortunate to obtain the help of steve sweet a programmer to carry out the conversion
however soon thereafter hp transferred the pc work to a new division in the united states whose director favored popular music
henceforth with the help of steve sweet clynes developed the software program called superconductor himself
by they had a fully working version incorporating all the new principles with which they interpreted first all the brandenburg concertos of bach and then all of bach s solo violin and cello works and the last six quartets of beethoven
all these works were recorded on cds
clynes further expanded superconductor s capacity for real life expressive interpretation of music with a fourth principle he called self tuning expressive intonation which unfixes the equal temperament tuning and permits the sharpening of the leading tone and other modifications of the sort executed by fine players of stringed instruments and other instruments whose intonation is actively controlled in the playing now even a piano could exhibit this technique by means of a laptop computer and synthesizer
since it is a melodic tuning depending on intervals no transposition was required
the same interval going up received a different small pitch increment from that interval going down
moreover similarly to known use in tones like the leading tone clynes found it appropriate to provide quite small specific increments to all melodic intervals in all twelve up and twelve different ones down
a new patent us was granted in
this now made it possible for all computers and synthesizers to benefit from expressive intonation a non static dynamic tuning in which the same note has a slightly different pitch depending on the melodic structure the demise of equal temperament
after a four year absence in thailand steve sweet returned to sonoma and resumed his development work with clynes incorporating the new functionality into superconductor ii
ref to mp s on the webpage of superconductor
with superconductor clynes performed beethoven s emperor concerto at mit s kresge auditorium in to the astonishment and wonder and thunderous applause of over two thousand people
in using self tuning expressive intonation he performed the schubert unfinished symphony and beethoven s eroica symphony at the university of vienna in the kleine konzertsaal
it became clynes aim gradually to make music better than had ever been possible before to empower the computer in an enterprise of historic proportions to incrementally improve and increase in profundity the musical interpretations of great works of our music heritage
with computers this work of increasing musical perfection could span years decades and even centuries
clynes has also kept up his own playing of the piano
in he gave a very substantial concert program of which a videotape exists as a memorial for a prominent resident of sonoma
the program included including liszt s sixth hungarian rhapsody campanella and beethoven s waldstein sonata as well as several major works of chopin
in at the age of clynes has developed new exercises for piano playing away from the piano which may permit the improvement of piano technique even for octogenarians
in he applied for three new patents related to superconductor to enhance computer interpretation of music through increased mathematical subtlety of note shaping and resulting timbre variations as earlier dependent on musical structure resulting in instant rehearseless conducting and importation of note specific vibrato and shaping from superconductor into midi files
patent numbers when available
clynes married in divorced in and has three children and eight grandchildren
he died in west nyack new york in january at the age of
