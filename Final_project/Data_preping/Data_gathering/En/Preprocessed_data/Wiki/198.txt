clynes wa subject front page article wall street journal september
clynes concentrated saw natural unalterable interlocking central nervous system basic expressive time form innate power form generate specific basic emotions
recognized familiar interlocking experience laughter yawning although scientific importance largely swept carpet skinnerian bias still largely is
according clynes's experimental research time form sentic form embodied central nervous system primary varied mode find expression sound touch gesture
clynes wa able prove systematically deriving sound subject expression emotion touch playing sound hearer culturally remote original subjects
one trial example aborigine central australia able correctly identify specific emotional quality sound derived touch white urban americans
clynes found confirmation existence biologically fixed universal primary dynamic form determine expression emotion give rise much experience within human societies
co-authored publication dr alicia heraz journal internet medical research demonstrate similar emotional pattern mobile phone force sensitivity
dynamic form appear shared animal time consciousness similar rate human hence intuition pet owner dog cat understands tone voice emotional form touch
anger love grief example according clynes clearly different dynamic expressive forms
importantly cardinal property inherent biologic communication language clynes finding closely expression follows precise dynamic form powerful generation corresponding emotion person expressing perceiver expression
hence presumably phenomenon charisma person whose performance emotional expression closely follows universal form
experience pablo casals confirmed clynes importance faithfulness natural dynamic form generating emotionally significant meaning musical performance
drawing finding clynes also developed applicationa simple touch art formin without music subject expressed repeated finger pressure sequence emotion timed according natural requirement sentic forms
minute sequence called sentic cycle comprises no-emotion anger hate grief love sexual desire joy reverence
many also evidenced progress alleviation depression degree tobacco alcohol addiction result repeated application process
thousand people experienced sentic cycle year even decades
especially clynes taught various group conduct sentic cycle own
early work developing sentic cycle convinced clynes also easy people proceed experiencing one emotion another quite rapidly
three four minute one emotion person tended satiated current emotion
ready switching next emotion quite fresh experience pointed existence specific receptor brain suggested become satiated particular neurohormone wa later confirmed identification number receptors
finding link well historic tendency composer vary emotion every minute compositions
anyone ha seen three charlie chaplin movie row testify laughter pall prolonged exposure seems reason
clynes also studied laughter nature's arrow appearance reality
nonderisive laughter according clynes small element disorder suddenly understood apparently disordered within actual larger order
predicted existence soundless laughter sound production replaced tactile pressure temporal pattern
study ucsd mean repetition ha's wa found approximately per second
clynes hypothesized couple unmatched speed laughter might readily compatible whose laughter wa harmoniously coordinated
clynes enthusiastically published realization love joy reverence always experienced capable generated precise expression accessible simple mean due connection biologic roots
music always special mean touch artform wa universally accessible
mean even negative emotion grief anger could enjoyed compassionate non-destructive framework
clynes started write poem found way book sentics

beginning embodiment mental concept wordless mannera way representing intuitive concept brain wordlessly
turned first question characteristic pulse music various composer mind since princeton years
clynes designed instrument called sentograph measure motoric pulse
experiment required outstanding musician conduct music pressure-sensitive finger rest thinking music without sound
soon became apparent pulse shape beethoven mozart schubert mendelssohn consistently different another similar across different piece normalized according selection similar tempo
encouraged positive finding relating output specific inner state brain first presented smithsonian conference santa inez clynes proceeded measure expressive form specific emotion similar way subject generate repeatedly expressing finger rest thus finding specific signature emotion called sentic forms
case composers' pulse form associated emotion consistently appeared emotion wa distinct form emotions
clynes whose work long supported nih grant received grant wenner gren foundation sweden allowing collect data central mexico japan bali using sentograph investigate emotional expression cross-culturally
though considerably limited scope nature inquiry would demand data largely confirmatory clynes' theory universal biologically determined time form emotion
