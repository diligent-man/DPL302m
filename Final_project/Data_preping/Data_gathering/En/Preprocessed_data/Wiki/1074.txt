It was launched in July 2014 to provide a platform for original video series which diverge from the MSNBC television network's political focus.
In July 2014, MSNBC.com launched msnbc2, a brand for several web-only series hosted by MSNBC personalities, in December 2014, msnbc2 was renamed shift by msnbc, with a daily live stream and programming schedule which was less focused on politics and is more tailored to a younger audience
