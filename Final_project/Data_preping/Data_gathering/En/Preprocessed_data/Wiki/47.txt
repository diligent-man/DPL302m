research funding is a term generally covering any funding for scientific research in the areas of natural science technology and social science
different methods can be used to disburse funding but the term often connotes funding obtained through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding
it is often measured via gross domestic expenditure on r d gerd
most research funding comes from two major sources corporations through research and development departments and government primarily carried out through universities and specialized government agencies often known as research councils
a smaller amount of scientific research is funded by charitable foundations especially in relation to developing cures for diseases such as cancer malaria and aids
according to the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd more than of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry and and respectively by universities and government
comparatively in countries with less gdp such as portugal and mexico the industry contribution is significantly lower
the government funding proportion in certain industries is higher and it dominates research in social science and humanities
in commercial research and development all but the most research oriented corporations focus more heavily on near term commercialization possibilities rather than blue sky ideas or technologies such as nuclear fusion
conducting research requires funds
over the past years funding for research has gone from a closed patronage system to which only few could contribute to an open system with multiple funding possibilities
in the early zhou dynasty c
th century to bce government officials used their resources to fund schools of thought of which they were patron
the bulk of their philosophies are still relevant including confucianism legalism and taoism
during the mayan empire c
scientific research was funded for religious purposes
the venus table is developed showing precise astronomical data about the position of venus in the sky
in cairo c
the mamluk sultan qalawun funded a monumental hospital patronizing the medical sciences over the religious sciences
furthermore tycho brahe was given an estate c
by his royal patron king frederik ii which was used to build uraniborg an early research institute
in scientific academies became central creators of scientific knowledge
funded by state sponsorship societies are still free to manage scientific developments
membership is exclusive in terms of gender race and class but academies open the world of research up beyond the traditional patronage system
in louis nicolas robert patents the paper machine
when he quarrels over invention ownership he seeks financing from the fourdrinier brothers
in th century europe businessmen financed the application of science to industry
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the industrial revolution most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual inventors using their own funds
a system of patents was developed to allow inventors a period of time often twenty years to commercialize their inventions and recoup a profit although in practice many found this difficult
the manhattan project had cost billion and employed people many of them scientists charged with producing the first nuclear weapons
in scientists signed the szilard petition asking president truman to make a demonstration of the power of the bomb before using it
most of the signers lost their jobs in military research
in the twentieth century scientific and technological research became increasingly systematized as corporations developed and discovered that continuous investment in research and development could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy
it remained the case however that imitation by competitors circumventing or simply flouting patents especially those registered abroad was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique or even in marketing
today many funders move towards transparent and accessible research outcomes through data repositories or open access mandates
some researchers turn to crowdfunding in search of new projects to fund
private and public foundations governments and others stand as an expansion of funding opportunities for researchers
as new funding sources become available the research community grows and becomes accessible to a wider and more diverse group of scientists
the guidelines for r d data collections are laid down in the frascati manual published by the oecd
in the publication r d denotes three type of activity basic research applied research and experimental development
this definition does not cover innovation but it may feed into the innovative process
business sector innovation has a dedicated oecd manual
the most frequently used measurement for r d is gross domestic expenditure on r d gerd gerd is often represented in gerd to gdp ratios as it allows for easier comparisons between countries
the data collection for gerd is based on reporting by performers
gerd differentiates according to the funding sector business enterprise government higher education private non profit rest of the world and the sector of performance all funding sectors with the exception of rest of the world as gerd only measures activity within the territory of a country
the two may coincide for example when government funds government performed r d
government funded science also may be measured by the government budget appropriations and outlays for r d gbaord gbard
gbard is a funder based method it denotes what governments committed to r d even if final payment might be different
gerd source of funding government and gbard are not directly comparable
on data collection gerd is performer based gbard is funder
the level of government considered also differs gerd should include spending by all levels of the government federal state local whereas gbard excludes the local level and often lacks state level data
on geographic coverage gerd takes into account performance within the territory of a country whereas gbard also payments to the rest of the world
comparisons on the effectiveness of both the different sources of funding and sectors of performance as well as their interplay have been made
the analysis often boils down to whether public and private finance show crowding in or crowding out patterns
public funding refers to activities financed by tax payers money
this is primarily the case when the source of funds is the government
higher education institutions are usually not completely publicly financed as they charge tuition fees and may receive funds from non public sources
r d is a costly and long term investment to which disruptions are harmful
the public sector has multiple reasons to fund science
the private sector is said to focus on the closer to the market stage of r d policy where appropriability hence private returns are high
basic research is weak on appropriability and so remains risky and under financed
consequently although governmental r d may provide support across the r d value chain it is often characterized as market failure induced intervention to maintain early stage research where incentives to invest are low
the theory of public goods seconds this argument
publicly funded research often supports research fields where social rate of return is higher than private rate of return often related to appropriability potential
the general free rider problem of public goods is a threat especially in case of global public goods such as climate change research which may lower incentives to invest by both the private sector but also other governments
in endogenous growth theories r d contributes to growth
some have depicted this relationship in the inverse claiming that growth drives innovation
recently tacit knowledge itself is said to be a source of economic driver internalized by science workers
when this knowledge and or human capital emigrates countries face the so called brain drain
science policy can assist to avoid this as large shares of governmental r d is spent on researchers and supporting staff personnel salaries
in this sense science funding is not only discretionary spending but also has elements of entitlement spending
r d funded and especially performed by the state may allow greater influence over its direction
this is particularly important in the case of r d contributing to public goods
however the ability of governments have been criticized over whether they are best positioned to pick winners and losers
in the eu dedicated safeguards have been enacted under a dedicated form of competition law called state aid
state aid safeguards business activities from governmental interventions
this invention was largely driven by the german ordoliberal school as to eliminate state subsidies advocated by the french dirigiste
threats to global public goods has refueled the debate on the role of governments beyond a mere market failure fixer the so called mission driven policies
governments may fund science through different instruments such as direct subsidies tax credits loans financial instruments regulatory measures public procurement etc
while direct subsidies have been the prominent instrument to fund business r d since the financial crisis a shift has taken place in oecd countries in the direction of tax breaks
the explanation seems to lay in the theoretical argument that firms know better and in the practical benefit of lower administrative burden of such schemes
depending on the funding type different modalities to distribute the funds may be used
for regulatory measures often the competition antitrust authorities will rule on exemptions
in case of block funding the funds may be directly allocated to given institutions such as higher education institutions with relative autonomy over their use
for competitive grants governments are often assisted by research councils to distribute the funds
research councils are usually public bodies that provide research funding in the form of research grants or scholarships
these include arts councils and research councils for the funding of science
an incomplete list of national and international pan disciplinary public research councils
in addition to project deliverables funders also increasingly introduce new eligibility requirements alongside traditional ones such as research integrity ethics
with the open science movement funding is increasingly tied to data management plans and making data fair
the open science requirement complements open access mandates which today are widespread
the gender dimension also gained ground in recent years
the european commission mandates applicants to adopt gender equality plans across their organization
the uk research and innovation global challenges research fund mandates a gender equality statement
most recently the european commission also introduced a do no significant harm principle to the framework program which aims to curb the environmental footprint of scientific projects
do no significant harm has been criticized as coupled with other eligibility requirements it is often characterized as red tape
the european commission has been trying to simplify the framework program for numerous years with limited success
simplification attempts are also taken by the uk research and innovation
often scientists apply for research funding which a granting agency may or may not approve to financially support
these grants require a lengthy process as the granting agency can inquire about the researcher s s background the facilities used the equipment needed the time involved and the overall potential of the scientific outcome
the process of grant writing and grant proposing is a somewhat delicate process for both the grantor and the grantee the grantors want to choose the research that best fits their scientific principles and the individual grantees want to apply for research in which they have the best chances but also in which they can build a body of work towards future scientific endeavors
the engineering and physical sciences research council in the united kingdom has devised an alternative method of fund distribution the sandpit
most universities have research administration offices to facilitate the interaction between the researcher and the granting agency
research administration is all about service service to our faculty to our academic units to the institution and to our sponsors
to be of service we first have to know what our customers want and then determine whether or not we are meeting those needs and expectations
in the united states of america the national council of university research administrators serves its members and advances the field of research administration through education and professional development programs the sharing of knowledge and experience and by fostering a professional collegial and respected community
in academic contexts hard money may refer to funding received from a government or other entity at regular intervals thus providing a steady inflow of financial resources to the beneficiary
the antonym soft money refers to funding provided only through competitive research grants and the writing of grant proposals
hard money is usually issued by the government for the advancement of certain projects or for the benefit of specific agencies
community healthcare for instance may be supported by the government by providing hard money
since funds are disbursed regularly and continuously the offices in charge of such projects are able to achieve their objectives more effectively than if they had been issued one time grants
individual jobs at a research institute may be classified as hard money positions or soft money positions the former are expected to provide job security because their funding is secure in the long term whereas individual soft money positions may come and go with fluctuations in the number of grants awarded to the institution
private funding for research comes from philanthropists crowd funding private companies non profit foundations and professional organizations
philanthropists and foundations have been pouring millions of dollars into a wide variety of scientific investigations including basic research discovery disease cures particle physics astronomy marine science and the environment
privately funded research has been adept at identifying important and transformative areas of scientific research
many large technology companies spend billions of dollars on research and development each year to gain an innovative advantage over their competitors though only about of this funding goes towards projects that are considered substantially new or capable of yielding radical breakthroughs
new scientific start up companies initially seek funding from crowd funding organizations venture capitalists and angel investors gathering preliminary results using rented facilities but aim to eventually become self sufficient
europe and the united states have both reiterated the need for further private funding within universities
the european commission highlights the need for private funding via research in policy areas such the european green deal and europe s role in the digital age
the source of funding may introduce conscious or unconscious biases into a researcher s work
this is highly problematic due to academic freedom in case of universities and regulatory capture in case of government funded r d
disclosure of potential conflicts of interest cois is used by journals to guarantee credibility and transparency of the scientific process
conflict of interest disclosure however is not systematically nor consistently dealt with by journals that publish scientific research results
when research is funded by the same agency that can be expected to gain from a favorable outcome there is a potential for biased results and research shows that results are indeed more favorable than would be expected from a more objective view of the evidence
a systematic review studied the scope and impact of industry sponsorship in biomedical research
the researchers found financial relationships among industry scientific investigators and academic institutions widespread
results showed a statistically significant association between industry sponsorship and pro industry conclusions and concluded that conflicts of interest arising from these ties can influence biomedical research in important ways
a british study found that a majority of the members on national and food policy committees receive funding from food companies
in an effort to cut costs the pharmaceutical industry has turned to the use of private nonacademic research groups i e contract research organizations cros which can do the work for less money than academic investigators
in cros came under criticism when the editors of major scientific journals issued a joint editorial published in each journal on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication of any studies in which their product did poorly
they further criticized the trial methodology stating that researchers are frequently restricted from contributing to the trial design accessing the raw data and interpreting the results
the cochrane collaboration a worldwide group that aims to provide compiled scientific evidence to aid well informed health care decisions conducts systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of health care interventions and tries to disseminate the results and conclusions derived from them
a few more recent reviews have also studied the results of non randomized observational studies
the systematic reviews are published in the cochrane library
a study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta analyses reviewed meta analyses and found that conflicts of interest in the studies underlying the meta analyses were rarely disclosed
the meta analyses reviewed an aggregate of randomized controlled trials
of these trials reported funding sources with industry funded
of the trials reported author disclosures of conflict of interest with studies disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors
however the information was seldom reflected in the meta analyses
only two reported funding sources and none reported author industry ties
the authors concluded without acknowledgment of coi due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from rcts included in meta analyses readers understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta analysis may be compromised
in researchers looked at the association between authors published positions on the safety and efficacy in assisting with weight loss of olestra a fat substitute manufactured by the procter gamble p g and their financial relationships with the food and beverage industry
they found that supportive authors were significantly more likely than critical or neutral authors to have financial relationships with p g and all authors disclosing an affiliation with p g were supportive
the authors of the study concluded because authors published opinions were associated with their financial relationships obtaining noncommercial funding may be more essential to maintaining objectivity than disclosing personal financial interests
a study in the journal nature surveyed us researchers who were all publicly funded by the national institutes of health
out of the scientists questioned admitted to altering design methodology or results of their studies due to pressure of an external funding source
private funding also may be chanelled to public funders
in a news story broke following the resignation of eric lander former director of the office of science and technology policy ostp at the biden administration that the charity of former google executive eric schmidt schmidt futures paid the salary of a number employees of the ostp
ethics inquiries were initiated in the ostp
the traditional measurement for efficiency of funding are publication output citation impact number of patents number of phds awarded etc
however the use of journal impact factor has generated a publish or perish culture and a theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly
calls have been made to reform research assessment most notably in the san francisco declaration on research assessment and the leiden manifesto for research metrics
the current system also has limitations to measure excellence in the global south
novel measurement systems such as the research quality plus has been put forward to better emphasize local knowledge and contextualization in the evaluation of excellence
another question is how to allocate funds to different disciplines institutions or researchers
a recent study by wayne walsh found that prestigious institutions had on average higher grant application success rates and larger award sizes whereas less prestigious institutions produced more publications and had a higher citation impact per dollar of funding
in endogenous growth theories r d contributes to economic growth
therefore countries have strong incentives to maintain investments in r d
different countries spend vastly different amounts on research in both absolute and relative terms
for instance south korea and israel spend more than of their gdp while many less developed countries spend less than
in developed economies gerd is financed mainly by the business sector whereas the government and the university sector dominates in less developed economies
in some countries funding from the rest of the world makes up of total gerd probably due to fdi and foreign aid but only in mali it is the main source of fund
private non profit is not the main source of fund in any countries but it reaches of total gerd in columbia and honduras
when comparing annual gerd and gdp growth it can be seen that countries with lower gerd are often growing faster
however as most of these countries are developping their growth is probably driven by other factors of production
on the other hand developed countries who have higher gerd also produce positive growth rates
gerd in these countries has a more substantial contribution to growth rate
in crisis business r d tends to act procyclically
as r d is a long term investments and so disruptions should be avoided keynesian countercyclical reactions were advocated for in the wake of the financial crisis but this was difficult to achieve for some countries
due to the nature of covid the pandemic accelerated publicly funded r d spending in primarily into the pharmaceutical industry
a fall is expected in spending for although not below levels
the pandemic made health research and sectors with strategic value chain dependencies the main target of science funding
