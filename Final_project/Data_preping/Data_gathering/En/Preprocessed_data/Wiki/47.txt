definition doe cover innovation may feed innovative process
frequently used measurement rd gross domestic expenditure rd gerd gerd often represented gerd-to-gdp ratio allows easier comparison countries
gerd differentiates according funding sector business enterprise government higher education private non-profit rest world sector performance funding sector exception rest world gerd measure activity within territory country
two may coincide example government fund government performed rd
government funded science also may measured government budget appropriation outlay rd gbaord gbard
gbard funder-based method denotes government committed rd even final payment might different
level government considered also differs gerd include spending level government federal state local whereas gbard excludes local level often lack state level data
geographic coverage gerd take account performance within territory country whereas gbard also payment rest world
comparison effectiveness different source funding sector performance well interplay made
analysis often boil whether public private finance show crowding-in crowding-out patterns
higher education institution usually completely publicly financed charge tuition fee may receive fund non-public sources
private sector said focus closer market stage rd policy appropriability hence private return high
consequently although governmental rd may provide support across rd value chain often characterized market failure induced intervention maintain early-stage research incentive invest low
publicly funded research often support research field social rate return higher private rate return often related appropriability potential
general free rider problem public good threat especially case global public good climate change research may lower incentive invest private sector also governments
recently tacit knowledge said source economic driver internalized science workers

sense science funding discretionary spending also ha element entitlement spending
rd funded especially performed state may allow greater influence direction
however ability government criticized whether best positioned pick winner losers
eu dedicated safeguard enacted dedicated form competition law called state aid
invention wa largely driven german ordoliberal school eliminate state subsidy advocated french dirigiste
threat global public good ha refueled debate role government beyond mere market failure fixer so-called mission-driven policies

explanation seems lay theoretical argument firm know better practical benefit lower administrative burden schemes
depending funding type different modality distribute fund may used
case block funding fund may directly allocated given institution higher education institution relative autonomy use
competitive grant government often assisted research council distribute funds
research council usually public body provide research funding form research grant scholarships

recently european commission also introduced significant harm principle framework program aim curb environmental footprint scientific projects
significant harm ha criticized coupled eligibility requirement often characterized red-tape
european commission ha trying simplify framework program numerous year limited success
often scientist apply research funding granting agency may may approve financially support
grant require lengthy process granting agency inquire researchers's background facility used equipment needed time involved overall potential scientific outcome
process grant writing grant proposing somewhat delicate process grantor grantee grantor want choose research best fit scientific principle individual grantee want apply research best chance also build body work towards future scientific endeavors

university research administration office facilitate interaction researcher granting agency
research administration serviceservice faculty academic unit institution sponsors
service first know customer want determine whether meeting need expectations
united state america national council university research administrator serf member advance field research administration education professional development program sharing knowledge experience fostering professional collegial respected community
academic context hard money may refer funding received government entity regular interval thus providing steady inflow financial resource beneficiary
antonym soft money refers funding provided competitive research grant writing grant proposals
hard money usually issued government advancement certain project benefit specific agencies
community healthcare instance may supported government providing hard money
since fund disbursed regularly continuously office charge project able achieve objective effectively issued one-time grants
individual job research institute may classified hard-money position soft-money position former expected provide job security funding secure long term whereas individual soft-money position may come go fluctuation number grant awarded institution
private funding research come philanthropist crowd-funding private company non-profit foundation professional organizations
philanthropist foundation pouring million dollar wide variety scientific investigation including basic research discovery disease cure particle physic astronomy marine science environment
privately funded research ha adept identifying important transformative area scientific research
many large technology company spend billion dollar research development year gain innovative advantage competitor though funding go towards project considered substantially new capable yielding radical breakthroughs

another question allocate fund different discipline institution researchers
recent study wayne walsh found prestigious institution average higher grant application success rate larger award size whereas less-prestigious institution produced publication higher citation impact per dollar funding
different country spend vastly different amount research absolute relative terms
instance south korea israel spend gdp many le developed country spend le than
developed economy gerd financed mainly business sector whereas government university sector dominates less-developed economies
country funding rest world make total gerd probably due fdi foreign aid mali main source fund
private non-profit main source fund country reach total gerd columbia honduras
comparing annual gerd gdp growth seen country lower gerd often growing faster
however country developping growth probably driven factor production
hand developed country higher gerd also produce positive growth rates
