it was digitally released as a promotional single two days later
all the ways was used in a target marketing campaign
she delayed the august scheduled release of treat myself to january because she wanted to add more songs to it though it was not released on that date either
in february trainor announced the release of an ep called the love train describing it as something of an appetizer to treat myself

she was sitting on a couch with him one day and asked him do you love me to which he replied yes the singer said tell me all the ways to which sabara responded all the ways
the song was trainor s attempt to use the line in a song and make everyone get it
according to her it has a big chorus which was inspired by the work of abba a concept that she wanted to execute without making it sound cheesy but rather timeless
all the ways a perky pop song that runs for the duration of minutes and seconds sees trainor laying down the law
her vocals in the verses were described as coos with mike wass of idolator adding that the singer playfully chides in the chorus if you love me love me love me like you say darling tell me all the ways
tell me all the ways
billboard s rita thompson described all the ways as melodic and upbeat adding that its release ensured that fans have another fun danceable track to fall in love with before the lp drops
