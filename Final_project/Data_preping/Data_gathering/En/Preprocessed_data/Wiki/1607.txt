Fuller held assistant and associate professorships at the University of Colorado at Boulder Virginia Tech and the University of Pittsburgh In he was appointed to the chair in sociology and social policy at the University of Durham England He moved in to the University of Warwick England In July Fuller was awarded a D Litt by Warwick in recognition of published work or papers which demonstrate a high standard of important original work forming a major contribution to a subject In Fuller served as President of the Sociology section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science In that capacity he staged a play Lincoln and Darwin—Live for One Night Only at the BA's annual Festival of Science in Liverpool The play was later produced as a podcast in Australia
Fuller has been a visiting professor in Denmark Germany Israel Japan Netherlands Norway Sweden where he held a Fulbright Professorship in at Gothenburg University and the United States UCLA
In Fuller became a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity at the University of North Texas In the University of Warwick appointed him to the Auguste Comte Chair in Social Epistemology In Fuller was appointed a Fellow of the UK Academy of Social Sciences In he was appointed to an Honorary Professorship at Dalian University of Technology China In he was made a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in Division I Humanities
Fuller is most closely associated with social epistemology as an interdisciplinary research program Social epistemology is a normative discipline that addresses philosophical problems of knowledge using the tools of history and the social sciences Fuller founded the first journal and wrote the first book devoted to this topic The most obvious feature of Fuller's approach already present in his book is that he rejects out of hand the Cartesian problem of skepticism
Along with books Fuller has written book chapters academic articles and many minor pieces He has given many distinguished lectures and plenary addresses and has presented to academic and non academic audiences throughout the world including over media interviews His works have been translated into fifteen languages academic symposia have been published on his work He moved to the United Kingdom in the year he organized a conference in Durham on Science's Social Standing
Since moving to the UK Fuller has increasingly oriented himself towards public intellectual expression including television radio and internet which he interprets as a natural outgrowth of his version of social epistemology Two of his books have been recognized in this regard Kuhn vs Popper was Book of the Month for February in the US mass circulation magazine Popular Science However Rupert Read wrote I did not have to read far into this book in order to conclude that it is worthless In sum this book offers only a cartoon opposition of a fake 'Popper' to a fake 'Kuhn' Fuller responded coining the word Kuhnenstein Kuhn + Wittgenstein to capture Read's view of Kuhn which Fuller calls a figment of Read's and other's fertile imagination The Intellectual was selected as a Book of the Year in by the UK liberal left magazine New Statesman He periodically contributes a column to the Project Syndicate associated with George Soros' Open Society project which appears in several languages in newspapers across the world In he also taught a course on the epistemology of journalism at an international summer school at the University of Lund Sweden
Fuller believes modeled on what he takes to be the German model that academic freedom is a freedom reserved for academics not a special case of freedom of speech This includes the right to cause reasoned offence if within the terms of reason and evidence appropriate to the academic profession He believes it important for academics to be able to express intellectual opinions for further debate which can result in progress He also argues that students are equally entitled to academic freedom
Fuller has made many statements about his support for the teaching of intelligent design ID and authored two books on the subject In in the case of Kitzmiller v Dover Area School District he testified on behalf of a local school system in the United States that required the teaching of intelligent design The decision of the US District Court held that intelligent design was a form of creationism and that its inclusion in the curriculum violated the US Constitution's prohibition on the establishment of religion The decision repeatedly cited Fuller's testimony to undermine the school system's position Some of Fuller's critics within the Science and Technology Studies community described his participation in the trial as naïve and suggested that the field needs further development before it can constructively engage the legal community on the nature of science
Fuller has said that he does not support intelligent design but feels that it should have a 'fair run for its money' In his book Dissent over Descent he says he sees religion in general as a motivating influence in scientific pursuits and believes that the difference between science and religion is more institutional than intellectual Critics have called his views on science postmodernist though others characterize them as more closely related to social constructionism
On February Fuller debated Lewis Wolpert at Royal Holloway University of London on whether evolution and intelligent design should be accorded equal status as scientific theories Fuller supported the proposition Fuller endorsed a work in support of Intelligent Design the Discovery Institute's textbook Explore Evolution The Arguments For and Against Neo Darwinism
Appearing in the film Expelled No Intelligence Allowed Fuller told an interviewer
Fuller openly acknowledges that while some people simply do not like or accept either 'design in nature' or that human beings were created in the image and likeness of God imago Dei many people do and that it has been a consistent fixture in the progress development and motivation for doing modern science
Much of his work focuses on questions around technological enhancements and how they can improve the capacities of human beings Fuller argues that the pursuit for enhancements is based on a need ″to create some distance between ourselves and the other animals″ For Fuller transhumanism offers humanity the prospect to re engineer the human body to enable us to live longer so as to work and play harder
He featured in the documentary The Future of Work and Death
In Fuller wrote Science Vs Religion Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution In addition to introduction and conclusion chapters it has chapters on the history of the relationship between religion and science the thesis that modern science has its basis in an attempt by humanity to transcend itself and reach God how Fuller believes complexity distinguishes ID from other versions of creationism legal issues and the future of Darwinism
Professor of mathematics at Rutgers University Norman Levitt in a review described it as a truly miserable piece of work crammed with errors scientific historical and even theological Levitt took issue with the following points
Fuller's acceptance at face value of William Dembski's claims on complexity and randomness and his failure to come to grips with the wealth of results that this field has generated and with the trenchant criticism of Dembski's claims or even to describe these claims accurately
Fuller's disparagement of evolutionary biology without doing serious analysis of the working methods and logical structure of biology itself on which to base it
Fuller's misrepresentation of Isaac Newton's religious beliefs in order to make a point that is in fact antithetical to Newton's viewsLevitt infers that Fuller's views arise from an animosity to science as such and to its cognitive authority that still pervades academic life outside the dominion of the science faculty
Fuller later responded to these points accusing Levitt of axe grinding and questioning his understanding of the book which Fuller claimed was less a defense of contemporary intelligent design theory than a demonstration of its rootedness in the history of science Fuller also claims that Levitt misquotes one of the three passages Levitt cites from the book making it mean the opposite of the original Levitt subsequently responded at length to Fuller concluding that Fuller's misreading of the politics that generated and sustains the ID movement is so complete as to constitute a peculiar pathology all its own Fuller has long been highly critical of the views of science of his opponents in the Science Wars including Levitt dating back at least to
Sahotra Sarkar a philosophy professor and integrative biologist at the University of Texas at Austin also criticized Fuller's book for presenting an analysis of the intellectual disputes over contemporary ID creationism that is almost vacuous Sarkar further states that the book has an idiosyncratic interpretation of the history of philosophy including of Kant and of logical positivism having a limited grasp of the history of science including making claims about Newton Cuvier Agassiz Lamarck Mendel Pearson and Galton that are not supported by their writings failure to engage the debate over naturalism that ID creationism has generated with remarks on supernaturalism that show him to be equally non cognizant of the work of Philip Johnson and other scientific errors
In Fuller's book on the intelligent design controversy Dissent Over Descent Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism was published Steven Poole of The Guardian wrote book is an epoch hopping parade of straw men incompetent reasoning and outright gibberish as when evolution is argued to share with astrology a commitment to action at a distance except that the distance is in time rather than space It's intellectual quackery like this that gives philosophy of science a bad name Michael Ruse Philosopher of Science at Florida State University wrote in the journal Science that Fuller's book is completely wrong and is backed by no sound scholarship whatsoever In at least one case Fuller makes his case by an egregious misreading—of something I wrote about the role of genetic drift in Sewall Wright's shifting balance theory For the record Charles Darwin set out to provide a cause what he called—following his mentors like William Whewell who in turn referred back to Newton—a true cause or vera causa Darwin felt and historians and philosophers of science as well as practicing evolutionary biologists still feel that he succeeded… In a book of the week review by retired Divinity Professor Keith Ward in the Times Higher Education Supplement the book was praised for providing often overlooked information and provocative interpretations but was criticized for a number of inaccuracies and misrepresentations
A C Grayling in New Humanist wrote that the book contains a mark of ignorance and historical short sightedness on Fuller's part In response Fuller wrote an online response saying if Grayling's grasp of the history of science went beyond head banging standards he would realize that our current level of scientific achievement would never have been reached and more importantly that we would not be striving to achieve more had chance based explanations dominated over the design based ones in our thinking about reality To which Grayling wrote Steve Fuller complains as do all authors whose books are panned that I did not read his book properly or at all He continued I'll take on Fuller any day regarding the history and theology of the various versions of Christianity with which humanity has been burdened … The same applies to the history of science
