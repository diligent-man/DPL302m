The Law of Jante Danish Janteloven j nt l w n l w is a code of conduct created in fiction by the Danish Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose and has been assumed by some to explain the egalitarian nature of Nordic countries It characterizes as unworthy and inappropriate any behavior that is not conforming does things out of the ordinary or is personally ambitious The attitudes were first formulated in the form of the ten rules in Sandemose's satirical novel A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks En flyktning krysser sitt spor but the actual attitudes themselves are older Sandemose portrays the fictional small Danish town of Jante which he modeled upon his native town Nyk bing Mors in the s where nobody was anonymous a feature of life typical of small towns
It is used generally in colloquial speech in the Nordic countries as a sociological term to denote a social attitude of disapproval towards expressions of individuality and personal success
There are ten rules in the law as defined by Sandemose all expressive of variations on a single theme and usually referred to as a homogeneous unit You are not to think you're anyone special or that you're better than us
You're not to think you are anything special
You're not to think you are as good as we are
You're not to think you are smarter than we are
You're not to imagine yourself better than we are
You're not to think you know more than we do
You're not to think you are more important than we are
You're not to think you are good at anything
You're not to laugh at us
You're not to think anyone cares about you
You're not to think you can teach us anything The Janters who transgress this unwritten 'law' are regarded with suspicion and some hostility as it goes against the town's communal desire to preserve harmony social stability and uniformity
An eleventh rule recognized in the novel as 'the penal code of Jante' is
From the chapter Maybe you don't think I know something about you
That one sentence the eleventh rule which acts as the penal code of Jante as such was rich in content It was a charge of all sorts of things and that it also had to be because absolutely nothing was allowed It was also an elaborate indictment with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected Furthermore it was useful depending fully on tone of voice in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts and it could also be the best means of defense Sandemose's novel described working class life in the fictional town of Jante He wrote in a bit mischievously that Many people have recognized in Jante their own hometown this has happened regularly to people from Arendal Norway Troms Norway and Viborg Denmark Sandemose made no claim to having invented the rules he simply sought to formulate social norms that had stamped the Danish and Norwegian psyches for centuries
Although intended as criticism of society in general some critics in the 's argued that the Law of Jante had shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position
It is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish Norwegian or Swedish The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes It is commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected
While the original intention was as satire Kim Orlin Kantardjiev a Norwegian politician and educational advisor claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools as more of a social code to encourage group behavior and wants to credit it with fueling Nordic countries' high happiness scores It has also been suggested that contentedness with a humdrum lifestyle is a part of happiness in the Scandinavian countries
However in Scandinavia there have also been journalistic articles which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates Backlash has occurred against the rules and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws declaring them dead in However others have questioned whether they will ever go away as they may be firmly entrenched in society
When interviewed during episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert broadcast November Swedish actor Alexander Skarsg rd explained that although he had recently received an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for a lauded performance the inhibitions induced by the Law of Jante prevented him from boasting of the accolade
