A procession is an organized body of people walking in a formal or ceremonial manner
Processions have in all peoples and at all times been a natural form of public celebration as forming an orderly and impressive ceremony
Religious and triumphal processions are abundantly illustrated by ancient monuments eg
the religious processions of Egypt those illustrated by the rock-carvings of Boghaz-Keui the many representations of processions in Greek art culminating in the great Panathenaic procession of the Parthenon Frieze and Roman triumphal reliefs such as those of the arch of Titus
Processions played a prominent part in the great festivals of Greece where they were always religious in character
The games were either opened or accompanied by more or less elaborate processions and sacrifices while processions from the earliest times formed part of the worhsip of the old nature gods as those connected with the cult of Dionysus and the Phallic processions and later formed an essential part of the celebration of the great religious festivals eg
the processions of the Thesmophoria and that of the Great Dionysia and of the mysteries eg
the great procession from Athens to Eleusis in connection with the Eleusinia
The most prominent of the Roman processions was that of the Triumph which had its origin in the return of a victorious army headed by their general who accompanied by the army captives spoils the chief magistrate priests bearing the images of the gods amidst strewing of flowers burning of incense and the like Ovid Trist
and proceeded in great pomp from the Campus to the Capitol to offer sacrifice
Connected with the triumph was the pompa circensis or solemn procession that preceded the games in the circus
It first came into use at the Ludi Romani when the games were preceded by a great procession from the Capitol to the Circus
The praetor or consul who appeared in the ponipa circensis wore the robes of a triumphing general see Mommsen Staatsreczt I
for the connection of the triumph with the ludi
Thus when it became customary for the consul to celebrate games at the opening of the consular year he came under the empire to appear in triumphal robes in the processus consularis or procession of the consul to the Capitol to sacrifice to Jupiter
After the ascendency of Christianity in the Roman Empire the consular processions in Constantinople retained their religious character now proceeding to Hagia Sophia where prayers and offerings were made but in Rome where Christianity was not so widely spread among the upper classes at first the tendency was to convert the procession into a purely civil function omitting the pagan rites and prayers without substituting Christian ones
Only after Theodosius did the processions become a religious event replete with icons crosses and banners
There were other local processions connected with the primitive worship of the country people which remained unchanged but they were eventually overshadowed by the popular piety of the Church
Such were those of the Ambarvalia Robigalia which were essentially rustic festivals lustrations of the fields consisting in a procession round the spot to be purified leading the sacrificial victims with prayers hymns and ceremonies to protect the young crops from evil influence
Tertullian nd century uses processio and procedere in the sense of to go out appear in public and as applied to a church function processio was first used in the same way as collecta ie
for the assembly of the people in a church
In this sense it appears to be used by Pope Leo I while in the version by Dionysius Exiguus of the th canon of the Council of Laodicea about Ancient Greek σονάξεσι is translated by processionibus
For the processions that formed part of the ritual of the Eucharist those of the introit the gospel and the oblation the earliest records date from the th century and even later but they evidently were established at a much earlier date
As to public processions these seem to have come into rapid vogue after the recognition of Christianity as the religion of the empire
Those at Jerusalem would seem to have been long established when described by the author of the Peregrinatio Sylviae towards the end of the th century
Very early were the processions accompanied by hymns and prayers known as litaniae rogationes or supplicationes
It is to such a procession that reference appears to be made in a letter of St Basil which would thus be the first recorded mention of a public Christian procession
The first mention for the Western Church occurs in St Ambrose
In both these cases the litanies are stated to have been long in use
There is also mention of a procession accompanied by hymns organized at Constantinople by St John Chrysostom c
in opposition to a procession of Arians in Sozomen
Some liturgists maintain that the early Church in its processions followed Old Testament precedents quoting such cases as the procession of the ark round the walls of Jericho the procession of David with the ark the processions of thanksgiving on the return from captivity c
The liturgy of the early Church as Duchesne shows was influenced by that of the Jewish synagogue but the theory that the Church's processions were directly related to the Old Testament ritual is of later origin
In times of calamity litanies were held in which the people walked in robes of penitence fasting barefooted and in later times frequently dressed in black litaniae nigrae
The cross was carried at the head of the procession and often the gospel and the relics of the saint were carried
Gregory of Tours gives numerous instances of such litanies in time of calamity thus he describes a procession of the clergy and people round the city in which relics of St Remigius were carried and litanies chanted in order to avert the plague
So too Gregory the Great writes to the Sicilian bishops to hold processions to prevent a threatened invasion of Sicily
A famous instance of these penitential litanies is the litania septiformis ordered by Gregory the Great in the year when Rome had been inundated and pestilence had followed
In this litany seven processions of clergy laymen monks nuns matrons the poor and children respectively starting from seven different churches proceeded to hear mass at St
This litany has often been confused with the litania major introduced at Rome in vide supra but is quite distinct from it
Funeral processions accompanied with singing and the carrying of lighted tapers were very early customary see ceremonial use of lights and akin to these also very early were the processions connected with the translation of the relics of martyrs from their original burying place to the church where they were to be enshrined
From the time of the emperor Constantine I these processions were of great magnificence
Festivals involving processions were adopted by the Catholic Church from the pre-Christian Roman festive calendar
The litaniae majores et minores which are stated by Hermann Usener to have been first instituted by Pope Liberius -
It is generally acknowledged that they are the equivalent of the Catholic Church of the Roman lustrations of the crops in spring the Ambarvalia c
The litania major or great procession on St Mark's day April is shown to coincide both in date and ritual with the Roman Robigalia which took place ad
Mai and consisted in a procession leaving Rome by the Flaminian gate and proceeding by way of the Milvian bridge to a sanctuary at the th milestone of the Via Claudia where the flamen quirinalis sacrificed a dog and a sheep to avert blight robigo from the crops
The litania major followed the same route as far as the Milvian bridge when it turned off and returned to St Peter's where mass was celebrated
This was already established as an annual festival by as is shown by a document of Gregory the Great that inculcates the duty of celebrating litaniam quae major ab omnibus appellatur
The litaniae minores or rogations held on the three days preceding Ascension Day were first introduced into Gaul by Bishop Mamertus of Vienne c
and made binding for all Gaul by the First Council of Orlans
The litaniae minores were also adopted for these three days in Rome by Pope Leo III c
A description of the institution and character of the Ascensiontide rogations is given by Sidonius Apollinaris
The solemnity of these he says was first established by Mamertus
Hitherto they had been erratic lukewarm and poorly attended vagae tepentes infrequentesque
Those he instituted were characterized by fasting prayers psalms and tears
In the Ambrosian rite the rogations take place after Ascension and in the Spanish on the Thursday to Saturday after Whitsuntide and in November Synod of Girona
The element of ritual was prominent in early modern Catholicism even after Luther's critique of the empty rituals in late medieval Christianity
There were processions to commemorate almost all the holiday
Though th-century Church reformers made strides to simplify the liturgical year and its complex web of holidays festivals and processions these practices remained as essential to Catholic ritual traditions in as they had been in the th-century
After the number of processions was on the rise as processions became as essential to the observance of feast days as Catholic Mass
Some processions were tied to agricultural lifestyles while others were pilgrimages to shrines and holy places or to develop ties with other parishes
During the Reformation the Herrenjahr was central to the liturgical practices of Catholicism
Beginning with the Christmas season from Advent to Epiphany and followed by the feasts of Easter Passiontide and the post-Easter feasts Pentecost Pfingsten Trinity Sunday Kreuzwoche Week of the Cross and Corpus Christi
In the early th century there were eleven processions of note at the village of Ettenkirch near Lake Constance
These processions could travel to destinations as far as two hours away
Monthly processions took place around the Church and on All Souls' Day and Palm Sunday
Corpus Christi Fronleichnam was one of the most elaborate
Ascension Day Christi Himmelfahrt was another important ceremony that held strong anti-Protestant meaning
In Herbolzheim the procession involved villagers flying flags crosses held high singing and loudly recited prayers as they passed near neighboring Protestant villages
When the Bishop of Strasbourg forbade the Ascension Day procession in believing the practice would create conflict with Protestants in neighboring towns the Rhine Valley villagers protested
One of the effects of the Tridentine reform was to ensure that the variety of devotions that sprang up in ecclesiastically fragmented parts of Europe were connected with the rituals of the Catholic Church
The Josephine Reforms banned Good Friday processions with costumed figures and palmesel processions for Palm Sunday but some still went on
On Palm Sunday villagers carried green branches re-enacting Christ's entry into Jerusalem and Palmesel processions still took place with a representation of Christ on a donkey
The parish of Niederwihl claimed possession of a piece of the True Cross and by the th-century had introduced new processions for the Discovery of the True Cross May and the Elevation of the True Cross September
The relic would be carried by the townspeople for processions through their agricultural fields integrating a Counter-Reformation devotional theme with the ancient fertility rites of the townsfolk's rural religion
The Story of the Stone written in the th century contains a description of the procession accompanying an Imperial Concubine
Many elements may be used to make a procession more significant than just people walking in the same direction
A special mode of transport such as a ceremonial barge elephant howdah horse-drawn carriage or a palanquin carried on the shoulders of others
Cleopatra's arrival to seduce Mark Antony on a perfumed barge has taken on legendary proportion
African kings sometimes ride in palanquins carved to look like luxury cars or other status symbols while Muslim brides travel in camel howdahs as shown in Bride Arriving in a Village Biskra Algeria by Philippe Pavy
The Pope has traditionally been carried in a special sedan chair known as the sedia gestatoria
In humbler terms a mayor grand marshal or fair queen of a local parade will often ride in the town's fanciest automobile
Music including everything from the choir of a church procession to the marching band of a military procession
Criers may march before the procession yelling to clear the way for it
Some high school homecoming parades include trucks filled with people who do nothing but make as much noise as possible
Order of precedence even without showy display a group of people walking forward may be said to form a procession if their order and placement clearly visualize a hierarchy or symbiotic relationship
For instance one's nearness to the king or others of high rank had important political connotations when the royal family walked to or from chapel services at the palace of Versailles
Similarly precedence came into play when the grandest Edwardian parties progressed from the sitting room to the dining room and the stylized movement and hierarchy of marching military units clearly sets up a formal procession
Bearers of banners fans icons treasure or other eye-catching items or leading exotic animals
This was a very important part of Roman triumphs as booty gave the Roman populace visual proof of the warrior's success
The most elaborate evolution of this is the spectacular floats of Carnival parades
A simpler example is the ring bearer at a wedding
Scent provided by flower bearers or censers of incense
Skilled performers such as acrobats or dancers
Special costume traditionally the costumes of acolytes footmen ceremonial guards or slaves help show off the wealth of the person staging a procession
An ornate example was the embroidered train of George IV of the United Kingdom carried at his coronation by nine lords in waiting with their own matching silken clothes capes ruffs and plumed hats
Other examples include the Swiss Guard and high vestments of the Pope
The formal matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony
In egalitarian times and places whoever has taken the time and money to put together something impressive may appear in a parade such costumes are of course the focal point of Halloween parades such as that staged in Greenwich Village New York
Finally processions may be staged simply to show off the costumes as one part of a larger event such as at fashion pageants military reenactments pop concerts or Renaissance Festivals
Special lighting candlelight vigils for the deceased or to show political solidarity often include a candlelit procession
Fireworks illuminate such diverse events as coronations parades and Thai royal barge processions
Spectacle such as an aircraft flyover or the confetti of New York ticker tape parades
The dispensing of gifts at one time often food or money
Today most people are familiar with the dispensing of beads at Mardi Gras and the throwing of candy at local fair paradesEdo-period documenters enjoyed drawing the processions of pleasure district beauties such as Courtesan Parading With Attendants by Suzuki Harunobu
Similar parading courtesans feature in Cherry Blossom in the Evening on the Nakanomachi in Yoshiwara by Utagawa Hiroshige and True Scenery of the Gay Quarter of Minatozakimachi Shinminato by Utagawa Sadahide
The Lord Mayor's Show in London has long featured displays by the city's official trade guilds

Such as ancient Roman triumphs the durbar processions of India and modern reviewing of the troops by generals and heads of state
Return From Vienna a painting by Jozef Brandt shows war booty taken from the Turks being escorted into eastern Europe by soldiers
Some processions are arranged for entertainment purely for fun such as those of community organizations and friendly societies so popular in Great Britain and the United States of America
Religious ceremonies have since prehistory employed the procession of holy objects to inspire solidarity of belief
The Doges of Venice once staged elaborate barge processions to bless the waters on which Venice's tightly controlled maritime economy depended
Processions used to mark the beginning or end of an event such as parades at the beginning of county fairs or at the Olympic Games or processions that begin and end funerals graduations and weddings
Processions are found in almost every form of religious worship such as Holy Week processions
Some biblical examples were the processions with the Ark of Covenant and the procession of Jesus on a donkey into Jerusalem
In a narrower sense of going forth proceeding the term is used in the technical language of theology in the phrase Procession of the Holy Ghost expressing the relation of the Third Person in the Triune Godhead to the Father and the Son
It is impossible to describe in detail the vast development of processions during the Middle Ages
The most important and characteristic of these still have a place in the ritual of the Catholic Church as well as those of the Church of England and the Orthodox Church

The observance or variation of the discipline belongs to the Congregation of Rites in pontifical processions which are regulated by the masters of the ceremonies magistri ceremoniarum pontificalium these points are decided by the chief cardinal deacon
As to processions within the churches some difference of opinion having arisen as to the regulating authority the Congregation of Rites has decided that the bishop must ask though not necessarily follow the advice of the chapter in their regulation
The Reformation abolished in all Protestant countries those processions associated with the doctrine of transubstantiation Corpus Christi the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the th Article of Religion of the Church of England was not by Christ's ordinance reserved carried about lifted up or worshiped
It also abolished those associated with the cult of the Blessed Virgin and the saints
The stern simplicity of Calvinism indeed would not tolerate religious processions of any kind and from the Reformed Churches they vanished altogether
The more conservative temper of the Anglican and Lutheran communions however suffered the retention of such processions as did not conflict with the reformed doctrines though even in these Churches they met with opposition and tended after a while to fall into disuse
Liturgical processions were revived in the Church of England by the members of the Oxford Movement during the th century
In Ritual Notes an Anglo-Catholic liturgical manual it is stated that A solemn procession as part of the ceremony proper to the occasion is ordered to be held respectively at Candlemas on Palm Sunday at the Rogations ie
on April th and the three days preceding Ascension and on Corpus Christi A procession is a distinct act of worship in itself though it is desirable and accords with ancient practice that it should have a definite purpose such as to commemorate some notable event or to honour the Blessed Sacrament
The Lutheran practice has varied at different times and in different countries
Thus according to the Wrttemberg Kirchenordnung of a funeral procession was prescribed the bier being followed by the congregation singing hymns the Brandenburg Kirchenordnung directed a cross-bearer to precede the procession and lighted candles to be carried and this was prescribed also by the Waldeck Kirchenordnung of
At present funeral processions survive in general only in the country districts the processional cross or crucifix is still carried
In some provinces also the Lutheran Church has retained the ancient rogation processions in the week before Whitsuntide and in some cases in the month of May or on special occasions eg
days of humiliation Busstage processions about the fields to ask a blessing on the crops
On these occasions the ancient litanies are still used
