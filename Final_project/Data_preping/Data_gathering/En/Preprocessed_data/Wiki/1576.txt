the first classified edition of factbook was published in august and the first unclassified version in june
the world factbook was first available to the public in print in
in the cia discontinued printing the factbook themselves instead turning printing responsibilities over to the government printing office

others
places set apart from the list of independent countries
currently there are two taiwan and the european union
dependencies and areas of special sovereignty
places affiliated with another country
they may be subcategorized by affiliated country
australia entities
china entities
denmark entities
france entities
netherlands entities
new zealand entities
norway entities
united kingdom entities
united states entitiesmiscellaneous
antarctica and places in dispute
there are six such entities
other entities
the world and the oceans
there are five oceans and the world the world entry is intended as a summary of the other entries specific regions within a country or areas in dispute among countries such as kashmir are not covered but other areas of the world whose status is disputed such as the spratly islands have entries
subnational areas of countries such as u s
states or the canadian provinces and territories are not included in the factbook
instead users looking for information about subnational areas are referred to a comprehensive encyclopedia for their reference needs
this criterion was invoked in the and editions with the decision to drop the entries for french guiana guadeloupe martinique mayotte and reunion
they were dropped because besides being overseas departments they were now overseas regions and an integral part of france
since the trump administration s recognition of morocco s sovereignty over western sahara in late most of its data has been merged into morocco s page
some entries on the world factbook are known to be in line with the political views and agenda of the united states
the united states is behind both the excision of the chagos archipelago from mauritian territory and the forcible expulsion of the chagossians from their lands to establish a military base on one of the island of the archipelago namely diego garcia
the us does not recognise the sovereignty of mauritius over the chagos archipelago and the archipelago is listed as the british indian ocean territory on the cia website
the website further erroneously mentioned that the chagos archipelago is also claimed by the seychelles while officially countries including the seychelles against only countries including the united states voted in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution dated may which called upon the united kingdom to withdraw its colonial administration from the chagos archipelago unconditionally to enable mauritius to complete the decolonization of its territory as rapidly as possible
maps depicting kashmir have the indo pakistani border drawn at the line of control but the region of kashmir administered by china drawn in hash marks
northern cyprus which the u s
considers part of the republic of cyprus is not given a separate entry because territorial occupations annexations not recognized by the united states government are not shown on u s
government maps
the name republic of china is not listed as taiwan s official name under the government section due to u s
acknowledgement of beijing s one china policy according to which there is one china and taiwan is a part of it
the name republic of china was briefly added on january but has since been changed back to none
of the factbook s two maps of china one highlights the island of taiwan as part of the country while the other does not
see also political status of taiwan legal status of taiwan
the paracel islands and spratly islands subjects of territorial disputes have entries in the factbook where they are not listed as the territory of any one nation
the disputed claims to the islands are discussed in the entries
the u s
does not recognize the renaming of burma by its ruling military junta to myanmar and thus keeps its entry for the country under the burma name
the country was first entered as macedonia in the factbook upon independence in
in the edition the name of the entry was changed to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia as it is recognised by the united nations pending resolution of the macedonia naming dispute
for the next decade this was the name the nation was listed under
in the edition of the factbook the name of the entry was changed back to macedonia following a november u s
decision to refer to the country using this name
on february the entry was renamed to north macedonia following the country s name change to the republic of north macedonia
on december the cia added an entry for the european union eu for the first time
the what s new section of the factbook states the european union continues to accrue more nation like characteristics for itself and so a separate listing was deemed appropriate
in the edition of the world factbook the entries for baker island howland island jarvis island kingman reef johnston atoll palmyra atoll and the midway islands were merged into a new united states pacific island wildlife refuges entry
the old entries for each individual insular area remain as redirects on the factbook website
on september the cia also merged the entries for bassas da india europa island the glorioso islands juan de nova island and tromelin island into a new iles eparses entry
as with the new united states pacific island wildlife refuges entry the old entries for these five islands remained as redirects on the website
on july the iles eparses entry and redirects for each island were dropped due to the group becoming a district of the french southern and antarctic lands in february
the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia sfry broke apart in
the following year it was replaced in the factbook with entries for each of its former constituent republics
in doing this the cia listed the federal republic of yugoslavia fry proclaimed in as serbia and montenegro as the u s
did not recognize the union between the two republics
this was done in accordance with a may decision by the u s
not to recognize any of the former yugoslav republics as successor states to the recently dissolved sfry
these views were made clear in a disclaimer printed in the factbook serbia and montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint independent state but this entity has not been recognized as a state by the united states montenegro and serbia were treated separately in the factbook data as can be seen on the map
in october slobodan milo evi was forced out of office after a disputed election
this event led to democratic elections and u s
diplomatic recognition
the edition of the factbook thus referred to the state as yugoslavia
on march an agreement was signed to transform the fry into a loose state union called serbia and montenegro it took effect on february
the name of the yugoslavia entity was altered in the factbook the month after the change
on february the cia added an entry for kosovo which declared independence on february of the same year
before this kosovo was excluded in the factbook
kosovo is the subject of a territorial dispute serbia continues to claim kosovo as part of its own sovereign territory
kosovo s independence has been recognised by out of united nations member states including the united states
on july the entry for east timor was renamed timor leste following a decision of the united states board on geographic names bgn
factbook does not cite its sources making verification of the information it presents difficult if not impossible
in june national public radio npr relying on information obtained from the cia world factbook put the number of israeli jews living in settlements in the west bank and israeli annexed east jerusalem at
however a better estimate based on state department and israeli sources put the figure at about
npr then issued a correction
chuck holmes foreign editor for npr digital said i m surprised and displeased and it makes me wonder what other information is out of date or incorrect in the cia world factbook
