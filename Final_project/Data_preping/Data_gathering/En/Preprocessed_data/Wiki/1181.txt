brain death is the permanent irreversible and complete loss of brain function which may include cessation of involuntary activity necessary to sustain life
it differs from persistent vegetative state in which the person is alive and some autonomic functions remain
it is also distinct from comas as long as some brain and bodily activity and function remain and it is also not the same as the condition locked in syndrome
a differential diagnosis can medically distinguish these differing conditions
brain death is used as an indicator of legal death in many jurisdictions but it is defined inconsistently and often confused by the public
various parts of the brain may keep functioning when others do not anymore and the term brain death has been used to refer to various combinations
for example although one major medical dictionary considers brain death to be synonymous with cerebral death death of the cerebrum the us national library of medicine medical subject headings mesh system defines brain death as including the brainstem
the distinctions are medically significant because for example in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem spontaneous breathing may continue unaided whereas in whole brain death which includes brainstem death only life support equipment would maintain ventilation
in certain countries patients classified as brain dead may legally have their organs surgically removed for organ donation
differences in operational definitions of death have obvious medicolegal implications in medical jurisprudence and medical law
traditionally both the legal and medical communities determined death through the permanent end of certain bodily functions in clinical death especially respiration and heartbeat
with the increasing ability of the medical community to resuscitate people with no respiration heartbeat or other external signs of life the need for another definition of death occurred raising questions of legal death
this gained greater urgency with the widespread use of life support equipment and the rising capabilities and demand for organ transplantation
since the s laws governing the determination of death have been implemented in all countries that have active organ transplantation programs
the first european country to adopt brain death as a legal definition or indicator of death was finland in while in the united states the state of kansas had enacted a similar law earlier
an ad hoc committee at harvard medical school published a pivotal report to define irreversible coma
the harvard criteria gradually gained consensus toward what is now known as brain death
in the wake of the karen ann quinlan case state legislatures in the united states moved to accept brain death as an acceptable indication of death
in a presidential commission issued a landmark report entitled defining death medical legal and ethical issues in the determination of death which rejected the higher brain approach to death in favor of a whole brain definition
this report formed the basis for the uniform determination of death act since enacted in thirty nine states
today both the legal and medical communities in the us use brain death as a legal definition of death allowing a person to be declared legally dead even if life support equipment maintains the body s metabolic processes
in the uk the royal college of physicians reported in abandoning the claim that the tests published in sufficed for the diagnosis of brain death and suggesting a new definition of death based on the irreversible loss of brain stem function alone
this new definition the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and for spontaneous breathing and the essentially unchanged tests held to establish that state have been adopted as a basis of death certification for organ transplant purposes in subsequent codes of practice
the australia and new zealand intensive care society anzics states that the determination of brain death requires that there is unresponsive coma the absence of brain stem reflexes and the absence of respiratory centre function in the clinical setting in which these findings are irreversible
in particular there must be definite clinical or neuro imaging evidence of acute brain pathology e g
traumatic brain injury intracranial haemorrhage hypoxic encephalopathy consistent with the irreversible loss of neurological function in brazil the federal council of medicine revised its regulations in including a requirement for the patient to meet specific physiological prerequisites and for the physician to provide optimized care to the patient before starting the procedures for diagnosing brain death and to perform complementary tests as well as the need for specific training for physicians who make this diagnosis
in an international panel of experts the world brain death project published a guideline that provides recommendations for the minimum clinical standards for determination of brain death death by neurologic criteria bd dnc in adults and children with clear guidance for various clinical circumstances
the recommendations have widespread international society endorsement and can serve to guide professional societies and countries in the revision or development of protocols and procedures for determination of brain death death by neurologic criteria leading to greater consistency within and between countries
natural movements also known as the lazarus sign or lazarus reflex can occur on a brain dead person whose organs have been kept functioning by life support
the living cells that can cause these movements are not living cells from the brain or brain stem these cells come from the spinal cord
sometimes these body movements can cause false hope for family members
a brain dead individual has no clinical evidence of brain function upon physical examination
this includes no response to pain and no cranial nerve reflexes
reflexes include pupillary response fixed pupils oculocephalic reflex corneal reflex no response to the caloric reflex test and no spontaneous respirations
brain death can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from other medical states such as barbiturate overdose alcohol intoxication sedative overdose hypothermia hypoglycemia coma and chronic vegetative states
some comatose patients can recover to pre coma or near pre coma level of functioning and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions such as spontaneous respiration despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality
such is the case with anencephaly
brain electrical activity can stop completely or drop to such a low level as to be undetectable with most equipment
an eeg will therefore be flat though this is sometimes also observed during deep anesthesia or cardiac arrest
although in the united states a flat eeg test is not required to certify death it is considered to have confirmatory value
in the uk it is not considered to be of value because any continuing activity it might reveal in parts of the brain above the brain stem is held to be irrelevant to the diagnosis of death on the code of practice criteria
the diagnosis of brain death is often required to be highly rigorous in order to be certain that the condition is irreversible
legal criteria vary but in general require neurological examinations by two independent physicians
the exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function brain stem function in uk and may include two isoelectric flat line eegs hours apart less in other countries where it is accepted that if the cause of the dysfunction is a clear physical trauma there is no need to wait that long to establish irreversibility
the patient should have a normal temperature and be free of drugs that can suppress brain activity if the diagnosis is to be made on eeg criteria
also a radionuclide cerebral blood flow scan that shows complete absence of intracranial blood flow must be considered with other exams temporary swelling of the brain particularly within the first hours can lead to a false positive test on a patient that may recover with more time
ct angiography is neither required nor sufficient test to make the diagnosis
confirmatory testing is only needed under the age of
for children and adults testing is optional
other situations possibly requiring confirmatory testing include severe facial trauma where determination of brainstem reflexes will be difficult pre existing pupillary abnormalities and patients with severe sleep apnea and or pulmonary disease
confirmatory tests include cerebral angiography electroencephalography transcranial doppler ultrasonography and cerebral scintigraphy technetium tc m exametazime
cerebral angiography is considered the most sensitive confirmatory test in the determination of brain death
while the diagnosis of brain death has become accepted as a basis for the certification of death for legal purposes it is a very different state from biological death the state universally recognized and understood as death
the continuing function of vital organs in the bodies of those diagnosed brain dead if mechanical ventilation and other life support measures are continued provides optimal opportunities for their transplantation
when mechanical ventilation is used to support the body of a brain dead organ donor pending a transplant into an organ recipient the donor s date of death is listed as the date that brain death was diagnosed
in some countries for instance spain finland wales portugal and france everyone is automatically an organ donor after diagnosis of death on legally accepted criteria although some jurisdictions such as singapore spain wales france czech republic poland and portugal allow opting out of the system
elsewhere consent from family members or next of kin may be required for organ donation
in new zealand australia the united kingdom excluding wales and most states in the united states drivers are asked upon application if they wish to be registered as an organ donor
in the united states if the patient is at or near death the hospital must notify a designated organ procurement organization opo of the details and maintain the patient while the patient is being evaluated for suitability as a donor
the opo searches to see if the deceased is registered as a donor which serves as legal consent if the deceased has not registered or otherwise noted consent e g on a driver s license the opo will ask the next of kin for authorization
the patient is kept on ventilator support until the organs have been surgically removed
if the patient has indicated in an advance health care directive that they do not wish to receive mechanical ventilation or has specified a do not resuscitate order and the patient has also indicated that they wish to donate their organs some vital organs such as the heart and lungs may not be able to be recovered
brain death is responsible for of all adult and of pediatric in hospital deaths in the united states
in a nationwide survey of pediatric intensive care units picu in the united states in there were more than pediatric brain deaths out of a total of more than children who died in picus
according to a national study brain death evaluations are performed infrequently even in large picus
