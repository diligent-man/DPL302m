platelets also called thrombocytes from greek clot and cell are a component of blood whose function along with the coagulation factors is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping thereby initiating a blood clot
platelets have no cell nucleus they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow or lung which then enter the circulation
circulating inactivated platelets are biconvex discoid lens shaped structures m in greatest diameter
activated platelets have cell membrane projections covering their surface
platelets are found only in mammals whereas in other vertebrates e g
birds amphibians thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells
on a stained blood smear platelets appear as dark purple spots about the diameter of red blood cells
the smear is used to examine platelets for size shape qualitative number and clumping
a healthy adult typically has to times more red blood cells than platelets
one major function of platelets is to contribute to hemostasis the process of stopping bleeding at the site of interrupted endothelium
they gather at the site and unless the interruption is physically too large they plug the hole
first platelets attach to substances outside the interrupted endothelium adhesion
second they change shape turn on receptors and secrete chemical messengers activation
third they connect to each other through receptor bridges aggregation
formation of this platelet plug primary hemostasis is associated with activation of the coagulation cascade with resultant fibrin deposition and linking secondary hemostasis
these processes may overlap the spectrum is from a predominantly platelet plug or white clot to a predominantly fibrin or red clot or the more typical mixture
some would add the subsequent retraction and platelet inhibition as fourth and fifth steps to the completion of the process and still others would add a sixth step wound repair
platelets also participate in both innate and adaptive intravascular immune responses
the platelet cell membrane has receptors for collagen
following the rupture of the blood vessel wall the platelets are exposed and they adhere to the collagen in the surrounding connective tissue
low platelet concentration is called thrombocytopenia and is due to either decreased production or increased destruction
elevated platelet concentration is called thrombocytosis and is either congenital reactive to cytokines or due to unregulated production one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms or certain other myeloid neoplasms
a disorder of platelet function is called a thrombocytopathy or a platelet function disorder
normal platelets can respond to an abnormality on the vessel wall rather than to hemorrhage resulting in inappropriate platelet adhesion activation and thrombosis the formation of a clot within an intact vessel
this type of thrombosis arises by mechanisms different from those of a normal clot namely extending the fibrin of venous thrombosis extending an unstable or ruptured arterial plaque causing arterial thrombosis and microcirculatory thrombosis
an arterial thrombus may partially obstruct blood flow causing downstream ischemia or may completely obstruct it causing downstream tissue death
platelet concentration is measured either manually using a hemocytometer or by placing blood in an automated platelet analyzer using electrical impedance such as a coulter counter
the normal range of population analyzed for platelets in healthy white people is to per cubic millimeter a mm equals a microliter
or per liter
the normal range has been confirmed to be the same in the elderly and the population of spain
the number of platelets varies across individuals
the normal physiologic range is to per microliter of blood
since they contain receptors for thrombopoietin the protein that facilitates the maturation of megakaryocytes and release of platelets a higher number of platelets binds more of the protein
consequently there is stimulation for more production of thrombopoietin in the liver and kidneys
this is the basis for the production of more thrombopoietin and as a result more platelets in the bloodstream during the blood clotting process
in a first approximation the platelet shape can be considered similar to oblate spheroids with a semiaxis ratio of to
this approximation is often used to model the hydrodynamic and optical properties of a platelet population as well as to restore the geometric parameters of individual measured platelets by flow cytometry
more accurate biophysical models of the platelet surface morphology which model its shape from first principles make it possible to obtain a more realistic platelet geometry in a calm and activated state
structurally the platelet can be divided into four zones from peripheral to innermost
peripheral zone is rich in glycoproteins required for platelet adhesion activation and aggregation
for example gpib ix v gpvi gpiib iiia
sol gel zone is rich in microtubules and microfilaments allowing the platelets to maintain their discoid shape
organelle zone is rich in platelet granules
alpha granules contain clotting mediators such as factor v factor viii fibrinogen fibronectin platelet derived growth factor and chemotactic agents
delta granules or dense bodies contain adp calcium and serotonin which are platelet activating mediators
membranous zone contains membranes derived from megakaryocyte smooth endoplasmic reticulum organized into a dense tubular system which is responsible for thromboxane a synthesis
this dense tubular system is connected to the surface platelet membrane to aid thromboxane a release megakaryocyte and platelet production is regulated by thrombopoietin a hormone produced in the kidneys and liver
each megakaryocyte produces between and platelets during its lifetime
an average of platelets are produced daily in a healthy adult
reserve platelets are stored in the spleen and are released when needed by splenic contraction induced by the sympathetic nervous system the average life span of circulating platelets is to days
life span of individual platelets is controlled by the internal apoptotic regulating pathway which has a bcl xl timer
old platelets are destroyed by phagocytosis in the spleen and liver an overview summarizing platelet dynamics the complex process of converting inactive platelets into a platelet plug is essential
complicating any verbal description is the fact that at least proteins and interactions are involved in platelet dynamics
the separation of platelet dynamics into three stages is useful in this regard but it is artificial in fact each stage is initiated in rapid succession and each continues until the trigger for that stage is no longer present so there is overlap
thrombus formation on an intact endothelium is prevented by nitric oxide prostacyclin and cd
endothelial cells are attached to the subendothelial collagen by von willebrand factor vwf which these cells produce
vwf is also stored in the weibel palade bodies of the endothelial cells and secreted constitutively into the blood
platelets store vwf in their alpha granules
when the endothelial layer is disrupted collagen and vwf anchor platelets to the subendothelium
platelet gp b ix v receptor binds with vwf and gpvi receptor and integrin bind with collagen
the intact endothelial lining inhibits platelet activation by producing nitric oxide endothelial adpase and pgi prostacyclin
endothelial adpase degrades the platelet activator adp
resting platelets maintain active calcium efflux via a cyclic amp activated calcium pump
intracellular calcium concentration determines platelet activation status as it is the second messenger that drives platelet conformational change and degranulation see below
endothelial prostacyclin binds to prostanoid receptors on the surface of resting platelets
this event stimulates the coupled gs protein to increase adenylate cyclase activity and increases the production of camp further promoting the efflux of calcium and reducing intracellular calcium availability for platelet activation
adp on the other hand binds to purinergic receptors on the platelet surface
since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor p y is coupled to gi proteins adp reduces platelet adenylate cyclase activity and camp production leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the camp calcium efflux pump
the other adp receptor p y couples to gq that activates phospholipase c beta plcb resulting in inositol trisphosphate ip generation and intracellular release of more calcium
this together induces platelet activation
endothelial adpase degrades adp and prevents this from happening
clopidogrel and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor p y antagonists
platelet activation begins seconds after adhesion occurs
it is triggered when collagen from the subendothelium binds with its receptors gpvi receptor and integrin on the platelet
gpvi is associated with the fc receptor gamma chain and leads via the activation of a tyrosine kinase cascade finally to the activation of plc gamma plcg and more calcium release
tissue factor also binds to factor vii in the blood which initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production
thrombin is a potent platelet activator acting through gq and g
these are g protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet overcoming the baseline calcium efflux
families of three g proteins gq gi g operate together for full activation
thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin reinforcement of the platelet plug
platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor v and fibrinogen potentiating the coagulation cascade
so in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially with each inducing the other to form the final fibrin crosslinked thrombus
collagen mediated gpvi signalling increases the platelet production of thromboxane a txa and decreases the production of prostacyclin
this occurs by altering the metabolic flux of platelet s eicosanoid synthesis pathway which involves enzymes phospholipase a cyclo oxygenase and thromboxane a synthase
platelets secrete thromboxane a which acts on the platelet s own thromboxane receptors on the platelet surface hence the so called out in mechanism and those of other platelets
these receptors trigger intraplatelet signaling which converts gpiib iiia receptors to their active form to initiate aggregation
platelets contain dense granules lambda granules and alpha granules
activated platelets secrete the contents of these granules through their canalicular systems to the exterior
simplistically bound and activated platelets degranulate to release platelet chemotactic agents to attract more platelets to the site of endothelial injury
granule characteristics
granules alpha granules containing p selectin platelet factor transforming growth factor platelet derived growth factor fibronectin b thromboglobulin vwf fibrinogen and coagulation factors v and xiii
granules delta or dense granules containing adp or atp calcium and serotonin
granules gamma granules similar to lysosomes and contain several hydrolytic enzymes
granules lambda granules contents involved in resorption during later stages of vessel repairas shown by flow cytometry and electron microscopy the most sensitive sign of activation when exposed to platelets using adp are morphological changes
mitochondrial hyperpolarization is a key event in initiating changes in morphology
intraplatelet calcium concentration increases stimulating the interplay between the microtubule actin filament complex
the continuous changes in shape from the unactivated to the fully activated platelet is best seen on scanning electron microscopy
three steps along this path are named early dendritic early spread and spread
the surface of the unactivated platelet looks very similar to the surface of the brain with a wrinkled appearance from numerous shallow folds to increase the surface area early dendritic an octopus with multiple arms and legs early spread an uncooked frying egg in a pan the yolk being the central body and the spread a cooked fried egg with a denser central body
these changes are all brought about by the interaction of the microtubule actin complex with the platelet cell membrane and open canalicular system ocs which is an extension and invagination of that membrane
this complex runs just beneath these membranes and is the chemical motor that literally pulls the invaginated ocs out of the interior of the platelet like turning pants pockets inside out creating the dendrites
this process is similar to the mechanism of contraction in a muscle cell
the entire ocs thus becomes indistinguishable from the initial platelet membrane as it forms the fried egg
this dramatic increase in surface area comes about with neither stretching nor adding phospholipids to the platelet membrane
platelet activation causes its membrane surface to become negatively charged
one of the signaling pathways turns on scramblase which moves negatively charged phospholipids from the inner to the outer platelet membrane surface
these phospholipids then bind the tenase and prothrombinase complexes two of the sites of interplay between platelets and the coagulation cascade
calcium ions are essential for the binding of these coagulation factors
in addition to interacting with vwf and fibrin platelets interact with thrombin factors x va viia xi ix and prothrombin to complete formation via the coagulation cascade
six studies suggested platelets express tissue factor the definitive study shows they do not
the platelets from rats were conclusively shown to express tissue factor protein and also it was proved that the rat platelets carry both the tissue factor pre mrna and mature mrna
aggregation begins minutes after activation and occurs as a result of turning on the gpiib iiia receptor allowing these receptors to bind with vwf or fibrinogen
there are around of these receptors per platelet
when any one or more of at least nine different platelet surface receptors are turned on during activation intraplatelet signaling pathways cause existing gpiib iiia receptors to change shape curled to straight and thus become capable of binding
since fibrinogen is a rod like protein with nodules on either end capable of binding gpiib iiia activated platelets with exposed gpiib iiia can bind fibrinogen to aggregate
gpiib iiia may also further anchor the platelets to subendothelial vwf for additional structural stabilisation
classically it was thought that this was the only mechanism involved in aggregation but three new mechanisms have been identified which can initiate aggregation depending on the velocity of blood flow i e
shear range
the blood clot is only a temporary solution to stop bleeding tissue repair is needed
small interruptions in the endothelium are handled by physiological mechanisms large interruptions by the trauma surgeon
the fibrin is slowly dissolved by the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin and the platelets are cleared by phagocytosis
platelets have central role in innate immunity initiating and participating in multiple inflammatory processes directly binding pathogens and even destroying them
this supports clinical data which show that many with serious bacterial or viral infections have thrombocytopenia thus reducing their contribution to inflammation
also platelet leukocyte aggregates plas found in circulation are typical in sepsis or inflammatory bowel disease showing the connection between thrombocytes and immune cells sensu stricto
as hemostasis is a basic function of thrombocytes in mammals it also has its uses in possible infection confinement
in case of injury platelets together with the coagulation cascade form the first line of defense by forming a blood clot
thus hemostasis and host defense were intertwined in evolution
for example in the atlantic horseshoe crab living fossil estimated to be over million years old the only blood cell type the amebocyte facilitates both the hemostatic function and the encapsulation and phagocytosis of pathogens by means of exocytosis of intracellular granules containing bactericidal defense molecules
blood clotting supports the immune function by trapping the pathogenic bacteria within
although thrombosis blood coagulation in intact blood vessels is usually viewed as a pathological immune response leading to obturation of lumen of blood vessel and subsequent hypoxic tissue damage in some cases directed thrombosis called immunothrombosis can locally control the spread of the infection
the thrombosis is directed in concordance of platelets neutrophils and monocytes
the process is initiated either by immune cells sensu stricto by activating their pattern recognition receptors prrs or by platelet bacterial binding
platelets can bind to bacteria either directly through thrombocytic prrs and bacterial surface proteins or via plasma proteins that bind both to platelets and bacteria
monocytes respond to bacterial pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps or damage associated molecular patterns damps by activating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation
neutrophils facilitate the blood coagulation by netosis
in turn the platelets facilitate neutrophils netosis
nets bind tissue factor binding the coagulation centres to the location of infection
they also activate the intrinsic coagulation pathway by providing its negatively charged surface to the factor xii
other neutrophil secretions such as proteolytic enzymes which cleave coagulation inhibitors also bolster the process
in case of imbalance throughout the regulation of immunothrombosis this process can quickly become aberrant
regulatory defects in immunothrombosis are suspected to be major factor in causing pathological thrombosis in many forms such as disseminated intravascular coagulation dic or deep vein thrombosis
dic in sepsis is a prime example of both dysregulated coagulation process as well as undue systemic inflammatory response resulting in multitude of microthrombi of similar composition to that in physiological immunothrombosis fibrin platelets neutrophils and nets
platelets are rapidly deployed to sites of injury or infection and potentially modulate inflammatory processes by interacting with leukocytes and by secreting cytokines chemokines and other inflammatory mediators
platelets also secrete platelet derived growth factor pdgf
platelets modulate neutrophils by forming platelet leukocyte aggregates plas
these formations induce upregulated production of m mac integrin in neutrophils
interaction with plas also induce degranulation and increased phagocytosis in neutrophils
platelets are also the largest source of soluble cd l which induces production of reactive oxygen species ros and upregulate expression of adhesion molecules such as e selectin icam and vcam in neutrophils activates macrophages and activates cytotoxic response in t and b lymphocytes
recently the dogma that mammalian platelets lacking nucleus are unable of autonomous locomotion was broken
in fact the platelets are active scavengers scaling walls of blood vessels and reorganising the thrombus
they are able to recognize and adhere to many surfaces including bacteria
they are even able to fully envelop them in their open canalicular system ocp leading to proposed name of the process being covercytosis rather than phagocytosis as ocs is merely an invagination of outer plasma membrane
these platelet bacteria bundles are then used as an interaction platform for neutrophils which destroy the bacteria using the netosis and phagocytosis
platelets also participate in chronic inflammatory diseases such as synovitis or rheumatoid arthritis
platelets are activated by collagen receptor glycoprotein iv gpvi
proinflammatory platelet microvesicles trigger constant cytokine secretion from neighboring fibroblast like synoviocytes most prominently il and il
inflammatory damage to surrounding extracellular matrix continually reveals more collagen maintaining the microvesicle production
activated platelets are able to participate in adaptive immunity interacting with antibodies
they are able to specifically bind igg through fc riia receptor for constant fragment fc of igg
when activated and bound to igg opsonised bacteria the platelets subsequently release reactive oxygen species ros antimicrobial peptides defensins kinocidins and proteases killing the bacteria directly
platelets also secrete proinflammatory and procoagulant mediators such as inorganic polyphosphates or platelet factor pf connecting innate and adaptive immune responses
spontaneous and excessive bleeding can occur because of platelet disorders
this bleeding can be caused by deficient numbers of platelets dysfunctional platelets or very excessive numbers of platelets over million microliter
the excessive numbers create a relative von willebrand factor deficiency due to sequestration
one can get a clue as to whether bleeding is due to a platelet disorder or a coagulation factor disorder by the characteristics and location of the bleeding
all of the following suggest platelet bleeding not coagulation bleeding the bleeding from a skin cut such as a razor nick is prompt and excessive but can be controlled by pressure spontaneous bleeding into the skin which causes a purplish stain named by its size petechiae purpura ecchymoses bleeding into mucous membranes causing bleeding gums nose bleed and gastrointestinal bleeding menorrhagia and intraretinal and intracranial bleeding
excessive numbers of platelets and or normal platelets responding to abnormal vessel walls can result in venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis
the symptoms depend on the site of thrombosis
bleeding time was first developed as a test of platelet function by duke in
duke s test measured the time taken for bleeding to stop from a standardized wound in the ear lobe which was blotted every seconds
the normal time for bleeding to stop was less than minutes
more modern techniques are now used
a normal bleeding time reflects sufficient platelet numbers and function plus normal microvasculature
in multiple electrode aggregometry anticoagulated whole blood is mixed with saline and a platelet agonist in a single use cuvette with two pairs of electrodes
the increase in impedance between the electrodes as platelets aggregate onto them is measured and visualized as a curve
in light transmission aggregometry lta platelet rich plasma is placed between a light source and a photocell
unaggregated plasma allows relatively little light to pass through
after adding an agonist the platelets aggregate resulting in greater light transmission which is detected by the photocell
the pfa platelet function assay is a system for analysing platelet function in which citrated whole blood is aspirated through a disposable cartridge containing an aperture within a membrane coated with either collagen and epinephrine or collagen and adp
these agonists induce platelet adhesion activation and aggregation leading to rapid occlusion of the aperture and cessation of blood flow termed the closure time ct
an elevated ct with epi and collagen can indicate intrinsic defects such as von willebrand disease uremia or circulating platelet inhibitors
the follow up test involving collagen and adp is used to indicate if the abnormal ct with collagen and epi was caused by the effects of acetyl sulfosalicylic acid aspirin or medications containing inhibitors

for example in patients undergoing surgery a level below l is associated with abnormal surgical bleeding and regional anaesthetic procedures such as epidurals are avoided for levels below l
platelets may also be transfused when the platelet count is normal but the platelets are dysfunctional such as when an individual is taking aspirin or clopidogrel
finally platelets may be transfused as part of a massive transfusion protocol in which the three major blood components red blood cells plasma and platelets are transfused to address severe hemorrhage
platelet transfusion is contraindicated in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp as it fuels the coagulopathy
platelets are either isolated from collected units of whole blood and pooled to make a therapeutic dose or collected by platelet apheresis blood is taken from the donor passed through a device which removes the platelets and the remainder is returned to the donor in a closed loop
the industry standard is for platelets to be tested for bacteria before transfusion to avoid septic reactions which can be fatal
recently the aabb industry standards for blood banks and transfusion services has allowed for use of pathogen reduction technology as an alternative to bacterial screenings in platelets
pooled whole blood platelets sometimes called random platelets are separated by one of two methods
in the us a unit of whole blood is placed into a large centrifuge in what is referred to as a soft spin
at these settings the platelets remain suspended in the plasma
the platelet rich plasma prp is removed from the red cells then centrifuged at a faster setting to harvest the platelets from the plasma
in other regions of the world the unit of whole blood is centrifuged using settings that cause the platelets to become suspended in the buffy coat layer which includes the platelets and the white blood cells
the buffy coat is isolated in a sterile bag suspended in a small amount of red blood cells and plasma then centrifuged again to separate the platelets and plasma from the red and white blood cells
regardless of the initial method of preparation multiple donations may be combined into one container using a sterile connection device to manufacture a single product with the desired therapeutic dose
apheresis platelets are collected using a mechanical device that draws blood from the donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected
the remaining blood is returned to the donor
the advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose as opposed to the multiple donations for whole blood platelets
this means that a recipient is not exposed to as many different donors and has less risk of transfusion transmitted disease and other complications
sometimes a person such as a cancer patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets will receive repeated donations from a specific donor to further minimize the risk
pathogen reduction of platelets using for example riboflavin and uv light treatments can also be carried out to reduce the infectious load of pathogens contained in donated blood products thereby reducing the risk of transmission of transfusion transmitted diseases
another photochemical treatment process utilizing amotosalen and uva light has been developed for the inactivation of viruses bacteria parasites and leukocytes that can contaminate blood components intended for transfusion
in addition apheresis platelets tend to contain fewer contaminating red blood cells because the collection method is more efficient than soft spin centrifugation at isolating the desired blood component
platelets collected by either method have a very short shelf life typically five days
this results in frequent problems with short supply as testing the donations often requires up to a full day
since there are no effective preservative solutions for platelets they lose potency quickly and are best when fresh
platelets are stored under constant agitation at c f
units can not be refrigerated as this causes platelets to change shape and lose function
storage at room temperature provides an environment where any bacteria that are introduced to the blood component during the collection process may proliferate and subsequently cause bacteremia in the patient
regulations are in place in the united states that require products to be tested for the presence of bacterial contamination before transfusion
platelets do not need to belong to the same a b o blood group as the recipient or be cross matched to ensure immune compatibility between donor and recipient unless they contain a significant amount of red blood cells rbcs
the presence of rbcs imparts a reddish orange color to the product and is usually associated with whole blood platelets
an effort is sometimes made to issue type specific platelets but this is not critical as it is with rbcs
prior to issuing platelets to the recipient they may be irradiated to prevent transfusion associated graft versus host disease or they may be washed to remove the plasma if indicated
the change in the recipient s platelet count after transfusion is termed the increment and is calculated by subtracting the pre transfusion platelet count from the post transfusion platelet count
many factors affect the increment including the recipient s body size the number of platelets transfused and clinical features that may cause premature destruction of the transfused platelets
when recipients fail to demonstrate an adequate post transfusion increment this is termed platelet transfusion refractoriness
platelets either apheresis derived or random donor can be processed through a volume reduction process
in this process the platelets are spun in a centrifuge and the excess plasma is removed leaving to ml of platelet concentrate
such volume reduced platelets are normally transfused only to neonatal and pediatric patients when a large volume of plasma could overload the child s small circulatory system
the lower volume of plasma also reduces the chances of an adverse transfusion reaction to plasma proteins
volume reduced platelets have a shelf life of only four hours
platelets release platelet derived growth factor pdgf a potent chemotactic agent and tgf beta which stimulates the deposition of extracellular matrix fibroblast growth factor insulin like growth factor platelet derived epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor
local application of these factors in increased concentrations through platelet rich plasma prp is used as an adjunct in wound healing
instead of having platelets non mammalian vertebrates have nucleated thrombocytes which resemble b lymphocytes in morphology
they aggregate in response to thrombin but not to adp serotonin nor adrenaline as platelets do
george gulliver in drew pictures of platelets using the twin lens compound microscope invented in by joseph jackson lister
this microscope improved resolution sufficiently to make it possible to see platelets for the first time
william addison in drew pictures of a platelet fibrin clot
lionel beale in was the first to publish a drawing showing platelets
max schultze in described what he called spherules which he noted were much smaller than red blood cells occasionally clumped and were sometimes found in collections of fibrin material
giulio bizzozero in studied the blood of amphibians microscopically in vivo
he named schultze s spherules it piastrine little plates
an article in scientific american suggests bizzozero proposed the name blutplattchen
william osler observed platelets and in published lectures in called them a third corpuscle and a blood plaque and described them as a colorless protoplasmic disc
james wright examined blood smears using the stain named for him and used the term plates in his publication but changed to platelets in his publication which has become the universally accepted term the term thrombocyte clot cell came into use in the early s and is sometimes used as a synonym for platelet but not generally in the scientific literature except as a root word for other terms related to platelets e g
thrombocytopenia meaning low platelets
the term thrombocytes are proper for mononuclear cells found in the blood of non mammalian vertebrates they are the functional equivalent of platelets but circulate as intact cells rather than cytoplasmic fragments of bone marrow megakaryocytes
in some contexts the word thrombus is used interchangeably with the word clot regardless of its composition white red or mixed
in other contexts it is used to contrast a normal from an abnormal clot thrombus arises from physiologic hemostasis thrombosis arises from a pathologic and excessive quantity of clot
in a third context it is used to contrast the result from the process thrombus is the result thrombosis is the process
