in economics a shock is an unexpected or unpredictable event that affects an economy either positively or negatively
technically it is an unpredictable change in exogenous factors that is factors unexplained by an economic model which may influence endogenous economic variables
the response of economic variables such as gdp and employment at the time of the shock and at subsequent times is measured by an impulse response function
a technology shock is the kind resulting from a technological development that affects productivity
if the shock is due to constrained supply it is termed a supply shock and usually results in price increases for a particular product
supply shocks can be produced when accidents or disasters occur
the western australian gas crisis resulting from a pipeline explosion at varanus island is one example
an inflationary shock happens when prices of commodities increase suddenly e g after a decrease of government subsidies while not all salaries are adjusted immediately throughout society this results in a temporary loss of purchasing power for many consumers or that production costs begin to exceed corporate revenues e g
following energy price hikes
a demand shock is a sudden change of the pattern of private expenditure especially of consumption spending by consumers or of investment spending by businesses
a monetary policy shock occurs when a central bank changes without sufficient advance warning its pattern of interest rate or money supply control
a fiscal policy shock is an unexpected change of government spending or taxation amounts
a preference shock is a change in preferences over consumption or leisure
a news shock is a change in current expectations of future technological progress which could be induced by new information about potential technological developments
in the context of microeconomics shocks are also studied at the household level such as health income and consumption shocks
negative individual and household economic shocks can result from job loss for example while positive shocks can come from winning the lottery
for example in development microeconomics the relationship between household income shocks and household levels of consumption is studied to understand a household s ability to insure itself testing the full insurance hypothesis
economic shocks impact political preference
the experience of negative shocks such as job loss causes individuals to favor redistributive policies and broader social policies
some evidence shows that negative economic shocks cause individuals to lose faith in political systems though this erosion of trust is often temporary rebounding over time
a narrow portion of voters may change their voting patterns in response to shock which can include support for candidates and policies that are antiestablishment populist leftist or ceasing to participate in the electoral process
positive economic shocks are linked to an increase in trust in government institutions
