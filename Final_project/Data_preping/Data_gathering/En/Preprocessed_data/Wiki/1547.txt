braddock is an irish american boxer from new jersey formerly a light heavyweight contender who is forced to give up boxing after breaking his hand in the ring
this is both a relief and a burden to his wife mae
she cannot bring herself to watch the violence of his chosen profession yet she knows they will not have enough income without his boxing
as the united states enters the great depression braddock does manual labor as a longshoreman to support his family even with his injured hand
unfortunately he cannot get work every day
thanks to a last minute cancellation by another boxer braddock s longtime manager and friend joe gould offers him a chance to fill in for just one night and earn cash
the fight is against the number two contender in the world corn griffin
braddock stuns the boxing experts and fans with a third round knockout of his formidable opponent
he believes that while his right hand was broken he became more proficient with his left hand improving his in ring ability
despite mae s objections braddock takes up gould s offer to return to the ring
mae resents this attempt by gould to profit from her husband s dangerous livelihood until she discovers that gould and his wife also have been devastated by hard times
with a shot at the heavyweight championship held by max baer a possibility braddock continues to win
out of a sense of pride he uses a portion of his prize money to pay back money to the government given to him while unemployed
when his rags to riches story gets out the sportswriter damon runyon dubs him the cinderella man and before long braddock comes to represent the hopes and aspirations of the american public struggling with the depression
after wins against john henry lewis and art lasky a title fight against baer comes his way
braddock is a to underdog
baer is so destructive that the fight s promoter james johnston forces both braddock and gould to watch a film of baer in action just so he can maintain later that he warned them what braddock was up against
braddock demonstrates no fear
the arrogant baer attempts to intimidate him even taunting mae in public that her man might not survive
when he says this she becomes so angry that she throws a drink at him
she is unable to attend the fight at the madison square garden bowl or even to listen to it on the radio
on june in one of the greatest upsets in boxing history braddock defeats the seemingly invincible baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world
an epilogue reveals that braddock would lose his title to joe louis and later worked on the building of the verrazano bridge owning and operating heavy machinery on the docks where he worked during the depression and that he and mae used his boxing income to buy a house where they spent the rest of their lives
during filming in toronto several areas were redressed to resemble s new york
the richmond street side of the bay s queen street store was redressed as madison square garden complete with fake store fronts and period stop lights

in a campaign to boost ticket sales after the film s low opening amc theatres advertised on june that in markets about theaters nationwide it would offer a refund to any ticket buyer dissatisfied with the film
