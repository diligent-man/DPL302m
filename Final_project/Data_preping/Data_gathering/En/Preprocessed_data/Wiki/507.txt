the sinosphere may be taken to be synonymous to ancient china and its descendant civilizations as well as the far eastern civilizations the mainland and the japanese ones
in the s in a study of history the sinosphere along with the western islamic eastern orthodox indic etc
civilizations is presented as among the major units of study
british historian arnold j
toynbee listed the far eastern civilization as one of the main civilizations outlined in his book a study of history
he included japan and korea in his definition of far eastern civilization and proposed that they grew out of the sinic civilization that originated in the yellow river basin
toynbee compared the relationship between the sinic and far eastern civilization with that of the hellenic and western civilizations which had an apparentation affiliation
american sinologist and historian edwin o
reischauer also grouped china japan korea and vietnam into a cultural sphere that he called the sinic world a group of centralized states that share a confucian ethical philosophy
reischauer states that this culture originated in northern china comparing the relationship between northern china and east asia to that of greco roman civilization and europe
the elites of east asia were tied together through a common written language based on chinese characters much in the way that latin had functioned in europe
american political scientist samuel p
huntington considered the sinic world as one of many civilizations in his book the clash of civilizations
he notes that all scholars recognize the existence of either a single distinct chinese civilization dating back to at least b c
and perhaps a thousand years earlier or of two chinese civilizations one succeeding the other in the early centuries of the christian epoch huntington s sinic civilization includes china north korea south korea mongolia vietnam and chinese communities in southeast asia
of the many civilizations that huntington discusses the sinic world is the only one that is based on a cultural rather than religious identity
huntington s theory was that in a post cold war world humanity identifies with cultural groups tribes ethnic groups religious communities and at the broadest level civilizations yet huntington considered japan as a distinct civilization

festivities nowadays aren t as elaborate as the western new year but okinawans still celebrate and partake in many traditions for lunar new year east asian literary culture is based on the use of literary chinese which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region
although each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature they continued to use chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the th century
throughout east asia literary chinese was the language of administration and scholarship
although vietnam korea and japan each developed writing systems for their languages these were limited to popular literature
chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late th and early th centuries
though they did not use chinese for spoken communication each country had its tradition of reading texts aloud the so called sino xenic pronunciations which provide clues to the pronunciation of middle chinese
chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars and today comprise over half their vocabularies
books in literary chinese were widely distributed
by the th century and possibly earlier woodblock printing had been developed in china
at first it was used only to copy the buddhist scriptures but later secular works were also printed
by the th century metal movable type was used by government printers in korea but seems to have not been extensively used in china vietnam or japan

bc declares that the tao is the source of the universe thus considered a creative principle but not as a deity

l a system of norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life mid imperial chinese philosophy is primarily defined by the development of neo confucianism

neo confucianism has its origins in the tang dynasty the confucianist scholar han yu is seen as a forebear of the neo confucianists of the song dynasty
the song dynasty philosopher zhou dunyi is seen as the first true pioneer of neo confucianism using daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy
elsewhere in east asia japanese philosophy began to develop as indigenous shinto beliefs fused with buddhism confucianism and other schools of chinese philosophy

all of these languages have a well documented history of having historically used chinese characters japanese korean and vietnamese all having roughly of their vocabulary stemming from chinese
there is a small set of minor languages that are comparable to the core east asian languages such as zhuang and hmong mien
they are often overlooked since neither have their own country or heavily export their culture but zhuang has been written in hanzi inspired characters called sawndip for over years
hmong while having supposedly lacked a writing system until modern history is also suggested to have a similar percentage of chinese loans to the core cjkv languages as well
while other languages have been impacted by the sinosphere such as the thai with its thai numeral system and mongolian with its historical use of hanzi the amount of chinese vocabulary overall is not nearly as expansive in these languages as the core cjkv or even zhuang and hmong
various hypotheses are trying to unify various subsets of the above languages including the sino austronesian altaic and austric language groupings
an overview of these various language groups is discussed in jared diamond s germs guns and steel among other places
east asia is quite diverse in writing systems from the brahmic inspired abugidas of sea the logographic hanzi of china the syllabaries of japan and various alphabets and abjads used in korea hangul mongolia cyrillic vietnam latin etc

mainland china malaysia and singapore uses simplified characters whereas taiwan hong kong and macau use traditional chinese
japan still uses kanji but has also invented kana inspired by the chinese cursive script
korea used to write in hanja but has invented an alphabetic system called hangul also inspired by chinese and phags pa during the mongol empire that is nowadays the majority script
however hanja is a required subject in south korea
most names are also written in hanja
hanja is also studied and used in academia newspapers and law areas where a lot of scholarly terms and sino korean loanwords are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms
vietnam used to write in ch h n or classical chinese
since the th century they began inventing many of their own ch n m
since french colonization they have switched to using a modified version of the latin alphabet called ch qu c ng
however chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by chinese characters
in vietnam and north korea ch h n can be seen in temples cemeteries and monuments today as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design
and there are movements to restore h n n m in vietnam
also see history of writing in vietnam
zhuang people are similar to the vietnamese in that they used to write in sawgun chinese characters and have invented many of their characters called sawndip immature characters or native characters
sawndip is still used informally and in traditional settings but in the people s republic of china introduced an alphabetical script for the language which is what it officially promotes
