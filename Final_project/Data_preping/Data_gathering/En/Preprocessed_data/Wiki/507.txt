The East Asian cultural sphere also known as the Sinosphere the Sinic world the Sinitic world the Chinese cultural sphere the Chinese character sphere encompasses multiple countries in East and Southeast Asia that were historically influenced by Chinese culture
According to academic consensus the East Asian cultural sphere is made up of four entities Greater China Japan Korea and Vietnam
Other definitions sometimes include other countries such as Mongolia and Singapore because of limited historical Chinese influences or increasing modern-day Chinese diaspora
The East Asian cultural sphere is not to be confused with the Sinophone world which includes countries where the Chinese-speaking population is dominant
Imperial China was a regional power and exerted influence on tributary states and neighboring states among which were Japan Korea and Vietnam
These interactions brought ideological and cultural influences rooted in Confucianism Buddhism and Taoism
During classical history the four cultures shared a common imperial system under respective emperors
Chinese inventions influenced and were in turned influenced by innovations of the other cultures in governance philosophy science and the arts
Written Classical Chinese became the regional lingua franca for literary cultural scientific and economic exchange and Chinese characters Hanzi became locally adapted in Japan as Kanji Korea as Hanja and Vietnam as Ch Hn
In late classical history the literary importance of classical Chinese diminished as Japan Korea and Vietnam each adopted their own literary device
Japan developed the Katakana and Hiragana scripts Korea developed Hangul and Vietnam developed Ch Nm which is now rarely used the modern Vietnamese alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet
Classical literature written in Chinese characters nonetheless remains an important legacy of Japanese Korean and Vietnamese cultures
In the st century ideological and cultural influences of Confucianism and Buddhism remain visible in high culture and social doctrines
Additionally besides China itself nations of Korea Japan and Vietnam all at one point called itself variations of Little China within their history
China has been regarded as one of the centers of civilization with the emergent cultures that arose from the migration of original Han settlers from the Yellow River generally regarded as the starting point of the East Asian world
Japanese historian Nishijima Sadao ja professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo originally coined the term Tōa bunka-ken 'East Asian Cultural Area' conceiving of a Chinese or East-Asian cultural sphere distinct from the cultures of the west
According to Nishijima this cultural sphere—which includes China Japan Korea Vietnam stretching from areas between Mongolia and the Himalayas—shared the philosophy of Confucianism the religion of Buddhism and similar political and social structures stemming from a background of historical scholars in Classical Chinese
Sometimes used as a synonym for the East-Asian cultural sphere the term Sinosphere derives from Sino- 'China Chinese' and -sphere in the sense of a sphere of influence ie an area influenced by a country
As cognates of each other the CJKV languages—Chinese Japanese Korean and Vietnamese—translate the English term sphere as
Japanese ken けん 'sphere circle range radius'
Mair discussed the origins of these culture sphere terms
The Chinese wnhu quān dates back to a translation for the German term Kulturkreis 'culture circle field' which the Austrian ethnologists Fritz Graebner and Wilhelm Schmidt proposed
Japanese historian Nishijima Sadao ja coined the expressions Kanji bunka ken Chinese-character culture sphere and Chuka bunka ken Chinese culture sphere which China later re-borrowed as loanwords
Nishijima devised these Sinitic cultural spheres within his Theory of an East Asian World アジア Higashi Ajia sekai-ron
ChineseEnglish dictionaries provide similar translations of this keyword wnhu quān as the intellectual or literary circles Liang Shiqiu and literary educational circles Lin Yutang
The Sinosphere may be taken to be synonymous to Ancient China and its descendant civilizations as well as the Far Eastern civilizations the Mainland and the Japanese ones
In the s in A Study of History the Sinosphere along with the Western Islamic Eastern Orthodox Indic etc
civilizations is presented as among the major units of study
Toynbee listed the Far Eastern civilization as one of the main civilizations outlined in his book A Study of History
He included Japan and Korea in his definition of Far Eastern civilization and proposed that they grew out of the Sinic civilization that originated in the Yellow River basin
Toynbee compared the relationship between the Sinic and Far Eastern civilization with that of the Hellenic and Western civilizations which had an apparentation-affiliation
Reischauer also grouped China Japan Korea and Vietnam into a cultural sphere that he called the Sinic world a group of centralized states that share a Confucian ethical philosophy
Reischauer states that this culture originated in Northern China comparing the relationship between Northern China and East Asia to that of Greco-Roman civilization and Europe
The elites of East Asia were tied together through a common written language based on Chinese characters much in the way that Latin had functioned in Europe
Huntington considered the Sinic world as one of many civilizations in his book The Clash of Civilizations
He notes that all scholars recognize the existence of either a single distinct Chinese civilization dating back to at least BC
and perhaps a thousand years earlier or of two Chinese civilizations one succeeding the other in the early centuries of the Christian epoch Huntington's Sinic civilization includes China North Korea South Korea Mongolia Vietnam and Chinese communities in Southeast Asia
Of the many civilizations that Huntington discusses the Sinic world is the only one that is based on a cultural rather than religious identity
Huntington's theory was that in a post-Cold War world humanity identifies with cultural groups tribes ethnic groups religious communities and at the broadest level civilizations Yet Huntington considered Japan as a distinct civilization

New Year China Zhōnggu Xīn Nin Korea Seollal Vietnam Tt Nguyn Đn Japan Koshōgatsu and Taiwan traditionally observe the same Lunar New Year
However Japan has moved its New Year Shōgatsu to fit the Western New Year since the Meiji Restoration
Although mainland Japan may not celebrate the Lunar New Year anymore there are some indigenous minority ethnic groups in Japan that still do such as the OkinawanRyukyuan people

Festivities nowadays aren't as elaborate as the Western new year but Okinawans still celebrate and partake in many traditions for Lunar New YearEast-Asian literary culture is based on the use of Literary Chinese which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region
Although each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature they continued to use Chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the th century
Throughout East Asia Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship
Although Vietnam Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their languages these were limited to popular literature
Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late th and early th centuries
Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication each country had its tradition of reading texts aloud the so-called Sino-Xenic pronunciations which provide clues to the pronunciation of Middle Chinese
Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars and today comprise over half their vocabularies
Books in Literary Chinese were widely distributed
By the th century and possibly earlier woodblock printing had been developed in China
At first it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures but later secular works were also printed
By the th century metal movable type was used by government printers in Korea but seems to have not been extensively used in China Vietnam or Japan
At the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late th century
Japan's textual scholarship had Chinese origin which made Japan one of the birthplaces of modern Sinology

The Song dynasty philosopher Zhou Dunyi is seen as the first true pioneer of Neo-Confucianism using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy
Elsewhere in East Asia Japanese philosophy began to develop as indigenous Shinto beliefs fused with Buddhism Confucianism and other schools of Chinese philosophy
Similar to Japan in Korean philosophy elements of Shamanism were integrated into the Neo-Confucianism imported from China
In Vietnam neo-Confucianism along with Taoism and Buddhism were also developed into Vietnam's own Tam gio which together with Vietnamese folk religion contributed to perfecting Vietnamese philosophy

All of these languages have a well-documented history of having historically used Chinese characters Japanese Korean and Vietnamese all having roughly of their vocabulary stemming from Chinese
There is a small set of minor languages that are comparable to the core East Asian languages such as Zhuang and Hmong-Mien
They are often overlooked since neither have their own country or heavily export their culture but Zhuang has been written in Hanzi inspired characters called Sawndip for over years
Hmong while having supposedly lacked a writing system until modern history is also suggested to have a similar percentage of Chinese loans to the core CJKV languages as well
While other languages have been impacted by the Sinosphere such as the Thai with its Thai numeral system and Mongolian with its historical use of Hanzi the amount of Chinese vocabulary overall is not nearly as expansive in these languages as the core CJKV or even Zhuang and Hmong
Various hypotheses are trying to unify various subsets of the above languages including the Sino-Austronesian Altaic and Austric language groupings
An overview of these various language groups is discussed in Jared Diamond's Germs Guns and Steel among other places
East Asia is quite diverse in writing systems from the Brahmic inspired abugidas of SEA the logographic hanzi of China the syllabaries of Japan and various alphabets and abjads used in Korea Hangul Mongolia Cyrillic Vietnam Latin etc
Hanzi or is considered the common culture that unifies the languages and cultures of many East Asian nations
Historically Japan Korea and Vietnam have used Chinese characters
Today they are mainly used in China Japan and South Korea albeit in different forms
Mainland China Malaysia and Singapore uses simplified characters whereas Taiwan Hong Kong and Macau use Traditional Chinese
Japan still uses kanji but has also invented kana inspired by the Chinese cursive script
Korea used to write in hanja but has invented an alphabetic system called hangul also inspired by Chinese and phags-pa during the Mongol Empire that is nowadays the majority script
However hanja is a required subject in South Korea
Most names are also written in hanja
Hanja is also studied and used in academia newspapers and law areas where a lot of scholarly terms and Sino-Korean loanwords are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms
Vietnam used to write in ch Hn or Classical Chinese
Since the th century they began inventing many of their own ch Nm
Since French colonization they have switched to using a modified version of the Latin alphabet called ch Quc ng
However Chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters
In Vietnam and North Korea ch Hn can be seen in temples cemeteries and monuments today as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design
And there are movements to restore Hn Nm in Vietnam
Also see History of writing in Vietnam
Zhuang people are similar to the Vietnamese in that they used to write in Sawgun Chinese characters and have invented many of their characters called Sawndip Immature characters or native characters
Sawndip is still used informally and in traditional settings but in the People's Republic of China introduced an alphabetical script for the language which is what it officially promotes
Before European imperialism East Asia has always been one of the largest economies in the world whose output had mostly been driven by China and the Silk Road
During the Industrial Revolution East Asia modernized and became an area of economic power starting with the Meiji Restoration in the late th century when Japan rapidly transformed itself into the only industrial power outside the North Atlantic area
Japan's early industrial economy reached its height in World War II - when it expanded its empire and became a major world power
