Armand Peugeot became interested in the automobile early on and after meeting with Gottlieb Daimler and others were convinced of its viability The first Peugeot automobile a three wheeled steam powered car designed by Léon Serpollet was produced in only four examples were made Steam power was heavy and bulky and required lengthy warmup times In after meeting Daimler and Émile Levassor steam was abandoned in favour of a four wheeled car with a petrol fuelled internal combustion engine built by Panhard under Daimler licence The car was more sophisticated than many of its contemporaries with a three point suspension and a sliding gear transmission An example was sold to the young Alberto Santos Dumont who exported it to Brazil
More cars followed being built in in in in and in These early models were given type numbers Peugeot became the first manufacturer to fit rubber tyres solid rather than pneumatic to a petrol powered car Due to family discord Armand Peugeot founded the Société des Automobiles Peugeot in but in it was merged back with the family's Peugeot bicycle and motorcycle business
Peugeot was an early pioneer in motor racing with Albert Lemaître winning the world's first motor race the Paris Rouen in a hp Peugeot Five Peugeots qualified for the main event and all finished Lemaître finished min sec behind the Comte de Dion whose steam powered car was ineligible for the official competition Three Peugeots were entered in the Paris Bordeaux Paris where they were beaten by Panhard's car despite an average speed of kmh mph and taking the franc prize This also marked the debut of Michelin pneumatic tyres in racing also on a Peugeot they proved insufficiently durable Nevertheless the vehicles were still very much horseless carriages in appearance and were steered by a tiller
In the first Peugeot engines were built no longer were they reliant on Daimler Designed by Rigoulot the first engine was an hp kW horizontal twin fitted to the back of the Type It also served as the basis of a nearly exact copy produced by Rochet Schneider Further improvements followed the engine moved to the front on the Type and was soon under a bonnet at the front of the car instead of hidden underneath the steering wheel was adopted on the Type and they began to look more like the modern car

For the French Grand Prix an improved L with cc cu in engine was produced with a pioneering ballbearing crankshaft gear driven camshafts and dry sump lubrication all of which soon became standard on racing cars Zuccarelli was killed during testing on public roads but Boillot easily won the event making him and Peugeot the race's first double winner For the French GP Peugeot was overmatched by Mercedes and despite a new innovation four wheel brakes against the Mercedes' rear only Georges proved unable to match them and the car broke down Surprisingly a model turned a mph kmh lap in practice at Indy in yet it failed to qualify Peugeot was more fortunate in winning at the French GP and Vanderbilt Cup
During the First World War Peugeot turned largely to arms production becoming a major manufacturer of arms and military vehicles from armoured cars and bicycles to shells
After the war car production resumed in earnest Racing continued as well with Boillot entering the Targa Florio in a liter in car designed for an event pre empted by World War I the car had km mi on it yet Boillot won with an impressive drive the best of his career Peugeots in his hands were third in the Targa first in the and Coppa Florios first in the and Touring Car Grands Prix and first at the Spa Hours Peugeot introduced a five valve per cylinder triple overhead cam engine for the Grand Prix conceived by Marcel Gremillon who had criticised the early DOHC but the engine was a failure
