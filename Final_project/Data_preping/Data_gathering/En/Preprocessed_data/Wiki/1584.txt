the car and motorcycle company and the bicycle company parted ways in but the family owned cycles peugeot continued to build bicycles throughout the th century until the brand name was sold off to unrelated firms
the family owned firm peugeot saveurs continues to make and market grinders and other kitchen and table service equipment
armand peugeot became interested in the automobile early on and after meeting with gottlieb daimler and others were convinced of its viability
the first peugeot automobile a three wheeled steam powered car designed by l on serpollet was produced in only four examples were made
steam power was heavy and bulky and required lengthy warmup times
in after meeting daimler and mile levassor steam was abandoned in favour of a four wheeled car with a petrol fuelled internal combustion engine built by panhard under daimler licence
the car was more sophisticated than many of its contemporaries with a three point suspension and a sliding gear transmission
an example was sold to the young alberto santos dumont who exported it to brazil
more cars followed being built in in in in and in
these early models were given type numbers
peugeot became the first manufacturer to fit rubber tyres solid rather than pneumatic to a petrol powered car
due to family discord armand peugeot founded the soci t des automobiles peugeot in but in it was merged back with the family s peugeot bicycle and motorcycle business
peugeot was an early pioneer in motor racing with albert lema tre winning the world s first motor race the paris rouen in a hp peugeot
five peugeots qualified for the main event and all finished
lema tre finished min sec behind the comte de dion whose steam powered car was ineligible for the official competition
three peugeots were entered in the paris bordeaux paris where they were beaten by panhard s car despite an average speed of km h mph and taking the franc prize
this also marked the debut of michelin pneumatic tyres in racing also on a peugeot they proved insufficiently durable
nevertheless the vehicles were still very much horseless carriages in appearance and were steered by a tiller
in the first peugeot engines were built no longer were they reliant on daimler
designed by rigoulot the first engine was an hp kw horizontal twin fitted to the back of the type
it also served as the basis of a nearly exact copy produced by rochet schneider
further improvements followed the engine moved to the front on the type and was soon under a bonnet at the front of the car instead of hidden underneath the steering wheel was adopted on the type and they began to look more like the modern car
also in armand peugeot broke away from les fils de peugeot fr res to form his own company soci t anonyme des automobiles peugeot building a new factory at audincourt to focus entirely on cars
in sales hit total car sales for all of france that year were
the same year lema tre won the nice castellane nice rally in a special cc cu in hp kw racer
at the paris salon peugeot debuted a tiny shaft driven cc cu in hp kw one cylinder dubbed b b baby and shed its conservative image becoming a style leader
after placing th in the paris vienna rally with a hp kw cc cu in racer and failing to finish with two similar cars peugeot quit racing
in peugeot motocycles presents at the paris motorshow the first motorcycle equipped with a dion bouton motor
peugeot motocycles remains the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in the world
peugeot added motorcycles to its range in and they have been built under the peugeot name ever since
by peugeot produced half of the cars built in france and they offered the hp kw b b a hp kw four seater and an hp kw and hp kw resembling contemporary mercedes models
the salon showed peugeot s first six cylinder and marked tony huber joining as an engine builder
by peugeot s product line included a cc cu in two cylinder and six four cylinders of between two and six liters
in addition a new factory opened the same year at sochaux which became the main plant in
a more famous name ettore bugatti designed the new cc cu in four cylinder b b of
the same year peugeot returned to racing with a team of three driver engineers a breed typical of the pioneer period exemplified by enzo ferrari among others jules goux graduate of arts et metiers paris paolo zuccarelli formerly of hispano suiza and georges boillot collectively called les charlatans with year old swiss engineer ernest henry to make their ideas reality
the company decided voiturette light car racing was not enough and chose to try grandes preuves grand touring
they did so with an engineering tour de force a dual overhead camshaft dohc liter four cylinder x mm with four valves per cylinder
it proved faster than other cars of its time and boillot won the french grand prix at an average of mph km h despite losing third gear and taking a minute pit stop
in may goux took one to indianapolis and won at an average of mph km h recording straightaway speeds of mph km h
making peugeot the first non american based auto company to win at the indianapolis motor speedway
in boillot s liter l set a new indy lap record of mph km h and duray placed second beaten by ex peugeot ace ren thomas in a cc cu in delage
another driven by boillot s brother andr placed in similar models won in dario resta and howdy wilcox
for the french grand prix an improved l with cc cu in engine was produced with a pioneering ballbearing crankshaft gear driven camshafts and dry sump lubrication all of which soon became standard on racing cars zuccarelli was killed during testing on public roads but boillot easily won the event making him and peugeot the race s first double winner
for the french gp peugeot was overmatched by mercedes and despite a new innovation four wheel brakes against the mercedes rear only georges proved unable to match them and the car broke down
surprisingly a model turned a mph km h lap in practice at indy in yet it failed to qualify peugeot was more fortunate in winning at the french gp and vanderbilt cup
during the first world war peugeot turned largely to arms production becoming a major manufacturer of arms and military vehicles from armoured cars and bicycles to shells
after the war car production resumed in earnest
racing continued as well with boillot entering the targa florio in a liter in car designed for an event pre empted by world war i the car had km mi on it yet boillot won with an impressive drive the best of his career peugeots in his hands were third in the targa first in the and coppa florios first in the and touring car grands prix and first at the spa hours
peugeot introduced a five valve per cylinder triple overhead cam engine for the grand prix conceived by marcel gremillon who had criticised the early dohc but the engine was a failure
the same year peugeot debuted hp kw and hp kw fours the larger based on the type and a liter hp kw sleeve valve six as well as a new cyclecar la quadrilette
during the s peugeot expanded in splitting the cycle pedal and motor business off to form cycles peugeot the consistently profitable cycle division seeking to free itself from the rather more cyclical auto business and taking over the defunct bellanger and de dion companies in
in the type was introduced
new for was the peugeot the cheapest car on the french market and the first to use the later peugeot trademark and registered as such three digits with a central zero
the would get independent front suspension in soon afterwards the depression hit peugeot sales decreased but the company survived
the peugeot system of using three digit names with a central was introduced in
the first digit has always signified the car s size and the final digit has indicated the generation of the vehicle
in attempting a revival of fortune the company unveiled a new aerodynamically styled range
in peugeot introduced the bl clipse d capotable the first convertible with a retractable hardtop an idea followed later by the ford skyliner in the s and revived in the modern era by the mitsubishi gt spyder in
more recently many manufacturers have offered retractable hardtops including peugeot itself with the cc
three models of the s were the peugeot peugeot and peugeot
these cars had curvaceous designs with headlights behind sloping grille bars evidently inspired by the chrysler airflow
the liter entered production in and was produced until the end of despite france s occupation by the nazis
for the new airflow inspired which ran until and a based large model designed by andrean featured a vertical fin and bumper with the first high mounted taillight
the entry level was built in series from to and about more examples were built from existing stocks of supplies in february
the lifted peugeot s sales in to just behind citro n
regular production began again in mid and lasted into
in the company restarted car production with the delivering copies
in peugeot introduced the peugeot with coil springs rack and pinion steering and hydraulic brakes
the set new peugeot sales records remaining in production until
peugeot took over chenard walcker in having already been required to acquire a controlling interest in hotchkiss in

the company began selling cars in the united states in and in introduced the peugeot which used a cc cu in engine tilted
the proved rugged enough to win the east african safari rally four times in and
more models followed many styled by pininfarina such as the one of peugeot s most distinctive models
like many european manufacturers collaboration with other firms increased peugeot worked with renault from and volvo from
the results of this cooperation included the development of the v prv engine which was first manufactured in
several peugeot models were assembled in australia commencing with the in
these were followed by and models with australian assembly ending with the in the early s
in peugeot bought a share of citro n and took over it completely in after the french government gave large sums of money to the new company
citro n was in financial trouble because it developed too many radical new models for its financial resources
some of them notably the citro n sm and the comotor wankel engine venture proved unprofitable
others the citro n cx and citro n gs for example proved very successful in the marketplace
the joint parent company became the psa peugeot citro n group which aimed to keep separate identities for both the peugeot and citro n brands while sharing engineering and technical resources
peugeot thus briefly controlled the italian maserati marque but disposed of it in may
the group then took over the european division of chrysler which were formerly rootes and simca in as the american auto manufacturer struggled to survive
soon the whole chrysler simca range was sold under the revived talbot badge until the production of talbot branded passenger cars was shelved in and on commercial vehicles in
in peugeot launched the successful peugeot supermini which is largely credited for turning the company s fortunes around
the was regularly the bestselling car in france and was also very popular in other parts of europe including britain where sales regularly topped a year by the late s
it won plaudits for its styling ride and handling
it remained on sale in many markets until overlapping with the introduction of the in and ceasing production at the launch of the which also proved hugely popular across europe
as part of the guangzhou peugeot automobile company gpac joint venture the peugeot and were built in china from to
by the company had dropped the talbot brand for passenger cars when it ceased production of the simca based horizon alpine and solara models as well as the talbot samba supermini which was based on the peugeot
what was to be called the talbot arizona became the peugeot with the former rootes plant in ryton and simca plant in poissy being turned over for peugeot assembly
producing peugeots in ryton was significant as it signalled the first time peugeots would be built in britain
the was the first peugeot badged hatchback of its size and sold well across europe
the s successor the was also built at ryton
the saloon was launched in to compete with the likes of the ford sierra and was voted european car of the year
this too was a very popular car across europe and continued to be available in africa and asia after it was replaced by the nearly a decade later
production of the in europe was divided between britain and france although its successor was only produced in france
the peugeot s entry level model from was also produced solely in france
the talbot name survived for a little longer on commercial vehicles until before being shelved completely
as experienced by other european volume car makers peugeot s united states and canadian sales faltered and finally became uneconomical as the peugeot design aged
for a time distribution in the canadian market was handled by chrysler
several ideas to turn around sales in the united states such as including the peugeot in its lineup were considered but not pursued
in the early s the newly introduced proved uncompetitive with domestic and import models in the same market segment and sold less than units
total sales fell to units in and through july which caused the company to cease its u s
and canada operations after years
in just six years after pulling out of both united states and canadian markets peugeot returned to mexico after a year absence under the chile mexico free trade agreement
however peugeot models present are not to be bought or imported into the united states from mexico
on april psa peugeot citro n announced the closure of the ryton manufacturing facility in coventry england
this announcement resulted in the loss of jobs as well as about jobs in the supply chain
the plant produced its last peugeot on december and finally closed down in january
peugeot set an ambitious target of selling million units annually by the end of the decade
in its sales stayed below the million mark
in mid adverse market and industry conditions were blamed for falls in sales and operating losses
christian streiff was replaced by philippe varin ceo and jean pierre plou head of design was transferred from his post at citro n
in peugeot returned to the canadian market with the scooter brand only
peugeot still plans on developing new models to compete in segments where it currently does not compete
collin claimed that the french automaker competed in of market segments in but he wanted to get that figure up to
despite peugeot s sportscar racing program the company is not prepared to build a pure sportscar any more hardcore than the rc z sports coupe
it is also pursuing government funding to develop a diesel hybrid drivetrain which might be key to its expansion
by peugeot planned on pursuing new markets mainly in china russia and south america
in it decided to re enter india after years with a new factory at sanand gujarat
peugeot re entered the philippines in after having a short presence in with distribution done by the alvarez group
in march general motors purchased a share in peugeot for million euros as part of a cooperation aimed at finding savings through joint purchasing and product development
in december gm sold its entire peugeot stake taking a loss of about million euros
in october peugeot closed their production plant at aulnay sous bois as part of a restructuring plan to reduce overcapacity in the face of a shrinking domestic market
by december chinese investors were rumoured to be potential investors
in february the peugeot family agreed to give up control of the company by reducing its holdings from to
as part of this agreement dongfeng motors and the french government were each to buy stakes in the company creating three partners with equal voting rights
the board of directors was to be composed of six independent members two representatives of each dongfeng the french state and the peugeot family and two members representing employees and employees shareholders
the french government took the view the deal did not require approval by brussels as eu competition rules do not count public investment in a company on the same terms as a private investor as state aid
the equity participation by dongfeng expanded an already budding relationship with peugeot
the pair at the time were jointly operating three car manufacturing plants in china with a capacity of producing vehicles a year
in july the joint venture dongfeng peugeot citro n disclosed they were building a fourth factory in china in chengdu in sichuan province targeting the manufacture of sport utility and multipurpose vehicles a year starting towards the end of
in january indian multinational automotive giant mahindra mahindra purchased a major stake of of peugeot motocycles for a price of million euro

pick uppeugeot presented a new concept hybrid electric sports sedan at the paris motor show called the peugeot rc hymotion
similar to the drivetrain model used in the upcoming chevrolet volt the rc concept promises the ability to run solely on electric power for extended periods with a hybrid electric powertrain filling in the gaps when extra range is needed
the rc hymotion includes a kw electric motor at the front wheels
the peugeot prologue hymotion was also shown at the paris show and is in many ways the opposite of the rc hymotion concept
the prologue puts the internal combustion engine up front and runs on diesel instead of gasoline with the electric motor going at the back

peugeot was involved in motorsport from the earliest days and entered five cars for the paris rouen trials in with one of them driven by lema tre finishing second the winning car was a steam powered car and was therefore disqualified meaning lem tre was promoted to first
these trials are usually regarded as the first motor sporting competition
participation in a variety of events continued until world war i but in peugeot made its most notable contribution to motor sporting history when one of their cars driven by georges boillot won the french grand prix at dieppe
this revolutionary car was powered by a straight engine designed by ernest henry under the guidance of the technically knowledgeable racing drivers paul zuccarelli and georges boillot
the design was very influential for racing engines as it featured for the first time dohc and four valves per cylinder providing for high engine speeds a radical departure from previous racing engines which relied on huge displacement for power
in peugeots of similar design to the grand prix car won the french grand prix at amiens and the indianapolis
when one of the peugeot racers remained in the united states during world war i and parts could not be acquired from france for the season owner bob burman had it serviced in the shop of harry miller by a young mechanic named fred offenhauser
their familiarity with the peugeot engine was the basis of the famed miller racing engine which later developed into the offenhauser

in jean todt former co driver for hannu mikkola timo m kinen and guy fr quelin among others was asked by jean boillot the head of automobiles peugeot to create a competition department for psa peugeot citro n
the resulting peugeot talbot sport established at bois de boulogne near paris debuted its group b turbo at the tour de corse in may and took its first world rally win that same year at the lakes rally in august in the hands of ari vatanen
excluding an endurance rally where peugeot were not participating vatanen went on win five world rallies in a row
peugeot s domination continued in the season
despite vatanen s nearly fatal accident in argentina in the middle of the season his teammate and compatriot timo salonen led peugeot to its first drivers and manufacturers world championship titles well ahead of audi and their audi sport quattro
in the season vatanen s young replacement juha kankkunen beat lancia s markku al n to the drivers title and peugeot took its second manufacturers title ahead of lancia
following fia s banning of group b cars for in may after henri toivonen s fatal accident todt was outraged and even unsuccessfully pursued legal action against the federation
peugeot then switched to rally raids

in peugeot again took part in the rally dakar with a newly constructed buggy
for the paris dakar peugeot presented a new team of drivers including time wrc champion s bastien loeb and time dakar winner st phane peterhansel who managed to win the edition for the peugeot factory team in the peugeot dkr

on october peugeot announced that it would end its program in the dakar rally after the edition in order to focus on its fia world rallycross championship career
the event would see peugeot win for the th straight time with ex world rally championship driver carlos sainz
in peugeot returned to the world rally championship with the wrc
the car was immediately competitive against such opposition as the subaru impreza wrc the ford focus wrc and the mitsubishi lancer evolution
marcus gr nholm gave the car its first win at the swedish rally and peugeot went on to win the manufacturers title in their first full year since the return and gr nholm the drivers title in his first full wrc season
after successfully but narrowly defending their manufacturers title in peugeot sport dominated the season taking eight wins in the hands of gr nholm and gilles panizzi
gr nholm also took the drivers title
for the season peugeot retired the wrc in favour of the new wrc
the wrc did not match its predecessor in success but gr nholm took three wins with the car one in and two in

in gran turismo the saloon description sums its racing career up as a competitive touring car which raced throughout europe
the british cars were initially prepared by peugeot sport a team from the peugeot uk factory in coventry under the direction of team manager mick linford in with total sponsorship
peugeot sport was not however a full professional race team akin to those of the competition by now including williams prodrive schnitzer and twr being as it was run from workshops within the peugeot factory largely by factory employees from to racing the mi from to
peugeot therefore contracted motor sport development msd who had developed and run the honda accord in the btcc from to to build run the for when they wore a distinctive green and gold flame design in deference to new sponsor esso
initially the s lack of success was blamed on suspension problems
during the apparently lacked sufficient horsepower to compete with the front runners nissan primeras and honda accords this was mentioned during a particularly strong showing from harvey s at the oulton park btcc meeting of when motorsport commentator charlie cox stated some people say the is down on power you re kidding
during the first btcc meeting at silverstone in the same year cox mentions that msd re designed the touring car from the ground up
it was however widely reported in publications like the now defunct super touring magazine that it was the aero package primarily developed for longer faster tracks in germany and france that led to its success there but hindered the on the slower twistier tracks of the uk
in peugeot entered three btc t peugeot coup s into the british touring car championship to compete with the dominant vauxhall astra coupes
unfortunately the coupe was at the end of its product lifecycle and was not competitive despite some promise towards the end of the year notably when peugeot s steve soper led a race only to suffer engine failure in the last few laps
the coupes were retired at the end of the following year and replaced with the peugeot again uncompetitively in
alongside the btc c s two works supported gtis were also raced in the btc p production class by simon harrison and roger moen with harrison emerging class champion
in the s the company competed in endurance racing including the world sportscar championship and the hours of le mans race with the

for the hours of le mans the peugeot hdi faps finished first and second overall led by drivers marc gen david brabham and alexander wurz
the company has also been involved in providing engines to formula one teams notably to mclaren in to jordan for the and seasons and to prost for the and seasons
despite a number of podium finishes with each of these three teams the manufacturer did not score any victories and their f interests were sold to asiatech at the end of the season
in april a t was tested by s bastien loeb at mont ventoux
loosely based on the shape and design of the production the t is a lightweight kg lb vehicle that uses the rear wing from the peugeot and has a litre twin turbo v engine developing bhp kw ps with the aim of competing at the pikes peak international hill climb
