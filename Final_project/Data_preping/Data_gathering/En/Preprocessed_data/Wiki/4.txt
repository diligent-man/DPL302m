The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States It was founded in by supporters of Andrew Jackson making it the world's oldest active political party Since the s its main political rival has been the Republican Party
Before the Democratic Party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing a national bank and high tariffs It split in over slavery and won the presidency only twice between and In the late th century it continued to oppose high tariffs and had fierce internal debates on the gold standard In the early th century it supported progressive reforms and opposed imperialism with Woodrow Wilson winning the White House in and Since Franklin D Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition after the Democratic Party has promoted a socially liberal platform The New Deal attracted strong support for the party from recent European immigrants many of whom were Catholics based in the cities but caused a decline of the party's conservative pro business wing Following the Civil Rights Act of and the Voting Rights Act of the core bases of the two parties shifted with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic The once powerful labor union element became smaller after the s though the working class remains an important component of the Democratic base Women people with post graduate degrees people living in urban areas younger Americans as well as most sexual religious and racial minorities also tend to support the Democratic Party
The Democratic Party's philosophy of modern liberalism blends notions of civil liberty and social equality with support for a mixed economy In Congress the party is a big tent coalition with influential centrist progressive and conservative wings Corporate governance reform environmental protection support for organized labor expansion of social programs affordable college tuition health care reform equal opportunity and consumer protection form the core of the party's economic agenda On social issues it advocates campaign finance reform LGBT rights criminal justice and immigration reform stricter gun laws abortion rights the abolition of capital punishment and drug reform

Democratic Party officials often trace its origins to the Democratic Republican Party founded by Thomas Jefferson James Madison and other influential opponents of the Federalists in That party died out before the modern Democratic Party was organized the Jeffersonian party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans Historians argue that the modern Democratic Party was first organized in the late s with the election of Andrew Jackson
Since the nomination of William Jennings Bryan in the party has generally positioned itself to the left of the Republican Party on economic issues Democrats have been more liberal on civil rights since although conservative factions within the Democratic Party that opposed them persisted in the South until the s On foreign policy both parties have changed positions several times
The Democratic Party evolved from the Jeffersonian Republican or Democratic Republican Party organized by Jefferson and Madison in opposition to the Federalist Party The Democratic Republican Party favored republicanism a weak federal government states' rights agrarian interests especially Southern planters and strict adherence to the Constitution The party opposed a national bank and Great Britain After the War of the Federalists virtually disappeared and the only national political party left was the Democratic Republicans which was prone to splinter along regional lines The era of one party rule in the United States known as the Era of Good Feelings lasted from until when Andrew Jackson became president Jackson and Martin Van Buren worked with allies in each state to form a new Democratic Party on a national basis In the s the Whig Party coalesced into the main rival to the Democrats
The Democratic Republican Party split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe The faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren became the modern Democratic Party As Norton explains the transformation in
Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats Opposing factions led by Henry Clay helped form the Whig Party The Democratic Party had a small yet decisive advantage over the Whigs until the s when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery In angry with the Kansas Nebraska Act anti slavery Democrats left the party and joined Northern Whigs to form the Republican Party
The Democrats split over slavery with Northern and Southern tickets in the election of in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy The radical pro slavery Fire Eaters led walkouts at the two conventions when the delegates would not adopt a resolution supporting the extension of slavery into territories even if the voters of those territories did not want it These Southern Democrats nominated the pro slavery incumbent vice president John C Breckinridge of Kentucky for president and General Joseph Lane of Oregon for vice president The Northern Democrats nominated Senator Stephen A Douglas of Illinois for president and former Georgia Governor Herschel V Johnson for vice president This fracturing of the Democrats led to a Republican victory and Abraham Lincoln was elected the th president of the United States
As the American Civil War broke out Northern Democrats were divided into War Democrats and Peace Democrats The Confederate States of America deliberately avoided organized political parties Most War Democrats rallied to Republican President Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans' National Union Party in the election of which featured Andrew Johnson on the Union ticket to attract fellow Democrats Johnson replaced Lincoln in but he stayed independent of both parties
The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of Reconstruction after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party After Redeemers ended Reconstruction in the s and following the often extremely violent disenfranchisement of African Americans led by such white supremacist Democratic politicians as Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina in the s and s the South voting Democratic became known as the Solid South Although Republicans won all but two presidential elections the Democrats remained competitive The party was dominated by pro business Bourbon Democrats led by Samuel J Tilden and Grover Cleveland who represented mercantile banking and railroad interests opposed imperialism and overseas expansion fought for the gold standard opposed bimetallism and crusaded against corruption high taxes and tariffs Cleveland was elected to non consecutive presidential terms in and
Agrarian Democrats demanding free silver drawing on Populist ideas overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in and nominated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency a nomination repeated by Democrats in and Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests but he lost to Republican William McKinley
The Democrats took control of the House in and Woodrow Wilson won election as president in when the Republicans split and Wilson effectively led Congress to put to rest the issues of tariffs money and antitrust which had dominated politics for years with new progressive laws He failed to secure Senate passage of the Versailles Treaty ending the war with Germany and joining the League of Nations The weak party was deeply divided by issues such as the KKK and prohibition in the s However it did organize new ethnic voters in Northern cities
The Great Depression in that began under Republican President Herbert Hoover and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government as the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from until the Senate for of years from and won most presidential elections until Franklin D Roosevelt elected to the presidency in came forth with federal government programs called the New Deal New Deal liberalism meant the regulation of business especially finance and banking and the promotion of labor unions as well as federal spending to aid the unemployed help distressed farmers and undertake large scale public works projects It marked the start of the American welfare state The opponents who stressed opposition to unions support for business and low taxes started calling themselves conservatives
Until the s the Democratic Party was a coalition of two parties divided by the Mason Dixon line liberal Democrats in the North and culturally conservative voters in the South who though benefitting from many of the New Deal public works projects opposed increasing civil rights initiatives advocated by Northeastern liberals The polarization grew stronger after Roosevelt died Southern Democrats formed a key part of the bipartisan conservative coalition in an alliance with most of the Midwestern Republicans The economically activist philosophy of Franklin D Roosevelt which has strongly influenced American liberalism shaped much of the party's economic agenda after From the s to the mid s the liberal New Deal coalition usually controlled the presidency while the conservative coalition usually controlled Congress
Issues facing parties and the United States after World War II included the Cold War and the civil rights movement Republicans attracted conservatives and after the s white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their use of the Southern strategy and resistance to New Deal and Great Society liberalism Until the s African Americans had traditionally supported the Republican Party because of its anti slavery civil rights policies Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of the Southern states became more reliably Republican in presidential politics while Northeastern states became more reliably Democratic Studies show that Southern whites which were a core constituency in the Democratic Party shifted to the Republican Party due to racial conservatism
The election of President John F Kennedy from Massachusetts in partially reflected this shift In the campaign Kennedy attracted a new generation of younger voters In his agenda dubbed the New Frontier Kennedy introduced a host of social programs and public works projects along with enhanced support of the space program proposing a crewed spacecraft trip to the moon by the end of the decade He pushed for civil rights initiatives and proposed the Civil Rights Act of but with his assassination in November he was not able to see its passage
Kennedy's successor Lyndon B Johnson was able to persuade the largely conservative Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of and with a more progressive Congress in passed much of the Great Society which consisted of an array of social programs designed to help the poor Kennedy and Johnson's advocacy of civil rights further solidified black support for the Democrats but had the effect of alienating Southern whites who would eventually gravitate toward the Republican Party particularly after the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in The United States' involvement in the Vietnam War in the s was another divisive issue that further fractured the fault lines of the Democrats' coalition After the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in President Johnson committed a large contingency of combat troops to Vietnam but the escalation failed to drive the Viet Cong from South Vietnam resulting in an increasing quagmire which by had become the subject of widespread anti war protests in the United States and elsewhere With increasing casualties and nightly news reports bringing home troubling images from Vietnam the costly military engagement became increasingly unpopular alienating many of the kinds of young voters that the Democrats had attracted in the early s The protests that year along with assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and Democratic presidential candidate Senator Robert F Kennedy younger brother of John F Kennedy climaxed in turbulence at the hotly contested Democratic National Convention that summer in Chicago which amongst the ensuing turmoil inside and outside of the convention hall nominated Vice President Hubert Humphrey in a series of events that proved to mark a significant turning point in the decline of the Democratic Party's broad coalition
Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon was able to capitalize on the confusion of the Democrats that year and won the election to become the th president He won re election in a landslide in against Democratic nominee George McGovern who like Robert F Kennedy reached out to the younger anti war and counterculture voters but unlike Kennedy was not able to appeal to the party's more traditional white working class constituencies During Nixon's second term his presidency was rocked by the Watergate scandal which forced him to resign in He was succeeded by vice president Gerald Ford who served a brief tenure Watergate offered the Democrats an opportunity to recoup and their nominee Jimmy Carter won the presidential election With the initial support of evangelical Christian voters in the South Carter was temporarily able to reunite the disparate factions within the party but inflation and the Iran Hostage Crisis of took their toll resulting in a landslide victory for Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan in which shifted the political landscape in favor of the Republicans for years to come
With the ascendancy of the Republicans under Ronald Reagan the Democrats searched for ways to respond yet were unable to succeed by running traditional candidates such as former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale who lost to Reagan in the presidential election Many Democrats attached their hopes to the future star of Gary Hart who had challenged Mondale in the primaries running on a theme of New Ideas and in the subsequent primaries became the de facto front runner and virtual shoo in for the Democratic presidential nomination before a sex scandal ended his campaign The party nevertheless began to seek out a younger generation of leaders who like Hart had been inspired by the pragmatic idealism of John F Kennedy
Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was one such figure who was elected president in as the Democratic nominee He labeled himself and governed as a New Democrat The party adopted a centrist economic yet socially progressive agenda with the voter base after Reagan having shifted considerably to the right In an effort to appeal both to liberals and to fiscal conservatives Democrats began to advocate for a balanced budget and market economy tempered by government intervention mixed economy along with a continued emphasis on social justice and affirmative action The economic policy adopted by the Democratic Party including the former Clinton administration has been referred to as Third Way The Democrats lost control of Congress in the election of to the Republican Party Re elected in Clinton was the first Democratic president since Franklin D Roosevelt to be elected to two terms
