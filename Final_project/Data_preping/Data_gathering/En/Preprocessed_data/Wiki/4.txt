the democratic party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the united states
it was founded in by supporters of andrew jackson making it the world s oldest active political party
since the s its main political rival has been the republican party
before the democratic party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing a national bank and high tariffs
it split in over slavery and won the presidency only twice between and
in the late th century it continued to oppose high tariffs and had fierce internal debates on the gold standard
in the early th century it supported progressive reforms and opposed imperialism with woodrow wilson winning the white house in and
since franklin d
roosevelt and his new deal coalition after the democratic party has promoted a socially liberal platform
the new deal attracted strong support for the party from recent european immigrants many of whom were catholics based in the cities but caused a decline of the party s conservative pro business wing
following the civil rights act of and the voting rights act of the core bases of the two parties shifted with the southern states becoming more reliably republican in presidential politics and the northeastern states becoming more reliably democratic
the once powerful labor union element became smaller after the s though the working class remains an important component of the democratic base
women people with post graduate degrees people living in urban areas younger americans as well as most sexual religious and racial minorities also tend to support the democratic party
the democratic party s philosophy of modern liberalism blends notions of civil liberty and social equality with support for a mixed economy
in congress the party is a big tent coalition with influential centrist progressive and conservative wings
corporate governance reform environmental protection support for organized labor expansion of social programs affordable college tuition health care reform equal opportunity and consumer protection form the core of the party s economic agenda
on social issues it advocates campaign finance reform lgbt rights criminal justice and immigration reform stricter gun laws abortion rights the abolition of capital punishment and drug reform
including the incumbent joe biden democrats have served as president of the united states
as of the party holds a federal government trifecta the presidency and majorities in both the u s
house and the u s
senate as well as state governorships state legislatures and state government trifectas the governorship and both legislative chambers
three of the nine justices on the u s
supreme court were appointed by democratic presidents
by registered members in those states which permit or require registration by party affiliation the democratic party is the largest party in the united states and the third largest in the world
democratic party officials often trace its origins to the democratic republican party founded by thomas jefferson james madison and other influential opponents of the federalists in
that party died out before the modern democratic party was organized the jeffersonian party also inspired the whigs and modern republicans
historians argue that the modern democratic party was first organized in the late s with the election of andrew jackson
since the nomination of william jennings bryan in the party has generally positioned itself to the left of the republican party on economic issues
democrats have been more liberal on civil rights since although conservative factions within the democratic party that opposed them persisted in the south until the s
on foreign policy both parties have changed positions several times
the democratic party evolved from the jeffersonian republican or democratic republican party organized by jefferson and madison in opposition to the federalist party
the democratic republican party favored republicanism a weak federal government states rights agrarian interests especially southern planters and strict adherence to the constitution
the party opposed a national bank and great britain
after the war of the federalists virtually disappeared and the only national political party left was the democratic republicans which was prone to splinter along regional lines
the era of one party rule in the united states known as the era of good feelings lasted from until when andrew jackson became president
jackson and martin van buren worked with allies in each state to form a new democratic party on a national basis
in the s the whig party coalesced into the main rival to the democrats
the democratic republican party split over the choice of a successor to president james monroe
the faction that supported many of the old jeffersonian principles led by andrew jackson and martin van buren became the modern democratic party
as norton explains the transformation in
behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the democrats opposing factions led by henry clay helped form the whig party
the democratic party had a small yet decisive advantage over the whigs until the s when the whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery
in angry with the kansas nebraska act anti slavery democrats left the party and joined northern whigs to form the republican party
the democrats split over slavery with northern and southern tickets in the election of in which the republican party gained ascendancy
the radical pro slavery fire eaters led walkouts at the two conventions when the delegates would not adopt a resolution supporting the extension of slavery into territories even if the voters of those territories did not want it
these southern democrats nominated the pro slavery incumbent vice president john c
breckinridge of kentucky for president and general joseph lane of oregon for vice president
the northern democrats nominated senator stephen a
douglas of illinois for president and former georgia governor herschel v
johnson for vice president
this fracturing of the democrats led to a republican victory and abraham lincoln was elected the th president of the united states
as the american civil war broke out northern democrats were divided into war democrats and peace democrats
the confederate states of america deliberately avoided organized political parties
most war democrats rallied to republican president abraham lincoln and the republicans national union party in the election of which featured andrew johnson on the union ticket to attract fellow democrats
johnson replaced lincoln in but he stayed independent of both parties
the democrats benefited from white southerners resentment of reconstruction after the war and consequent hostility to the republican party
after redeemers ended reconstruction in the s and following the often extremely violent disenfranchisement of african americans led by such white supremacist democratic politicians as benjamin tillman of south carolina in the s and s the south voting democratic became known as the solid south although republicans won all but two presidential elections the democrats remained competitive
the party was dominated by pro business bourbon democrats led by samuel j
tilden and grover cleveland who represented mercantile banking and railroad interests opposed imperialism and overseas expansion fought for the gold standard opposed bimetallism and crusaded against corruption high taxes and tariffs
cleveland was elected to non consecutive presidential terms in and
agrarian democrats demanding free silver drawing on populist ideas overthrew the bourbon democrats in and nominated william jennings bryan for the presidency a nomination repeated by democrats in and
bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking eastern moneyed interests but he lost to republican william mckinley
the democrats took control of the house in and woodrow wilson won election as president in when the republicans split and
wilson effectively led congress to put to rest the issues of tariffs money and antitrust which had dominated politics for years with new progressive laws
he failed to secure senate passage of the versailles treaty ending the war with germany and joining the league of nations
the weak party was deeply divided by issues such as the kkk and prohibition in the s
however it did organize new ethnic voters in northern cities
the great depression in that began under republican president herbert hoover and the republican congress set the stage for a more liberal government as the democrats controlled the house of representatives nearly uninterrupted from until the senate for of years from and won most presidential elections until
franklin d
roosevelt elected to the presidency in came forth with federal government programs called the new deal
new deal liberalism meant the regulation of business especially finance and banking and the promotion of labor unions as well as federal spending to aid the unemployed help distressed farmers and undertake large scale public works projects
it marked the start of the american welfare state
the opponents who stressed opposition to unions support for business and low taxes started calling themselves conservatives
until the s the democratic party was a coalition of two parties divided by the mason dixon line liberal democrats in the north and culturally conservative voters in the south who though benefitting from many of the new deal public works projects opposed increasing civil rights initiatives advocated by northeastern liberals
the polarization grew stronger after roosevelt died
southern democrats formed a key part of the bipartisan conservative coalition in an alliance with most of the midwestern republicans
the economically activist philosophy of franklin d
roosevelt which has strongly influenced american liberalism shaped much of the party s economic agenda after
from the s to the mid s the liberal new deal coalition usually controlled the presidency while the conservative coalition usually controlled congress
issues facing parties and the united states after world war ii included the cold war and the civil rights movement
republicans attracted conservatives and after the s white southerners from the democratic coalition with their use of the southern strategy and resistance to new deal and great society liberalism
until the s african americans had traditionally supported the republican party because of its anti slavery civil rights policies
following the passage of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of the southern states became more reliably republican in presidential politics while northeastern states became more reliably democratic
studies show that southern whites which were a core constituency in the democratic party shifted to the republican party due to racial conservatism
the election of president john f
kennedy from massachusetts in partially reflected this shift
in the campaign kennedy attracted a new generation of younger voters
in his agenda dubbed the new frontier kennedy introduced a host of social programs and public works projects along with enhanced support of the space program proposing a crewed spacecraft trip to the moon by the end of the decade
he pushed for civil rights initiatives and proposed the civil rights act of but with his assassination in november he was not able to see its passage
kennedy s successor lyndon b
johnson was able to persuade the largely conservative congress to pass the civil rights act of and with a more progressive congress in passed much of the great society which consisted of an array of social programs designed to help the poor
kennedy and johnson s advocacy of civil rights further solidified black support for the democrats but had the effect of alienating southern whites who would eventually gravitate toward the republican party particularly after the election of ronald reagan to the presidency in
the united states involvement in the vietnam war in the s was another divisive issue that further fractured the fault lines of the democrats coalition
after the gulf of tonkin resolution in president johnson committed a large contingency of combat troops to vietnam but the escalation failed to drive the viet cong from south vietnam resulting in an increasing quagmire which by had become the subject of widespread anti war protests in the united states and elsewhere
with increasing casualties and nightly news reports bringing home troubling images from vietnam the costly military engagement became increasingly unpopular alienating many of the kinds of young voters that the democrats had attracted in the early s
the protests that year along with assassinations of martin luther king jr
and democratic presidential candidate senator robert f
kennedy younger brother of john f
kennedy climaxed in turbulence at the hotly contested democratic national convention that summer in chicago which amongst the ensuing turmoil inside and outside of the convention hall nominated vice president hubert humphrey in a series of events that proved to mark a significant turning point in the decline of the democratic party s broad coalition
republican presidential nominee richard nixon was able to capitalize on the confusion of the democrats that year and won the election to become the th president
he won re election in a landslide in against democratic nominee george mcgovern who like robert f
kennedy reached out to the younger anti war and counterculture voters but unlike kennedy was not able to appeal to the party s more traditional white working class constituencies
during nixon s second term his presidency was rocked by the watergate scandal which forced him to resign in
he was succeeded by vice president gerald ford who served a brief tenure
watergate offered the democrats an opportunity to recoup and their nominee jimmy carter won the presidential election
with the initial support of evangelical christian voters in the south carter was temporarily able to reunite the disparate factions within the party but inflation and the iran hostage crisis of took their toll resulting in a landslide victory for republican presidential nominee ronald reagan in which shifted the political landscape in favor of the republicans for years to come
with the ascendancy of the republicans under ronald reagan the democrats searched for ways to respond yet were unable to succeed by running traditional candidates such as former vice president and democratic presidential nominee walter mondale who lost to reagan in the presidential election
many democrats attached their hopes to the future star of gary hart who had challenged mondale in the primaries running on a theme of new ideas and in the subsequent primaries became the de facto front runner and virtual shoo in for the democratic presidential nomination before a sex scandal ended his campaign
the party nevertheless began to seek out a younger generation of leaders who like hart had been inspired by the pragmatic idealism of john f
kennedy
arkansas governor bill clinton was one such figure who was elected president in as the democratic nominee
he labeled himself and governed as a new democrat the party adopted a centrist economic yet socially progressive agenda with the voter base after reagan having shifted considerably to the right
in an effort to appeal both to liberals and to fiscal conservatives democrats began to advocate for a balanced budget and market economy tempered by government intervention mixed economy along with a continued emphasis on social justice and affirmative action
the economic policy adopted by the democratic party including the former clinton administration has been referred to as third way the democrats lost control of congress in the election of to the republican party
re elected in clinton was the first democratic president since franklin d
roosevelt to be elected to two terms
in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon as well as the growing concern over global warming some of the party s key issues in the early st century have included combating terrorism while preserving human rights expanding access to health care labor rights and environmental protection
democrats regained majority control of both the house and the senate in the elections
barack obama won the democratic party s nomination and was elected as the first african american president in
under the obama presidency the party moved forward reforms including an economic stimulus package the dodd frank financial reform act and the affordable care act
in the midterm elections the democratic party lost control of the house and lost its majority in state legislatures and state governorships
in the elections president obama was re elected but the party remained in the minority in the house of representatives and lost control of the senate in the midterm elections
after the election of donald trump the democratic party transitioned into the role of an opposition party and held neither the presidency nor the senate but won back a majority in the house in the midterm elections
democrats were extremely critical of president trump particularly his policies on immigration healthcare and abortion as well as his response to the covid pandemic
based on a poll conducted in gallup found that of americans identified as democrats as republicans and as independents
in the same poll a survey of registered voters stated that identified as democrats or leaned toward the party compared to of registered voters who identified as or leaned toward the republicans
in democratic congressional candidate tom malinowski who was later elected described the party
in november democrat joe biden won the presidential election
he began his term with narrow democratic majorities in the house and the senate
the democratic republican party splintered in into the short lived national republican party and the jacksonian movement which in became the democratic party
under the jacksonian era the term the democracy was in use by the party but the name democratic party was eventually settled upon and became the official name in
members of the party are called democrats or dems
the term democrat party has also been in local use but has usually been used by opponents since as a disparaging term
the most common mascot symbol for the party has been the donkey or jackass
andrew jackson s enemies twisted his name to jackass as a term of ridicule regarding a stupid and stubborn animal
however the democrats liked the common man implications and picked it up too therefore the image persisted and evolved
its most lasting impression came from the cartoons of thomas nast from in harper s weekly
cartoonists followed nast and used the donkey to represent the democrats and the elephant to represent the republicans
in the early th century the traditional symbol of the democratic party in indiana kentucky oklahoma and ohio was the rooster as opposed to the republican eagle
this symbol still appears on oklahoma kentucky indiana and west virginia ballots
the rooster was adopted as the official symbol of the national democratic party
in new york the democratic ballot symbol is a five pointed star
although both major political parties and many minor ones use the traditional american colors of red white and blue in their marketing and representations since election night blue has become the identifying color for the democratic party while red has become the identifying color for the republican party
that night for the first time all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map blue states for al gore democratic nominee and red states for george w
bush republican nominee
since then the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party
this is contrary to common practice outside of the united states where blue is the traditional color of the right and red the color of the left
for example in canada red represents the liberals while blue represents the conservatives
in the united kingdom red denotes the labour party and blue symbolizes the conservative party
any use of the color blue to denote the democratic party prior to would be historically inaccurate and misleading
since blue has also been used both by party supporters for promotional efforts actblue buyblue and bluefund as examples and by the party itself in both for its red to blue program created to support democratic candidates running against republican incumbents in the midterm elections that year and on its official website
in september the democratic party unveiled its new logo which featured a blue d inside a blue circle
it was the party s first official logo the donkey logo had only been semi official
jefferson jackson day is the annual fundraising event dinner held by democratic party organizations across the united states
it is named after presidents thomas jefferson and andrew jackson whom the party regards as its distinguished early leaders
the song happy days are here again is the unofficial song of the democratic party
it was used prominently when franklin d
roosevelt was nominated for president at the democratic national convention and remains a sentimental favorite for democrats today
for example paul shaffer played the theme on the late show with david letterman after the democrats won congress in
don t stop by fleetwood mac was adopted by bill clinton s presidential campaign in and has endured as a popular democratic song
the emotionally similar song beautiful day by the band u has also become a favorite theme song for democratic candidates
john kerry used the song during his presidential campaign and several democratic congressional candidates used it as a celebratory tune in
as a traditional anthem for its presidential nominating convention aaron copland s fanfare for the common man is traditionally performed at the beginning of the democratic national convention
the democratic national committee dnc is responsible for promoting democratic campaign activities
while the dnc is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the democratic platform the dnc is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy
in presidential elections it supervises the democratic national convention
the national convention is subject to the charter of the party and the ultimate authority within the democratic party when it is in session with the dnc running the party s organization at other times
the dnc is chaired by jaime harrison
each state also has a state committee made up of elected committee members as well as ex officio committee members usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies which in turn elects a chair
county town city and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level
state and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law
rarely do they have much funding but in dnc chairman dean began a program called the state strategy of using dnc national funds to assist all state parties and pay for full time professional staffers
the democratic congressional campaign committee dccc assists party candidates in house races and its current chairman selected by the party caucus is representative sean patrick maloney of new york
similarly the democratic senatorial campaign committee dscc headed by senator gary peters of michigan raises funds for senate races
the democratic legislative campaign committee dlcc chaired by majority leader of the new york state senate andrea stewart cousins is a smaller organization that focuses on state legislative races
the dnc sponsors the college democrats of america cda a student outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of democratic activists
democrats abroad is the organization for americans living outside the united states
they work to advance the party s goals and encourage americans living abroad to support the democrats
the young democrats of america yda and the high school democrats of america hsda are young adult and youth led organizations respectively that attempt to draw in and mobilize young people for democratic candidates but operates outside of the dnc
the democratic governors association dga is an organization supporting the candidacies of democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents
likewise the mayors of the largest cities and urban centers convene as the national conference of democratic mayors
upon foundation the democratic party supported agrarianism and the jacksonian democracy movement of president andrew jackson representing farmers and rural interests and traditional jeffersonian democrats
since the s especially in northern states the party began to favor more liberal positions the term liberal in this sense describes modern liberalism rather than classical liberalism or economic liberalism
in recent exit polls the democratic party has had broad appeal across all socio ethno economic demographics
historically the party has represented farmers laborers and religious and ethnic minorities as it has opposed unregulated business and finance and favored progressive income taxes
in foreign policy internationalism including interventionism was a dominant theme from to the mid s
in the s the party began advocating social programs targeted at the poor
the party had a fiscally conservative pro business wing typified by grover cleveland and al smith and a southern conservative wing that shrank after president lyndon b
johnson supported the civil rights act of
the major influences for liberalism were labor unions which peaked in the era and african americans
environmentalism has been a major component since the s
the st century democratic party is predominantly a coalition of centrists liberals and progressives with significant overlap between the three groups
political scientists characterize the democratic party as less ideologically cohesive than the republican party due to the broader diversity of coalitions than compose the democratic party
the democratic party once dominant in the southeastern united states is now strongest in the northeast mid atlantic and new england the great lakes region and the west coast including hawaii
the party is also very strong in major cities regardless of region
centrist democrats or new democrats are an ideologically centrist faction within the democratic party that emerged after the victory of republican george h
bush in the presidential election
they are an economically liberal and third way faction which dominated the party for around years starting in the late s after the united states populace turned much further to the political right
they are represented by organizations such as the new democrat network and the new democrat coalition
the new democrat coalition is a pro growth and fiscally moderate congressional coalition
one of the most influential centrist groups was the democratic leadership council dlc a nonprofit organization that advocated centrist positions for the party
the dlc hailed president bill clinton as proof of the viability of third way politicians and a dlc success story
the dlc disbanded in and much of the former dlc is now represented in the think tank third way
some democratic elected officials have self declared as being centrists including former president bill clinton former vice president al gore senator mark warner former pennsylvania governor ed rendell former senator jim webb president joe biden congresswoman ann kirkpatrick and former congressman dave mccurdy
the new democrat network supports socially liberal and fiscally moderate democratic politicians and is associated with the congressional new democrat coalition in the house
suzan delbene is the chair of the coalition and former senator and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton was a member while in congress
in president barack obama was self described as a new democrat
a conservative democrat is a member of the democratic party with conservative political views or with views relatively conservative with respect to those of the national party
while such members of the democratic party can be found throughout the nation actual elected officials are disproportionately found within the southern states and to a lesser extent within rural regions of the united states generally more commonly in the west
historically southern democrats were generally much more ideologically conservative than conservative democrats are now
many conservative southern democrats defected to the republican party beginning with the passage of the civil rights act of and the general leftward shift of the party
strom thurmond of south carolina billy tauzin of louisiana kent hance and ralph hall of texas and richard shelby of alabama are examples of this
the influx of conservative democrats into the republican party is often cited as a reason for the republican party s shift further to the right during the late th century as well as the shift of its base from the northeast and midwest to the south
into the s the democratic party had a conservative element mostly from the south and border regions
their numbers declined sharply as the republican party built up its southern base
they were sometimes humorously called yellow dog democrats or boll weevils and dixiecrats in the house they form the blue dog coalition a caucus of conservatives and centrists willing to broker compromises with the republican leadership
they have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past giving its members some ability to change legislation depending on their numbers in congress
split ticket voting was common among conservative southern democrats in the s and s
these voters supported conservative democrats for local and statewide office while simultaneously voting for republican presidential candidates
social liberals modern liberals are a large portion of the democratic base
according to exit polls liberals constituted of the electorate and of american liberals favored the candidate of the democratic party
white collar college educated professionals were mostly republican until the s but they now compose a vital component of the democratic party
a large majority of liberals favor moving toward universal health care with many supporting an eventual gradual transition to a single payer system in particular
a majority also favor diplomacy over military action stem cell research the legalization of same sex marriage stricter gun control and environmental protection laws as well as the preservation of abortion rights
immigration and cultural diversity are deemed positive as liberals favor cultural pluralism a system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to adopting their new culture
they tend to be divided on free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta and organizations with some seeing them as more favorable to corporations than workers
most liberals oppose increased military spending and the mixing of church and state
this ideological group differs from the traditional organized labor base
according to the pew research center a plurality of resided in mass affluent households and were college graduates the highest figure of any typographical group
it was also the fastest growing typological group between the late s and early s
liberals include most of academia and large portions of the professional class
progressives are the most left leaning faction in the party and support strong business regulations social programs and workers rights
progressive ideological stances have much in common with the programs of european countries as well as many east asian countries
many progressive democrats are descendants of the new left of democratic presidential candidate senator george mcgovern of south dakota whereas others were involved in the presidential candidacy of vermont senator bernie sanders
progressives are often considered to have ideas similar to social democracy due to heavy inspiration from the nordic model believing in federal top marginal income taxes ranging from to rent control increased collective bargaining power a an hour minimum wage as well as free tuition and universal healthcare typically medicare for all
in progressive senator elizabeth warren set out eleven commandments of progressivism tougher regulation on corporations affordable education scientific investment and environmentalism net neutrality increased wages equal pay for women collective bargaining rights defending social programs same sex marriage immigration reform and unabridged access to reproductive healthcare
in addition progressives strongly oppose political corruption and seek to advance electoral reforms such as campaign finance rules and voting rights protections
today many progressives have made combating economic inequality their top priority
the congressional progressive caucus cpc is a caucus of progressive democrats chaired by pramila jayapal of washington
its members have included representatives dennis kucinich of ohio john conyers of michigan jim mcdermott of washington barbara lee of california and senator paul wellstone of minnesota
senators sherrod brown of ohio tammy baldwin of wisconsin mazie hirono of hawaii and ed markey of massachusetts were members of the caucus when in the house of representatives

democrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of environmentalism
in more recent years this stance has emphasized renewable energy generation as the basis for an improved economy greater national security and general environmental benefits
the democratic party is substantially more likely than the republican party to support environmental regulation and policies that are supportive of renewable energy
the democratic party also favors expansion of conservation lands and encourages open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and the economy as it believe s that communities environmental interests and the government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies
once americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment
they now know this is a false choice
