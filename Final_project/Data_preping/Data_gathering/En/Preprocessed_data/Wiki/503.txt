This is a list of characters from the American television sitcom, Cheers.
Before the Cheers pilot, "Give Me a Ring Sometime", was finalized and then aired in 1982, the series originally consisted of four employees of Cheers, the bar, in the original script
There was neither Norm Peterson nor Cliff Clavin, regular customers of Cheers; later revisions added them as part of the series.
Samuel "Mayday" Malone (Ted Danson) — a bartender and owner of Cheers
Sam is also a ladies' man
Before the series began, he was a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox when he became (and still is) a friend of Coach, but then he became alcoholic, which took a toll on his baseball career
He has had on-again, off-again relationships with Diane Chambers, his opposite, in the first five seasons (1982–1987)
During the breaks in their relationship Sam has flings with many not-so-bright "sexy women", but generally doesn't pursue relationships and fails to seduce some intellectual women.
After Diane leaves Boston, he pursues Rebecca Howe, largely unsuccessfully
In the end, he is still unmarried, recovering from sexual addiction with help from Dr
Robert Sutton's (Gilbert Lewis) group meetings, advised by Frasier, in the penultimate episode "The Guy Can't Help It" (1993)
Sam Malone was originally written as a former football player, but the casting of Ted Danson led writers to change Sam into an ex-baseball player.
Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) — a highly academic, sophisticated college student
In the pilot, Diane is abandoned by her fiancé Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire), for whom she'd worked as an assistant, as he returns to his ex-wife
Without a job, money, or man, she reluctantly becomes a cocktail waitress
Over time, she becomes a close friend of Coach
She has an on-and-off relationship with bartender Sam Malone
When not involved with Sam, Diane dates men who fit her upper-class ideals, such as Frasier Crane
Later in the fifth season, she leaves Boston behind for a writing career and in the eleventh and final season lives in Los Angeles.
Ernie "Coach" Pantusso (or Pantuso) (Nicholas Colasanto) — a "senile" co-bartender, widower, and retired baseball coach
Coach was also a friend of Sam and a close friend of Diane
He had a daughter, Lisa
Coach was often easily tricked, particularly into situations that put the bar at stake
Nevertheless, he listened to people's problems and then helped to them with advice and analyses
In the fourth season, Coach died without explicit explanation while the actor Colasanto himself died of a heart attack in February 1985.
Carla Maria Victoria Angelina Teresa Apollonia Lozupone (Rhea Perlman) — a "wisecracking, cynical" cocktail waitress, who abuses customers
At the series premiere, she was the mother of four children and divorced from Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya)
She flirts with men, including ones who are not interested in her, and believes in superstitions, but secretly carries the torch for Sam
She is both highly fertile and matrimonially inept.
Carla's last husband, Eddie LeBec, a washed-up ice hockey goalie whom she married during the run of the show, eventually died in an ice show accident involving a Zamboni
Carla later discovered that Eddie had cheated on her, committing bigamy with another woman whom he had gotten pregnant
Carla's sleazy first husband, Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya), also made appearances, variously challenging Carla with a custody battle or a legal scam stemming from their divorce
Carla's eight children, four of whom were born during the show's run, were notoriously ill-behaved, except for Ludlow, whose father was a prominent academician
Perlman's real-life pregnancies were written into the series as Carla's pregnancies.
Hilary Norman Peterson (George Wendt) — a bar regular and semi-unemployed accountant, whose common name "Norm" is often shouted whenever he enters the bar
Outside the bar, he frequently changes jobs and has a troubled marriage with (but is still in love with and married to) Vera, an unseen character
Later in the series, he becomes a house painter, especially for Rebecca's bar office
(Despite a few fleeting appearances and vocal cameos, Vera's body is seen in the fifth-season episode "Thanksgiving Orphans" (1986), but her face is covered with a pumpkin pie
Her body is played by Bernadette Birkett, the real-life wife of George Wendt.)
Originally, there was no Norm Peterson
Wendt auditioned for a minor role George for the pilot episode, who was Diane Chambers' first customer and had only one word in one line: "Beer!" After he was cast as George, Wendt's role was rewritten into Norm.
Clifford C
Clavin, Jr
(John Ratzenberger) — a know-it-all bar regular and postman
He mostly lives with his mother, Esther Clavin (Frances Sternhagen), in the family house (until its on-screen destruction in season 6) and then in a condo, although he first purchases the condo as a bachelor pad for himself
He is ridiculed by friends and enemies alike, including Norm and Carla, for his know-it-all attitude
Cliff is mostly hopeless with women
His longest relationship is with fellow postal worker Margaret O'Keefe (Annie Golden), which begins during Cheers' seventh season (1988–89)
When Margaret becomes pregnant with another man's child in 1993's "Do Not Forsake Me O My Postman", Cliff stays by her side as the baby's stepfather before Margaret returns to the child's biological father.
In "The Barstoolie" (1985) Cliff meets his father, Cliff Clavin Sr
(Dick O'Neill), who left Cliff and his mother years earlier when Cliff was still a child
Cliff later realizes that his father is a fraudster and a fugitive from justice, and will run off again
Cliff does not want to turn his father in; Cliff Sr
disappears, leaving his son devastated.
Ratzenberger auditioned for the Norm Peterson role but, sensing he would not get the role, Ratzenberger pitched the idea of a bar "know-it-all"
The producers loved the idea so the security guard Cliff Clavin was added for the pilot
However, the producers changed his occupation into a postal worker because they perceived postal workers as more knowledgeable than security guards.
Woody Boyd replaced Coach, who died off-screen in the fourth season
Frasier Crane began as a recurring guest role and became a permanent character
Rebecca Howe replaced Diane Chambers, who left Boston for a writing career in 1987
Lilith Sternin started as a one-time character in the Season 4 episode, "Second Time Around" (1986), and became a recurring character in Season 5 (1986–87), and a regular character for Season 10 and the episodes that she appears in for Season 11 (1992–93).
Frasier W
Crane (Kelsey Grammer) and Lilith Sternin (formerly Sternin-Crane) (Bebe Neuwirth) — married psychiatrists and bar regulars, although Lilith rarely orders drinks
Frasier starts out as Diane Chambers's love interest
When she jilts him at the wedding altar in Europe, he ends up frequently going to Cheers pub for drinks and becomes everybody's bar friend
His first date with Lilith in "Second Time Around" (1986), Lilith's only episode of the fourth season, does not go well because they constantly argue
In the fifth season, Frasier and Lilith meet again when they are scheduled for a psychological talk show
With help from Diane, Frasier becomes aroused by Lilith's makeover, especially with her hair down, for the talk show
Frasier and Lilith flirt with each other on the talk show
Although they later feel guilty, Frasier and Lilith overcome their guilt with more help from Diane and begin their relationship.
They move in together, get married, and in the seventh season (1988–89) conceive a son Frederick, who is born in the following eighth season (1989–90)
 Their marriage is strained when Lilith has an affair with Dr
Louis Pascal (Peter Vogt)
In the Cheers spin-off Frasier, Frasier divorces her, gives custody of Frederick to Lilith, and moves from Boston to Seattle
Lilith appears in the spin-off recurringly.
Woodrow Tiberius Boyd (Woody Harrelson) — a co-bartender, commonly called "Woody"
When he arrived from his Midwest hometown to Boston, Woody wanted to meet his pen pal Coach
However, he finds out that Coach already died, and is hired to work at the bar
Later, he dates Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), marries her and is elected to the Boston City Council
At the end, he and Kelly have a son and daughter as revealed in Frasier.
Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) — a "voluptuously beautiful" manager and occasional waitress
Initially, she starts out a strong independent woman, but after several romantic failures with (mainly) rich men, she becomes "more neurotic, insecure, and sexually frustrated"
At the start, Sam attempts to seduce Rebecca without success, but, when her persona changes, he loses interest in her
In the series finale, she marries the plumber Don Santry (Tom Berenger)
In Frasier, according to Sam, she divorces Don and then ends up visiting the bar without working there again.
Each of the following characters of Cheers may or may not be particularly significant to the story of the series; each was introduced in one season and would appear in subsequent seasons — unless introduced in season 11, which was the last season
However, even when a character appeared earlier, information is arranged based on a character's first appearance rather than an actor's, especially when a same actor portrays different characters
Moreover, uncredited appearances are disregarded.
Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire) is a college English literature professor for whom Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) worked as a teaching assistant
Divorced, Sumner became engaged to Diane, whom he left to return to his ex-wife, Barbara, flying to Barbados on the flight Diane had booked for them both
Sumner tried secretly to win Diane back while she was seriously dating Sam Malone (Ted Danson), an attempt which ultimately failed
Diane ultimately states that it wasn't because Sam read War and Peace, but that he read it for her.
In "I Do, Adieu" (1987), where he last appears, Sumner returns after he heard the news about Sam and Diane's engagement
Sumner tells Diane that he sent one of her unfinished manuscripts to one of his colleagues, who had praised it
He warns her that writing both a novel and being a housewife to Sam simultaneously is impossible
Moreover, he warns her that choosing one would put an end to the other, either her marriage or her writing talents
Diane orders Sumner to leave the bar right away, but after talking with Sam, she decides to invest six months of her time into the endeavour of finishing the book, and they ultimately do not marry.
Harry "the Hat" Gittes (Harry Anderson) is a con artist who first appeared in "Sam at Eleven" (1982)
More often, Harry has been kicked out by Sam for his confidence tricks, while Harry tricks bar customers into giving him money
 Sam has standing orders to have Harry thrown out of the bar on sight, but Harry will help out the gang at Cheers upon occasion—partly out of sentiment, and partly to protect the Cheers gang from operators even more unscrupulous than himself
As Harry notes, "I don't like the idea of someone else plucking my pigeons." In "Pick a Con..
Any Con" (1983), Sam Malone (Ted Danson) bails Harry out of jail because Sam and Coach (Nicholas Colasanto) want him to spite a hustler, George Wheeler (Reid Shelton), who has been taking away $8,000 worth of bar assets from Coach at card games of gin rummy
Then Harry suggests poker, which he assumes that George may not be good at conning, and prices Sam's requests for $5,000
Later, Harry ends up "losing" to George at poker games.
However, as discovered, Harry's hand was four of a kind (four 3s), which would have beaten George's straight hand
As they later admit, Harry and George had been cheating players, including Sam, at poker to take away their money
Therefore, they play a serious but final game
When Coach scratches his nose, George indicates a gesture that his three Queens (three of a kind) would beat Harry's hand
This time, however, Harry's four 3s in his hand beats George's hand, so Harry takes all the money and then leaves the bar
Nevertheless, as it turns out, the whole events are part of Harry and Coach's plan to spite George, so Harry comes back after George leaves and then gives everyone back $8,000
Harry appeared four times in the series’ first and second seasons, after which he disappeared until season six's "A Kiss is Still a Kiss"
This was actually due to the fact that the actor-magician had achieved fame in his own right by starring in his own series Night Court, which followed Cheers on NBC's Thursday night "Must See TV" line up
Harry casually explained his long absence—when asked how long it had been since his last visit to Cheers, he replied it had been "two to ten, with time off for good behavior".
In "Bar Wars VII: The Naked Prey" (1993), Harry "refuses" to help out the Cheers gang spite Gary (Robert Desiderio; previously Joel Polis), who has been taunting the Cheers gang by pranking them and seemingly always winning their competitions
He tells the gang that they are naturally "losers" and that topping Gary is impossible
However, he ultimately cons Gary by pretending to be a contractor with a fake name
Gary has his own pub, Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, demolished under Harry's "contract" for millions, but then Gary realizes that he was conned and that the money does not exist
Harry hides while Gary angrily exits the bar to chase after him
At the end, Harry steals the money from Cheers's cash register as a form of payment for taking down Gary.
Dave Richards (Fred Dryer) is a sports commentator, friend of former baseball player Sam Malone (Ted Danson), and also divorced
In "Sam at Eleven" (1982), Dave wants to interview Sam only because, unbeknownst to Sam, none of high-profile celebrities at Dave's priorities were available
However, when one of the high-profile sports celebrities (John McEnroe) is finally available, Dave halts his interview with Sam, which puts an end to Sam's second chance of fame.
In "Old Flames" (1983), Dave realizes that Sam and Diane are together and bets that their relationship will end in 24 hours, so he and Sam can have debauchery with women
Then Dave sets Sam up with another woman to put his relationship with Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) at stake
However, Sam refuses to have a fling with that woman because he still thinks about Diane
After the time expires, Dave fails to break them up because Sam and Diane are still together
In "Love Thy Neighbor" (1985), Dave is heard on the radio, where he interviews Sam about Diane
In "'I' on Sports" (1987), Dave offers Sam a job as Dave's substitute for covering sports on television, which Sam accepts
(Nevertheless, Sam's news career is short-lived.)
Fred Dryer originally auditioned for the role of Sam Malone, who was initially a football player
Because he was a football player, Dryer was considered for that role
However, the role was eventually given to Ted Danson.
Paul (Paul Vaughn) was a bar customer who appears recurringly until "Manager Coach" (1983), an episode of the second season (1983–1984)
He spends most of his time antagonising Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger)
He is not to be confused with Paul Krapence (Paul Willson).

 The character of Alan is known to be single, and lives in a room with a Murphy bed
In his first appearance "Let Me Count the Ways" (1983), Alan informs waitress Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) that she has given him a wrong drink

In "The Heart Is the Lonely Snipe Hunter" (1985), he is one of the boys who purposely abandon Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) at the fabricated snipe hunting game
In "Those Lips, Those Ice" (1988), when Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) assumes that her then-husband Eddie (Jay Thomas) is cheating on her with another woman, Alan advises Carla to tell Eddie how she feels inside by expressing not only her heart but also her soul, so they both "give unto" each other
Norm Peterson (George Wendt) reacts by calling him a "clown".
Andy Schroeder (Derek McGrath) is an ex-convict
Andy first appears in "Diane's Perfect Date" (1983) as Diane Chambers's (Shelley Long) blind date, paid by Sam Malone (Ted Danson), who calls him "Andy-Andy" because he does not know and has not asked his surname, for $20
It is discovered he killed the waitress in an Italian restaurant, Via Milano, and was imprisoned
He rides a motorcycle
During the date, Diane and Sam are horrified by Andy's murderous comments.
Andy later reappears in "Homicidal Ham" (1983) and then holds people hostage to commit robbery with a gun
Fortunately, Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) catches him after he drops the gun
As learned, Andy has no job because of his past; nevertheless, Andy learned acting in high school
Diane convinces Sam not to send him to the police and, instead, gives him a chance to do performance in Shakespearean play Othello
Andy then falls in love with Diane, but he becomes jealous and then murderous when he see Sam and Diane kissing
At the play, performed in the bar, Andy chokes Diane to near death until Sam rescues her, and Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) grab hold of Andy.
Later, he is sometimes called "Andy-Andy" by characters and real-life sources alike
In "Diane's Nightmare" (1985), Andy marries Cynthia (Nancy Cartwright), but the whole thing turns out to be Diane's dream
In "Do Not Forsake Me, O' My Postman" (1992), Andy returns to the bar with bomb detonator around his body and wants to see Diane
Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) tells him that Diane no longer works as a waitress anymore, so Andy leaves.

In "Someone Single, Someone Blue" (1983), Boggs repeatedly asks Diane to be his wife to help her mother Helen keep her inheritance under the late Spencer Chambers's will

Tom Babson (Tom Babson), an aspiring lawyer who studies law and attempts to pass the bar exam
He is primarily involved in main stories that involve legality, like financial will and parental custody

Babson, Esq.")  In "Chambers vs
Malone" (1987), he has finally passed the bar (after numerous attempts), and is a defense attorney for Sam Malone's (Ted Danson) court case of "assaulting" Diane Chambers (Shelley Long)
Although Sam testifies that there was no assault, Tom requests that Sam propose to Diane in front of the court, which Sam reluctantly does
 His last episode is "Airport V" (1988).
Nick and Loretta Tortelli (Dan Hedaya and Jean Kasem) are a married couple currently living in Las Vegas
In previous season, Nick was referenced, mostly by his ex-wife Carla (Rhea Perlman); as discovered, he was a deadbeat father and disloyal husband when he cheated on Carla with another woman
He has made no attempt to support his children financially and barely has any contact with them
Nick is loud, unkempt, and extremely unsophisticated; despite these tremendous flaws, he has at times exercised an inexplicable romantic power over Carla
In their first episode "Battle of the Exes" (1983), after Nick and Loretta's wedding, Nick comes into the bar and then begs Carla to reunite with him, even though he is married to Loretta
However, Carla turns him down in "favor" of Sam Malone (Ted Danson) (although, unbeknownst to him, Sam and Carla pretend to be together at the wedding to make Nick jealous), and then Nick and Loretta leave.
In "An American Family" (1984), Loretta discovered that she will never be able to produce children
Therefore, Nick and Loretta attempt to retrieve custody of one of Carla's children - eldest son Anthony (Timothy Williams) - without avail
Before marrying Nick, Loretta had dreamed of becoming a singer; she once described herself as a "taller, blonder, less Mormon Marie Osmond"
Although she lacked talent, she performed with two groups: "The Grinning Americans" (described as an Up with People-type group), and The Lemon Sisters (deliberately named to be confused with The Lennon Sisters)
In "If Ever I Would Leave You" (1985), Loretta kicks Nick out for not supporting her decision to join a singing group, so he goes to Cheers to work as a janitor to prove himself as a better man to Carla
Three weeks later, Loretta comes to the bar and then begs him to be still her husband
At first he refuses, but he realizes his mistake, prompting him to dump Carla again.
In "Save the Last Dance for Me" (1986), Nick and Loretta enter the dance competition against Sam and Carla, but both are disqualified during the contest
Nick and Carla dance for one time, and subsequently win the competition

Carla tries to throw him out, but Sarafina convinces her to let Nick stay
At the wedding reception, Loretta sings.
Lewis (Sam Scarber), an African-American "large, athletic male" postal worker
In the episode "Cliff's Rocky Moment" (1984), Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) attempts to have Lewis brawl with Victor (Peter Iacangelo) without avail
In fact, both Lewis and Victor cannot stand Cliff because of his know-it-all behavior, and Lewis leaves, resolving not to help Cliff
In his second and final episode "I Call Your Name" (1984), Lewis is fired from his job for stealing fragrance samples from people's mail (unbeknownst to him, Cliff had reported him)
Lewis wants to find out the identity of the person who reported him to physically attack him, but ultimately he decides not to do so, having already found another job.

Gianelli previously appeared as unnamed customer in "No Help Wanted" (1984).
Al (Al Rosen) was an elderly male bar patron
Over the series until the actor's death in 1990, Al was sometimes involved in bar dialogue, especially cold openings
He has a distinct, gravelly voice and often unexpectedly interjected with a comedic one-liner relevant to what the characters are discussing, often leaving them speechless momentarily
In his first credited episode "Fortune and Men's Weight" (1984), when Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) asks men who the all-time "bigwig" is, Al declares "Sinatra" as an answer, bemusing patrons
In "Cheers: The Motion Picture" (1987), Al sends Woody Boyd's (Woody Harrelson) father a philosophical phrase that convinces him to let Woody stay in Boston rather than take him back to his hometown
In "Bar Wars" (1988), he attends Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, the bar that is Cheers' rival

In the Frasier episode "Cheerful Goodbyes" (2002), Cliff mistakenly refers to Phil as Al; Phil corrects him by saying that Al died "fourteen years" earlier, i.e
1988, contradicting Al Rosen's death in 1990 and last credited appearance.

Beth Curtis (Amanda Wyss) is an old-time girlfriend of Woody Boyd's (Woody Harrelson) from Indiana
In "Woody Goes Belly Up" (1985), Beth and Woody are reunited
During high school, both Woody and Beth were overweight, a problem which seemed to become resolved once they were separated; however, after their reunion, they end up overeating and people unsuccessfully attempt to help them overcome it
Fortunately, Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) tells Beth that she and Woody substitute overeating for premarital sex due to religious backgrounds
Although Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) take the couple to dinner to help them control their eating habits, Woody and Beth end up taking Frasier's psychological advice seriously and make plans to have sex.
In her second and last episode "The Book of Samuel" (1986), Beth ends up engaged to her fiancé Leonard Twilley (John Brace), much to Woody's disappointment

In "It's Lonely on the Top" (1993), Paul had sex with a drunk Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) offscreen, which she regrets, while he takes pride in it
However, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) orders him not to tell anyone about this for everyone's sake
 In the season 10 episode "The Norm Who Came to Dinner", Norm explains that Paul (years earlier) had been an athlete who had been brought into the bar to try to get him and Cliff into shape, implying that Paul instead conformed to become the frumpy, smoking bar patron we see throughout the show's run
It is later revealed that Paul works as a toll booth operator

As discovered, she also works as a waitress at Norm Peterson's (George Wendt) favorite restaurant, The Hungry Heifer
Her last episode is "Cheers: The Motion Picture" (1987)
Corinne told Norm that all the waitresses at The Hungry Heifer had a nickname for him: "The Guy Who Comes Back"
While covering for Diane, Corinne manages to catch the eye of barfly Al (Al Rosen)
Portrayer Doris Grau was also a script supervisor of Cheers.
Esther "Ma" Clavin (Frances Sternhagen) is the mother of Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger).
Before her physical appearances, a lot is learnt about her, mainly through her son
 As learned in "Sam Turns the Other Cheek" (1984), her husband Cliff Sr (Dick O'Neill) left her and their son behind
 In the episode "Just Three Friends", when Cliff and Norm Peterson (George Wendt) make a prank call to her
 It is first mentioned in the third season that Cliff lives with her, for which the other barflies mocked him
 In the episode "Coach in Love Part 2", Cliff's mother is heard in a voice-over
 When she asked if she could stop by and meet the gang, Cliff whispered under his breath "When Hell freezes over".
Regardless, Esther ultimately appears in "Money Dearest" (1986), and becomes engaged to a wealthy man Duncan Fitzgerald (Richard Erdman) upon Cliff's urging
 Cliff tries to persuade Esther to break off the engagement when Esther makes Duncan donate half his fortune to charity, but Duncan dies hours later, leaving her heartbroken
 In season six, it was revealed that Cliff, contrary to his usual know-it-all personality at the bar, is actually quiet at home and his mother is actually "the real yapper in the family"
 Esther's appearances at the bar gives an insight into Cliff's know-it-all personality, as Esther spouts even more useless facts than Cliff; Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) remarks that, after meeting Esther, he sees Cliff as "almost heroically" well-adjusted.
One of Esther's pastimes is making pretzels in unintentionally unusual shapes, which Cliff brings them into the bar in "Second Time Around" (1986)
 Patrons find them awful tasting, but are unable to tell him without hurting Esther's feelings
 Therefore, Cliff brings them again in other episodes
 In "The Last Angry Mailman" (1987), Esther sells their house, only to have it bulldozed and then replaced by a convenience store
 Since then, they live in an apartment together, which first appears in "My Fair Clavin" (1987)
 In "Look Before You Sleep" (1993), witnessed by Sam Malone (Ted Danson), Cliff and Esther argue over their lives together, including how dateless Cliff is, but then apologize, which stuns Sam.
In her "Rebecca Gaines, Rebecca Loses" (1993), Cliff sends Esther to a senior center but then regrets it - until he discovers she is actually enjoying living there
However, when Cliff receives the first bill for her care, he quickly takes her back to the apartment.
Vera Peterson (née Kreitzer) (Bernadette Birkett) is the wife of Norm Peterson (George Wendt)
Most of Vera's appearances were uncredited voiceovers, although her body is seen in the fifth season episode "Thanksgiving Orphans"; her face is covered by filling from a pie Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) threw at Norm
In the ninth season episode "It's A Wonderful Wife" her legs can be seen through the bar's front window as she sits crying on the steps after being fired from her job at Melville's as a hat-check girl
Birkett's only credited appearance is in Season 11's "Look Before You Sleep".
Vera's background is briefly mentioned throughout the series: she and Norm were high school sweethearts, Vera was a cheerleader, and they married soon after graduating
In "Truce or Consequences" (1982), the two celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary (which they celebrate by going for pizza, so Norm can "get back here [the bar] by ten"), which means they married at some point in 1972.
Vera's family, who also remain unseen, frequently descend upon the Peterson household
Vera's (much) younger sister, Donna, is the most frequent visitor, and usually stays for extended periods of time
Norm claims to dread these visits because, while he considers her more attractive than Vera, she relentlessly hits on him; he claims to have once walked in on Donna while she was naked and she tried to cover herself up with an emery board
In "One Hugs, The Other Doesn't" (1992), Norm mentions that Vera has nieces and nephews, which means Vera must have at least one brother or another sister
While generally tolerating Donna and Vera's other relatives, Norm shows a dislike to her parents: when Vera's mother stays with them, Norm was assigned to take her to visit Bunker Hill, but he instead locked her in the car and went to the bar like normal
A conversation at the bar revealed that Norm doesn't know if Vera's father is alive or not; when he calls her and asks, she refuses to speak to him for several days (and the issue is never clarified).
Despite being the frequent butt of Norm's jokes, he professes a deep love for Vera
When they separate following Norm's inability to hold down a job, Norm slumps without her
When he learns that Vera is being wooed by former high school wrestling rival Wally Bodell (Walter Olkewicz) in "They Called Me Mayday" (1983), Norm challenged Wally to a wrestling match in order to win her back; when Vera learns of this, it leads to her reconciling with Norm
In "Love Thy Neighbour" (1985), Phyllis Henshaw (Miriam Flynn) visits the bar, voicing her suspicions that her husband Ron is having an affair with Vera
Norm is subsequently distraught at the thought of Vera cheating on him and the prospect of him leaving her; despite that, he refuses to have an affair with Phyllis out of spite, still feeling a certain loyalty to Vera
In "Feeble Attraction" (1990), Norm's secretary Doris (Cynthia Stevenson) reveals that she has developed feelings for Norm, which flusters him, although he is soon rid of the problem when he has to close the business down
In "Norm's Big Audit" (1993), when IRS agent Dot Carroll (Sharon Barr) offers to overlook Norm's tax evasion in exchange for sexual favours, Norm refuses to betray Vera (a decision that may have been influenced by his fear and disgust for Dot).
In "The Two Faces of Norm" (1989), Norm scares his employee Rudi (Eric Allen Kramer) by using an alternate personality, harsh-hearted Anton Kreitzer, to scare them into shape
When asked by Frasier where he came up with the name Kreitzer, Norm reveals that it was Vera's maiden name.
Hugh (Hugh Maguire) is a tall, balding (with a fringe of dark hair) bar patron wearing usually a beige or brown sport jacket and tie
His first episode is "Chambers vs
Malone" (1987), and his last is "Jumping Jerks" (1988)
In the cold opening of "Chambers vs
Malone", Hugh sits with Pete and Mark at one table, forgetting who is the "designated driver" while intoxicated
Sam calls a taxicab company to take them home.
Pete (Peter Schreiner) is a friendly blonde man seen usually in casual clothing
His first episode is "Chambers vs
Malone" (1987), and his last is "One for the Road" (1993)
In the cold opening of "Chambers vs
Malone", Pete sits with Hugh and Mark at one table, forgetting who is the "designated driver" while intoxicated
Sam calls a taxicab company to take them home
He loans Sam surveillance equipment in "Indoor Fun with Sammy and Robby" (1990), telling Frasier that he uses it to spy on his wife, who "sleeps around a lot."
Mark (Mark Arnott) is a man with a black hair wearing usually a suit
His first episode is "Chambers vs
Malone" (1987), and his last is "Indoor Fun with Sam and Robby" (1990)
In the cold opening of "Chambers vs
Malone", Mark sits with Hugh and Pete at one table
Seeing them forget who is the "designated driver" while intoxicated, Hugh agrees with Sam calling them a taxicab ride home.
In two-part episode "Never Love a Goalie" (1987), Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) meets the Boston Bruins ice hockey player, Guy "Eddie" LeBec (Jay Thomas), who has a long winning streak and a French Canadian background, and then begins to date him
However, because of their relationship, Eddie's streak unfortunately comes to an end
Since both are superstitious, they end their relationship in order to avoid ruining Eddie's ability to play
They nevertheless reconcile shortly thereafter and promise to break up repeatedly before every game to avoid the "curse"
In "Home Is the Sailor", Carla is revealed to be several months pregnant with Eddie's twins (incorporated by another of Perlman's pregnancies)
In the two-part episode "Little Carla, Happy at Last", Carla and Eddie wed
She almost quits her waitressing job because Eddie said that he would take care of her financially
However, the Bruins released him from his contract due to his age and declining athletic performance, and he could not find another team
In "Airport V" (1988), Eddie ends up as a penguin mascot for a traveling ice show in another state
Later in the 1987–88 season, Carla gives birth to their twin boys, named Elvis and Jesse, after Carla's idol Elvis Presley and his stillborn twin brother.
In "Death Takes a Holiday on Ice" (1989), Eddie is killed by an ice resurfacer when he saves the life of another member of the ice show
At the funeral, it was revealed that he had bigamously married another woman, Gloria (Anne De Salvo), and had twins with her as well
Carla changes her surname back to Tortelli to avoid being confused with the other "Mrs
LeBec".
The demise of Jay Thomas's character Eddie LeBec has been claimed to stem from Thomas's comments "about" Perlman in a radio show
However, Thomas denied this and declared that he was referring only to the Carla character
Despite Ken Levine's praise of Thomas's acting and the pairing of Eddie and Carla, Eddie was reportedly written out of the show because Perlman thought that the pairing would make her "not part of the people in the bar."
Joanne (Catherine MacNeal) is a local newscaster, appearing only when someone, usually Norm Peterson (George Wendt), is watching the bar's television
In "'I' on Sports" (1987), her short-time co-newsanchor Sam Malone (Ted Danson) flirts with her, but she resists and turns him down
In "Christmas Cheers" (1987), she reports a raging lunatic (presumably Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger)) throwing canned foods at an airplane
In her last episode "Where Nobody Knows Your Name" (1990), she reports that imprisoned millionaire Robin Colcord (Roger Rees) cheated on Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) with another woman.
Father Barry (Eric Christmas) is a priest, who usually gives advice about sexuality and spirituality
His first episode is "Swear to God" (1988), and his last is "Achilles Hill" (1991)
In "Death Takes a Holiday on Ice" (1990), he officiates at Eddie LeBec's (Jay Thomas) funeral, where Eddie's bigamy is revealed when Eddie's second wife appears, shocking the invited guests, including Eddie's widow Carla and Father Barry.
Mr
Sheridan (Michael Currie) is corporate vice president for the Lilian Corporation, of which Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) is a minor executive
In "Adventures in Housesitting" (1989), he assigns her to babysit his doberman Sir Broundwin the Gallant, also called Buster, while he leaves for a business trip
During Rebecca's care, Buster runs away from Mr
Sheridan's manor, so Woody brings in another doberman Satan, a wrecking yard's dog resembling Buster, to conceal this negligence
Then Mr
Sheridan returns from the trip and pets Satan, fully unaware of the situation
Then Sam brings Buster, retrieved by a neighbor, through the backdoor to switch the dogs in the kitchen
To prevent Mr
Sheridan from entering the kitchen where the ruckus occurs, Rebecca distracts Mr
Sheridan by discussing a trophy-looking urn, which he reveals contains his late wife's ashes
Later at the Cheers bar, the bar regulars are unsure whether the dogs were successfully switched; Cliff says "Geronimo" as one of the Indian names that provokes the dog to attack him, confirming the dog to be Satan.
In "For Real Men Only" (1989), Mr
Sheridan assigns Rebecca to manage a retirement party at the bar for an employee, Larry, also his brother-in-law
The party turns out depressing mainly because Larry is very dull to entertain
After failed efforts to enliven up the party, Rebecca jadedly allows newborn Frederick Crane's bris to take place at the same time
Consequently, the retirement party livens up, and Larry plans to marry a woman, pleasing Mr
Sheridan, who wants Larry out of the house.
Margaret Catherine "Maggie" O'Keefe (Annie Golden) is a recurring love interest for Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) from the seventh season onward
Maggie first appears in "Please Mr
Postman" (season 7, episode 12) as a rookie postal carrier who is to be trained by Cliff
Maggie asks Cliff out, and he accepts
However, Maggie is later caught taking a postal vehicle to a motel and is fired
She then leaves Cliff to go to Canada to join the Canadian post office
She makes regular appearances thereafter, leading to her and Cliff's on-again, off-again relationship.
Maggie reappears in season eleven episode "Do Not Forsake Me, O' My Postman" (her final appearance), informing Cliff that she is pregnant with Cliff's child
This forced Cliff to admit that he and Maggie never had sex, causing the other barflies to mock him
Cliff agrees to marry Maggie
Before they depart, she decides to call her child's real father, so Cliff would not worry anymore
She then tells Norm that the father is upset someone else will be raising his child and that he wants to marry her and Cliff is off the hook
However, as she leaves she tells Cliff they did have sex, twice, though Cliff was apparently inebriated and did not remember.
Kelly Susan Boyd (née Gaines) (Jackie Swanson) is a love interest (and later wife) for Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) from the seventh season
She appeared in twenty-four episodes
Like Woody, she is naive about the world and not overly intelligent
On the other hand Kelly is, again like Woody, very sweet and polite and, despite her vast wealth, never knowingly condescends to or patronizes others.
Kelly and Woody first meet in the thirteenth episode of the seventh season
Woody and Sam Malone (Ted Danson) are bartending at a private party to celebrate Kelly's return from Europe
Kelly is a rich and sheltered girl, but Woody is able to open her eyes to new experiences, the first being a monster truck pull
Again in Kelly's third appearance in the nineteenth episode of the seventh season, Woody teaches her a lesson from his world
Instead of buying her an expensive gift for her birthday, he writes her a memorable song.
Kelly and Woody marry in the tenth season's finale episode
The marriage, at the Gaines' mansion, is a fiasco: The minister dies; Kelly's flirtatious cousin Monika (Colleen Morris) teases Sam until her fanatically-jealous husband brandishes a sword; Rebecca Howe's (Kirstie Alley) petulance causes the French chef to quit, leaving her in charge of the food; Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) keeps getting pushed down the shaft in the dumbwaiter; Woody cannot keep his hands (and other things) off Kelly before the ceremony; and two attack dogs (cf
"The Lads" on Magnum, P.I.) menace everyone who dared exit the kitchen to the patio, until an infuriated Carla chases them inside, at which time they whimper like puppies and scamper away
To top it off, the dead body of the minister tips over and topples the wedding cake to the floor
Despite this, the wedding goes ahead.
Kelly and Woody were expecting their first child when Cheers ended.
In the sixteenth episode of the second season of Frasier, Sam visits and it is revealed that Kelly and Woody's first child was a baby boy
In the thirteenth episode of the sixth season, Woody visits Seattle and reveals that he and Kelly have had another child, a girl.
Walter Gaines (Richard Doyle) is Kelly's (Jackie Swanson) father and one of Rebecca Howe's (Kirstie Alley) corporate executives
Since his first episode "Golden Boyd" (1989), Walter usually disapproves of Kelly and Woody being together
Eventually, he accepts the relationship when they become married in "An Old Fashioned Wedding" (1992)
In "Ill-Gotten Gaines" (1992), he has a brief affair with his married sister-in-law Katherine (Sondra Currie)
Due to a misunderstanding, he mistakenly believes Woody had found out and is attempting to blackmail him
He later learns that Woody knew nothing of the affair and that Woody would never stoop to blackmail, however Mr
Gaines' butler Hives overhears the entire conversation and proceeds to blackmail him.
In "Rebecca Gaines, Rebecca Loses" (1993), Walter asks Rebecca for a date at the bar, even after she gets drunk and then humiliates him at the party in the house
However, Rebecca turns him down because she realizes she would only be dating him for his money
Walter is divorced from Roxanne (Melendy Britt), who appears in "Woody Or Won't He" (1990)
Walter's mother (Celeste Holm) accepts Woody as a husband for Kelly in the episode "No Rest for Woody" (1992).
Ludlow Tortelli (Jarrett Lennon) is Carla Tortelli's (Rhea Perlman) youngest son
Nicknamed "Lud" by Carla, he is named for his absentee father – the esteemed psychiatrist (and mentor of Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer)), Dr
Bennett Ludlow (James Karen) – and is conceived in "Whodunit?" (season 3, episode 13)
He first appears in the Season 7 episode "I Kid You Not", when his coach drops him off at Cheers after his T-ball game
After Carla asks him how the game went, it becomes clear Lud is much better suited for intellectual activities than sports ("They finally put me in after the kid with the cast on his leg and the two fat girls left")
Frasier and his wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) take a shine to the bright and inquisitive youngster and offer to take him to an opera, to which Lud happily agrees
Excited at the opportunity to mentor Ludlow, the Cranes continue to invite him out to one high-minded activity after another, which eventually alienates Carla
Feeling bad for taking away her time with son, the Cranes invite her and Ludlow to dinner at a fancy restaurant
However, Ludlow dislikes the food and crawls under the table in protest
Frasier attempts to lure him out with psychology, but Ludlow responds by giving Frasier the "hot foot" treatment, effectively ending their mentorship
Carla lures Lud out from the table with the promise of taking him out for hamburgers but then orders him to apologize to Frasier for the incident, which Ludlow does.
He is also mentioned (in name only) in season 6, episode 13 "Woody for Hire Meets Norman of the Apes" as Carla is describing the horrible things her kids did that day; apparently, Ludlow unplugged the freezer to see if frozen peas defrosted quicker than ice-cream.
Ludlow appears briefly in two more episodes: "Unplanned Parenthood" (1991) and "Rich Man, Wood Man" (1992), the latter in which he sells chocolate candy.
Robin Colcord (Roger Rees), was an English multi-millionaire industrialist, who spent most of his time on Cheers as a love interest for the gold-digging Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley)
This led to his developing something of a rivalry with Sam Malone (Ted Danson), because of Sam's own romantic interest in Rebecca
In November 1989 Rees told a news agency Knight-Ridder Wire about the creation of the character: They needed a fillip, to give them a boost, someone to drive Sam [Malone] crazy
Robin's there to be dashing, sexy, irritating
He's not as charming and nice as he appears to be at first sight
He's sort of the villain of the piece
He's a megalomaniac millionaire
He's got an airline and a helicopter fleet
It's very much Donald Trump.In January 1990, actor Rees said that he had not based "the character on anyone", despite "speculation that Colcord was a British version of Trump," wrote Phil Kloer of Cox News Service.
In season 8, Rebecca and Sam discovers that Robin was plotting a hostile takeover of the company for which Rebecca worked, the Lilian Corporation, and had been secretly and illegally using Rebecca's access to the company's confidential information
Rebecca chooses to conceal Robin's activities for the sake of their relationship
However, Sam discovers that the company suspected Rebecca of being a willing corporate spy
To protect her, Sam reveals Robin's crimes.
Amidst the ensuing scandal, Robin is arrested and briefly sent to prison as well as losing his business positions and money
In season 9, he and Rebecca plan to marry on his release, despite his new humble status
She chooses not to go through with this
He then reveals that he still had some of his fortune in a secret stash, but that he would go away if she still had not changed her mind
Believing this to be a bluff, she refuses yet again, and watches as he walks out of her life carrying a moneybelt which he had concealed in her desk
In his last appearance at "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Bar", an episode of season 11, Robin claims to be a broke but humble vagabond and petty fugitive, asking to reunite with Rebecca
The episode ends with him and Rebecca attempting to hitchhike out of town, while Rebecca believes that this is a second test.
Frederick Gaylord Crane (Christopher and Kevin Graves; Luke Tarsitano and Trevor Einhorn on Frasier) is the son of Frasier and Lilith Sternin
"Freddy" made his first appearance as a baby on Cheers, while his parents were still married; he appears in several episodes throughout the show's run
Frederick was born during the eighth season episode "The Stork Brings a Crane"
He was delivered in a taxicab while Lilith was on her way home from the hospital after an episode of false labour
Lilith tolerated the pain by biting down on one of the cab driver's fuzzy dice.
Captain Dobbins (Robert Machray) is a fire marshal who is often the victim of pranks at Cheers
He appeared in several "Bar Wars" episodes, in which the Cheers gang thought he was an agent of Gary's Olde Town Tavern, only to be proved wrong
He also appeared in the final season, when the Cheers gang suspected Robin Colcord of hiding money belts at Cheers
They suspected Captain Dobbins of stealing the money belts, only to be proved wrong yet again
He appeared in four episodes.
Kevin McHale (himself) is a Boston Celtics player
In "Cheers Fouls Out" (1990), he plays for Cheers's basketball team against rival bar Gary's Olde Towne Tavern
McHale is told by Sam Malone (Ted Danson) that the game is a charity match; when he finds out that it is a lie, he tells Sam that he will play if they donate the winnings to charity
During one of the games, he is injured but quickly recovers.
In "Where Have All the Floorboards Gone?" (1991), McHale is brought by Sam as a birthday present to Norm Peterson (George Wendt)
Bar patrons, mostly Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger), feed McHale bar trivia including asking a question about the number of bolts in the floorboards in Boston Garden
McHale becomes obsessed with this question, and it severely affects his basketball performance
The gang try to undo the damage but to no avail; they break into a basketball stadium overnight and end up ruining the floor.
John Allen Hill (Keene Curtis) is a restaurateur who becomes the owner of Melville's, the seafood restaurant above Cheers, in season 9
He informs Sam that the deed for Melville's includes Cheers' bathrooms and pool room, and after some resistance Sam eventually capitulates and begins paying monthly rent to him, until Sam and Rebecca team up to purchase the rooms
Sam despises him due to his condescending and disdainful manner
In season nine, Sam dated Hill's daughter Valerie as a way to get back at Hill for his attitude towards the Cheers bar
Hill and Carla have a combative relationship that frequently turns sexual.
Henrí (Anthony Cistaro) is a French photographer who becomes friends with Kelly Gaines during her time abroad in Paris
Woody finds his frequent "jokes" about stealing Kelly away from him tiresome, and he does on one occasion attempt to trick Kelly into a supposed green card marriage
He is a lothario who is familiar with Sam's playboy reputation among stewardesses
Henrí and Sam are good friends until the final season, when Henrí challenges Sam to a contest; whoever gets the most phone numbers of women by midnight would be "acknowledged as the world's greatest ladies' man"
Henrí ends up winning by just one point, only to have Sam walk out with three more women.
Gino Tortelli (Josh Lozoff) is Carla's son
To keep the family peace between Carla and her mother, he agrees to keep the family tradition alive and change his name to Benito Mussolini, but Carla initially refuses
In the first season, Carla tells a drunk Diane Chambers that Gino was the result of a one-night stand between Carla and Sam Malone
Diane is horrified at the thought, but this later turns out to be a malicious lie told by Carla to annoy Diane
In Season 10, he wants to become a priest, but changes his mind and decides to become a male model.
Serafina Tortelli (Leah Remini) is the eldest daughter of Nick (Dan Hedaya) and Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman)
She first appears, albeit briefly, in the episode "Unplanned Parenthood." Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) decide they should babysit Carla's kids in order to hone their parental skills
Arriving at Carla's house, Rebecca blows a whistle to line up all their kids (a la the Von Trapp family in The Sound of Music)
Sarafina promptly informs them she is spending the night with her boyfriend and knocks the whistle into Rebecca's mouth, causing her to choke on it
She ends up staying against her will through dinner but warns Sam and Rebecca they better let her go as her boyfriend is a retired cop.
Her second, and more prominent, appearance was in "Loathe and Marriage", where she weds her retired cop boyfriend, Pat McDougall (Dennis Cockrum) after becoming pregnant
The ceremony is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of her deadbeat father Nick and his wife Loretta (Jean Kasem)
Carla insists Nick leave but Sarafina objects, telling Carla she knows he's a terrible father but she still wants him there - she had always pictured her dad giving her away on her wedding day
Sarafina asks Carla how it made her feel that her own father missed her wedding
Carla admits it made her feel "pretty rotten" and, seeing Sarafina's point, relents and lets Nick stay.
She is previously mentioned in "Woody for Hire Meets Norman of the Apes", as Carla is describing the horrible things her kids did that day
Apparently, Sarafina took a pair of hedge clippers to the shag carpet.
