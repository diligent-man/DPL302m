El Escorpión Park is a three-acre (12,000 m²) park located in the Simi Hills of the western San Fernando Valley, in the West Hills district of Los Angeles, California
The park contains the geographic landmark known as Escorpión Peak or Castle Peak (kas'ele'ew picacho), a 1,475-foot-tall (450 m) rocky peak seen from most parts of the park and the surrounding community.
The El Escorpión Park entrance and parking is at the western end of Vanowen Street, west of Valley Circle Boulevard, in West Hills.
The park is open from sunrise to sunset, 7 days a week
 The trails are available for walking, hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking and equestrian use
Dogs are allowed on a leash
Rattlesnakes live in the area, requiring observant footfalls and handholds
Unauthorized motor vehicles and motorbikes are not permitted.
El Escorpión Park is managed by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks.
Climbing the rough south side trail to the summit of Castle Peak is not for beginners and is considered challenging
This hike is not recommended for children
The final climb to the top of the peak requires climbing over boulders and other rocks, and missteps or slips can result in a fall
Intermediate and advanced hikers will enjoy the vertical challenge, around 561 feet (171 m) of gain in a very short distance
The beginning of the trail in Moores Canyon is easily seen at the base of the peak
Around 3/4 of the way up the trail becomes more difficult to see, the easiest route veers to the left (west).
At the summit, along the western ridge line, there is a trail west to a small meadow
At the meadow's southern cliff edge: overlooking Moores Canyon, lower El Escorpión Park, and the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve; a panoramic view of the Santa Monica Mountains, Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, and the San Fernando Valley
A trail leads northward toward Bell Creek, the community of Bell Canyon, and Bell Canyon Park.

The expansive 3,000-acre (12 km²) Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve adjoins along the southwest of El Escorpión Park with miles of trails and even further links west to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Cheseboro/Palo Comado Canyon Park's trails.Castle Peak is the corrupted American form of the Ventureño Chumash name for the peak, which was Kas'ele'ew (also, Kas'elew) in the Chumash language,
The area was inhabited for around 8,000 years by Native Americans of the Tongva-Fernandeño and Chumash-Ventureño tribes that lived in the Simi Hills and close to tributaries of the Los Angeles River
A village, Hu'wam (Ventureño Chumash placename), was located at the base of Castle Peak along present Bell Creek near the mouth of Bell Canyon
 It was a meeting and trading point for them with the Tongva-Fernandeño and Tataviam-Fernandeño people.
