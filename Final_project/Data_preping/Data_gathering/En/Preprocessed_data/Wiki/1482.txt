count georges vacher de lapouge french va e d lapu december february was a french anthropologist and a theoretician of eugenics and racialism
he is known as the founder of anthroposociology the anthropological and sociological study of race as a means of establishing the superiority of certain peoples
while a young law student at the university of poitiers vacher de lapouge read herbert spencer and charles darwin
in he gained a doctorate degree in law and became a magistrate in niort deux s vres and a prosecutor in le blanc
he then studied history and philology at the cole pratique des hautes tudes and learned several languages such as akkadian egyptian hebrew chinese and japanese at the cole du louvre and at school of anthropology in paris from to
from vacher de lapouge taught anthropology at the university of montpellier advocating francis galton s eugenic thesis but was expelled in because of his socialist activities
he co founded jules guesde s french workers party and campaigned during for city mayor in the montpellier municipal election
he worked later as a librarian at the university of rennes until his retirement in
he wrote l aryen son r le social the aryan his social role in which he opposed the aryan dolichocephalic races to the brachycephalic races
vacher de lapouge thus classified human races first the homo europaeus nordic or fair haired then the homo alpinus represented by the auvergnat and turkic peoples finally the homo mediterraneus represented by the neapoletan or andaluz peoples
vacher de lapouge endorsed francis galton s theory of eugenics but applied it to his theory of races
vacher de lapouge s ideas are comparable to those of henri de boulainvilliers who believed that the germanic franks formed the upper class of french society whereas the gauls were the ancestors of the peasantry
race according to him thus became almost synonymous with social class
vacher de lapouge added to this concept of races and classes what he termed selectionism his version of galton s eugenics
vacher de lapouge s anthropology was intended to prevent social conflict by defining a fixed hierarchical social order
in he prefaced and translated madison grant s publication the passing of the great race le d clin de la grande race payot
he also translated one work of ernst haeckel into french
lapouge had a direct influence on nazi racial and eugenic doctrine
in his political science works he described the jew as the only competitor of the aryan who dominated lesser races without them knowing
in this he is deemed co responsible for the holocaust from
lapouge in had predicted that the th century would witness genocides that slaughtered millions over their alleged racial differences which is seen as prescient of the holocaust though he was not saying this should occur
the anti morality moral nihilism lapouge espoused along with proposing a totalitarian selectionist state that would strictly enforce racist eugenics is also viewed as a precedent of nazism later
anthropologist hans f
gunther the race theorist whom the nazis looked to most was lapouge s disciple praising his work and eulogizing him when lapouge died
lapouge in turn championed gunther s cause to become a chair of anthropolosociology at the university of jena
indeed most of lapouge s followers were germans which caused ironic tension given their old german french rivalry
some also felt discomfort at his fervent atheism and materialism while this did not stop them adopting his eugenicist and racial ideas
they also disliked his idea that sperm from the most fit men should be used to impregnate many women artificially
lapouge s work spurred a strong reaction on the political left in france since it was seen as undermining the democratic enlightenment values which they cherished with science generally deemed their friend he had repudiated the revolutionary slogan liberty equality fraternity saying this should be replaced with determinism inequality selection
lapouge had initially been on the political left but gravitated to the right over time and held great contempt for other atheists who did not share his convictions claiming they clung to a theistic based morality which no longer held
his work left secular leftists with a quandary since they cited science some of the same as lapouge to advance their own views though his were opposed to theirs
anthropologists who shared their views attacked lapouge s theories along with the racist and sexist ideas common in anthropology then generally
however this was not enough for many opponents of lapouge
they feared that if science were upheld as determining social values the threat his theories posed or similar ones would always exist
french leftists thus increasingly rejected taking science as a source of any political truths
it was argued enlightenment democratic egalitarian ideals should be upheld no matter what science said
equal rights should belong to citizens even assuming any biological disparities that existed between them they insisted
increasingly leftists were driven to debunking racist and sexist claims from anthropology in reaction to claims by lapouge among others given the threat views like his posed to their values
lapouge complained bitterly of this and particularly hated one critic who was jewish saying his theories had been rejected because of french jews influence
