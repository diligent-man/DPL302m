ancient greek in classical antiquity before the development of the common koine greek of the hellenistic period was divided into several varieties
most of these varieties are known only from inscriptions but a few of them principally aeolic doric and ionic are also represented in the literary canon alongside the dominant attic form of literary greek
likewise modern greek is divided into several dialects most derived from koine greek
the earliest known greek dialect is mycenaean greek the south eastern greek variety attested from the linear b tablets produced by the mycenaean civilization of the late bronze age in the late nd millennium bc
the classical distribution of dialects was brought about by the migrations of the early iron age after the collapse of the mycenaean civilization
some speakers of mycenaean were displaced to cyprus while others remained inland in arcadia giving rise to the arcadocypriot dialect
this is the only dialect with a known bronze age precedent
the other dialects must have preceded their attested forms but the relationship of the precedents to mycenaean remains to be discovered
aeolic was spoken in three subdialects one lesbian on the island of lesbos and the west coast of asia minor north of smyrna
the other two boeotian and thessalian were spoken in the northeast of the greek mainland in boeotia and thessalia
the dorian invasion spread doric greek from a probable location in northwestern greece to the coast of the peloponnesus for example to sparta to crete and to the southernmost parts of the west coast of asia minor
northwest greek is sometimes classified as a separate dialect and is sometimes subsumed under doric
macedonian is regarded by most scholars as another greek dialect possibly related to doric or nw greek
ionic was mostly spoken along the west coast of asia minor including smyrna and the area to the south of it but also in euboea
homer s iliad and odyssey were written in homeric greek or epic greek an early east greek blending ionic and aeolic features
attic greek a sub or sister dialect of ionic was for centuries the language of athens
because attic was adopted in macedon before the conquests of alexander the great and the subsequent rise of hellenism it became the standard dialect that evolved into the koin ancient greek literature is written in literary dialects that developed from particular regional or archaic dialects
ancient greek authors did not necessarily write in their native dialect but rather chose a dialect that was suitable or traditional for the type of literature they were writing see belles lettres
all dialects have poetry written in them but only attic and ionic have full works of prose attested
homeric greek is used in the first epic poems the iliad and the odyssey and the homeric hymns traditionally attributed to homer and written in dactylic hexameter
homeric is a literary dialect with elements of ionic aeolic and arcadocypriot
hesiod uses a similar dialect and later writers imitate homer in their epics such as apollonius rhodius in argonautica and nonnus in dionysiaca
homer influenced other types of poetry as well
ionic proper is first used in archilochus of paros
this dialect includes also the earliest greek prose that of heraclitus and ionic philosophers hecataeus and logographers herodotus democritus and hippocrates
elegiac poetry originated in ionia and always continued to be written in ionic
doric is the conventional dialect of choral lyric poetry which includes the laconian alcman the theban pindar and the choral songs of attic tragedy stasima
several lyric and epigrammatic poets wrote in this dialect such as ibycus of rhegium and leonidas of tarentum
the following authors wrote in doric preserved in fragments epicharmus comic poet and writers of south italian comedy phlyax play mithaecus food writer and archimedes
aeolic is an exclusively poetic lyric dialect represented by sappho and alcaeus for lesbian aeolic and corinna of tanagra for boeotian
thessalic aeolic northwest doric arcado cypriot and pamphylian never became literary dialects and are only known from inscriptions and to some extent by the comical parodies of aristophanes and lexicographers
attic proper was used by the attic orators lysias isocrates aeschines and demosthenes the philosophers plato and aristotle and the historian xenophon
thucydides wrote in old attic
the tragic playwrights aeschylus sophocles and euripides wrote in an artificial poetic language and the comic playwright aristophanes wrote in a language with vernacular elements
the ancients classified the language into three gene or four dialects ionic proper ionic attic aeolic doric and later a fifth one koine
grammarians focus mainly on the literary dialects and isolated words
historians may classify dialects on mythological historical reasons rather than linguistic knowledge
according to strabo ionic is the same as attic and aeolic the same as doric outside the isthmus all greeks were aeolians except the athenians the megarians and the dorians who live about parnassus in the peloponnese achaeans were also aeolians but only eleans and arcadians continued to speak aeolic
however for most ancients aeolic was synonymous with literary lesbic
stephanus of byzantium characterized boeotian as aeolic and aetolian as doric
remarkable is the ignorance of sources except lexicographers on arcadian cypriot and pamphylian
finally unlike modern greek and english ancient greek common terms for human speech gl ssa dialektos ph n and the suffix isti may be attributed interchangeably to both a dialect and a language
however the plural dialektoi is used when dialects and peculiar words are compared and listed by the grammarians under the terms lexeis or gl ssai
the dialects of classical antiquity are grouped slightly differently by various authorities
pamphylian is a marginal dialect of asia minor and is sometimes left uncategorized
mycenaean was deciphered only in and so is missing from the earlier schemes presented here
a historical overview of how the dialects were classified in different points in time can be found in van rooy
the ancient greek dialects differed mainly in vowels
loss of intervocalic s and consonantal i and w from proto greek brought two vowels together in hiatus a circumstance often called a collision of vowels
over time greek speakers would change pronunciation to avoid such a collision and the way that vowels changed determined the dialect
for example the word for the god of the sea regardless of the culture and language from which it came was in some prehistoric form poseid w n genitive poseid wonos
loss of the intervocalic w left poseid n which is seen in both mycenaean and homeric dialects
ionic greek changed the a to an e poseide n while attic greek contracted it to poseid n
it changed differently in other dialects
corinthian poted woni poted ni and poted n
boeotian poteid oni
cretan rhodian and delphian poteid n
lesbian poseid n
arcadian posoid nos
laconian pohoid nthe changes appear designed to place one vowel phoneme instead of two a process called contraction if a third phoneme is created and hyphaeresis taking away if one phoneme is dropped and the other kept
sometimes the two phonemes are kept sometimes modified as in the ionic poseide n
a vowel shift differentiating the ionic and attic dialects from the rest was the shift of to
in ionic the change occurred in all positions but in attic it occurred almost everywhere except after e i and r
homeric greek shows the ionic rather than the attic version of the vowel shift for the most part
doric and aeolic show the original forms with

attic ne n s ionic ne n s young man another principle of vocalic dialectization follows the indo european ablaut series or vowel grades
the proto indo european language could interchange e e grade with o o grade or use neither zero grade
similarly greek inherited the series for example ei oi i which are e o and zero grades of the diphthong respectively
they could appear in different verb forms present le p i leave perfect l loipa i have left aorist lipon i left or be used as the basis of dialectization attic de kn mi i point out but cretan d kn mi
the ancient greek dialects were a result of isolation and poor communication between communities living in broken terrain
all general greek historians point out the influence of terrain on the development of the city states
often the development of languages dialectization results in the dissimilation of daughter languages
that phase did not occur in greek instead the dialects were replaced by standard greek
increasing population and communication brought speakers more closely in touch and united them under the same authorities
attic greek became the literary language everywhere
buck says
long after attic had become the norm of literary prose each state employed its own dialect both in private and public monuments of internal concern and in those of a more interstate character such as treaties in the last few centuries bc regional dialects replaced local ones northwest greek koine doric koine and attic koine
the last came to replace the others in common speech in the first few centuries ad
after the division of the roman empire the earliest modern greek prevailed although a version of attic greek was still exclusively taught in schools and served as the official language of the state until the early th century
the dialect distribution was then as follows
attic greek
byzantine greek language
modern greek
demotic greek
katharevousa
yevanic
cypriot greek
cretan greek
southern italian greek griko and calabrian bovesian retaining some doric elements
pontic greek retaining some ionic elements
cappadocian greek
romano greek
doric greek
doric koin
tsakonianaccording to some scholars tsakonian is the only modern greek dialect that descends from doric albeit with some influence from the koine
others include the southern italian dialects in this group though perhaps they should rather be regarded as descended from the local doric influenced variant of the koine
