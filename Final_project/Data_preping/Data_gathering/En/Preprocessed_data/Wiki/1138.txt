In United States history the Redeemers were a political coalition in the Southern United States during the Reconstruction Era that followed the Civil War Redeemers were the Southern wing of the Democratic Party They sought to regain their political power and enforce white supremacy Their policy of Redemption was intended to oust the Radical Republicans a coalition of freedmen carpetbaggers and scalawags They generally were led by the White yeomanry and they dominated Southern politics in most areas from the s to
During Reconstruction the South was under occupation by federal forces and Southern state governments were dominated by Republicans elected largely by freedmen and allies Republicans nationally pressed for the granting of political rights to the newly freed slaves as the key to their becoming full citizens and the votes they would cast for the party The Thirteenth Amendment banning slavery Fourteenth Amendment guaranteeing the civil rights of former slaves and ensuring equal protection of the laws and Fifteenth Amendment prohibiting the denial of the right to vote on grounds of race color or previous condition of servitude enshrined such political rights in the Constitution
Numerous educated blacks moved to the South to work for Reconstruction Some were elected to office in the Southern states or were appointed to certain positions The Reconstruction governments were unpopular with many White Southerners who were not willing to accept defeat and continued to try to prevent black political activity by any means While the elite planter class often supported insurgencies violence against freedmen and other Republicans was usually carried out by other whites the secret Ku Klux Klan chapters developed in the first years after the war as one form of insurgency
In the s paramilitary organizations such as the White League in Louisiana and Red Shirts in Mississippi and North Carolina undermined the Republicans disrupting meetings and political gatherings These paramilitary bands also used violence and threats of violence to undermine the Republican vote By the presidential election of only three Southern states Louisiana South Carolina and Florida were unredeemed or not yet taken over by white Democrats The disputed Presidential election between Rutherford B Hayes the Republican governor of Ohio and Samuel J Tilden the Democratic governor of New York was allegedly resolved by the Compromise of also known as the Corrupt Bargain or the Bargain of In this compromise it was claimed Hayes became president in exchange for numerous favors to the South one of which was the removal of Federal troops from the remaining unredeemed Southern states this was however a policy Hayes had endorsed during his campaign With the removal of these forces Reconstruction came to an end
In the s Democrats began to muster more political power as former Confederate Whites began to vote again It was a movement that gathered energy up until the Compromise of in the process known as the Redemption White Democratic Southerners saw themselves as redeeming the South by regaining power
More importantly in a second wave of violence following the suppression of the Ku Klux Klan violence began to increase in the Deep South In White terrorists tried to prevent Republicans from winning the fall election in Louisiana Over a few days they killed some two hundred freedmen in St Landry Parish in the Opelousas massacre Other violence erupted From April to October there were political murders in Louisiana in which most of the victims were freedmen Violence was part of campaigns prior to the election of in several states In and more formal paramilitary groups affiliated with the Democratic Party conducted intimidation terrorism and violence against black voters and their allies to reduce Republican voting and turn officeholders out These included the White League and Red Shirts They worked openly for specific political ends and often solicited coverage of their activities by the press Every election from on was surrounded by intimidation and violence they were usually marked by fraud as well
In the aftermath of the disputed gubernatorial election of in Louisiana for instance the competing governors each certified slates of local officers This situation contributed to the Colfax Massacre of in which white Democratic militia killed more than Republican blacks in a confrontation over control of parish offices Three whites died in the violence
In remnants of White militia formed the White League a Democratic paramilitary group originating in Grant Parish of the Red River area of Louisiana with chapters arising across the state especially in rural areas In August the White League turned out six Republican office holders in Coushatta Louisiana and told them to leave the state Before they could make their way they and five to twenty black witnesses were assassinated by White paramilitary In September thousands of armed white militia supporters of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate John McEnery fought against New Orleans police and state militia in what was called the Battle of Liberty Place They took over the state government offices in New Orleans and occupied the capitol and armory They turned Republican governor William Pitt Kellogg out of office and retreated only in the face of the arrival of Federal troops sent by President Ulysses S Grant
Similarly in Mississippi the Red Shirts formed as a prominent paramilitary group that enforced Democratic voting by intimidation and murder Chapters of paramilitary Red Shirts arose and were active in North Carolina and South Carolina as well They disrupted Republican meetings killed leaders and officeholders intimidated voters at the polls or kept them away altogether
The Redeemers' program emphasized opposition to the Republican governments which they considered to be corrupt and a violation of true republican principles The crippling national economic problems and reliance on cotton meant that the South was struggling financially Redeemers denounced taxes higher than what they had known before the war At that time however the states had few functions and planters maintained private institutions only Redeemers wanted to reduce state debts Once in power they typically cut government spending shortened legislative sessions lowered politicians' salaries scaled back public aid to railroads and corporations and reduced support for the new systems of public education and some welfare institutions
As Democrats took over state legislatures they worked to change voter registration rules to strip most blacks and many poor whites of their ability to vote Blacks continued to vote in significant numbers well into the s with many winning local offices Black Congressmen continued to be elected albeit in ever smaller numbers until the s George Henry White the last Southern black of the post Reconstruction period to serve in Congress retired in leaving Congress completely white until
In the s William Jennings Bryan defeated the Southern Bourbon Democrats and took control of the Democratic Party nationwide The Democrats also faced challenges with the Agrarian Revolt when their control of the South was threatened by the Farmers Alliance the effects of Bimetallism and the newly created People's Party
Democrats worked hard to prevent populist coalitions In the former Confederate South from to starting with Mississippi legislatures of ten of the eleven states passed disenfranchising constitutions which had new provisions for poll taxes literacy tests residency requirements and other devices that effectively disenfranchised nearly all blacks and tens of thousands of poor Whites Hundreds of thousands of people were removed from voter registration rolls soon after these provisions were implemented
In Alabama for instance in fourteen Black Belt counties had a total of voters on the rolls by June after the new constitution was passed registration had dropped to just Statewide Alabama in had blacks eligible to vote but by only were registered although at least were literate From to the number of White registered voters fell by more than although the white population grew overall
By more poor Whites than blacks had been disenfranchised in Alabama mostly due to effects of the cumulative poll tax estimates were that Whites and blacks had been disenfranchised
In addition to being disenfranchised African Americans and poor Whites were shut out of the political process as Southern legislatures passed Jim Crow laws imposing segregation in public facilities and places The discrimination segregation and disenfranchisement lasted well into the later decades of the th century Those who could not vote were also ineligible to run for office or serve on juries so they were shut out of all offices at the local and state as well as federal levels
While Congress had actively intervened for more than years in elections in the South which the House Elections Committee judged to be flawed after it backed off from intervening Many Northern legislators were outraged about the disenfranchisement of blacks and some proposed reducing Southern representation in Congress but they never managed to accomplish this as Southern representatives formed a strong one party voting bloc for decades
Although educated African Americans mounted legal challenges with many secretly funded by educator Booker T Washington and his northern allies the Supreme Court upheld Mississippi's and Alabama's provisions in its rulings in Williams v Mississippi and Giles v Harris
People in the movement chose the term Redemption from Christian theology Historian Daniel W Stowell concludes that White Southerners appropriated the term to describe the political transformation they desired that is the end of Reconstruction This term helped unify numerous White voters and encompassed efforts to purge southern society of its sins and to remove Republican political leaders
It also represented the birth of a new Southern society rather than a return to its antebellum predecessor Historian Gaines M Foster explains how the South became known as the Bible Belt by connecting this characterization with changing attitudes caused by slavery's demise Freed from preoccupation with federal intervention over slavery and even citing it as precedent White Southerners joined Northerners in the national crusade to legislate morality Viewed by some as a bulwark of morality the largely Protestant South took on a Bible Belt identity long before H L Mencken coined the term
When Reconstruction died so did all hope for national enforcement of adherence to the constitutional amendments that the U S Congress had passed in the wake of the Civil War As the last Federal troops left the ex Confederacy two old foes of American politics reappeared at the heart of the Southern polity the twin inflammatory issues of state rights and race It was precisely on the ground of these two issues that the Civil War had broken out and in sixteen years after the secession crisis the South reaffirmed control over them
The slave went free stood a brief moment in the sun then moved back again toward slavery wrote W E B Du Bois The black community in the South was brought back under the yoke of the Southern Democrats who had been politically undermined during Reconstruction Whites in the South were committed to reestablish its own sociopolitical structure with the goal of a new social order enforcing racial subordination and labor control While the Republicans succeeded in maintaining some power in part of the Upper South such as Tennessee in the Deep South there was a return to home rule Nowhere was this more true than Georgia where an unbroken line of Democrats occupied the governor's office for years a period of dominance that only came to an end in
In the aftermath of the Compromise of Southern Democrats held the South's black community under increasingly tight control Politically blacks were gradually evicted from public office as the few that remained saw the sway they held over local politics considerably decreased Socially the situation was worse as the Southern Democrats tightened their grip on the labor force Vagrancy and anti enticement laws were reinstituted It became illegal to be jobless or to leave a job before the required contract expired Economically the blacks were stripped of independence as new laws gave White planters the control over credit lines and property Effectively the black community was placed under a three fold subjugation that was reminiscent of slavery
Also historian Edward L Ayers argues that after the Redeemers were sharply divided and fought for control of the Democratic Party
For the next few years the Democrats seemed in control of the South but even then deep challenges were building beneath the surface Behind their show of unity the Democratic Redeemers suffered deep divisions Conflicts between upcountry and Black Belt between town and country and between former Democrats and former Whigs divided the Redeemers The Democratic party proved too small to contain the ambitions of all the white men who sought its rewards too large and unwieldy to move decisively In the years immediately following Reconstruction most blacks and former abolitionists held that Reconstruction lost the struggle for civil rights for black people because of violence against blacks and against white Republicans Frederick Douglass and Reconstruction Congressman John R Lynch cited the withdrawal of federal troops from the South as a primary reason for the loss of voting rights and other civil rights by African Americans after
But by the turn of the th century white historians led by the Dunning School saw Reconstruction as a failure because of its political and financial corruption its failure to heal the hatreds of the war and its control by self serving Northern politicians such as those around President Grant Historian Claude Bowers said that the worst part of what he called the Tragic Era was the extension of voting rights to freedmen a policy he claimed led to misgovernment and corruption The freedmen the Dunning School historians argues were not at fault because they were manipulated by corrupt white carpetbaggers interested only in raiding the state treasury and staying in power They agreed the South had to be redeemed by foes of corruption Reconstruction in short was said to violate the values of republicanism and all Republicans were classified as extremists This interpretation of events the hallmark of the Dunning School dominated most U S history textbooks from to the s
Beginning in the s historians such as C Vann Woodward and Howard K Beale attacked the redemptionist interpretation of Reconstruction calling themselves revisionists and claiming that the real issues were economic The Northern Radicals were tools of the railroads and the Republicans in the South were manipulated to do their bidding The Redeemers furthermore were also tools of the railroads and were themselves corrupt
In W E B Du Bois published a Marxist analysis in his Black Reconstruction An Essay toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America His book emphasized the role of African Americans during Reconstruction noted their collaboration with whites their lack of majority in most legislatures and also the achievements of Reconstruction establishing universal public education improving prisons establishing orphanages and other charitable institutions and trying to improve state funding for the welfare of all citizens He also noted that despite complaints most Southern states kept the constitutions of Reconstruction for many years some for a quarter of a century
By the s neo abolitionist historians led by Kenneth Stampp and Eric Foner focused on the struggle of freedmen While acknowledging corruption in the Reconstruction era they hold that the Dunning School over emphasized it while ignoring the worst violations of republican principles namely denying African Americans their civil rights including their right to vote
Although African Americans mounted legal challenges the U S Supreme Court upheld Mississippi's and Alabama's provisions in its rulings in Williams v Mississippi Giles v Harris and Giles v Teasley Booker T Washington secretly helped fund and arrange representation for such legal challenges raising money from northern patrons who helped support Tuskegee University
When white primaries were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Smith v Allwright civil rights organizations rushed to register African American voters By the All Citizens Registration Committee ACRC of Atlanta managed to get voters registered in Georgia raising black participation to of those eligible This was a major increase from the on the rolls who had managed to get through administrative barriers in
However Georgia among other Southern states passed new legislation to once again repress black voter registration It was not until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of the Civil Rights Act of and the Voting Rights Act of that the descendants of those who were first granted suffrage by the Fifteenth Amendment finally regained the ability to vote
