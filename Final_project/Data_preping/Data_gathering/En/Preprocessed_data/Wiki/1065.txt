vittorio jano designed a new v engine for sports car racing for ferrari
this new engine introduced in combined elements of both colombo and lampredi engines with new features
engine architecture was more of lampredi school but retained smaller colombo internal measurements
jano moved to ferrari along with his designs for the lancia d in and went on to design not only a new v but also a family of the dino v engines soon after
some of the technical ideas came from the jano s lancia v dohc engine intended for formula one
this family of engines replaced lampredi inline s known from ferrari monza line and went on to win many international races and titles for ferrari
the design team comprised jano as well as vittorio bellentani alberto massimino best known for the maserati f and andrea fraschetti
all jano engines used dry sump lubrication and almost all of them had two spark plugs per cylinder with four coils
also most of them had dohc configuration with chain driven camshafts and two valves per cylinder
type was the first engine designed by jano for ferrari
introduced in it remained the only sohc in its v family
bore and stroke was mm by mm for a total capacity of cc l cu in
at compression ratio and at first with only three weber ir c carburettors this powerplant produced ps kw hp at rpm and could achieve km h top speed
only four cars were made all bodied by scaglietti as spyders
the ferrari mm that used this engine was a highly competitive race car at its time
type was introduced in for the ferrari s
having same measurements as before mm by mm and same capacity this engine received a dohc configuration
it was the first ferrari sports racing car with a dohc v engine nine years before colombo v received a quad cam upgrade in p
those twin camshafts per cylinder bank were inspired by the lancia d formula one car s engine also designed by vittorio jano
with a new configuration also the fuel system was upgraded and now the s sported six weber dcn carburettors
the power grew slightly to ps kw hp but at higher rpm
compression and top speed remained the same
this car was very short lived and same year after a couple of races upgraded to the specification
type was a first step forward in terms of capacity
redesigned in and enlarged to cc l cu in thanks to bigger mm bore with the same stroke as before
power output was now ps kw hp at rpm
same six webers setup compression ratio and spark plugs arrangement remained
double camshafts per bank engine was not only more powerful than previous single cam engines but also lighter and more reliable which was important in long distance racing
the ferrari s with this engine won the last mille miglia in
type also debuted in on the ferrari s
having even bigger displacement than before at cc l cu in this was also the last enlargement
both bore and stroke were changed now at mm by mm respectively
previous weber carburettors were upgraded to dcn type
compression ratio was slightly upped to which resulted in ps kw hp at rpm of maximum power
the ferrari s equipped with this engine could top km h
type was very short lived installed in a single chassis ever produced
due to tragic events at the mille miglia new regulations forced limited displacement to l for season
this new requirement meeting engine had the same measurements as colombo at mm by mm resulting in total capacity of cc l cu in difference being that this was a quad cam configuration
power output was ps kw hp at rpm that is ps kw more than the testa rossa from the same year
the only jano v single spark plug engine with two magnetos
after only a single unfinished race in the spa francorchamps grand prix in may the car was quickly converted into the s
the ferrari mi mi for monza indianapolis was one of only two ferrari race cars purpose made for the miles of monza a sort of italian version of the indianapolis
this single seater used the l engine from the s
now with a compression ratio and a six weber dcn carburettors it could produce up to ps kw hp at rpm
it was the most powerful of the ferrari engines to date
luigi musso won qualifying at a record average speed of km h mph
the actual race was divided into three heats and with an aid from phil hill and mike hawthorn the mi was able to finish third overall just behind two purpose built american competitors
type again found its way into a sports racing chassis
this time as a result of a conversion from the s in
this model is usually confused with the mi due to a similar name
the engine was based on the l unit from the mi with a higher compression ratio and the same type carburettors
it could produce an impressive ps kw hp at rpm
the car was raced in california by phil hill richie ginther and john von neumann ferrari distributor for california
ferrari race cars sporting jano designed v engines scored many victories in europe and internationally
in the mm won the mille miglia brought victory at the sveriges grand prix and placed third at the km n rburgring
in the mm won the km buenos aires
same year the s scored victory at the mille miglia and third place at the km n rburgring with the highest le mans score of fifth place
the s won at the gran premio de venezuela and finished second at the n rburgring and the swedish grand prix
in the short lived race of two worlds ran in and only the highest place of any european entrant was achieved by the ferrari mi
the jano v engines helped ferrari achieve and world sportscar championships
in the mm scored two out of five rounds and in three different jano engined models won three out of seven rounds
after rules change for season imposing a l total capacity limit most of the jano sports cars became obsolete
in the end ferrari moved towards ubiquitous colombo engined sports and gt cars winning world sportscar championship solely with the testa rossas
vittorio jano being a talented engineer designed many different types of engines in his career
when enzo ferrari brought him from lancia in he also inherited their cc l cu in dohc v formula one engine from lancia d race car
in this car was reinstituted as the ferrari d and was powered by a cc l cu in engine with x mm of bore and stroke and capable of ps kw hp at rpm
v engine was redesigned yet again for formula one season and used in the ferrari f single seater
now it could deliver ps kw hp at rpm
compression was and four solex pii carburettors were installed
engine was of a quad cam configuration and had a dry sump
the design team also included carlo chiti
