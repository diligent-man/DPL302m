Vittorio Jano designed a new 60° V12 engine for sports car racing for Ferrari
This new engine, introduced in 1956, combined elements of both Colombo and Lampredi engines with new features
Engine architecture was more of Lampredi school but retained smaller Colombo internal measurements
Jano moved to Ferrari along with his designs for the Lancia D50 in 1955 and went on to design not only a new V12 but also a family of the Dino V6 engines soon after
Some of the technical ideas came from the Jano's Lancia V8 DOHC engine, intended for Formula One
This family of engines replaced Lampredi inline-4s known from Ferrari Monza line and went on to win many international races and titles for Ferrari
The design team comprised Jano as well as Vittorio Bellentani, Alberto Massimino (best known for the Maserati 250F), and Andrea Fraschetti
All Jano engines used dry sump lubrication and almost all of them had two spark plugs per cylinder with four coils
Also most of them had DOHC configuration with chain-driven camshafts and two valves per cylinder.
Type 130 was the first engine designed by Jano for Ferrari
Introduced in 1956 it remained the only SOHC in its V12 family
Bore and stroke was 73 mm by 69.5 mm for a total capacity of 3,490.61 cc (3.5 L; 213.0 cu in)
At 9:1 compression ratio and, at first, with only three Weber 36 IR4/C1 carburettors this powerplant produced 320 PS (235 kW; 316 hp) at 7200 rpm and could achieve 280 km/h top speed
Only four cars were made, all bodied by Scaglietti as spyders
The Ferrari 290 MM that used this engine was a highly competitive race car at its time.
Type 136 was introduced in 1957 for the Ferrari 290 S
Having same measurements as before (73 mm by 69.5 mm) and same capacity, this engine received a DOHC configuration
It was the first Ferrari sports racing car with a DOHC V12 engine, nine years before Colombo V12 received a quad-cam upgrade in 275 P2
Those twin camshafts per cylinder bank were inspired by the Lancia D50 Formula One car's engine, also designed by Vittorio Jano
With a new configuration also the fuel system was upgraded and now the 290 S sported six Weber 42DCN carburettors
The power grew slightly to 330 PS (243 kW; 325 hp) but at higher, 8000, rpm
Compression and top speed remained the same
This car was very short lived and same year, after a couple of races, upgraded to the 315 specification.
Type 140 was a first step forward in terms of capacity
Redesigned in 1957 and enlarged to 3,783.40 cc (3.8 L; 230.9 cu in) thanks to bigger 76 mm bore with the same stroke as before
Power output was now 360 PS (265 kW; 355 hp) at 7800 rpm
Same six Webers setup, compression ratio and spark plugs arrangement remained
Double camshafts per bank engine was not only more powerful than previous single-cam engines but also lighter and more reliable, which was important in long distance racing
The Ferrari 315 S with this engine won the last Mille Miglia in 1957.
Type 141 also debuted in 1957 on the Ferrari 335 S
Having even bigger displacement than before at 4,023.32 cc (4.0 L; 245.5 cu in), this was also the last enlargement
Both bore and stroke were changed, now at 77 mm by 72 mm, respectively
Previous Weber carburettors were upgraded to 44 DCN type
Compression ratio was slightly upped to 9.2:1 which resulted in 390 PS (287 kW; 385 hp) at 7400 rpm of maximum power
The Ferrari 335 S equipped with this engine could top 300 km/h.
Type 142 was very short lived installed in a single chassis ever produced
Due to tragic events at the Mille Miglia, new regulations forced limited displacement to 3.0 L for 1958 season
This new requirement-meeting engine had the same measurements as Colombo 250 at 73 mm by 58.8 mm resulting in total capacity of 2,953.21 cc (3.0 L; 180.2 cu in), difference being that this was a quad-cam configuration
Power output was 320 PS (235 kW; 316 hp) at 8400 rpm, that is 20 PS (15 kW) more than the 250 Testa Rossa from the same year
The only Jano V12 single spark plug engine with two magnetos
After only a single, unfinished race in the Spa Francorchamps Grand Prix in May 1958, the car was quickly converted into the 412 S.
The Ferrari 412 MI (MI for Monza Indianapolis) was one of only two Ferrari race cars, purpose-made for the 1958 500 Miles of Monza, a sort of Italian version of the Indianapolis 500
This single-seater used the 4.0 L engine from the 335 S
Now with a 9.9:1 compression ratio and a six Weber 42DCN carburettors, it could produce up to 447 PS (329 kW; 441 hp) at 7700 rpm
It was the most powerful of the Ferrari engines to date
Luigi Musso won qualifying at a record average speed of 280.8 km/h (174.5 mph)
The actual race was divided into three heats and, with an aid from Phil Hill and Mike Hawthorn, the 412 MI was able to finish third overall, just behind two purpose-built American competitors.
Type 141 again found its way into a sports racing chassis
This time as a result of a conversion from the 312 S in 1958
This model is usually confused with the 412 MI due to a similar name
The engine was based on the 4.0 L unit from the MI with a higher compression ratio and the same 42-type carburettors
It could produce an impressive 432 PS (318 kW; 426 hp) at 8000 rpm
The car was raced in California by Phil Hill, Richie Ginther and John von Neumann (Ferrari distributor for California).
Ferrari race cars sporting Jano-designed V12 engines scored many victories in Europe and internationally
In 1956, the 290 MM won the Mille Miglia, brought 1-2 victory at the Sveriges Grand Prix and placed third at the 1000 km Nürburgring.
In 1957, the 290 MM won the 1000 km Buenos Aires
Same year the 315 S scored 1-2 victory at the Mille Miglia and third place at the 1000 km Nürburgring with the highest Le Mans score of fifth place
The 335 S won 1-2 at the Gran Premio de Venezuela and finished second at the Nürburgring and the Swedish Grand Prix
In the short-lived Race of Two Worlds, ran in 1957 and 1958 only, the highest place of any European entrant was achieved by the Ferrari 412 MI.
The Jano V12 engines helped Ferrari achieve 1956 and 1957 World Sportscar Championships
In 1956 the 290 MM scored two out of five rounds and in 1957 three different Jano-engined models won three out of seven rounds.
After rules change for 1958 season, imposing a 3.0 L total capacity limit, most of the Jano sports cars became obsolete
In the end Ferrari moved towards ubiquitous Colombo 250 engined sports and GT cars, winning 1958 World Sportscar Championship solely with the 250 Testa Rossas.
Vittorio Jano being a talented engineer, designed many different types of engines in his career
When Enzo Ferrari brought him from Lancia in 1955 he also inherited their 2,488.02 cc (2.5 L; 151.8 cu in), DOHC, 90° V8 Formula One engine from Lancia D50 race car
In 1956 this car was reinstituted as the Ferrari D50 and was powered by a 2,485.98 cc (2.5 L; 151.7 cu in) engine with 76 x 68.5 mm of bore and stroke and capable of 265 PS (195 kW; 261 hp) at 8000 rpm.
V8 engine was redesigned yet again for 1957 Formula One season and used in the Ferrari 801 F1 single-seater
Now it could deliver 275 PS (202 kW; 271 hp) at 8400 rpm
Compression was 11.5:1 and four Solex 40 PII carburettors were installed
Engine was of a quad-cam configuration and had a dry sump
The 801 design team also included Carlo Chiti.
