The Ferrari SF70H is a Formula One racing car designed and constructed by Scuderia Ferrari to compete during the 2017 Formula One season
The car was driven by Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen
It made its competitive début at the 2017 Australian Grand Prix, where it finished first and fourth in the hands of Vettel and Räikkönen respectively.
In keeping with his tradition of giving his cars female nicknames, Vettel named his SF70H "Gina".
It was the last car to feature sponsorship from Santander, their long-term sponsor since 2010, until Santander returned to sponsor the team for the 2022 season.
The chassis was designed by Mattia Binotto, Simone Resta, Enrico Cardile, David Sanchez and Rory Byrne with Corrado Iotti leading the powertrain design.
The model was named Ferrari SF70H to mark Ferrari's 70th anniversary as an automotive manufacturer.
The car proved to be fast in pre-season testing, and it carried its form into the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix
Vettel qualified in 2nd, splitting the two Mercedes cars and Räikkönen qualified in 4th
Vettel took the lead from Lewis Hamilton on lap 17 when he pitted for new tyres
Hamilton rejoined behind Max Verstappen and could not pass him
Vettel took advantage of this and came out in the lead after his stop
Vettel went on to win the inaugural race of the season ahead of the two Mercedes drivers, giving Ferrari its first win since the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix
Räikkönen finished in 4th after fending off a late charge from Verstappen
This result also marked the first race weekend after which a Mercedes-powered team was not leading the Constructors' Championship since the 2013 Brazilian Grand Prix.
In China Vettel and Räikkönen qualified in same positions as in Australia, i.e., in 2nd and 4th respectively
The race started in semi-dry conditions
Everyone, except Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz Jr
started on the Intermediate tyre compound
At the end of lap 2, many drivers including Vettel decided to pit for dry tyres under the Virtual Safety Car caused by Williams' Lance Stroll who had crashed
This proved to be very costly for Vettel as Sauber's Antonio Giovinazzi crashed on lap 4 which forced the Safety Car to come out
This meant that the two Red Bulls of Ricciardo and Verstappen along with Räikkönen had eclipsed Vettel in the pits and he was relegated to 5th
Vettel eventually managed to climb back up into 2nd and maintain his position till the end
Räikkönen meanwhile struggled with understeer throughout the whole weekend
At the start of the race he was overtaken by Ricciardo into the first corner
Unlike his teammate, Räikkönen could not find a way past the two Red Bull cars and finished in fifth
Hamilton winning the race meant that he and Vettel were tied in points after two races
Mercedes also managed to outscore Ferrari which put them 1 point ahead of Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship before the  Bahrain Grand Prix.
At the Bahrain Grand Prix, Vettel qualified third, 4 tenths of a second down on pole-sitter Valtteri Bottas
Räikkönen qualified fifth, behind Ricciardo
At the start, Vettel passed Hamilton for second and was pushing Bottas who struggled with pace and rear tyres
Vettel pitted for supersoft tyres when the safety car came out
Vettel came out in first place and started making advantage on softer tyres
Vettel pitted again and returned on soft tyres, while Hamilton took the lead on older tyres, with Bottas moving into second place
Hamilton pitted for new tyres and started chasing Vettel
He easily passed Bottas, but Vettel maintained the lead to win the Bahrain Grand Prix for the third time, with Räikkönen finishing fourth
It was Vettel's second win in first three races in the season.
Ferrari would earn their first front-row lockout of the season in Russia with Vettel taking pole position
However Bottas was able to overtake both Vettel and Räikkönen at the start and maintained the lead throughout the race
Vettel initially struggled to match Bottas' pace but in the second half of the race, he was able to close the gap to Bottas, who was on an older set of tyres than Vettel
During the last lap, Vettel managed to get within a second of Bottas but it was too little too late as Bottas claimed his first win of his career
Räikkönen secured his first podium finish of the season by finishing in third and also had the fastest lap of the race
With 20% of the season completed, Vettel led the Drivers' Championship by 13 points over Hamilton and Ferrari trailed Mercedes in the Constructors' Championship by a single point.
Ferrari were again very fast in Spain, despite major upgrades to the Mercedes cars
Vettel, who had a scare in Q1 when he was ordered to stop the car on the track, was on course to take pole
He was 3 tenths up on Hamilton's best lap in the second sector, but lost time in the final sector and qualified second, 0.051 seconds behind Hamilton
Räikkönen qualified in fourth, 0.290 seconds off the pole time
In the race, Vettel got a better start than Hamilton from second and was into first position by Turn 1
Max Verstappen, Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas tried to go three-wide through Turn 1, but Bottas clipped the inside kerb, hitting Räikkönen, who hit Verstappen
It ended both Räikkönen and Verstappen's race but Bottas was able to continue
Meanwhile, Vettel had stretched the gap to 2.2 seconds over Hamilton by the end of lap 1, but the gap stayed around that margin till Lap 14, when Vettel pitted from the lead for soft tyres, to cover off the undercut threat from Hamilton
He made easy work of passing Daniel Ricciardo, but lost around 4 seconds trying to pass Bottas
Hamilton stayed out till lap 21 and then changed onto a set of mediums, rejoining 7 seconds back
Then the Virtual Safety Car was deployed for the Felipe Massa/Stoffel Vandoorne crash
Hamilton pitted just before the end of the VSC for softs, while Vettel pitted the next lap for mediums
They were side by side at Turn 1, touched wheels and Hamilton was forced off the track and had to fall behind Vettel
However, he got past on Lap 44 and won the race
He thus reduced the gap to Vettel in the Drivers' Championship to 6 points, while Mercedes extended their Constructors' lead to 8 points.
At Monaco, both Mercedes cars struggled to find the right setup, while Ferrari were very fast yet again
Kimi Räikkönen got his first pole position since France 2008 by 0.043 seconds over Vettel, who himself was just 0.002 seconds clear of the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas in third
But, crucially for the championship, Hamilton would start the race in thirteenth place
The two Ferraris stayed one and two until lap 34, when Räikkönen pitted to cover off the undercut from Bottas and Verstappen
Vettel stayed out for an extra five laps, putting in blistering lap times mostly quicker than those of Räikkönen on fresh supersofts
Vettel came in on lap 39, and rejoined ahead of Räikkönen, and led to the finish despite a safety car
But, after the race, talks arose that Ferrari had deliberately put Räikkönen on the slower strategy (Pirelli had said that ultrasofts could last an entire race distance, so the preferred strategy was to run on ultrasofts as long as possible) so that Vettel could maximize the points gain from Hamilton's lowly finish
 This was the first Ferrari win at Monaco since 2001 and first Ferrari 1–2 finish since the infamous 2010 German Grand Prix
Ferrari retook the lead in the Constructors' Championship after both Mercedes cars had a poor race and Vettel increased his lead over Hamilton to 25 points.
Ferrari had a poor weekend in Canada
Vettel qualified in second splitting the two Mercedes cars and Räikkönen qualified in fourth ahead of the two Red Bulls
At the start Vettel lost positions to Bottas and a fast starting Verstappen, who jumped from fifth to second before turn 1
Verstappen made slight contact with Vettel which damaged Vettel's front wing
After the safety car period which was triggered by Carlos Sainz's Toro Rosso crashing into Felipe Massa's Williams, half of Vettel's front wing fell off his car and he had to pit 2 laps later which relegated him to last place
Vettel made a comeback drive and managed to overtake the two Force Indias of Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon, who were engaged in an inter-team battle which possibly cost them a chance for a podium finish, and finished in fourth; Räikkonen meanwhile was running in sixth but had a brake issue which forced him to limp home in seventh
This allowed Mercedes to retake the lead in the Constructors' Championship by 8 points.
At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Räikkönen managed to out-qualify Vettel as they lined up on the second row of the grid behind the two Mercedes
A race which saw many crashes and incidents, was also a centre of controversy for Vettel who, under the safety car, steered his car into Hamilton's in frustration as he claimed that Hamilton had brake checked him just before the restart which caused damage to his front wing
He was awarded a 10-second stop-go penalty for that move
He finished in fourth, ahead of Hamilton who had to make a mandatory pit stop to change his loose headrest
Three penalty points were added to Vettel's licence and he later admitted his mistake and apologised to Hamilton and the FIA which saw him avoid a possible race ban
Räikkönen collided with Bottas on the opening lap
He retired on lap 46 as a precaution to prevent the failure of his suspension which had received damage from the crash with Bottas.
In Austria, Vettel qualified in second ahead of Räikkönen in third
Vettel finished second behind Bottas even after a late challenge for victory, finishing just six tenths of a second behind the winner; Räikkönen meanwhile struggled for pace throughout the whole race and dropped behind Ricciardo and Hamilton to finish in fifth.
At the British Grand Prix, Ferrari seemed to struggle to keep up with the Mercedes as Hamilton was half a second quicker than Räikkönen in qualifying who lined up in 2nd ahead of Vettel in 3rd
During the start of the race, Vettel dropped behind Verstappen and was relegated to 4th but he regained his position by undercutting the Red Bull in the pits
On lap 49, running in 2nd place, Räikkönen's front left tyre lost pressure and he had to pit 2 laps from the end which saw him fall to 4th behind Vettel
On the next lap Vettel suffered with the same issue as his teammate which forced him to pit with 1 lap to go while in 3rd
This re-promoted Räikkönen to the podium and saw Vettel fall down to 7th and they finished in those positions
This allowed Hamilton, who won the fourth British Grand Prix in succession, to reduce the championship deficit to Vettel to just 1 point and allowed Mercedes to open up a gap of 55 points in the Constructors' Championship at the halfway point of the season.
After an appalling weekend in Silverstone, Ferrari looked to be struggling during Friday practice in Hungary, however both cars looked dominant on Saturday with Vettel scoring pole position from Räikkönen and being half a second quicker than Bottas and seven-tenths faster than Hamilton despite Mercedes holding a 0.5–0.7 seconds advantage over Ferrari in qualifying trim
On Sunday morning however Vettel's car developed a hydraulic problem which had to be rectified quickly before the race began
As the race began it was apparent that Ferrari had the quickest car on circuit however Vettel's pace started dropping after the initial stint
This was due to a steering wheel issues which occurred before the race began (media suspecting it was due to the quick hydraulic fix Ferrari did) which meant that Vettel was holding up Räikkönen but was allowing the Mercedes to close in on the Ferraris
Despite this however Vettel won the race from Räikkönen and was 12.462 seconds ahead of Bottas in 3rd place
As a result of this, Ferrari were 2nd in the Constructors' Championship, 39 points behind Mercedes, but Vettel was leading the Drivers' Championship by 14 points ahead of Hamilton going into the summer break with Bottas 33 points behind in 3rd and Räikkönen in 5th place 86 points behind Vettel.

With a breathtaking lap Vettel grabbed pole position, beating Verstappen by over 3 tenths of a second
Räikkönen qualified fourth, behind Ricciardo but in front of Hamilton and Bottas
During the first ever wet-dry night race Vettel tried to chop Verstappen off in order to maintain his lead
He didn't see his Finnish teammate - who had a superb start - on his left which led to a chain reaction: Verstappen tried to evade the cut from Vettel but there was no room on the left because of the charging Räikkönen
Verstappen and Räikkönen hit each other and the Finn subsequently crashed into Vettel, ending the race for the three of them
