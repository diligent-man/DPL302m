in china vettel and r ikk nen qualified in same positions as in australia i e in nd and th respectively
the race started in semi dry conditions
everyone except toro rosso s carlos sainz jr
started on the intermediate tyre compound
at the end of lap many drivers including vettel decided to pit for dry tyres under the virtual safety car caused by williams lance stroll who had crashed
this proved to be very costly for vettel as sauber s antonio giovinazzi crashed on lap which forced the safety car to come out
this meant that the two red bulls of ricciardo and verstappen along with r ikk nen had eclipsed vettel in the pits and he was relegated to th
vettel eventually managed to climb back up into nd and maintain his position till the end
r ikk nen meanwhile struggled with understeer throughout the whole weekend
at the start of the race he was overtaken by ricciardo into the first corner
unlike his teammate r ikk nen could not find a way past the two red bull cars and finished in fifth
hamilton winning the race meant that he and vettel were tied in points after two races
mercedes also managed to outscore ferrari which put them point ahead of ferrari in the constructors championship before the bahrain grand prix
at the bahrain grand prix vettel qualified third tenths of a second down on pole sitter valtteri bottas
r ikk nen qualified fifth behind ricciardo
at the start vettel passed hamilton for second and was pushing bottas who struggled with pace and rear tyres
vettel pitted for supersoft tyres when the safety car came out
vettel came out in first place and started making advantage on softer tyres
vettel pitted again and returned on soft tyres while hamilton took the lead on older tyres with bottas moving into second place
hamilton pitted for new tyres and started chasing vettel
he easily passed bottas but vettel maintained the lead to win the bahrain grand prix for the third time with r ikk nen finishing fourth
it was vettel s second win in first three races in the season
ferrari would earn their first front row lockout of the season in russia with vettel taking pole position
however bottas was able to overtake both vettel and r ikk nen at the start and maintained the lead throughout the race
vettel initially struggled to match bottas pace but in the second half of the race he was able to close the gap to bottas who was on an older set of tyres than vettel
during the last lap vettel managed to get within a second of bottas but it was too little too late as bottas claimed his first win of his career
r ikk nen secured his first podium finish of the season by finishing in third and also had the fastest lap of the race
with of the season completed vettel led the drivers championship by points over hamilton and ferrari trailed mercedes in the constructors championship by a single point
ferrari were again very fast in spain despite major upgrades to the mercedes cars
vettel who had a scare in q when he was ordered to stop the car on the track was on course to take pole
he was tenths up on hamilton s best lap in the second sector but lost time in the final sector and qualified second seconds behind hamilton
r ikk nen qualified in fourth seconds off the pole time
in the race vettel got a better start than hamilton from second and was into first position by turn
max verstappen kimi r ikk nen and valtteri bottas tried to go three wide through turn but bottas clipped the inside kerb hitting r ikk nen who hit verstappen
it ended both r ikk nen and verstappen s race but bottas was able to continue
meanwhile vettel had stretched the gap to seconds over hamilton by the end of lap but the gap stayed around that margin till lap when vettel pitted from the lead for soft tyres to cover off the undercut threat from hamilton
he made easy work of passing daniel ricciardo but lost around seconds trying to pass bottas
hamilton stayed out till lap and then changed onto a set of mediums rejoining seconds back
then the virtual safety car was deployed for the felipe massa stoffel vandoorne crash
hamilton pitted just before the end of the vsc for softs while vettel pitted the next lap for mediums
they were side by side at turn touched wheels and hamilton was forced off the track and had to fall behind vettel
however he got past on lap and won the race
he thus reduced the gap to vettel in the drivers championship to points while mercedes extended their constructors lead to points
at monaco both mercedes cars struggled to find the right setup while ferrari were very fast yet again
kimi r ikk nen got his first pole position since france by seconds over vettel who himself was just seconds clear of the mercedes of valtteri bottas in third
but crucially for the championship hamilton would start the race in thirteenth place
the two ferraris stayed one and two until lap when r ikk nen pitted to cover off the undercut from bottas and verstappen
vettel stayed out for an extra five laps putting in blistering lap times mostly quicker than those of r ikk nen on fresh supersofts
vettel came in on lap and rejoined ahead of r ikk nen and led to the finish despite a safety car
but after the race talks arose that ferrari had deliberately put r ikk nen on the slower strategy pirelli had said that ultrasofts could last an entire race distance so the preferred strategy was to run on ultrasofts as long as possible so that vettel could maximize the points gain from hamilton s lowly finish
this was the first ferrari win at monaco since and first ferrari finish since the infamous german grand prix
ferrari retook the lead in the constructors championship after both mercedes cars had a poor race and vettel increased his lead over hamilton to points

this allowed mercedes to retake the lead in the constructors championship by points
at the azerbaijan grand prix r ikk nen managed to out qualify vettel as they lined up on the second row of the grid behind the two mercedes
a race which saw many crashes and incidents was also a centre of controversy for vettel who under the safety car steered his car into hamilton s in frustration as he claimed that hamilton had brake checked him just before the restart which caused damage to his front wing
he was awarded a second stop go penalty for that move
he finished in fourth ahead of hamilton who had to make a mandatory pit stop to change his loose headrest
three penalty points were added to vettel s licence and he later admitted his mistake and apologised to hamilton and the fia which saw him avoid a possible race ban

on lap running in nd place r ikk nen s front left tyre lost pressure and he had to pit laps from the end which saw him fall to th behind vettel
on the next lap vettel suffered with the same issue as his teammate which forced him to pit with lap to go while in rd
this re promoted r ikk nen to the podium and saw vettel fall down to th and they finished in those positions

on sunday morning however vettel s car developed a hydraulic problem which had to be rectified quickly before the race began
as the race began it was apparent that ferrari had the quickest car on circuit however vettel s pace started dropping after the initial stint
this was due to a steering wheel issues which occurred before the race began media suspecting it was due to the quick hydraulic fix ferrari did which meant that vettel was holding up r ikk nen but was allowing the mercedes to close in on the ferraris
