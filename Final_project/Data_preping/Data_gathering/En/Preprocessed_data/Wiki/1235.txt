the word punjabi sometimes spelled panjabi has been derived from the word panj b persian for five waters referring to the five major eastern tributaries of the indus river
the name of the region was introduced by the turko persian conquerors of south asia and was a translation of the sanskrit name for the region panchanada which means land of the five rivers
panj is cognate with sanskrit pa ca greek p nte and lithuanian penki all of which meaning five b is cognate with sanskrit p and with the av of avon
the historical punjab region now divided between india and pakistan is defined physiographically by the indus river and these five tributaries
one of the five the beas river is a tributary of another the sutlej
punjabi developed from prakrit languages and later apabhra a sanskrit deviated or non grammatical speech from bce sanskrit was advocated as official language and prakrit gave birth to many regional languages in different parts of india
all these languages are called prakrit sanskrit pr k ta collectively
paishachi prakrit was one of these prakrit languages which was spoken in north and north western india and punjabi developed from this prakrit
later in northern india paishachi prakrit gave rise to paishachi aparbhsha a descendant of prakrit
punjabi emerged as an apabhramsha a degenerated form of prakrit in the th century ce and became stable by the th century
the earliest writings in punjabi belong to nath yogi era from th to th century ce
the language of these compositions is morphologically closer to shauraseni apbhramsa though vocabulary and rhythm is surcharged with extreme colloquialism and folklore
the arabic and modern persian influence in the historical punjab region began with the late first millennium muslim conquests on the indian subcontinent
many persian and arabic words were incorporated in punjabi
so punjabi relies heavily on persian and arabic words which are used with a liberal approach to language
many important words like etc
are derived from persian and arabic
after the fall of the sikh empire urdu was made the official language of punjab in pakistani punjab it is still the primary official language and influenced the language as well
in fact the sounds of and have been borrowed from persian
later it was lexically influenced by portuguese words like greek words like chagatai words like japanese words like chinese words like and english words like though these influences have been minor in comparison to persian and arabic
note in more formal contexts hypercorrect sanskritized versions of these words pradh n for pardh n and pariv r for parv r may be used
punjabi is spoken in many dialects in an area from delhi to islamabad
the majhi dialect has been adopted as standard punjabi in india and pakistan for education media etc
the majhi dialect originated in the majha region of the punjab
the majha region consists of several eastern districts of pakistani punjab and in india around amritsar gurdaspur pathankot and tarn taran districts
the two most important cities in this area are lahore and amritsar
in india punjabi is written in the gurmukh script in offices schools and media
gurmukhi is the official standard script for punjabi though it is often unofficially written in the latin scripts due to influence from english india s two primary official languages at the union level
in pakistan punjabi is generally written using the shahmukh script which in literary standards is identical to the urdu alphabet however various attempts have been made to create certain distinct characters from a modification of the persian nasta l q characters to represent punjabi phonology not already found in the urdu alphabet
in pakistan punjabi loans technical words from persian and arabic languages just like urdu does
punjabi is the most widely spoken language in pakistan the eleventh most widely spoken in india and also present in the punjabi diaspora in various countries
punjabi is the most widely spoken language in pakistan being the native language of million people or approximately of the country s population
beginning with the census speakers of saraiki and hindko were no longer included in the total numbers for punjabi which explains the apparent decrease
punjabi is the official language of the indian state of punjab and has the status of an additional official language in haryana and delhi
some of its major urban centres in northern india are amritsar ludhiana chandigarh jalandhar ambala patiala bathinda hoshiarpur and delhi
in the census of india million reported their language as punjabi
the census publications group this with speakers of related mother tongues like bagri and bhateali to arrive at the figure of million
punjabi is also spoken as a minority language in several other countries where punjabi people have emigrated in large numbers such as the united states australia the united kingdom and canada
there were million native punjabi speakers in canada in million in the united kingdom in million in the united states and smaller numbers in other countries
standard punjabi sometimes referred to as majhi in india or simply punjabi is the most widespread and largest dialect of punjabi
it first developed in the th century and gained prominence when sufi poets such as shah hussain bulleh shah among others began to use the lahore amritsar spoken dialect with infused persian vocabulary in their works in the shahmukhi script
later the gurmukhi script was developed based on standard punjabi by the sikh gurus
standard punjabi is spoken by the majority of the people in faisalabad lahore gujranwala sheikhupura kasur sialkot narowal gujrat okara pakpattan sahiwal hafizabad nankana sahib and mandi bahauddin districts of pakistan s punjab province
it also has a large presence in every district in the rest of pakistani punjab and in all large cities in pakistan s other provinces
in india it is spoken in amritsar tarn taran sahib pathankot and gurdaspur districts of the state of punjab and sizable population also in major cities of the states of punjab haryana uttar pradesh delhi and mumbai india
in pakistan the standard punjabi dialect is not referred to as the majhi dialect which may be considered as indian terminology rather simply as standard punjabi
this dialect is widely used in the tv and entertainment industry which is mainly produced in lahore
while a vowel length distinction between short and long vowels exists reflected in modern gurmukhi orthographical conventions it is secondary to the vowel quality contrast between centralised vowels and peripheral vowels i e a o u in terms of phonetic significance
the peripheral vowels have nasal analogues
note for the tonal stops refer to the next section about tone
the three retroflex consonants do not occur initially and the nasals occur only as allophones of n in clusters with velars and palatals
the well established phoneme may be realised allophonically as the voiceless retroflex fricative in learned clusters with retroflexes
the phonemic status of the fricatives f z x varies with familiarity with hindustani norms more so with the gurmukhi script with the pairs f p z d x k and g systematically distinguished in educated speech
the retroflex lateral is most commonly analysed as an approximant as opposed to a flap
unusually for an indo aryan language punjabi distinguishes lexical tones
in many words there is a choice of up to three tones high falling low rising and level neutral
level tone is found in about of words and is described by some as absence of tone
there are also some words which are said to have rising tone in the first syllable and falling in the second
some writers describe this as a fourth tone however a recent acoustic study of six punjabi speakers in the united states found no evidence of a separate falling tone following a medial consonant
m rising falling shoulder it is considered that these tones arose when voiced aspirated consonants gh jh h dh bh lost their aspiration
at the beginning of a word they became voiceless unaspirated consonants k c t p followed by a high falling tone medially or finally they became voiced unaspirated consonants g j d b preceded by a low rising tone
the development of a high falling tone apparently did not take place in every word but only in those which historically had a long vowel
the presence of an h although the h is now silent or very weakly pronounced except word initially word finally and sometimes medially also often causes a rising tone before it for example c h tea
the gurmukhi script which was developed in the th century has separate letters for voiced aspirated sounds so it is thought that the change in pronunciation of the consonants and development of tones may have taken place since that time
some other languages in pakistan have also been found to have tonal distinctions including burushaski gujari hindko kalami shina and torwali
punjabi has a canonical word order of sov subject object verb
it has postpositions rather than prepositions
punjabi distinguishes two genders two numbers and five cases of direct oblique vocative ablative and locative instrumental
the ablative occurs only in the singular in free variation with oblique case plus ablative postposition and the locative instrumental is usually confined to set adverbial expressions
adjectives when declinable are marked for the gender number and case of the nouns they qualify
there is also a t v distinction
upon the inflectional case is built a system of particles known as postpositions which parallel english s prepositions
it is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or case marking then lies
the punjabi verbal system is largely structured around a combination of aspect and tense mood
like the nominal system the punjabi verb takes a single inflectional suffix and is often followed by successive layers of elements like auxiliary verbs and postpositions to the right of the lexical base
being an indo aryan language the core vocabulary of punjabi consists of tadbhav words inherited from sanskrit
it contains many loanwords from persian and arabic
the punjabi language is written in multiple scripts a phenomenon known as synchronic digraphia
each of the major scripts currently in use is typically associated with a particular religious group although the association is not absolute or exclusive
in india punjabi sikhs use gurmukhi a script of the brahmic family which has official status in the state of punjab
in pakistan punjabi muslims use shahmukhi a variant of the perso arabic script and closely related to the urdu alphabet
the punjabi hindus in india had a preference for devanagari another brahmic script also used for hindi and in the first decades since independence raised objections to the uniform adoption of gurmukhi in the state of punjab but most have now switched to gurmukhi and so the use of devanagari is rare
often in literature pakistani punjabi written in shahmukhi is referred as western punjabi or west punjabi and indian punjabi written in gurmukhi is referred as eastern punjabi or east punjabi although the underlying language is the same with a very slight shift in vocabulary towards islamic and sikh words respectively
historically various local brahmic scripts including la and its descendants were also in use
the punjabi braille is used by the visually impaired
