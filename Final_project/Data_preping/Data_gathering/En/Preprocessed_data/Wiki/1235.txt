In Pakistan Punjabi is written using the Shahmukhi alphabet based on the Perso Arabic script in India it is written using the Gurmukhi alphabet based on the Indic scripts Punjabi is unusual among the Indo Aryan languages and the broader Indo European language family in its usage of lexical tone
The word Punjabi sometimes spelled Panjabi has been derived from the word Panj āb Persian for 'Five Waters' referring to the five major eastern tributaries of the Indus River The name of the region was introduced by the Turko Persian conquerors of South Asia and was a translation of the Sanskrit name for the region Panchanada which means 'Land of the Five Rivers'
Panj is cognate with Sanskrit pañca पञ्च Greek pénte πέντε and Lithuanian Penki all of which meaning 'five' āb is cognate with Sanskrit áp अप् and with the Av of Avon The historical Punjab region now divided between India and Pakistan is defined physiographically by the Indus River and these five tributaries One of the five the Beas River is a tributary of another the Sutlej
Punjabi developed from Prakrit languages and later Apabhraṃśa Sanskrit अपभ्रंश 'deviated' or 'non grammatical speech' From BCE Sanskrit was advocated as official language and Prakrit gave birth to many regional languages in different parts of India All these languages are called Prakrit Sanskrit प्राकृत prākṛta collectively Paishachi Prakrit was one of these Prakrit languages which was spoken in north and north western India and Punjabi developed from this Prakrit Later in northern India Paishachi Prakrit gave rise to Paishachi Aparbhsha a descendant of Prakrit Punjabi emerged as an Apabhramsha a degenerated form of Prakrit in the th century CE and became stable by the th century The earliest writings in Punjabi belong to Nath Yogi era from th to th century CE The language of these compositions is morphologically closer to Shauraseni Apbhramsa though vocabulary and rhythm is surcharged with extreme colloquialism and folklore
The Arabic and modern Persian influence in the historical Punjab region began with the late first millennium Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent Many Persian and Arabic words were incorporated in Punjabi So Punjabi relies heavily on Persian and Arabic words which are used with a liberal approach to language Many important words like ਅਰਦਾਸ ਰਹਿਰਾਸ ਨਹਿਰ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਗਜ਼ਲ etc are derived from Persian and Arabic After the fall of the Sikh empire Urdu was made the official language of Punjab in Pakistani Punjab it is still the primary official language and influenced the language as well
In fact the sounds of ਜ਼ ਖ਼ ਸ਼ and ਫ਼ have been borrowed from Persian Later it was lexically influenced by Portuguese words like ਅਲਮਾਰੀالماری Greek words like ਦਾਮدام Chagatai words like ਕ਼ੈੰਚੀ ਸੁਗ਼ਾਤقینچی،سوغات Japanese words like ਰਿਕਸ਼ਾرکشا Chinese words like ਚਾਹ ਲੀਚੀ ਲੁਕਾਠچاہ، لیچی، لکاٹھ and English words like ਜੱਜ ਅਪੀਲ ਮਾਸਟਰجج، اپیل، ماسٹر though these influences have been minor in comparison to Persian and Arabic
Note In more formal contexts hypercorrect Sanskritized versions of these words ਪ੍ਰਧਾਨ pradhān for ਪਰਧਾਨ pardhān and ਪਰਿਵਾਰ parivār for ਪਰਵਾਰ parvār may be used
Punjabi is spoken in many dialects in an area from Delhi to Islamabad The Majhi dialect has been adopted as standard Punjabi in India and Pakistan for education media etc The Majhi dialect originated in the Majha region of the Punjab The Majha region consists of several eastern districts of Pakistani Punjab and in India around Amritsar Gurdaspur Pathankot and Tarn Taran districts The two most important cities in this area are Lahore and Amritsar
In India Punjabi is written in the Gurmukhī script in offices schools and media Gurmukhi is the official standard script for Punjabi though it is often unofficially written in the Latin scripts due to influence from English India's two primary official languages at the Union level
In Pakistan Punjabi is generally written using the Shahmukhī script which in literary standards is identical to the Urdu alphabet however various attempts have been made to create certain distinct characters from a modification of the Persian Nastaʿlīq characters to represent Punjabi phonology not already found in the Urdu alphabet In Pakistan Punjabi loans technical words from Persian and Arabic languages just like Urdu does
Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan the eleventh most widely spoken in India and also present in the Punjabi diaspora in various countries
Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan being the native language of million people or approximately of the country's population
Beginning with the census speakers of Saraiki and Hindko were no longer included in the total numbers for Punjabi which explains the apparent decrease
Punjabi is the official language of the Indian state of Punjab and has the status of an additional official language in Haryana and Delhi Some of its major urban centres in northern India are Amritsar Ludhiana Chandigarh Jalandhar Ambala Patiala Bathinda Hoshiarpur and Delhi
In the census of India million reported their language as Punjabi The census publications group this with speakers of related mother tongues like Bagri and Bhateali to arrive at the figure of million
Punjabi is also spoken as a minority language in several other countries where Punjabi people have emigrated in large numbers such as the United States Australia the United Kingdom and Canada
There were million native Punjabi speakers in Canada in million in the United Kingdom in million in the United States and smaller numbers in other countries
Standard Punjabi sometimes referred to as Majhi in India or simply Punjabi is the most widespread and largest dialect of Punjabi It first developed in the th century and gained prominence when Sufi poets such as Shah Hussain Bulleh Shah among others began to use the LahoreAmritsar spoken dialect with infused Persian vocabulary in their works in the Shahmukhi script Later the Gurmukhi script was developed based on Standard Punjabi by the Sikh Gurus
Standard Punjabi is spoken by the majority of the people in Faisalabad Lahore Gujranwala Sheikhupura Kasur Sialkot Narowal Gujrat Okara Pakpattan Sahiwal Hafizabad Nankana Sahib and Mandi Bahauddin districts of Pakistan's Punjab Province It also has a large presence in every district in the rest of Pakistani Punjab and in all large cities in Pakistan's other provinces
In India it is spoken in Amritsar Tarn Taran Sahib Pathankot and Gurdaspur Districts of the State of Punjab and sizable population also in major cities of the States of Punjab Haryana Uttar Pradesh Delhi and Mumbai India
In Pakistan the Standard Punjabi dialect is not referred to as the 'Majhi dialect' which may be considered as 'Indian terminology' rather simply as 'Standard Punjabi' This dialect is widely used in the TV and entertainment industry which is mainly produced in Lahore
While a vowel length distinction between short and long vowels exists reflected in modern Gurmukhi orthographical conventions it is secondary to the vowel quality contrast between centralised vowels ɪ ə ʊ and peripheral vowels iː eː ɛː aː ɔː oː uː in terms of phonetic significance
Note for the tonal stops refer to the next section about Tone
The three retroflex consonants ɳ ɽ ɭ do not occur initially and the nasals ŋ ɲ occur only as allophones of n in clusters with velars and palatals The well established phoneme ʃ may be realised allophonically as the voiceless retroflex fricative ʂ in learned clusters with retroflexes The phonemic status of the fricatives f z x ɣ varies with familiarity with Hindustani norms more so with the Gurmukhi script with the pairs f pʰ z dʒ x kʰ and ɣ g systematically distinguished in educated speech The retroflex lateral is most commonly analysed as an approximant as opposed to a flap
Unusually for an Indo Aryan language Punjabi distinguishes lexical tones In many words there is a choice of up to three tones high falling low rising and level neutral
Level tone is found in about of words and is described by some as absence of tone There are also some words which are said to have rising tone in the first syllable and falling in the second Some writers describe this as a fourth tone However a recent acoustic study of six Punjabi speakers in the United States found no evidence of a separate falling tone following a medial consonant
ਮੋਢਾ موڈھا móḍà rising falling shoulderIt is considered that these tones arose when voiced aspirated consonants gh jh ḍh dh bh lost their aspiration At the beginning of a word they became voiceless unaspirated consonants k c ṭ t p followed by a high falling tone medially or finally they became voiced unaspirated consonants g j ḍ d b preceded by a low rising tone The development of a high falling tone apparently did not take place in every word but only in those which historically had a long vowel
The presence of an h although the h is now silent or very weakly pronounced except word initially word finally and sometimes medially also often causes a rising tone before it for example cáh tea
The Gurmukhi script which was developed in the th century has separate letters for voiced aspirated sounds so it is thought that the change in pronunciation of the consonants and development of tones may have taken place since that time
Some other languages in Pakistan have also been found to have tonal distinctions including Burushaski Gujari Hindko Kalami Shina and Torwali
Punjabi has a canonical word order of SOV subject object verb It has postpositions rather than prepositions
Punjabi distinguishes two genders two numbers and five cases of direct oblique vocative ablative and locativeinstrumental The ablative occurs only in the singular in free variation with oblique case plus ablative postposition and the locativeinstrumental is usually confined to set adverbial expressions
Adjectives when declinable are marked for the gender number and case of the nouns they qualify There is also a T V distinction
Upon the inflectional case is built a system of particles known as postpositions which parallel English's prepositions It is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or case marking then lies
The Punjabi verbal system is largely structured around a combination of aspect and tensemood Like the nominal system the Punjabi verb takes a single inflectional suffix and is often followed by successive layers of elements like auxiliary verbs and postpositions to the right of the lexical base
Being an Indo Aryan language the core vocabulary of Punjabi consists of tadbhav words inherited from Sanskrit It contains many loanwords from Persian and Arabic
The Punjabi language is written in multiple scripts a phenomenon known as synchronic digraphia Each of the major scripts currently in use is typically associated with a particular religious group although the association is not absolute or exclusive
In India Punjabi Sikhs use Gurmukhi a script of the Brahmic family which has official status in the state of Punjab In Pakistan Punjabi Muslims use Shahmukhi a variant of the Perso Arabic script and closely related to the Urdu alphabet The Punjabi Hindus in India had a preference for Devanagari another Brahmic script also used for Hindi and in the first decades since independence raised objections to the uniform adoption of Gurmukhi in the state of Punjab but most have now switched to Gurmukhi and so the use of Devanagari is rare Often in literature Pakistani Punjabi written in Shahmukhi is referred as Western Punjabi or West Punjabi and Indian Punjabi written in Gurmukhi is referred as Eastern Punjabi or East Punjabi although the underlying language is the same with a very slight shift in vocabulary towards Islamic and Sikh words respectively
Historically various local Brahmic scripts including Laṇḍā and its descendants were also in use
The Punjabi Braille is used by the visually impaired

The Sikh religion originated in the th century in the Punjab region and Punjabi is the predominant language spoken by Sikhs Most portions of the Guru Granth Sahib use the Punjabi language written in Gurmukhi though Punjabi is not the only language used in Sikh scripturesThe Janamsakhis stories on the life and legend of Guru Nanak are early examples of Punjabi prose literature

Despite Punjabi's rich literary history it was not until that it would be recognised as an official language Previous governments in the area of the Punjab had favoured Persian Hindustani or even earlier standardised versions of local registers as the language of the court or government After the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British East India Company following the Second Anglo Sikh War in the British policy of establishing a uniform language for administration was expanded into the Punjab The British Empire employed Urdu in its administration of North Central and Northwestern India while in the North East of India Bengali language was used as the language of administration Despite its lack of official sanction the Punjabi language continued to flourish as an instrument of cultural production with rich literary traditions continuing until modern times The Sikh religion with its Gurmukhi script played a special role in standardising and providing education in the language via Gurdwaras while writers of all religions continued to produce poetry prose and literature in the language
In India Punjabi is one of the scheduled languages of India It is the first official language of the Indian State of Punjab Punjabi also has second language official status in Delhi along with Urdu and in Haryana
In Pakistan no regional ethnic language has been granted official status at the national level and as such Punjabi is not an official language at the national level even though it is the most spoken language in Pakistan It is however the official provincial language of Punjab Pakistan the second largest and the most populous province of Pakistan as well as in Islamabad Capital Territory The only two official languages in Pakistan are Urdu and English
When Pakistan was created in despite Punjabi being the majority language in West Pakistan and Bengali the majority in East Pakistan and Pakistan as whole English and Urdu were chosen as the national languages The selection of Urdu was due to its association with South Asian Muslim nationalism and because the leaders of the new nation wanted a unifying national language instead of promoting one ethnic group's language over another Broadcasting in Punjabi language by Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation decreased on TV and radio after Article of the Constitution of Pakistan declares that these two languages would be the only official languages at the national level while provincial governments would be allowed to make provisions for the use of other languages However in the s the constitution was amended to include the Bengali language Eventually Punjabi was granted status as a provincial language in Punjab Province while the Sindhi language was given official status in after Language violence in Sindh
Despite gaining official recognition at the provincial level Punjabi is not a language of instruction for primary or secondary school students in Punjab Province unlike Sindhi and Pashto in other provinces Pupils in secondary schools can choose the language as an elective while Punjabi instruction or study remains rare in higher education One notable example is the teaching of Punjabi language and literature by the University of the Punjab in Lahore which began in with the establishment of its Punjabi Department
In the cultural sphere there are many books plays and songs being written or produced in the Punjabi language in Pakistan Until the s there were a large number of Punjabi language films being produced by the Lollywood film industry however since then Urdu has become a much more dominant language in film production Additionally television channels in Punjab Province centred on the Lahore area are broadcast in Urdu The preeminence of Urdu in both broadcasting and the Lollywood film industry is seen by critics as being detrimental to the health of the language
The use of Urdu and English as the near exclusive languages of broadcasting the public sector and formal education have led some to fear that Punjabi in Pakistan is being relegated to a low status language and that it is being denied an environment where it can flourish Several prominent educational leaders researchers and social commentators have echoed the opinion that the intentional promotion of Urdu and the continued denial of any official sanction or recognition of the Punjabi language amounts to a process of Urdu isation that is detrimental to the health of the Punjabi language In August the Pakistan Academy of Letters International Writer's Council IWC and World Punjabi Congress WPC organised the Khawaja Farid Conference and demanded that a Punjabi language university should be established in Lahore and that Punjabi language should be declared as the medium of instruction at the primary level In September a case was filed in Supreme Court of Pakistan against Government of Punjab Pakistan as it did not take any step to implement the Punjabi language in the province Additionally several thousand Punjabis gather in Lahore every year on International Mother Language Day Thinktanks political organisations cultural projects and individuals also demand authorities at the national and provincial level to promote the use of the language in the public and official spheres
At the federal level Punjabi has official status via the Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution earned after the Punjabi Suba movement of the s At the state level Punjabi is the sole official language of the state of Punjab while it has secondary official status in the states of Haryana and Delhi In it was also made additional official language of West Bengal in areas where the population exceeds of a particular block sub division or district
Both union and state laws specify the use of Punjabi in the field of education The state of Punjab uses the Three Language Formula and Punjabi is required to be either the medium of instruction or one of the three languages learnt in all schools in Punjab Punjabi is also a compulsory language in Haryana and other states with a significant Punjabi speaking minority are required to offer Punjabi medium education
There are vibrant Punjabi language movie and news industries in India however Punjabi serials have had a much smaller presence within the last few decades in television due to market forces Despite Punjabi having far greater official recognition in India where the Punjabi language is officially admitted in all necessary social functions while in Pakistan it is used only in a few radio and TV programs attitudes of the English educated elite towards the language are ambivalent as they are in neighbouring Pakistan There are also claims of state apathy towards the language in non Punjabi majority areas like Haryana and Delhi
