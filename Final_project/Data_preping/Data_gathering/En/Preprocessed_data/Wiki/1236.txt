the old court house is a grade ii listed house located off hampton court green in the london borough of richmond upon thames its origins date back to
the architect sir christopher wren who lived there from to was given a year lease on the property by queen anne in lieu of overdue payments for his work on st paul s cathedral
the lease passed from wren s son to his grandson
it was purchased from the crown estate in
king henry viii obtained the newly built hampton court palace from cardinal wolsey in
from that time onwards all the property around hampton court also became the property of the monarch and this included the old court house
it is the only house on hampton court green other than hampton court itself to have a garden that stretches to the river thames
wren s dining room is now used as a study
this beautifully proportioned room features wood panelling chosen by wren and a fine marble fireplace similar to the one he installed for king william iii in the king s dining room in hampton court palace
beyond the reception hall a flight of stone steps take you into the garden which leads right down to the thames
in wren s day his most important visitors normally royalty would arrive by river walk across the garden and up those steps to enter his house via the back door
this meant the garden had to be just as magnificent as the house
the building is accordingly surrounded by several different types of tree and copious bushes bursting with figs walnuts apples crab apples cherries raspberries mint and borage
the greenery extends all the way to the river bank while york stone terraces lead to a pea shingle path which is flanked by lawn
this path then leads to a pond and fountain that was built by wren and which was listed before the old court house itself
wren s tool house is now a charming garden room from which to enjoy the garden in the summer
king henry viii took the newly built hampton court palace from cardinal wolsey in
all the property around hampton court then belonged to the monarch
in wren was appointed as the royal surveyor by king charles ii
previously inigo jones and sir john denham held this post
the king had been impressed by wren s plans to reconstruct the city of london after the great fire of
the royal surveyor or surveyor general was like a modern minister of works
he ordered the king s works at all of the palaces hampton court greenwich st james palace and windsor castle
wren held this post for years until straddling reigns charles ii james ii william iii and mary ii and anne and george i while at the same time building many city churches including st paul s cathedral
at each royal palace the surveyor general had lodgings
these at hampton court became the old court house built in
wren s biggest task at hampton court was the construction of the eastern part of hampton court palace the square part including the main east and south fronts and fountain court
william and mary had wanted to rebuild hampton court palace entirely but with the early death of mary in king william lost heart
the project was only half done
hampton court was left as it remains today half tudor and half wren
wren already aged was granted in a year lease of the old court house by queen anne
this was partly in lieu of arrears of salary for building st pauls cathedral
he had been paid on a time basis
the authorities thought that to be paid more he had dragged his feet
in an act of parliament in the ninth year of the reign of king william for the completing and adorning of the cathedral church of st paul london a clause was inserted to suspend a moiety i e
half of the surveyor s salary until the said church should be finished thereby the better to encourage to him to finish the same with the utmost diligence and expedition
it was at this time a common notion and misreport that the surveyor received a large annual salary for that building and consequently it was in his interest to prolong the finishing of the fabrick for the continuance of this supposed emolument
which it would seem occasioned that clause
upon the compleating of this great fabric st paul s cathedral in a clause passed in the act of parliament in the ninth year of the reign of queen anne declaring the church finished to empower the commissioners to pay the surveyor the arrears of this moiety of his salary
