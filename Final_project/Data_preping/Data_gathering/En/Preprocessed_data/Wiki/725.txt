Faculty of 1000 (abbreviated F1000) is a publisher of services for life scientists and clinical researchers
It was acquired by Taylor & Francis Group in January 2020.
Faculty Opinions (previously F1000Prime) publishes recommendations of articles in biology and medicine from a "faculty" of around 6,000 scientists and clinical researchers and 5,000 more junior "associate" faculty
The service covers 32 disciplines and around 3,700 journals
It previously existed as two sister sites, F1000 Biology, launched in 2002, and F1000 Medicine, launched in 2006
In 2010, these services were combined as F1000.com
The service obtained its current name in 2012
When faculty members recommend an article, they rate it as "good"
The individual scores are used to calculate a total score for each article, which is used to rank articles in each discipline
This score is an article-level metric, or altmetric, and is a potential indicator of the scientific impact of individual papers.
F1000Research is an open access, open peer review, scientific publishing platform covering the life sciences
Articles are published first and peer reviewed after publication by invited referees
The peer reviewer's names and comments are visible on the site
As part of its open science model, the data behind each article are also published and are downloadable
F1000Research publishes multiple article types including traditional research articles, single findings, case reports, protocols, replications, and null or negative results
The journal was criticized for unclear peer-review standards, and for its inclusion in PubMed
A journal representative later commented on the criteria for indexing articles in the PubMed and PubMed Central databases
F1000Research also publishes posters and slide presentations in biology and medicine.
In October 2014, managing director Rebecca Lawrence took part in a Reddit Science AMA (Ask Me Anything) as part of Open Access Week, to answer questions about the F1000Research publication format and about open science in general.
Sciwheel, formerly F1000Workspace, is a suite of tools to help scientists with writing, collaborating, reference management and preparation for publishing scientific papers
The service was launched in May 2015.
F1000 Specialists is an affiliate program aimed at experienced users and advocates of F1000 services
F1000 Specialists receive in-kind rewards in exchange for being a local representative and contact for one or more F1000 services at their organization.
Faculty of 1000 was founded in 2000 by publishing entrepreneur Vitek Tracz
The company was part of the Science Navigation Group until its acquisition by Taylor & Francis in January 2020.
In July 2017, F1000 launched Open Research Central, a "central portal for open research publishing"
The model has been running on F1000Research since 2013 and current partners include the Wellcome Trust's "Wellcome Open Research", Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's "Gates Open Research", and University College London's "UCL Child Health Open Research".
