Anarchism in Vietnam as a political movement started in the early twentieth century as Vietnamese radicals became exposed to strands of anarchism in Japan China and France Its most recognizable proponents were Phan Bội Châu and Nguyễn An Ninh
The spread of anarchism through Vietnam was responsible for an increase in violence against the colonial authorities inspired by the principle of propaganda of the deed but it also brought humanism to revolutionary circles of its time The Vietnamese anarchist movement reached its apex during the s but it soon began to lose its influence with the introduction of Marxism Leninism and the beginning of the Vietnamese communist movement
The roots of the Vietnamese anarchist movement lay in the early resistance to French colonial rule organized among various secret societies Among these were the Heaven and Earth Society which in had assassinated a colonial collaborator in Saigon Other attacks against the French colonial authorities included the Cần Vương movement which attempted to overthrow the French during the late s the Hanoi Poison Plot in which indigenous Vietnamese troops attempted to assassinate the entire French garrison in the Citadel of Hanoi as well as subsequent anti colonial uprisings in Cochinchina and Tonkin
Official French colonial publications implied that these Vietnamese secret societies and religious sects could be easily coopted by revolutionaries due to their status as indigenous methods of organizing echoing Mikhail Bakunin's claim that social bandits were instinctive revolutionaries
Anarchism was first introduced to the Vietnamese anti colonial movement during the s by the early nationalist leader Phan Bội Châu In January Phan moved to Japan where he was exposed to a variety of new political ideas being propagated among Chinese expatriates including the constitutionalism of Liang Qichao the republicanism of the Tongmenghui and the anarchism of the Tokyo group Initially a utilitarian Phan began to rapidly move through a variety of political ideologies and made acquaintance with a number of politically diverse groups and individuals in Japan In Phan founded the Constitutionalist Association Vietnamese Cong Hien Hoi an organization of Vietnamese expatriate students which advocated for constitutional monarchy but by it was forcibly disbanded by the Japanese authorities at the request of the French That same year Phan joined the Asian Friendship Association an organization founded by the exiled Chinese republicans and anarchists as well as Japanese socialists The Association was largely directed by Liu Shipei a prominent member of the Tokyo anarchist group and editor of its newspaper Natural Justice and included many other Chinese anarchists such as Chang Chi who was a close friend of Phan's
But by Phan Bội Châu was ordered to leave Japan and spent the subsequent years drifting around East Asia After the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the revolution Phan was invited to the newly established Republic of China by his old Chinese republican friends from Japan Zhang Binglin and Chen Qimei In January Phan arrived in China and settled in Guangdong now under the governorship of his friend Hu Hanmin who was actively providing a place of refuge for Vietnamese exiles Here with the financial aid of the Guangzhou anarchist Liu Shifu Phan formed a new republican and nationalist organization called the Vietnamese Restoration League Vietnamese Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội modeled after Sun Yat Sen's Tongmenghui and drawing its name from Zhang Binglin's Restoration Society Shifu also encouraged Phan to establish the Association for the Revitalization of China an organization dedicated to soliciting Chinese support for the independence movements in colonized Asian countries including Indochina India Burma and Korea Upon moving to Shanghai Phan joined the Worldwide League for Humanity a clandestine anarchist organization which went unrecognized by the new Beiyang government due to its extreme left program
As more Vietnamese expatriates joined up with internationalist organizations in China they increasingly came into contact with anarchist individuals and groups Phan Bội Châu himself who had developed ties with the Tokyo strand of Chinese anarchism led by Zhang Binglin and Liu Shipei was inspired by their traditionalist approach to anarchism and socialism Phan was particularly inspired by the anarchist positions on anti imperialism and direct action leading him to defend the violent overthrow of the French colonial authorities even to the chagrin of his republican allies like Hu Hanmin and Chen Qimei Developing on propaganda of the deed Phan admired past assassination attempts against state officials and encouraged the targeting of French colonial officials leading to a series of bombings in Hanoi which brought both increased publicity and reprisals against the Restoration League Several of the League's activists were executed internationalist organizations in China began to disintegrate and Phan himself was arrested and imprisoned by the Beiyang government While Phan was in prison Liu Shipei died of tuberculosis in Chen Qimei was assassinated in and Zhang Binglin abandoned anarchism and gave up on political pursuits leaving Phan politically isolated by the time of his release in February After briefly coming under the influence of a collaborationist advocate Phan turned his interests towards socialism inspired by the socialist currents of the Russian and Chinese revolutions
Following the end of World War I many more Vietnamese radicals went into exile looking for knowledge that was being suppressed in French Indochina People from Annam and Tonkin largely went to China or Japan where they were exposed to social anarchist tendencies whilst those from Cochinchina went to France where they became influenced by French strands of individualist anarchism While Vietnamese expatriates that took up the Chinese strand of anarchism tended to employ aspects of traditionalism expatriates inspired by French anarchism employed a more radical youth oriented and forward looking philosophy
This diversity of opinion within the nascent Vietnamese anarchist movement was reflected upon the exiles' return to Vietnam Political opposition was harshly repressed in the northern colonies of Annam and Tonkin the anti colonial movement turned to illegal activism and violent actions against colonial authorities This combined with the social anarchism brought back from abroad laid the groundwork for the formation of political organizations But in the southern colony of Cochinchina freedom of the press existed allowing Vietnamese radicals to participate in open political discourse which defused political tensions Upon his return from France the individualist anarchist Nguyễn An Ninh found a place in radical journalism publishing political tracts in his journal La Cloche Fêlée which encouraged the synthesis of the social struggle for individual liberties with the national struggle for Vietnamese independence Ninh called for the youth of Vietnam to reinvent itself and take control of its own destiny becoming incredibly popular amongst his peers as his rhetorical tone marked a stark contrast to the tendency towards moderation and compromise Ninh critiqued the Confucian family values of parental authority and gender inequality as well as traditional morality encouraging people to break with the past and free themselves from tyranny of all kinds and create a genuinely new culture He also attacked the bureaucratism of the colonial state the native Vietnamese bourgeoisie and traditional Confucian society Ninh explicitly expounded his anarchist views in his article Order and Anarchy quoting such authors as Rabindranath Tagore and Leo Tolstoy Ninh's anti authoritarianism also extended into his personal life as he got himself into a number of conflicts with colonial officials In addition while Ninh admired the Soviet Union he positioned himself firmly against a Bolshevik style revolution due to its human cost preferring the route of individuals directly undermining social inequalities rather than partaking in revolutionary violence However as time passed Ninh increasingly saw revolution as inevitable and began to agitate for organized resistance to achieve social justice
By this time Phan Bội Châu's political influence was largely marginalized and his followers in the Restoration League began to leave him behind Despite attempts to keep the League alive its prominent members started to criticize it for its elitism and called for Vietnamese revolutionaries to immerse themselves among the common people In the Society of Like Hearts Vietnamese Tam Tam Xa emerged from these critical anarchist currents of the revolutionary movement inspired in particular by the works of Liu Shifu and attempted to unite disparate Vietnamese anti colonial activists around collective decision making The Society also employed the use of direct action to destabilize the colonial administration with Phạm Hồng Thái launching an assassination attempt against Governor General Martial Henri Merlin Although the attempt itself failed it reinvigorated the Vietnamese anti colonial movement and Thái became known as a revolutionary martyr In response Phan Bội Châu attempted to open a military academy to train Vietnamese revolutionaries meeting with the anarchist elder Cai Yuanpei and agents of the Communist International to discuss this project but it ultimately did not materialize With the Restoration League failing to reform itself along the lines of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the Society of Hearts unable to successfully follow the assassination attempt both organizations began to decline into irrelevance Following a reorganization in the Phuc Viet party attempted to mobilize public opinion towards anti colonialism with Ton Quang Phiet writing the article Southern Wind highlighting the need for organization However none of these anarchist organizations had presented a clear vision of a future society and had not developed a solid analysis of the present society thus were left without a strong ideological foundation to unite behind In French agents seized Phan Bội Châu in Shanghai He was convicted of treason and spent the rest of his life under house arrest in Huế On March Nguyễn An Ninh was also arrested and only days later Phan Chu Trinh died causing mass protests against the government in April It was in this atmosphere that a young Marxist called Nguyễn Ái Quốc emerged onto the scene having links to both strands of Vietnamese anarchism and taking on a role as a fierce critic of radicalism
The first instance of the word revolution being introduced to Vietnam was through the writings of Liang Qichao in the midst of the New Culture Movement Qichao advocated for a widespread cultural revolution rather than a violent political revolution The definition of revolution that was adopted in Vietnam meant changing the Mandate of Heaven Vietnamese cách mạng which was interpreted in many different ways One of the first such revolutionary tracts was Nguyễn Thượng Hiền's On Revolution published on January in which he called for a peaceful boycott movement inspired by the Swadeshi movement organized by Mohandas K Gandhi but in which he also failed to define the means nor the ends of a revolution in Vietnam The restriction of the distribution of French language literature such as documents of the Enlightenment or Marxism meant that only French educated urban elements were exposed to them which reinforced the elitist tendencies that pervaded Vietnamese radicalism and ensured the continuation of the idea that the revolution was a top down affair organized by intellectuals rather than a mass uprising
Revolutionary socialist ideas began to work their way into Vietnam through the writings of Vladimir Lenin which advocated for a tightly organized opposition movement guided by educated Marxist intellectuals Although socialism and anarchism had previously been expounded as one and the same Vietnamese revolutionaries now found themselves forced to choose between the two tendencies which were becoming more antagonistic towards each other The rise of communism in China and France provided considerably more exposure to pro Bolshevik currents which combined with the fallout from the suppression of the Kronstadt Rebellion increased hostility towards anarchist ideas
Nguyễn Ái Quốc solicited aid from the Communist International for support in the Vietnamese anti colonial struggle but himself was skeptical of forming an openly communist movement in the country due to what he saw as a political naiveté among Vietnamese radicals He particularly criticized Nguyễn Thượng Hiền's work insisting on a particular need to reject reformism and evolutionary change in favor of a political revolution and further critiqued the use of non violent boycott movements In early Quốc established the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League to organize young Vietnamese people towards collective action Anarchism as championed by Nguyễn An Ninh still presented a significant challenge to Quốc's nascent communist movement as it appealed to the same young people that the communists were trying to recruit Quốc himself presented a fierce criticism of the anarchist movement
Quốc also critiqued the anarcho communism proposed by Peter Kropotkin taking the Orthodox Marxist line that the state could only wither away after wealth was redistributed and the people reeducated Although he admired the ideal of creating a post revolutionary society without laws he concluded that anarchist theories would only serve to sow disorder in society particularly attempting to refute the anarchist critique of political parties which presented the greatest challenge to his own ambitions
Despite these challenges from the emerging communist movement Nguyễn An Ninh set about building a revolutionary populist movement to advance the anarchist cause establishing the Nguyen An Ninh Secret Society Ninh's envisaged a revolutionary vanguard in contrast to the political party system advanced by Leninism instead advocating for it to be a loose movement that resulted from the moral and intellectual transformation of individuals He sharply criticized the authoritarianism of political parties that sought power while also growing more hostile to the bourgeoisie Instead of party politics he saw the path to an anti authoritarian liberation movement lay in anarchist populism embracing the concept of revolutionary spontaneity Ninh also followed the Bakuninist school of thought regarding the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat a class that was largely neglected by Orthodox Marxists and sought to organise the Vietnamese underclasses Ninh's revolutionary populism began to rapidly spread through Hóc Môn his home district of Saigon Following Ninh's release from prison he began to actively agitate among workers and peasants in and around Saigon travelling from place to place by bicycle with the aid of local monks and peasants By March the existence of Ninh's Secret Society was discovered by the Sûreté known publicly as the Aspirations of Youth Party The Society recruited people into its mutual friendship and mutual aid associations while also according to the Sûreté establishing militia structures organized by local villages Although the organizational structure of the Secret Society was very loose knit Ninh's associates managed to recruit up to members from the workers and peasants of Saigon Ninh eventually proposed that the Society merge with a number of revolutionary political parties The Revolutionary Party of New Vietnam turned down the proposal preferring to retain a small and ideologically homogenous membership despite the potential offered by the Society's much larger size The Nationalist Party of Vietnam also rejected this proposal as it was turned off by the extremism of Ninh's anarcho populist politics
On September Nguyễn An Ninh and his associate Phan Văn Hùm were arrested after an altercation with the police and given prison sentences The Sûreté subsequently exposed Ninh's Secret Society and detained of his followers with standing trial over the following year While Ninh was in prison some activists managed to keep the Society going but when a series of uprisings strikes and demonstrations broke out in many of Ninh's followers were led to the newly established Indochinese Communist Party
Upon his release from prison in October Nguyễn An Ninh returned to his organizing work in the countryside Ninh served as a unifying non partisan presence for anti colonial elements to join together in a united front and legally oppose the government in the Saigon municipal elections of uniting members of the Communist Party with nationalists Trotskyists and anarchists They rallied support through the publication of the newspaper La Lutte and succeeded in electing two members of the alliance to the Saigon city council In October Ninh revived the La Lutte collaboration to run various campaigns and participate in elections focused squarely on the plight of the urban poor the workers and peasant labourers
In the Cochinchinese parliamentary election of March the La Lutte group received of the vote although they failed to win a seat There was also a La Lutte candidacy that ran in the May Saigon municipal election in which four members of the alliance were elected but three were invalidated due to their communist sympathies The alliance also went on to organize a number of strikes in the subsequent years
However the united front was soon brought to an end in when the newly elected Popular Front government failed to deliver on its promises of colonial reform The Trotskyists led by Tạ Thu Thâu who took an oppositionist stance towards the new French government soon became the dominant tendency within La Lutte leading the Communist Party to split off from the alliance in launching their own newspaper and publishing attacks against the Trotskyists In the Cochinchinese parliamentary election the Trotskyists of La Lutte and the Communist Party ran on different lists The Trotskyist Workers' and Peasants' Slate were victorious electing three candidates with around of the vote whereas the Communist backed Democratic Front which included Nguyễn An Ninh himself was defeated with only of the vote
Following the signing of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact and the outbreak of World War II the amicable relations between France and the Soviet Union were severed leading France to undertake a repression of any seditious factions in Vietnam sentencing Nguyễn An Ninh to years in Côn Đảo Prison During the war Phan Bội Châu and Nguyễn An Ninh both died in captivity bringing a definitive end to the leadership of the Vietnamese anarchist movement
With the defeat and dissolution of the French Third Republic in the Battle of France and the subsequent Japanese invasion of French Indochina created an opportunity for Vietnamese anti colonial activists to begin making preparations for independence On May Hồ Chí Minh established the League for the Independence of Vietnam Viet Minh an anti imperialist coalition brought together to oppose both French colonialism and the Japanese occupation Following the liberation of Paris by Allied forces in March the Empire of Japan launched a coup d'état in Indochina establishing the Empire of Vietnam as a puppet state The new government led by Trần Trọng Kim oversaw widespread reforms including the expansion of education territorial reunification the encouragement of mass political participation and the even release of political prisoners many of whom went over to the Viet Minh and began to actively agitate for the fall of the Empire In August due to the resignation of the Vietnamese government and the subsequent surrender of Japan the Imperial regime in Vietnam fell apart and the Emperor Bảo Đại officially abdicated
The Viet Minh responded by launching the August Revolution seizing control of most of the country and proclaimed the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September However within a month the French Republic reasserted colonial rule over Vietnam triggering a mass anti colonial uprising in Saigon on September Led by the International Communist League ICL the city's populace armed themselves and organized workers' councils which they declared to be independent from any political parties But by October the workers' militias were defeated by the returning French colonial army Forced into a retreat into the countryside after surviving a massacre by British and French colonial troops members of the ICL including Phan Văn Hùm and Tạ Thu Thâu were hunted down and exectued by the Viet Minh After the First Indochina War Vietnam was partitioned between the communist held North and the anti communist South
Some of those who survived escaped to France one of whom was Ngo Van who met a number of Spanish anarchists and Poumistas that were also in exile in Paris The encounters with the Spanish anarchist exiles and the stories of their experiences during the Spanish Civil War which Van noted parallels with the Vietnamese experience led him to permanently distance himself from Bolshevism criticizing communist parties as seeking to form the nucleus of a new ruling class and bring about nothing more than a new system of exploitation Van found a political home with the International Workers' Association IWA which supported his criticisms of the Vietnamese Trotskyist exiles that remained supportive of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam He also joined a Libertarian Marxist group around Maximilien Rubel and was introduced to the works of Friedrich Nietzsche who had previously inspired the individualist anarchist philosophy of Nguyễn An Ninh Van would later go on to participate in a factory occupation during the events of May He retired a few years after the Fall of Saigon and the reunification of Vietnam and was finally able to return to his home country in where he noted that Vietnamese workers still do not enjoy collective ownership of the means of production nor have time for reflection nor the possibility of making their own decisions nor means of expression
In March the anarchist clowder Mèo Mun was established becoming the first specifically Vietnamese anarchist organization to operate since the s They have criticized the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam and what they perceive as a regime of state capitalism in the country as well as a persistent environment of homophobia responding by giving critical support to openly gay Lương Thế Huy in the time of the Vietnamese legislative election However they have clarified that their critical support does not imply a belief in the electoral system or in reforming the state and is rather specific to the socio political context of Vietnam with them calling it a fight for partial freedom
