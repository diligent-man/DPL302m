iaijutsu is a combative quick draw sword technique
this art of drawing the japanese sword katana is one of the japanese kory martial art disciplines in the education of the classical warrior bushi
iaijutsu is a combative sword drawing art but not necessarily an aggressive art because iaijutsu is also a counterattack oriented art
iaijutsu technique may be used aggressively to wage a premeditated surprise attack against an unsuspecting enemy
the formulation of iaijutsu as a component system of classical bujutsu was made less for the dynamic situations of the battlefield than for the relatively static applications of the warrior s daily life off the field of battle
historically it is unclear when the term iaijutsu originated
it is also unclear when techniques to draw katana from the scabbard were first practiced as a dedicated form of exercise
the japanese sword has existed since the nara period where techniques to draw the sword have been practiced under other names than iaijutsu
the term iaijutsu was first verified in connection with iizasa ch isai ienao c

archaeological excavations dated the oldest sword in japan from at least as early as second century b c
the kojiki record of ancient matters and the nihon shoki history of japan ancient texts on early japanese history and myth that were compiled in the eighth century a d describe iron swords and swordsmanship that pre date recorded history attributed to the mythological age of the gods kami
the development of japanese swordsmanship as a component system of classical bujutsu created by and for professional warriors bushi begins only with the invention and widespread use of the japanese sword the curved single cutting edged long sword
in its curved form the sword is known to the japanese as tachi in the eighth century
it evolved from and gained ascendancy over its straight bladed prototype because years of battlefield experience proved that the curved form of sword was better suited to the needs of the bushi than the straight bladed kind
around the curved long sword the bushi built a mystique of fantastic dimensions one that still influences japanese culture today
the nature of the bushi s combative deployment mounted as he was on horseback required the classical warrior to reach out for his enemy who might either be similarly mounted or otherwise ground deployed
during the kamakura period the japanese sword smiths achieved the highest level of technical excellence and because the war between two influential families the minamoto and the taira made it possible to test and evaluate swords under the severest of conditions
by the end of the kamakura period the tachi was superseded by a shorter weapon in a new form called katana
it was with the general widespread use of the curved sword mounted and worn as a katana that classical japanese swordsmanship for infantry applications really begins
the earliest reliable documentation to prove that the bushi practiced swordsmanship in a systematic manner is dated in the th century
in this connection it is believed that kenjutsu which deals with the art of swordsmanship as it is performed with an unsheathed sword is the preceding form of iaijutsu
iaijutsu is extant today but there also exists a modern times form for drawing the japanese sword called iaido which started its appearance as a term in
according to donn f
draeger iaijutsu is a combative art and therefore the warrior considered only two starting positions in the execution of a sword drawing technique
the first technique is the low crouching posture named iai goshi
the second is the standing posture named tachi ai two other postures are not used in iaijutsu because they possessed technical issues that would place their users at a disadvantage
the seated posture tate hiza does not permit all around mobility
seiza the formal kneeling sitting posture is a dead posture which is regarded by the warrior as less combatively efficient it would be difficult for the swordsman using either of these two postures to go quickly into action in an emergency
