The second partition of Poland in had resulted in a sharp increase in the number of Jews in Russia so that in Empress Catherine the Great decreed that the majority of them would henceforth be restricted to living and working in the Pale of Settlement The Jews were not allowed to leave the Pale or own land outside it They were removed from their homes and villages and once resettled barred from all but a handful of professions The crowded conditions and legal barriers to self sufficiency led to deepening poverty for the Pale's four million inhabitants After the reforms of Tsar Alexander II in the s the situation improved for some Jews but those in the Pale remained trapped by economic hardship and dismal conditions In Samuel Polyakov Horace de Gunzburg and Nikolai Bakst petitioned Tsar Alexander II for permission to start an assistance fund which would improve the lives of the millions of Russian Jews then living in poverty The fund would provide education and training in practical occupations like handicrafts and agricultural skills and would help people to help themselves
Permission was granted and the appeal was sent out signed by Poliakov and de Gunzburg as well as Abram Zak Leon Rosenthal and Meer Fridland leading to the establishment of the Society for Trades and Agricultural Labor among the Jews in Russia In its first years ORT raised educational standards and provided training to Jews across the Russian Empire People trained as artisans in glass blowing learned sewing and gardening trained as mechanics cabinetmakers and furniture designers
The first programs created by ORT were dictated by the demands of the market In the industrialization in Russia created a need for artisans so ORT developed courses for electricians in Vilna where electric streetcars were being introduced They offered automotive courses in St Petersburg when the automobile began taking root there in ORT s training programs varied to meet the needs of Jews depending on where they lived and what the gaps in the workforce were That flexibility and diversity meant that ORT became an established educational leader in many fields within only its first few decades of existence
After World War I ORT opened agricultural schools to provide tools and training for agricultural enterprises ORT headquarters moved to Berlin in after the Bolshevik Revolution Initially the Berlin office dealt mainly with fundraising and support for Jewish education in other countries where the Jews were less well off When the Nazis rose to power in Jewish children were expelled from German schools ORT sought to open a school in Berlin but encountered difficulties due to the ban on selling property to Jews Using its international ties the British branch of ORT purchased a school building and dormitory in the Moabit quarter of Berlin It received authorization to open in April after promising that all graduates would leave the country upon graduation

After the end of World War II ORT established rehabilitation programs for the survivors The first one in Germany was started in August in the Landsberg DP camp Vocational training centers were set up in DP Displaced Persons Camps in Germany and nearly people acquired professions and the tools they would need to rebuild their lives Jacob Olejski a Dachau survivor who had previously organized ORT in Lithuania was the driving force behind ORT's revival in Germany After he organized ORT in the newly founded state of Israel
