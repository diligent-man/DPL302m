pratyekabuddhay na sanskrit traditional chinese pinyin yu nju ch ng is a buddhist term for the mode or vehicle of enlightenment of a pratyekabuddha or paccekabuddha sanskrit and pali respectively a term which literally means solitary buddha or a buddha on their own prati each eka one
the pratyekabuddha is an individual who independently achieves liberation without the aid of teachers or guides and without teaching others to do the same
pratyekabuddhas may give moral teachings but do not bring others to enlightenment
they leave no sangha as a legacy to carry on the dhamma
at least some of the early buddhist schools used the concept of three vehicles including pratyekabuddhay na
for example the vaibh ika sarv stiv dins are known to have employed the outlook of buddhist practice as consisting of the three vehicles

bodhisattvay nathe dharmaguptakas regarded the path of a pratyekabuddha pratyekabuddhay na and the path of a bodhisattva bodhisattvay na to be separate
one of their tenets reads the buddha and those of the two vehicles although they have one and the same liberation have followed different noble paths
pratyekabuddhas are said to achieve enlightenment on their own without the use of teachers or guides according to some traditions by seeing and understanding dependent origination
they are said to arise only in ages where there is no buddha and the buddhist teachings sanskrit dharma p li dhamma are lost
the idea of a paccekabuddha is interesting as much as it implies that even when the four truths are not preached they still exist and can be discovered by anyone who makes the necessary mental and moral effort
many may arise at a single time
according to the theravada school paccekabuddhas one who has attained to supreme and perfect insight but who dies without proclaiming the truth to the world are unable to teach the dhamma which requires the omniscience and supreme compassion of a samm sambuddha who may even hesitate to attempt to teach

they are also characterized as arrogant
they cling to the idea that the unsullied meditative absorption they experience is nirvana when it s more like an island to find rest on the way to their actual goal
rather than let them feel discouraged the buddha taught the sravaka and pratyekabuddha paths for rest and recuperation
after finding rest in states of meditative absorption they are encouraged and awakened by the buddha s body speech and mind to reach final nirvana
inspired by the buddha they then cultivate bodhicitta and practice the bodhisattva path
