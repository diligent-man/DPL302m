Halcnovian AltsnerischPurisch alternatively spelled Haltsnovian is an East Central German dialect spoken in the former village of Hałcnw which is now a district of Bielsko-Biała Poland
It was the vernacular language of Hałcnw until when ethnic Germans were expelled from Poland
Some examples of the language were recorded in the works of Karl Olma who was active as a journalist in the Halcnovian exile community in West Germany after World War II
Recently the dialect has been researched from a linguistic standpoint by Marek Dolatowski
It is related to the Wymysorys language
