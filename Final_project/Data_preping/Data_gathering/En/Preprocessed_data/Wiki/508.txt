The Battle of Kaiserslautern November saw a Coalition army under Charles William Ferdinand Duke of Brunswick Wolfenbüttel oppose a Republican French army led by Lazare Hoche Three days of conflict resulted in a victory by the Prussians and their Electoral Saxon allies as they turned back repeated French attacks The War of the First Coalition combat was fought near the city of Kaiserslautern in the modern day state of Rhineland Palatinate Germany which is located about kilometres mi west of Mannheim
In the First Battle of Wissembourg the Coalition army of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser broke through the frontier defenses and drove the French Army of the Rhine south to Strasbourg In response to this crisis the French government appointed Hoche to command the Army of the Moselle and Jean Charles Pichegru to lead the Army of the Rhine while urging them to relieve the siege of Landau In November Hoche launched an offensive which pressed back the Duke of Brunswick's army to Kaiserslautern On November French troops moved on Brunswick's defenses from the north northwest and west but for two days the Coalition army fended off the piecemeal attacks of their adversaries Hoche finally got his entire army into action on the th but the professional Prussian soldiers proved more than a match for the enthusiastic but indifferently trained French After the setback Hoche changed his strategy and turned a large part of his army against Wurmser's exposed western flank in Alsace The next engagement was the Battle of Froeschwiller in December
The man Coalition army of Charles William Ferdinand Duke of Brunswick successfully concluded the siege of Mainz on July The French garrison of men surrendered and was released on the promise of not fighting the Coalition for one year The French government immediately sent the released troops to fight in the internal War in the Vendée During the siege the French suffered approximately casualties while the Coalition lost about The strong Army of the Rhine under Alexandre de Beauharnais and the strong Army of the Moselle under Jean Nicolas Houchard were poised to march to the relief of Mainz However Beauharnais had not informed the Mainz garrison that help was on the way and then took too long to start his movement After the fall of Mainz both French armies retreated the Army of the Rhine to Wissembourg and the Army of the Moselle to the Saar River Blamed for the loss of Mainz Beauharnais fell into a funk begged to be relieved of command and on August he was replaced by Charles Hyacinthe Le Clerc de Landremont Meanwhile Houchard had been replaced by Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg on August Beauharnais was executed by guillotine on July His widow Joséphine de Beauharnais later married Napoleon Bonaparte
Landremont was soon ordered to send soldiers to the Army of the North This reduced the strength of his field force to with an additional in garrisons or in the Upper Rhine Division under Jean Charles Pichegru Brunswick pressed forward toward the fortress of Bitche driving back the Corps of the Vosges and the Army of the Moselle At this moment the French government dismissed Schauenburg for the crime of being an aristocrat During his short tenure he had drilled the troops into better shape The late commander of the Corps of the Vosges Jean René Moreaux was named to succeed him but declined because an old wound had reopened A division commander Jacques Charles René Delauney reluctantly took over the army on September Landremont was also dismissed and arrested but his intended replacement Antoine Guillaume Delmas was trapped in the siege of Landau Pichegru was offered command of the Army of the Rhine but he refused Since the generals saw that leading the army led to arrest or execution none wanted to accept the command Finally on October Jean Pascal Carlenc took command of the Army of the Rhine He would quickly prove to be completely unfitted for the job
On October a man Coalition army led by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser defeated Carlenc's strong army in the First Battle of Wissembourg The government ordered Carlenc's arrest on the rd The Army of the Rhine withdrew to the Zorn River near Strasbourg while Wurmser's army occupied northern Alsace On October Delauney sent six battalions to Saverne where they helped repel an attack by one of Wurmser's divisions Pichegru took command of the Army of the Rhine on October That same day Delaunay was dismissed from command of the Army of the Moselle The representatives on mission wanted Eustache Charles d'Aoust to replace Delauney but Lazare Hoche arrived from Paris to take command on October His rank was general of division rather than army commander because he was supposed to act under the orders of Pichegru On November Pichegru began a series of attacks on Wurmser's defensive lines in the Battle of Haguenau
The French government reinforced the Army of the Moselle with troops taken from the Army of the Rhine and from the Army of the Ardennes Both Hoche and Pichegru were well aware that the main objective was the relief of Landau In mid November Hoche advanced from the Saar with troops while the rest of the army guarded the passes through the Vosges Hoche used rough language with his subordinates at this time he wrote one of his division commanders Jean Jacques Ambert Listen bugger of a sans culotte On November a Prussian raid on the fort at Bitche failed Leopold Alexander von Wartensleben's column of picked soldiers overran the outer defenses with the help of a French traitor However they were soon discovered and repulsed with casualties of killed and captured The French lost men captured and few other losses The same day the French divisions of Alexandre Camille Taponier and Louis Pierre Huet bumped into Prussians under Friedrich Adolf Count von Kalckreuth at Biesingen north of Mandelbachtal The French troops were drubbed losing men killed or wounded and captured against a Prussian loss of only killed and wounded
Despite the setback at Biesingen Brunswick's troops were pulling back into winter quarters and Hoche entered Blieskastel on November The Prussians abandoned the camp of Hornbach and the French occupied it on the th Believing that he had his enemies on the run Hoche became very optimistic Alarmed at the French offensive and anxious that they intended to relieve Landau by moving via Pirmasens Brunswick made up his mind to offer battle at Kaiserslautern In fact Hoche hoped to raise the siege of Landau by striking east from Zweibrücken Deux Ponts and then down the Queich River Meanwhile Hoche completely lost track of his enemies From Zweibrücken he launched his army toward Pirmasens on the th only to have to march back to his starting point the next day when he did not find Brunswick Finally the French started northeast for Kaiserslautern in three columns On the left Ambert moved through Neunkirchen am Potzberg and Reichenbach Steegen toward Otterberg north of Kaiserslautern On the right Taponier marched directly on Kaiserslautern via Landstuhl with instructions to seize the Hoheneck heights Hoche with the main body advanced through Schönenberg Kübelberg toward Rodenbach Rémy Vincent was posted in Pirmasens to watch the Prussians and to shield the army's movement

Brunswick's army was deployed with its right flank resting on the city of Kaiserslautern and its flank covered by the marshy banks of the Lauter River Just to the north a regiment was stationed on the castle hill at Otterberg in order to maintain a link with Ernst Christian von Kospoth's division at Lauterecken well to the north Another division was posted at Trippstadt to the south The Trippstadt force maintained communications with Frederick Louis Prince of Hohenlohe Ingelfingen's corps near Pirmasens Hohenlohe blocked the eastward routes to Landau via Neustadt an der Weinstrasse and Annweiler am Trifels Another Prussian corps under Wilhelm René de l'Homme de Courbière operated in the Rhine valley supporting Wurmser's army and covering the passes in the Vosges Finally a brigade under Leopold Heinrich von der Goltz guarded the Pigeonnier height west of Wissembourg Military theorist Antoine Henri Jomini commented that Brunswick ought to have massed all these forces against Hoche He also faulted Hoche for attacking in three separated columns
On November the French army advanced in three columns against the Prussian position with Taponier leading the right Hoche the center and Ambert the left Taponier moved against the village of Vogelweh while Ambert aimed to cross the Lauter at Hirschhorn Taponier's column was the first to encounter the Prussians and to open the battle meeting moderate success The initial attack carried his troops onto the outer ridge of the Hoheneck heights Taponier also came up against the Galgenberg Gallows Hill which was defended by a Prussian redoubt Alarmed at the march of Ambert's column Brunswick reacted by sending Kalckreuth north to block it Kalckreuth's force took a new position with his left flank on the Lauter his center at Morlautern and his right near Erlenbach Another division was placed on the Kaiserberg while Duke Karl August of Saxe Weimar was left to defend the western approaches to Kaiserslautern
After leaving Rodenbach Hoche's column encountered impassable roads in the Voog Forest and had to detour around the obstacle His troops stayed on the west bank of the Lauter and never got into action on the th By strenuous efforts Ambert crossed the Lauter and moved south through Katzweiler and Sambach He gamely attacked across the Otterbach stream several times but his men were outnumbered by Kalckreuth Menaced with encirclement Ambert retreated and came in close proximity to Hoche's center column near Sambach Despite the lack of success Hoche determined to deliver the main attack from his left wing the next day Accordingly he made preparations to cross the Sambach bridge to join Ambert
The next day the French army crossed the river in force On the th Dubois' advance guard crossed first and joined a brigade under Olivier in a costly attack on the Prussian entrenchments Meanwhile Hoche established a gun battery near Sambach and a second battery near Erfenbach on the west bank Ambert led the brigades of Simon and Paillard far to the left to turn the Prussian position at Otterberg Huet moved against the enemy position with Morlot's brigade Under the crossfire of the Sambach and Erfenbach batteries the Prussians fell back and the French crossed the Otterbach
Hoche set up a gun battery on the Osterberg height starting a mutual bombardment that went on for a few hours The French general then hurled a column of troops at the Prussian left flank This part of Kalckreuth's position between the Lauter and Morlautern was separated from the rest of his line by a ravine Two regiments of Saxon cavalry charged Huet's division in the left flank Hoche's chief of staff Gabriel Marie Joseph comte d'Hédouville brought up some French cavalry squadrons from the Osterberg and hit the Saxons in their right flank More horsemen from both sides joined the melee and ultimately the Saxons prevailed Shaken by the cavalry charge the French infantry withdrew to the Otterbach valley The French attacks on Erlenbach also failed and by PM the fusillade died down
On the left flank Simon's brigade got lost and was unable to join Paillard's brigade at the old Otterberg glassworks until that evening By then it was too late to mount an attack so the th was Ambert's day to miss the action Ambert had to march all night to rejoin the French main force Unknown to the French Kospoth's division marched south from Lauterecken to Schallodenbach from which the Prussian could attack Ambert in the rear So it was lucky that the French left wing shifted position On the right flank Taponier assaulted the Galgenberg but was unable to make any headway The Prussian left wing was supported by artillery fire from the Kaiserberg Brunswick directed Wartensleben at Trippstadt to march to Kaiserslautern with three battalions and squadrons During the day Wartensleben's troops reinforced the Duke of Saxe Weimar's position on the Galgenberg and helped drive Taponier's men back into the woods
Hoche persisted in his attacks on November At dawn he directed his artillery to open a new barrage on the Prussian positions On the left flank leading four battalions against the Buchberg near Erlenbach Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor failed to capture the position and was repulsed after a sanguinary fight with the Saxons The appearance of Kospoth's troops near Otterberg in his rear compelled Molitor to make a rapid retreat The French assaulted the Galapfelberg height but this effort was also defeated This feature is located north of the Kaiserberg While holding the woods in the center the division of Huet had difficulty maintaining its position suffering under a storm of grapeshot The cavalry of both armies was very active the fighting took the form of charges and counter charges of the French and Saxo Prussian cavalry On the French right Taponier made two more assaults on the Galgenberg but Saxe Weimar drove them off
After having secured his flanks the Duke of Brunswick launched a counterattack against the Osterberg Seeing his left wing outflanked by the Saxons near Erlenbach Hoche ordered a retreat He detailed Ambert and five battalions to cover the withdrawal from the Mayberg height while the army filed to the west bank across the Sambach bridge and another span built near the Lamperts mill Hoche's exhausted troops retreated to Zweibrücken Hornbach and Pirmasens Following the passive strategy of his sovereign King Frederick William II Brunswick did not launch a pursuit
Jomini estimated that the French suffered casualties while the Saxo Prussians lost A second authority asserted that the French lost killed and wounded plus an additional men two guns and one color captured adding that Brunswick's army sustained losses of officers and soldiers killed and wounded a total of A third source listed French losses as killed and wounded with men two guns and one color captured while the Prussians lost officers and men and the Saxons lost officers and men a total of
The representatives on mission were angry at Hoche and threatened to denounce him He sarcastically told them to write an order declaring victory then he went on Do not disturb yourselves I have other means Fortunately for him Hoche remained in favor with the Committee of Public Safety and was not arrested and executed like Custine and Houchard Maximilien Robespierre declared that Hoche's behavior showed that he was a true sans culotte and another reinforcements were sent him from the Army of the Ardennes However Hédouville who Hoche had kept as chief of staff for the battle was arrested as a nobleman François Joseph Lefebvre was promoted to general of brigade for excellent work as was Édouard Huet for repelling the Prussian assault at Bitche Louis Huet had shown himself incompetent and was shelved
Brunswick seemed baffled by Hoche's clumsy attack on his army In his subsequent actions the Prussian failed to fully cooperate with his colleague Wurmser Despite its defeat the morale of the Army of the Moselle was unaffected The French soldiers remained sure of themselves perhaps because of their capture of enemy held territory before the battle Hoche fortified Pirmasens and Blieskastel and mounted a false attack against Brunswick But this was a smokescreen to cover his real intentions which were to shift his strength against Wurmser's western flank Already on November Philippe Joseph Jacob's division was moved to Niederbronn les Bains This was joined by Taponier's division on December and Jean Grangeret's division a week later On December Hoche defeated Wurmser in the Battle of Froeschwiller
