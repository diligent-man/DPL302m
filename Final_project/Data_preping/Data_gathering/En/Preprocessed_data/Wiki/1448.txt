macdonald was assessed in the encyclop dia britannica of which argued
macdonald had none of that military genius that distinguished davout mass na and lannes nor of that military science conspicuous in marmont and st cyr but nevertheless his campaign in switzerland gives him a rank far superior to such mere generals of division as oudinot and dupont
this capacity for independent command made napoleon in spite of his defeats at the trebia and the battle of katzbach trust him with large commands till the end of his career
as a man his character cannot be spoken of too highly no stain of cruelty or faithlessness rests on him
military historian gunter e
rothenberg wrote that although he overstated his own abilities macdonald was an excellent commander
richard dunn pattison praised macdonald for his keen military insight while a
macdonell called his career a string of defeats
john m
keefe blamed his defeat at katzbach on a general lack of staff officers in french armies not commanded by napoleon arguing that macdonald had fought successfully in the rest of his career
