his experiences fighting against the xhosa created a low opinion of the fighting capabilities of african soldiers which later led to disastrous consequences during the anglo zulu war
in january the official sir henry bartle frere a personal friend of chelmsford engineered the outbreak of the anglo zulu war by issuing the zulu king cetshwayo an ultimatum to effectively disband his military
