new colorsThe Fitbit Ultra is powered by a small lithium polymer battery.
The Fitbit Ultra suffered from a small design flaw: the unit had a permanently curved shape in order to clip directly onto any piece of clothing
The plastic used in the unit was not appropriate for the strain experienced at the looped end, and with time would become brittle, and crack
While most users experienced only minor cracking with no effects to the device's function, in a few cases the cracking led to total failure
Fitbit offered replacement or repair of affected units that were under warranty.
Announced on September 17, 2012, the Fitbit One is an update to the Fitbit Ultra that has a more vivid digital display, has a separate clip and a separate charging cable and wireless sync dongle
