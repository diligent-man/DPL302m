Berbice is a region along the Berbice River in Guyana which was between and a colony of the Dutch Republic After having been ceded to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the latter year it was merged with Essequibo and Demerara to form the colony of British Guiana in In British Guiana gained independence as Guyana
After being a hereditary fief in the possession of the Van Peere family the colony was governed by the Society of Berbice in the second half of the colonial period akin to the neighbouring colony of Suriname which was governed by the Society of Suriname The capital of Berbice was at Fort Nassau until In that year the town of New Amsterdam which grew around Fort Sint Andries was made the new capital of the colony
Berbice was settled in by the businessman Abraham van Peere from Vlissingen under the suzerainty of the Dutch West India Company Until the colony remained the personal possession of Van Peere and his descendants Little is known about the early years of the colony other than that it succeeded in repelling an English attack in in the Second Anglo Dutch War The colony was a family affair who owned all the plantations on the Berbice River though they did allow a couple of sugar planters to settle on the Canje River
A dispute arose between the Second Dutch West India Company which was founded to succeed the First Dutch West India Company that went bankrupt in and the Van Peere family because the family wanted the colony as an immortal loan as agreed with the first Company This was resolved when on September a charter was signed which established Berbice as a hereditary fief of the Dutch West India Company in the possession of the Van Peere family
In November Berbice was briefly occupied by the French under Jacques Cassard as part of the War of the Spanish Succession The Van Peere family did not want to pay a ransom to the French to free the colony and in order to not let the colony cede to the French the brothers Nicolaas and Hendrik van Hoorn Arnold Dix Pieter Schuurmans and Cornelis van Peere paid the ransom of in cash and in sugar and enslaved people on October thereby acquiring the colony
In the five owners of the colony founded the Society of Berbice akin to the Society of Suriname which governed the neighbouring colony to raise more capital for the colony The Society was a public company listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange In the years following Berbice's economic situation improved consisting of plantations owned by the society private plantation along the Berbice River and plantations along the Canje River
In to houses were built around Fort Nassau to house the craftsmen The next year an inn was added The village was named New Amsterdam Dutch Nieuw Amsterdam In a school master was hired to teach the white children There were medical doctors stationed in New Amsterdam and Fort Nassau and six local doctors were assigned to the plantations Epidemics remained a frequent problem in the colony resulting in many deaths
The religion in the colony was Calvinism In a minister was installed in Fort Nassau but after a personal conflict with the governor he was transferred to Wiruni Creek Catholics and Jews were not allowed to become planters or have a government function In two missionaries of the Moravian Church had been invited by a planter to teach the people he enslaved They were treated with suspicion and received several official warnings In the missionaries left and joined the congregation at the village of Pilgerhut founded in outside the plantation area where they lived with Arawak
The colony had peace and trade treaties with the local Amerindians The colony was not to intervene in wars between the tribes and no Amerindian was allowed to be taken into slavery unless they were sold by the Kalina or the Arawak and captured from the interior of the country
Berbice was supposed to be guarded by soldiers in Fort Nassau and another to soldiers in other locations Even when not under attack wars often caused supply problems In s the colony had not been supplied for months and neutrality as during the Seven Years' War could not prevent supply shortages
The relatively sound economic situation of the colony was dealt a severe blow when a slave uprising broke out under the leadership of Coffy in February The enslaved people captured the south of the colony while the whites who were severely outnumbered tried to hang on the north The uprising went on until well into with Coffy naming himself governor of Berbice Only with the use of brute force and military aid by neighbouring colonies and the Netherlands was governor Wolfert Simon van Hoogenheim able to finally suppress the uprising and restore the colony to Dutch rule
The uprising led to a steep population decline abandonment and destruction of many plantations and serious financial problems for the Society Fort Nassau had been set on fire to prevent it falling into enemy hands In the village was abandoned in favour of Fort Sint Andries situated more downstream at the confluence of the Canje River The new village was again named New Amsterdam and is still known by that name in contemporary Guyana
On February British forces occupied Berbice and neighbouring Demerara and Essequibo as part of the Fourth Anglo Dutch War because out of plantations in Berbice were under British ownership In January the colonies were recaptured by the French who were allied with the Dutch and who subsequently restored the colonies to Dutch rule with the Treaty of Paris of
The colony was on April again captured by Britain however this time without a fight A deal was struck with the colony all laws and customs could remain and the citizens were equal to British citizens Any government official who swore loyalty to the British crown could remain in function Abraham van Batenburg decided to remain governor Many plantation owners from Barbados settled in the colony doubling the slave population The British now remained in possession of the colony until March when Berbice was restored to the Batavian Republic under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens In there was a mutiny of soldiers who complained about the rations They occupied Fort Sint Andries and raised the Union Jack with a piece of meat on top The remaining soldiers aided by Suriname and the Amerindians put down the revolt and executed five soldiers
In September the British occupied the territory again this time for good and once again without a fight Abraham van Batenburg who had been exiled to Europe in returned for his second term as governor In the Anglo Dutch Treaty of the colony was formally ceded to the United Kingdom and with the ratification of this treaty by the Netherlands on November all Dutch legal claims to the colony were rescinded The plantations and the enslaved people of the Society of Berbice remained under their ownership but they had already made a decision to sell their possessions in and they closed their offices in
In the colonies of Demerara and Essequibo had been merged into the colony of Demerara Essequibo As part of the reforms of the newly acquired colonies on the South American mainland the British merged Berbice with Demerara Essequibo on July forming the new crown colony of British Guiana now Guyana
In Berbice was made one of the three counties of Guiana the other two being Demerara and Essequibo In the county was abolished when Guiana was subdivided into districts
Historical Berbice was split in to make new Guyanese administrative regions and the name is preserved in the regions of East Berbice Corentyne Mahaica Berbice and Upper Demerara Berbice
