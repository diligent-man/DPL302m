The Archer School for Girls is an independent, college preparatory girls' school, grades 6–12, located in West Los Angeles, California, United States
Archer currently enrolls 490 students from 79 different zip codes and 141 feeder schools.
Archer was founded in 1995 by Megan Callaway, Victoria Shorr, and Diana Meehan, who are all graduates of girls' schools and parents of daughters about to enter middle school
According to Diana Meehan, the name Archer was chosen to signify a place where girls would be taught to be self-sufficient based on research specific to female learners
The school started in a converted Pacific Palisades dance studio with just over 30 sixth and seventh grade students.
In 1999 the school purchased the Eastern Star Home for Women in Brentwood Village, a building designed by California architect William Mooser
The building has been designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and is listed in the California and National Registers of Historic Places.
One of Archer's numerous traditions is the raising of a maypole each year in spring
The tradition began in 1981 when an anonymous donor arranged to have the maypole constructed for the residents of the Eastern Star Home for Women and then located at the site
Archer has continued this tradition, with 6th grade students performing a maypole dance on the last day of school.
In 2003, Archer received the LA Conservancy Preservation Award for Adaptive Reuse.
In addition to the traditional middle and high school subjects taught, Archer partners with the Online School for Girls to offer additional STEM, and language courses to students
In the 2018-2019 year, the School offered 149 courses.
