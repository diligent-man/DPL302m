YumaIn the st century Carroll County is overwhelmingly Republican
In general the alignment of voters with the two major parties has shifted since the late th century but Carroll County had a different history
Conservative whites in the upland and Deep South largely shifted away from the Democratic Party in the late th century to the Republican Party but Carroll County had only briefly supported Democratic presidential candidates in the th century when Southerner Woodrow Wilson was elected from - for Franklin D
Roosevelt and Harry Truman during the Depression and years of World War II and after and Southerners Lyndon B
Johnson in Jimmy Carter in and Bill Clinton in -
But at the time of the American Civil War and for decades after Carroll was the northernmost county in the Unionist Republican bloc made up of Wayne Henderson Hardin and McNairy counties within historically Democratic West Tennessee
The whites in this bloc were yeomen farmers who owned few slaves most identified as Unionist
Historians note that the enclave developed this way because unlike in the fertile Delta this region of the Highland Rim had soils that were shallow humus-poor and easily erodible
Settlers who were poor could acquire land here as the area could not support the plantations more typical of Middle and West Tennessee which were dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans
