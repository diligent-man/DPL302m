Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers (born October 1, 1989), known professionally as Brie Larson, is an American actress
Known for her supporting roles in comedies as a teenager, she has since expanded to leading roles in independent films and blockbusters
Larson is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award
Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019.
At age six, Larson was the youngest student admitted to a training program at the American Conservatory Theater, and she began her acting career in 1998 with a comedy sketch on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno
She appeared as a regular in the 2001 sitcom Raising Dad and briefly dabbled with a music career, releasing the album Finally Out of P.E
in 2005
Larson subsequently played supporting roles in the comedy films Hoot (2006), Scott Pilgrim vs
the World (2010), and 21 Jump Street (2012), and appeared as a sardonic teenager in the television series United States of Tara (2009–2011).
Her breakthrough came with a leading role in the acclaimed independent drama Short Term 12 (2013), and she continued to take on supporting parts in the romance The Spectacular Now (2013) and the comedy Trainwreck (2015)
For playing a kidnapping victim in the drama Room (2015), Larson won the Academy Award for Best Actress
The 2017 adventure film Kong: Skull Island marked her first big-budget release, after which she starred as Captain Marvel in the 2019 Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero films Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame.
Larson has co-written and co-directed two short films, and made her feature film directorial debut with the independent comedy-drama Unicorn Store (2017)
For producing the virtual reality series The Messy Truth VR Experience (2020), she won a Primetime Emmy Award
A gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors, Larson is vocal about social and political issues.
Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers was born on October 1, 1989, in Sacramento, California, to Heather (née Edwards) and Sylvain Desaulniers
Her parents were homeopathic chiropractors who ran a practice together, and they have another daughter, Milaine
Her father is Franco-Manitoban, and in her childhood, Larson spoke French as her first language
She was mostly home-schooled, which she believed allowed her to explore innovative and abstract experiences
Describing her early life, Larson has said she was "straight-laced and square", and that she shared a close bond with her mother but was shy and had social anxiety
During the summer, she would write and direct her own home movies in which she cast her cousins and filmed in her garage
At age six, she expressed interest in becoming an actress, later remarking that the "creative arts was just something that was always in me"
That same year, she auditioned for a training program at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, where she became the youngest student admitted.
Larson experienced trauma when her parents divorced when she was seven
She had a dysfunctional relationship with her father, saying: "As a kid I tried to understand him and understand the situation
But he didn't do himself any favors
I don't think he ever really wanted to be a parent." Soon after their separation, Heather relocated to Los Angeles with her two daughters to fulfill Larson's acting ambition
They had limited financial means and lived in a small apartment near Hollywood studio lots at Burbank
Larson described the experience, "We had a crappy one-room apartment where the bed came out of the wall and we each had three articles of clothing." Even so, she has recounted fond memories of this period and credits her mother for doing the best she could for them.
As her last name was difficult to pronounce, she adopted the stage name Larson from her Swedish great-grandmother, as well as an American Girl doll named Kirsten Larson that she received as a child
Her first job was performing a commercial parody for Barbie, named "Malibu Mudslide Barbie", in a 1998 episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno
She subsequently took on guest roles in several television series, including Touched by an Angel and Popular
In 2000, she was cast in the Fox sitcom Schimmel, which was canceled before airing when its star, Robert Schimmel, was diagnosed with cancer.
Larson's first major role came as Emily, the younger daughter of Bob Saget's character, in the WB sitcom Raising Dad, which aired for one season during the 2001–02 television schedule
Hal Boedeker of Orlando Sentinel criticized the program and wrote that its cast members were "merrily joking through the show"
She was next hired for the ABC sitcom Hope & Faith, but she and some other cast members were replaced after an unaired pilot
In 2003, she starred alongside Beverley Mitchell in the Disney Channel film Right on Track, based on the junior drag race star sisters Erica and Courtney Enders, and played minor roles in the 2004 comedies Sleepover and 13 Going on 30.
Larson developed an interest in music at age eleven when she learned to play the guitar
A music executive encouraged her to write her own songs, and she began self-recording and uploading tracks to her own website
After failing to get cast as Wendy Darling in the 2003 film Peter Pan, Larson wrote and recorded a song titled "Invisible Girl", which received airplay on KIIS-FM
She soon signed a record deal with Tommy Mottola of Casablanca Records; she and Lindsay Lohan were the only artists signed by the label at the time
In 2005, she released the album Finally Out of P.E., for which she also co-wrote songs with other songwriters, including Blair Daly, Pam Sheyne, Lindy Robbins, and Holly Brook
She titled it after a gym teacher she disliked and has said the songs she wrote were mostly about failed job opportunities
One of her singles, "She Said", was featured on the MTV series Total Request Live, was listed by Billboard in their weekly listings of the most-played videos in the channel, and peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot Single Sales
Larson went on tour with Jesse McCartney for Teen People's "Rock in Shop" mall concerts, opened for him during his Beautiful Soul tour, and also performed in New York City at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
Even so, the album was not a success, selling only 3,500 copies
Larson later admitted to being disillusioned with her music career, saying, "I wanted to write all my own songs, and [the recording company] were afraid of that
I wanted to wear sneakers and play my guitar—they wanted heels and wind blown hair."
In 2006, Larson was cast alongside Logan Lerman and Cody Linley in the comedy film Hoot, about young vigilantes trying to save a group of owls
It received poor reviews, but Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle was appreciative of Larson and Linley for bringing "a dash of Indiana Jones to their roles"
She had a small part, the following year, in the Amber Heard-starring drama Remember the Daze, and she launched an arts and literature magazine, Bunnies and Traps, for which she wrote her own opinion columns and accepted submissions from other artists and writers
Larson has said she frequently considered quitting acting at that point, as she found it difficult to find much work, blaming it on filmmakers' inability to typecast her
She was particularly discouraged when she lost out on key roles in the films Thirteen (2003) and Juno (2007)
To support herself, Larson worked as a club DJ.
In 2009, Larson began playing Kate Gregson, the sardonic teenage daughter of Toni Collette's character, coping with her mother's dissociative identity disorder, in the Showtime comedy-drama series United States of Tara
Portia Doubleday was initially cast in the role but was replaced with Larson after filming the pilot episode
Reviewing the first season for The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley took note of how well Larson played a "real teenager" and Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle credited her for finding nuance in her role
Larson has said that her character's journey to find meaning in life mirrored that of her own, and she was upset when the show was canceled after three seasons in 2011
Also in 2009, she starred alongside Rooney Mara in Tanner Hall, a coming-of-age film about four girls in boarding school
Despite disliking the film, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times commended Larson for providing "one of the film's funniest bits"
In her two other film releases that year, she played a scatterbrained cheerleader in House Broken and a popular high schooler in Just Peck.
At the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2010, Larson appeared in a stage production of Thornton Wilder's play Our Town
Directed by Nicholas Martin, it featured her in the role of Emily Webb, a precocious young girl
Reviewing the play for The Boston Globe, Louise Kennedy thought the production had glossed over the play's darker themes and bemoaned the lack of tragic arc in Larson's character
In film, she featured in Noah Baumbach's comedy-drama Greenberg and Edgar Wright's comedy Scott Pilgrim vs
the World
A journalist for Slant Magazine opined that these films helped raise her profile, and Larson has said the latter film, in which she played a rock star named Envy, marked a turning point in her career
In it, Larson performed the song "Black Sheep" with the band Metric
Although it did not fare well commercially, Scott Pilgrim vs
the World has since developed a cult following
She next played the troubled daughter of a corrupt cop (played by Woody Harrelson) in the drama Rampart (2011), an emotionally intense part she found herself unable to detach from
A confrontation scene between Harrelson and her proved upsetting for her; the director was surprised by how well it turned out and tweaked the script to further explore the father-daughter relationship.
In 2012, Larson expanded into filmmaking by co-writing and co-directing the short film The Arm with Jessie Ennis and Sarah Ramos
The film, about societal expectations in the near future, won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival
She featured as a seductive teenager in the critically panned drama The Trouble with Bliss, after which she played Molly, a high school student, in 21 Jump Street, an adaptation of the 1980s police procedural television series, co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum
Larson found her acting style to be more rigid than Hill's approach and was challenged by scenes that required her to improvise with him
Dana Stevens of Slate labeled Larson "a find of major proportions", adding that "she's not only beautiful but funny, with a scratchy contralto voice, and unlike the usual female in a buddy movie, she comes across as a real person"
With a worldwide gross of over $200 million, 21 Jump Street proved to be Larson's most widely seen film to that point.
Following an appearance in the sitcom Community, Larson collaborated with Dustin Bowser to co-write and co-direct Weighting (2013), a short film about a strained relationship, which was screened at South by Southwest
Larson's breakthrough came in the same year when she starred in Destin Daniel Cretton's critically acclaimed independent drama Short Term 12, which marked the first leading role of her career
Set in a group home for troubled teenagers, the film featured her as Grace, the emotionally distressed supervisor of the institution
To prepare, Larson interacted with staff in a children's home and watched online interviews of people with similar jobs
The film had a production budget of under $1 million, and she was pleased with its intimate and collaborative work environment
Larson's performance was acclaimed by critics
Manohla Dargis of The New York Times found her "terrific" and "completely persuasive", and Ian Freer of Empire stated that she "builds into a whirling dervish of a performance, making Grace strong but scarred, damaged but compassionate"
Jenny McCartney of The Daily Telegraph predicted that it would "[mark] her out for a stellar career"
Larson received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead; she later remarked that the film prompted directors to offer her a wide variety of parts, but she turned down roles of the unidimensional love interest.
Also in 2013, Larson had supporting roles in two romantic dramas, Don Jon and The Spectacular Now
In the former, written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, she played the sister of Don Jon (played by Gordon-Levitt)
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film's exploration of sexual themes and found Larson to be "terrific" in it
In The Spectacular Now, starring Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, she played Cassidy, the ex-girlfriend of Teller's character
Larson was drawn to the realism she found in the project's depiction of high school experiences
Writing for New York magazine, David Edelstein called upon viewers to admire "the shading and intelligence she brings to Cassidy"
The 2014 crime drama The Gambler, based on the 1974 film of the same name, featured Larson as a literature student who has an affair with her professor (played by Mark Wahlberg), a gambling addict
The director Rupert Wyatt felt the role was underwritten and cast Larson to lend heft to it
Even so, Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the "talented Larson is given little to do, other than react".
Larson had three film releases in 2015
Her first appearance was in Digging for Fire, a largely improvised ensemble comedy-drama featuring Jake Johnson in the lead role
Filming took place without a script and Larson made several on-set decisions regarding her character's choices, including the removal of a planned romantic subplot involving her and Johnson
She next played the sister of Amy Schumer's character in the comedy Trainwreck, which was loosely based on Schumer's own life
Larson modeled her role on Schumer's sister, who served as an associate producer on the film
Tim Grierson of Screen International labeled the film "a deft blend of laughs, romance and poignancy" and found Larson to be "lively, [but] slightly underused"
Trainwreck grossed over $140 million against a $35 million budget.
Larson then starred in Room, a film adaptation of Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name
It featured her as Ma, a young woman held in captivity, who bears a child of rape
The role proved physically and emotionally taxing for her, and she modeled it on her mother's struggle as a single parent
A large portion of the film was shot inside a 10 ft × 10 ft shed created in a studio, and Larson prepared herself by spending a month isolated in her apartment
She interacted with specialists on sexual abuse and researched the lack of nutrition that a person in captivity would suffer
To achieve the look, she stayed away from sunlight, modified her diet, and exercised extensively to lose weight
Larson collaborated closely with co-star Jacob Tremblay, who played her son, and spent time performing activities that mirrored those of their characters
Room was critically acclaimed, with major emphasis on the performances of Larson and Tremblay
Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called her performance "astonishing", stating that the "reality and preternatural commitment she brings to Ma is piercingly honest from start to finish, as scaldingly emotional a performance as anyone could wish for"
She won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as a Golden Globe and BAFTA in the same category.
Following the success of Room, Larson played a leading role in Free Fire (2016), an action-comedy about a shootout in a warehouse
She agreed to the project to call attention to gun violence
Eric Kohn of IndieWire noted how different Larson's role was from that in Room and added that her "businesslike demeanor once again proves her ability to command a scene with a single glare"
Commercially, the film failed to recoup its $7 million investment
She had filmed a part in Todd Solondz's comedy Wiener-Dog, but her scenes were deleted from the final cut as Solondz found her character inessential to the story
The following year, Larson starred alongside Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L
Jackson in the second installment of the MonsterVerse franchise, entitled Kong: Skull Island
Shot in Vietnam, the film featured her as a photojournalist in the 1970s
It marked her first mainstream big-budget release, and while she was glad to play a role not defined by her looks, she bemoaned the lack of female co-stars
Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the film's visual effects and remarked that "Larson manages to hold her own with very little to do"
Kong: Skull Island was a commercial success, grossing over $566 million worldwide.
Later in 2017, Larson portrayed Jeannette Walls in The Glass Castle, an adaptation of Walls' memoir, which reunited her with Destin Daniel Cretton
It tells the story of a young woman's relationship with her nonconformist parents (played by Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts)
Larson was drawn to the complex depiction of a parent-child relationship and identified with its theme of forgiveness
She collaborated closely with Walls and her siblings and observed their mannerisms
Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian disliked the film's sentimentality but noted that "it is saved, just a little, by the robustness of Brie Larson's presence"
Also poorly received was the India-set musical romance Basmati Blues, a project she had filmed back in 2013, which received criticism on social media for its white savior narrative
The 2017 Toronto International Film Festival marked the release of Larson's feature film directorial debut, the comedy-drama Unicorn Store, in which she also starred
It was later picked for digital distribution by Netflix in 2019
She played a disillusioned art student fascinated with unicorns
Larson had unsuccessfully auditioned in 2012 to star in the film when Miguel Arteta was attached to direct
After the production was stalled, Larson was offered to direct and star in it
She was drawn to the fanciful narrative and found a connection between her character's journey and her experience as a director
David Ehrlich of IndieWire disliked the film but took note of Larson's potential as a filmmaker.
After a year-long absence from the screen, Larson starred as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film Captain Marvel (2019), which marked Marvel Studios' first female-led film
She was initially skeptical about taking on such a high-profile role, but later accepted the part after viewing it as a platform to empower young women and found a connection with the character's flaws and humanity
In preparation, she underwent nine months of judo, boxing and wrestling training, and interacted with service personnel at the Nellis Air Force Base
Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that "Larson, a perceptive, low-key actor, carries the whole affair capably" and took note of how much she stood out in the film's quieter moments; David Sims of The Atlantic bemoaned the lack of depth in her role, but credited the actress for effectively portraying her character's struggle for independence from authoritarian men
Larson reprised her role in Avengers: Endgame, which she had filmed before Captain Marvel
Endgame grossed $2.79 billion worldwide to rank as the highest-grossing film of all time, and Captain Marvel became the first female-led superhero film to gross over $1 billion worldwide.
Also in 2019, Larson teamed with Destin Daniel Cretton for the third time in Just Mercy, based on Bryan Stevenson's memoir about death row inmate Walter McMillian's wrongful conviction, starring Michael B
Jordan and Jamie Foxx
She agreed to take on the supporting part of Eva Ansley, an advocate for the Equal Justice Initiative, to lend her support to Cretton's storytelling
Owen Gleiberman of Variety took note of how well she channeled her character's "antsy, cigarette-smoking defensiveness." The following year, Larson produced and appeared in an episode of The Messy Truth VR Experience, a virtual reality series, for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program.
Larson will reprise her role as Danvers in the superhero sequel The Marvels, and will join the cast of the tenth Fast & Furious film titled Fast X
She also has three upcoming projects for streaming television
She will serve as the producer and star as Victoria Woodhull, the first female presidential candidate in American history, in an eponymous biopic produced by Amazon Studios
Larson will also star in an Apple TV+ drama series based on the life of CIA officer Amaryllis Fox, and the Netflix film Lady Business, about challenges faced by female entrepreneurs.
Larson is a gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors
She uses her celebrity to speak out on social and political issues, asserting, "I'd put it all on the line and be an activist for the rest of my life because it doesn't feel right to me to be quiet." Following a performance by Lady Gaga at the 2016 Academy Awards, where several sexual abuse survivors appeared with the singer, Larson hugged all of them as they exited the stage
At the following year's ceremony, she presented Casey Affleck with the award for Best Actor, but due to several accusations of sexual harassment made against him, she did not clap for him during a standing ovation from the audience
However, she did hug him; she later said her action "spoke for itself"
In 2018, Larson collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination
In the same year, she became one of the first actors to incorporate an inclusion rider provision in her film and press junket contracts
In a 2019 interview, she remarked upon diversity among film critics and journalists, finding them to be "overwhelmingly white male", and supported diversity in the industry
This comment led to trolling and review bombing of the Captain Marvel page on Rotten Tomatoes.

Larson is reticent about her personal life and refuses to answer questions in interviews that make her uncomfortable
On her desire to be private, she has said she fears being judged for her flaws and that the privacy allows her to play a wide variety of roles without being typecast
Larson began dating Alex Greenwald, lead singer of the band Phantom Planet, in 2013, and they were engaged from 2016 to 2019
On January 10, 2019, it was reported that the pair called off their engagement
They had lived together in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles
She had credited Greenwald for creating a safe space for her and for empowering her to take risks in her work.
Describing Larson's off-screen persona, Holly Millea of Elle wrote in 2016 that she "carries herself like an athlete, lean and solid, surefooted [and] yet her energy is warm and familial, literally embracing"
The writer Anne Helen Petersen finds her to be "incredibly warm" and adds that she is "a serious nerd, with the endlessly tunneling knowledge of a homeschooler"
Jennifer Dickison of Porter states that Larson's "fully formed" personality made it difficult to categorize her into a conventional slot.
Larson has said she is interested in films that illustrate the "human condition" and which "make people feel more connected to themselves [and] the rest of the world"
She is drawn to roles that differ from her own personality and which involve themes of social activism
Fan Zhong of W magazine has identified a theme of "sex appeal, inner torment, and a quick, playful wit" in her characters
Lenny Abrahamson, who directed Larson in Room, believes that her craft has "none of that showy intensity that sometimes gets all the attention" and has said that her "awareness of tougher lives" empowers her performances
