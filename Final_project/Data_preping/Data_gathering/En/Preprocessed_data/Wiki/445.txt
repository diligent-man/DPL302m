journal ranking is widely used in academic circles in the evaluation of an academic journal s impact and quality
journal rankings are intended to reflect the place of a journal within its field the relative difficulty of being published in that journal and the prestige associated with it
they have been introduced as official research evaluation tools in several countries
traditionally journal ranking measures or evaluations have been provided simply through institutional lists established by academic leaders or through a committee vote
these approaches have been notoriously politicized and inaccurate reflections of actual prestige and quality as they would often reflect the biases and personal career objectives of those involved in ranking the journals also causing the problem of highly disparate evaluations across institutions
consequently many institutions have required external sources of evaluation of journal quality
the traditional approach here has been through surveys of leading academics in a given field but this approach too has potential for bias though not as profound as that seen with institution generated lists
consequently governments institutions and leaders in scientometric research have turned to a litany of observed bibliometric measures on the journal level that can be used as surrogates for quality and thus eliminate the need for subjective assessment
consequently several journal level metrics have been proposed most citation based
impact factor and citescore reflecting the average number of citations to articles published in science and social science journals
scimago journal rank a measure of scientific influence of scholarly journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from
h index usually used as a measure of scientific productivity and the scientific impact of an individual scientist but can also be used to rank journals
h index this metric calculated and released by google scholar is based on the h index of all articles published in a given journal in the last five years
expert survey a score reflecting the overall quality or contribution of a journal is based on the results of the survey of active field researchers practitioners and students i e actual journal contributors or readers who rank each journal based on specific criteria
publication power approach ppa the ranking position of each journal is based on the actual publishing behavior of leading tenured academics over an extended time period
as such the journal s ranking position reflects the frequency at which these scholars published their articles in this journal
altmetrics rate journals based on scholarly references added to academic social media sites
diamscore a measure of scientific influence of academic journals based on recursive citation weighting and the pairwise comparisons between journals
source normalized impact per paper snip a factor released in by elsevier based on scopus to estimate impact
the measure is calculated as snip rip r m where rip raw impact per paper r citation potential and m median database citation potential
pagerank in a recursive impact factor that gives citations from journals with high impact greater weight than citations from low impact journals was proposed
such a recursive impact factor resembles google s pagerank algorithm though the original paper uses a trade balance approach in which journals score highest when they are often cited but rarely cite other journals several scholars have proposed related approaches
eigenfactor is another pagerank type measure of journal influence with rankings freely available online a study published in compared the impact factor eigenfactor score scimago journal country rank and the source normalized impact per paper in journals related to pharmacy toxicology and biochemistry
it discovered there was a moderate to high and significant correlation between them
negative consequences of rankings are generally well documented and relate to the performativity of using journal rankings for performance measurement purposes
for example mckinnon has analyzed how the abs ajg ranking which in spite of its methodological shortcomings is widely accepted in british business schools has had negative consequences for the transportation and logistics management disciplines
universities now increasingly drop the idea that research quality can be measured based on the uni dimensional scale of a journal ranking
this has for example led to the san francisco declaration on research assessment dora which has now been signed by thousands of researchers worldwide asking not to use journal based metrics
as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles to assess an individual scientist s contributions or in hiring promotion or funding decisions
the community for responsible research in business management crrbm asks whether even the academy is being served when faculty members are valued for the quantity and placement of their articles not for the benefit their research can have for the world
