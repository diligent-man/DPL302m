Pulitzer Prize winning automotive journalist Dan Neil suggested the Countryman had jumped the shark – that is to say the car pushed the Mini ethos beyond relevance, marking the zenith of popularity and the start of decline
Neil suggested that by making a vehicle that is longer, wider and taller, the company had forsaken the inner logic of the brand: excellent handling in a tiny size
In a March 2011 review titled What Part of 'Mini' Did You Not Grasp, BMW? , Neil wrote "with the Countryman, tiny sharks have been jumped."
The Countryman became Mini's second most popular model after the iconic Hardtop
The very first year of production it sold almost 50% more units than the Clubman, Convertible, and Coupe added together
Almost 1 out of every 3 vehicles Mini sold in the US in 2011 was a Countryman.
This trend continued through 2012 also with almost 1 in 3 MINIs sold again being a Countryman - both in the US and globally.
By the end of 2013 the Countryman was 31% of total U.S
sales for the Mini brand.
A minor facelift to the Countryman was unveiled at the 2014 New York International Auto Show
Changes include a new structure of the hexagonal radiator grill, underride guard elements for the Cooper S Countryman ALL4 and additional body colour options
It went on sale in July 2014
All variants carried over

The second generation Countryman was introduced at the LA Auto Show in November 2016 and went on sale in February 2017 in Europe, and March elsewhere
It was launched with three variants: Cooper (FWD or ALL4), Cooper S (FWD or ALL4), and in June 2017, the new Cooper S E ALL4 plug-in hybrid
The new Countryman is 203 millimetres (8.0 in) longer than the first generation, and 25-millimetre (0.98 in) wider
The Cooper Countryman will be powered by a turbocharged 3-cylinder engine, while the Cooper S will use a new 2.0-litre turbo I4.
The Cooper S E plug-in hybrid combines a 134 hp (100 kW) 3-cylinder petrol engine and a 65 kW (88 PS; 87 hp) synchronous electric motor, producing a combined system output of 221 hp (165 kW) with system torque of 385 N·m (284 lb-ft)
Average fuel consumption on the NEDC test cycle is 112 mpg‑US (2.10 L/100 km; 135 mpg‑imp), with CO2 emissions of 49 grams per kilometer
The 7.6 kWh lithium-ion battery is positioned directly in front of the electric motor underneath the rear seat, delivering an all-electric range of up to 40 km (25 mi) and a top speed of 126 km/h (78 mph)
Charging at a 240-volt socket takes 3 hours and 15 minutes.
Mini makes the John Cooper Works edition available again in this generation with the tuned version based on the Cooper S
The 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine has been upgraded with a new heat-resistant turbocharger and additional inter-cooler, resulting in 228 bhp (170 kW; 231 PS), 258 lb⋅ft (350 N⋅m) of torque and a 0-62 mph (100 km/h) time of 6.5 seconds
Similar to the Countryman S, JCW Countryman can be mated to either a 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission (which comes with the option to choose between Normal, Sport, and Eco mode)
United States EPA-tested fuel economy for the JCW under manual transmission is 20 mpg‑US (12 L/100 km; 24 mpg‑imp) for city and 29 mpg‑US (8.1 L/100 km; 35 mpg‑imp) for highway which the automatic does slightly better with 22 mpg‑US (11 L/100 km; 26 mpg‑imp) for city and 30 mpg‑US (7.8 L/100 km; 36 mpg‑imp) for highway.
In summer 2019, Mini launched an updated version of the Countryman JCW, known unofficially as the Countryman JCW 306
This is thanks to the now increased output of 306 PS (225 kW; 302 hp) which now gives the vehicle a 0-62 mph (100 km/h) time of 5.1 seconds.
The Countryman received a facelift in the latter half of 2020.In May 2017, Euro NCAP awarded the Countryman a 5-star crash rating.
