Tatum was looked at for early attempts to include Gambit in the X Men films but was not available for that character's film introduction in X Men Origins Wolverine Taylor Kitsch portrayed the character instead but was not well received Producer Lauren Shuler Donner expressed interest in a Gambit film starring Tatum in early and the actor officially signed on that May The film had been in development hell since then with Rupert Wyatt Doug Liman and Gore Verbinski attached as director to the film at different times over the years with Tatum and his producing partner Reid Carolin also lobbying to direct and the film's release date also pushed back numerous times Gambit was scheduled for release on March but development of the film was placed on hold due to the acquisition of st Century Fox by Disney After taking over the film Disney officially cancelled it in May
For the film X director Bryan Singer asked stunt double James Bamford to film a short cameo as the character Gambit The scene was ultimately cut from the film and Bamford believed that a better known actor would be cast in the role for any future appearance Singer wanted the character to have a large part in the sequel X Men The Last Stand with Keanu Reeves in the role but ultimately did not return to direct that film A new writing team of Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn were set to write the sequel's screenplay by th Century Fox after Singer's departure and though the pair wanted to include the character they felt there was only room for a cameo appearance given the number of new characters more relevant to the film's storylines They decided to save Gambit for a larger role in a future film Before that decision was made Josh Holloway had been looked at for the part but was unavailable due to the filming schedule of his series Lost Channing Tatum was then chosen for the role but the character was written out of the script before he was officially cast
By October Gambit was believed to be appearing in the spin off film X Men Origins Wolverine set for release in Tatum was unable to re commit to the part at that time because of scheduling conflicts with GI Joe The Rise of Cobra and Taylor Kitsch was ultimately cast in the role Kitsch signed a three picture deal Fox executive Jeff Katz was confident that the character would be well received saying there is a level of strategy in how we grow these things and what characters can transition between multiple films indicating that the character could move on to his own standalone film as was the plan with Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool However Wolverine was not well received by critics and Kitsch's performance did not make him the breakout hit that Fox executives had expected In September Tatum expressed interest in taking over the role from Kitsch saying Gambit's my favorite I’m from New Orleans around that area My dad's from New Orleans and I like to do a Cajun accent I could do it for real No knock on Taylor Kitsch though ’cause I actually like his Gambit but I’ve always lived around Cajun people Gambit was always like the woman loving cigarette smoking drinking guy He was the punk rock of all the superheroes
X Men franchise producer Lauren Shuler Donner revealed in January that she had begun planning a Gambit film with Tatum She said it doesn't have to be a great big movie It's a thief in New Orleans it's a whole different story Tatum's on board and I have to get the studio on board That May Tatum officially signed on to star in a Gambit film that was intended to begin a new standalone franchise he would introduce his version of the character in X Men Apocalypse By October the producers were discussing the film's story and looking for a writer with Josh Zetumer hired in the role at the end of the month working off a story treatment by Gambit's comic creator Chris Claremont Alongside Donner and Kinberg Tatum was set to produce the film with Reid Carolin of their company Free Association In January Fox gave the film an October release date Over several months Tatum approached Bennett Miller Darren Aronofsky Gareth Evans and JC Chandor to direct the film but they all turned him down In May Zetumer completed his first draft of the script which Tatum described as a killer origin story that changed some of the tropes of these movies
In June Rupert Wyatt signed on to direct the film with Tatum saying We finally found someone that I really do believe wants to make Gambit Tatum added that the film was a really unique opportunity among superhero films and was no longer set to appear in Apocalypse He had begun learning to throw cards and sleight of hand tricks for the part from magician David Kwong a friend of Carolin's from College Filming was set to begin in New Orleans in late October or early November of that year By the end of July the film was believed to focus on mobsters and thieves rather than 'end of the world' stakes but Fox also wanted to load up on spectacle and make this character as popular as possible with a large million budget to be mostly spent in Louisiana Several actresses were being tested for the female lead including Léa Seydoux
Tatum was renegotiating his contract with Fox at the end of July and was believed to be close to dropping out of the project due to Fox's intention to have Tatum become one of the anchor characters of the franchise following the impending retirement of Hugh Jackman as the series' former lead character Wolverine This would be a major commitment for Tatum to make Backend compensation was also an issue Within days the issues had been resolved and Tatum was once again set to star and produce it was said that his participation hardly was in any real danger due to the commitments Tatum had already made to the project Rebecca Ferguson and Abbey Lee were also testing for the hotly contested female lead of Belladonna Boudreaux but Ferguson soon chose a role in The Girl on the Train instead Seydoux was cast in the role by the end of August
In September Wyatt left the film after changes to its schedule caused a clash with another project he was committed to Wyatt was also believed to have become skittish about directing the film due to wanting to rewrite the script and conceive the world that he is filming leading to differences in opinion on the script with Fox Tatum and Kinberg Wyatt later stated in March that he left the film because the studio slashed the budget quite considerably following the financial failure of Fantastic Four but was not willing to let the script be re written to match the new budget before the beginning of production which then was around weeks away
Fox began furiously meeting with potential replacements for Wyatt in hopes of keeping the film's release date including directors Doug Liman Joe Cornish Shane Black and F Gary Gray Liman was in final talks to take on the film in November He had already begun working on the screenplay with Tatum Carolin Zetumer and Kinberg The latter noted that the X Men franchise was beginning to branch out into different tones with the irreverent R rated Deadpool and that Gambit will have its own different flavor and tone to it will be more like a heist movie and a sexy thriller in a way In January filming was set for March
Fox officially removed Gambit from its October release date in February Liman soon chose to direct the film The Wall while waiting for a new draft of the Gambit script intending to then begin production on Gambit at the end of Tatum and Carolin were looking for a new writer to undertake the rewrite and pursue a different creative direction for the film while Liman was expected to discard Wyatt's casting of Seydoux and begin casting from scratch himself Kinberg explained in May that the group had collectively been unhappy with the film's script but were now very close to completing it He added that the most important thing is getting the tone and the voice right we are hoping that Gambit is like what Deadpool was—the start of a new franchise within the X Men universe—we want to make sure we get it right
In July Kinberg praised the script for Gambit and said that they were now aiming to begin filming at the beginning of However Liman left the project the next month in a mutual split with Fox choosing to instead direct the DC Comics based film Dark Universe Liman later explained that he is all about the script and I just wasn't feeling it I've gotta connect to the script
In November Gambit was expected to begin development again with a new director after Tatum completed work on the film Logan Lucky The next January Donner confirmed that Tatum was still attached to the project and a month later Kinberg described the film as being in active development He stated his hope for the project to be ready by the end of for filming to then begin at the start of He noted that there were already three X Men franchise films set for release in at that point so Gambit can wait for a moment Kinberg compared Tatum's commitment to the role of Gambit to the determination shown by Reynolds and Jackman to get their most recent X Men films Deadpool and Logan respectively made right and reiterated Fox's intention to build a new Gambit film franchise
At the end of May X Men producer Hutch Parker was unable to provide an update on the film but said there's still a desire and a passionate interest to see Gambit made Tatum reiterated that he was still actively working on the film in July and discussed the long development period for the film and the many delays to the production saying I think we got super super lucky I think a lot of setbacks we'll look at them in hindsight as giant blessings Because we were making it and we're writing a movie right at the turn of a paradigm shift in movies So we got lucky that we didn't just come out with ours which I don't think was fully formed It was a good idea We were going in the right direction And then we got to learn from two really beautifully different kinds of a complete paradigm shift in Logan and Deadpool Tatum added the next month that work on the Gambit script had started over and that we’re really getting to do some of the things we’ve always wanted to do with the script which he described as something that this genre of movie hasn't seen before In October Gore Verbinski was in talks to direct the film which was described as a high priority for Fox A week later the film was given a February release date and Verbinski was confirmed to direct By the end of the month casting for the film was well underway and Jenny Beavan was hired as costume designer The next month Lizzy Caplan was in talks to join the film as its female lead and location scouting for the film was taking place in New Orleans At some point Lil Rel Howery was attached to star in the film alongside Tatum By December filming was set to begin in New Orleans in March The next month Verbinski withdrew from the project due to a scheduling conflict though creative differences were also reported Fox subsequently moved the release date to June
Despite intending to keep the March filming start following Verbinski's departure Fox removed the film from its production schedule by the end of January At that time the search for Verbinski's replacement was underway while the new June release date was expected to play better for the film as a summer Marvel movie The film was described as having a comedic tone and revolving around a heist and had also undergone a rewrite to make it more New Orleans Fox expected another new draft of the script in March and still considered the film to be greenlit with a set budget despite the lack of director a new production start date of June was set dependent on a new director being found in time
The producers met with several directors for the film during April with Kinberg stating in May that he and Tatum were happy with the current script for the project and hoped to pick a new director in the next couple of weeks and shoot the movie maybe the end of this summer He reiterated that the film was still a priority for Fox believe it or not and added that the proposed acquisition of st Century Fox by Disney did not affect their plans for the film at that point In September Fox was believed to be interested in starting production on February The studio was still looking to shoot the film in New Orleans and was looking to use Big Easy Studios for production space after doing the same for Logan This new start date gave the studio time to hire a new crew for the film after previously hired crew members were let go By the end of the month Kinberg confirmed that they were now looking to begin production on Gambit in early He described the film as being loosely a romantic comedy due to Fox wanting the tone of each X Men spin off to be driven by the protagonist's personality such as Deadpool's raunchy comedic tone and Logan's western vibe and the character of Gambit being a hustler and a womanizer and we just felt like there was an attitude a swagger to him that lent itself to romantic comedy At that time Fox delayed the release of the film again pushing it to March By then Carolin was believed to have been working with Zetumer on the script
In October Kinberg confirmed that the version of the film they were developing was significantly different from their earlier plans which is why the tone had changed from a heist film to a romantic comedy He elaborated that some of the heist elements remained in the film due to Gambit still being a thief but the focus would be a love story between Gambit and Belladonna Kinberg compared the new direction to Mr Mrs Smith which he wrote as well as The Philadelphia Story and His Girl Friday At that time Daniel Woburn of Screen Rant opined that the film which he described as being in development hell since was likely to be canceled once Disney's acquisition of Fox was complete since Marvel Studios would want to integrate the X Men characters into their Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU
In January it was reported that Tatum was interested in directing the film along with starring Tatum and Carolin would have been co directors something the studio was not keen on given both had never directed before The next month Donner revealed that Gambit along with the rest of Fox's Marvel films was on hold until Disney's acquisition of Fox was complete A week after the acquisition was complete Kinberg said the film was being evaluated by Marvel In May Gambit was officially cancelled by Disney and removed from its release schedule In May Kinberg revealed the character Mister Sinister would have featured in the film after the Essex Corporation was teased in Apocalypse Mister Sinister had previously been rumored at one point to feature in The New Mutants
In February Carolin described the film as a romantic comedy superhero movie with a R rating and similar tone to Deadpool He also revealed that the film had been cast and was setting up production offices in anticipation of beginning shooting in New Orleans when Disney shelved the project Both Tatum and Carolin were open to returning to the project and character
