The Eight Great Yakṣa Generals Chinese Bād Ychā Djing or simply the Eight Yakṣa Generals are guardian deities in Buddhism
They are retainers of Vaiśravaṇa guardian of the north and king of the yakṣas
In East Asia they are also variously known as the Eight Great Yakṣas the Eight Great Heavenly Kings and the Eight Brothers of Vaiśravaṇa
The term yakṣarākṣasa has been used as a general term to denote the many classes of spirits in Indian mythology combining the words yakṣa and rākṣasa
According to Buddhist mythology Vaiśravaṇa is the chief of these beings and long ago dwelt together with them in the realm of darkness
When Vaiśravaṇa converted to Buddhism the many demonic spirits under his jurisdiction likewise assumed the role of devotees to the Buddha
Originally malevolent beings their conversion led to their deification as benevolent guardian deities
Among the many yakṣas under Vaiśravaṇa's rule the Eight Great Yakṣa Generals are ranked at the top of the hierarchy
Always at Vaiśravaṇa's command these deities command yakṣas that serve their king and are said to protect those who venerate them
A similar list may be found among the Twenty-Eight Great Yakṣa Generals
Their names are given in the Commentary on the Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra as follows
