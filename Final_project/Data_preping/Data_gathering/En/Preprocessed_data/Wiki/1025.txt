Stepanakert (Armenian: Ստեփանակերտ, romanized: Step'anakert, Eastern Armenian pronunciation: [əstɛpʰanaˈkɛɾt]), or Khankendi (Azerbaijani: Xankəndi, Azerbaijani: [xɑncænˈdi] (listen)), is the de facto capital and the largest city of the  breakaway Republic of Artsakh, de jure part of Azerbaijan, located within the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh
The city is located in a valley on the eastern slopes of the Karabakh mountain range, on the left bank of the Qarqarchay river.
The area that would become Stepanakert was originally an Armenian settlement named Vararakn
During the Soviet period, the city was made the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, becoming a hub for economic and industrial activity
In addition, the city became a hotbed for political activity, serving as the center for Armenian demonstrations calling for the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia
Stepanakert suffered extensive damage following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the outbreak of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War and passed into the hands of local Armenians with the establishment of the Republic of Artsakh.
The city is a regional center of education and culture, being home to Artsakh University, musical schools, and a palace of culture
The economy is based on the service industry and has varied enterprises, food processing, wine making, and silk weaving being the most important
As of 2021, the population of Stepanakert is 75,000.
Medieval Armenian sources attest to a settlement in the locale called Vararakn (Վարարակն, meaning "rapid spring" in Armenian)
Vararakn remained the local Armenian name for the town until 1923.
Most Azerbaijani sources claim that the settlement was built in late 18th century, as a place of rest for the heads of the Karabakh Khanate
In the first years, it was known as "Khan's village" (Azerbaijani: Xanın kəndi) because only the khan's family and his relatives lived there
By the 19th century, the settlement was renamed Khankendi ("village of the khan" in Azerbaijani).
The town was renamed Stepanakert ("City of Stepan") in 1923, after Armenian Bolshevik revolutionary Stepan Shahumian
The name is formed from the words Stepan (Armenian: Ստեփան) and "kert" (Armenian: կերտ, meaning "created").
According to medieval Armenian sources, the settlement was originally an Armenian village named Vararakn (Armenian: Վարարակն)
From the 10th-16th centuries, the settlement was a part of the Armenian Principality of Khachen
Over the centuries, it would successively pass into the hands of the meliks of Karabakh and the Karabakh khans before coming under the control of the Russian Empire in 1822.
Under the Russian Empire, the town was a part of the Shusha Uyezd of the Elisabethpol Governorate
According to the 19th century author Raffi, in 1826, the local Armenian meliks met with the Persian crown prince Abbas Mirza, who had invaded Karabakh with his army, in the village to reconcile relations with the Persians and ensure the safety of the Karabakh Armenian population
In 1847, Vararakn was a village of about 132 houses, consisting of 80 Armenian households, 52 Russian households, an Armenian church, and a cemetery
That same year, the village was renamed from Vararakn to Khankendi
By 1886, there were 52 houses in the settlement
The population of Khankendi consisted of retired soldiers and their descendants, who belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church
The population was engaged in agriculture, as well as various crafts, carriage, the renting of apartments (mainly to military personnel), and so on
After 1898, the tsarist government turned Khankendi into a Russian military garrison
The garrison consisted of barracks, hospitals, and a church, as well as, several houses where officers' families and a small local population, who supplied the military units with food, lived
The local population consisted of Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
In February 1920, after a body thought to be of an Azerbaijani soldier was found, an anti-Armenian riot took place in the village that claimed several hundred lives
Following the massacre of the Armenian population of Shusha in March 1920, the city received an influx of Armenians; as a result, Armenians formed the majority of the population from that time onwards
In the summer of 1920, the city was occupied by part of the Red Army
In 1923, Khankendi was renamed Stepanakert by the Soviet government in honor of Stepan Shahumian, a fallen Bolshevik party member and leader of the 26 Baku Commissars
The former regional capital was Shusha
However, following the depopulation of Armenians in Shusha, the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) was sited in Stepanakert
At the time of the formation of the NKAO, Stepanakert was a dilapidated settlement, where the number of surviving buildings barely reached 10 to 15
Some of the buildings were completely destroyed, others lacked doors and windows, while only walls remained from a number of buildings
During the first years of the oblast, some of the buildings were restored and many were rebuilt, roads were improved, and electricity and telephone communications were installed in the city
In time, Stepanakert grew to become the region's most important city (a status it received in 1940)
Its population rose from 10,459 in 1939 to 33,000 in 1978.
In 1926, municipal authorities adopted a new city layout designed by Aleksandr Tamanian; two additional designs for expansion were approved in the 1930s and 1960s, both of which retained Tamanian's initial plan
Several schools and two polyclinics were established, and an Armenian drama theater was founded in 1932 and named after Maxim Gorky
In 1960, the ensemble of the central square of Stepanakert was built with the building of the regional committee (now the NKR government)
This square, then named after Lenin, became the arena of many rallies demanding the transfer of the NKAO to the Armenian SSR
By 1968, the first outbreak of ethnic violence occurred in Stepanakert
In the city, a trial was held over an Azerbaijani director of the city school who was accused of murdering an Armenian girl
The Armenians, who considered the verdict of the Azerbaijani judge too lenient, gathered outside the court building and burned the car in which the criminal and judge were in.
Stepanakert served as Nagorno-Karabakh's main economic hub, and by the mid-1980s there were nineteen factories in operation in the city, including an electrical and asphalt plant
By the end of the Soviet era, Stepanakert had an agricultural technical school, a pedagogical institute, a medical and music school, a local history museum, and a drama theater.
The political and economic reforms that General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev undertook in 1985 saw a marked decentralization of Soviet authority
Armenians, in both the Armenian SSR and Nagorno-Karabakh, viewed Gorbachev's reform program as an opportunity to unite the two together
On 20 February 1988, tens of thousands of Armenians gathered to demonstrate in Stepanakert's Lenin Square (now Renaissance Square) to demand that the region be joined to Armenia
On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join the Armenian SSR, a move strongly opposed by the Soviet Azerbaijani authorities.
Relations between Stepanakert's Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who supported the Azerbaijani government's position, deteriorated in the following years
Inter-ethnic strife in the city in September 1988, encompassing physical attacks and burning of property, forced nearly all Azerbaijanis to flee the city
The Soviet Army took up positions in the city and announced a curfew three days later
In 1990 the army dispatched special forces units and various other elements to Stepanakert in order to prevent its takeover by Azerbaijani forces.
After Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Stepanakert was renamed Khankendi by the Azerbaijani government
Fighting broke out over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which, after three years of war, resulted in Armenian control of the region and a connecting corridor to Armenia to the west
Prior to the conflict, Stepanakert was the largest city of the NKAO, with a population of 70,000 out of a total 189,000 (Armenians at the time comprised 75% of the region's total population)
By early 1992, that figure had dropped to 50,000.
During the war, the city suffered immense damage from Azerbaijani bombardment, especially in early 1992 when the Azerbaijanis positioned BM-21 Grad rocket artillery in Shusha and rained down missiles over Stepanakert
A journalist for Time noted in an April 1992 article that "scarcely a single building [had] escaped damage in Stepanakert." It was not until 9 May 1992, with the capture of Shusha, that the ground bombardment ceased
The city, nevertheless, continued to suffer aerial bombardment until the end of the war
As a result, the majority of the city was in a severely damaged state
As of 2016, the city had not been completely restored from the war.
The city came under intense bombardment once again during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war
Residential areas were continuously hit by the Azerbaijani Army with cluster munitions throughout the war, starting on the first day of fighting, and residents were urged to use the city's bomb shelters
As Azerbaijani forces advanced on the city of Shusha, the Lachin corridor was shut down by Artsakh authorities.
With Azerbaijani forces 15 km (9.3 mi) from the capital, a ceasefire agreement was signed on 10 November
As part of the agreement, Russian peacekeepers were deployed to the region
Following the war, the population of Stepanakert swelled to 75,000 residents as a result of some 10,000 to 15,000 displaced people who lost their homes elsewhere in the Republic of Artsakh during the war.
Stepanakert is located on the Karabakh plateau, at an average altitude of 813 m (2,667 ft) above sea level.
The city has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) according to the Köppen climate classification system and a semi-arid climate (BS) according to the Trewartha climate classification system
In the month of January, the average temperature drops to 0.5 °C (33 °F)
In August, it averages around 22.6 °C (73 °F).

The president is directly elected for a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms
The current President is Arayik Harutyunyan
On 19 July 2012, Sahakyan was re-elected for a second term
He was again re-elected to a third term on 19 July 2017.
The National Assembly is a unicameral legislature
It has 33 members who are elected for five-year terms.
According to the data of the Transcaucasian Statistical Committee, extracted from the family lists of 1886, there were 71 houses and 279 residents registered in Khankendi (recorded as Ханкенды, Khankendy in Russian), of which 276 were Russians, 2 Armenians and 1 Tatar (later known as Azerbaijani), who were respectively Orthodox, Armenian Gregorian and Sunni Muslim by religion.
According to the 1910 publication of the Caucasian Calendar—a statistical almanac published by the office of the viceroy—there were 362 residents in the village of Khankendi of the Shusha uyezd of the Elisabethpol Governorate in 1908, most of whom were Russians
According to the 1912 publication of the Caucasian Calendar registered 1,076 residents, also mostly Russians

Montebello, United States: On 25 September 2005, Montebello, California and Stepanakert became sister cities
This prompted a complaint by the ambassador of Azerbaijan to the United States, Hafiz Pashayev, who sent a letter to California leaders, stating that the decision jeopardized peace talks between his country and Armenia
The letter was sent to then-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who deferred the letter to Montebello mayor Bill Molinari since it concerned a local, not a state, issue
Molinari responded to Pashayev that the city would go ahead with its plans to inaugurate Stepanakert under the sister city program
Stepanakert's relationship with Montebello is aimed at revitalizing the capital's economic infrastructure and building cultural and educational ties, as well as developing trade and health care between the two cities
Azerbaijan has described this as a contradictory foreign policy of the United States that supports the NKR government and Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan.
