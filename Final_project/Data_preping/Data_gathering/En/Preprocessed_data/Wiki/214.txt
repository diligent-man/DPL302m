artificial intelligence ai is intelligence demonstrated by machines as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans
ai research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals
the term artificial intelligence had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display human cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind such as learning and problem solving
this definition has since been rejected by major ai researchers who now describe ai in terms of rationality and acting rationally which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated
ai applications include advanced web search engines e g google recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix understanding human speech such as siri and alexa self driving cars e g tesla automated decision making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and go
as machines become increasingly capable tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of ai a phenomenon known as the ai effect
for instance optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be ai having become a routine technology
artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism followed by disappointment and the loss of funding known as an ai winter followed by new approaches success and renewed funding
ai research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding including simulating the brain modeling human problem solving formal logic large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior
in the first decades of the st century highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field and this technique has proved highly successful helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia
the various sub fields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools
the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects
general intelligence the ability to solve an arbitrary problem is among the field s long term goals
to solve these problems ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem solving techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics probability and economics
ai also draws upon computer science psychology linguistics philosophy and many other fields
the field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it
this raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human like intelligence these issues have previously been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity
computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that ai may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals
artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity
and have been common in fiction as in mary shelley s frankenstein or karel apek s r u r
these characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence
the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity
the study of mathematical logic led directly to alan turing s theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction
this insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the church turing thesis
the church turing thesis along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology information theory and cybernetics led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain
the first work that is now generally recognized as ai was mccullouch and pitts formal design for turing complete artificial neurons
by the s two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged
one vision known symbolic ai or gofai was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world
proponents included allen newell herbert a
simon and marvin minsky
closely associated with this approach was the heuristic search approach which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers
the second vision known as the connectionist approach sought to achieve intelligence through learning
proponents of this approach most prominently frank rosenblatt sought to connect perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons
james manyika and others have compared the two approaches to the mind symbolic ai and the brain connectionist
manyika argues that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period due in part to its connection to intellectual traditions of descarte boole gottlob frege bertrand russell and others
connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new prominence in recent decades
the field of ai research was born at a workshop at dartmouth college in
the attendees became the founders and leaders of ai research
they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing
computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english
by the middle of the s research in the u s
was heavily funded by the department of defense
and laboratories had been established around the world
researchers in the s and the s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field
herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do
marvin minsky agreed writing within a generation
the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved
they failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks
progress slowed and in in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill
and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the u s
and british governments cut off exploratory research in ai
the next few years would later be called an ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult
in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems
a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts
by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars
at the same time japan s fifth generation computer project inspired the u s and british governments to restore funding for academic research
however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longer lasting winter began
many researchers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition
a number of researchers began to look into sub symbolic approaches to specific ai problems
robotics researchers such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move survive and learn their environment
interest in neural networks and connectionism was revived by geoffrey hinton david rumelhart and others in the middle of the s
soft computing tools were developed in the s such as neural networks fuzzy systems grey system theory evolutionary computation and many tools drawn from statistics or mathematical optimization
ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by finding specific solutions to specific problems
the narrow focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results exploit more mathematical methods and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics
by solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence
faster computers algorithmic improvements and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception data hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around
according to bloomberg s jack clark was a landmark year for artificial intelligence with the number of software projects that use ai within google increased from a sporadic usage in to more than projects
he attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets
in a survey one in five companies reported they had incorporated ai in some offerings or processes
the amount of research into ai measured by total publications increased by in the years
numerous academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines
much of current research involves statistical ai which is overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems even highly successful techniques such as deep learning
this concern has led to the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several well funded institutions by the s
the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into sub problems
these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display
the traits described below have received the most attention
early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions
by the late s and s ai research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics
many of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a combinatorial explosion they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger
even humans rarely use the step by step deduction that early ai research could model
they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments
knowledge representation and knowledge engineering
allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real world facts
a representation of what exists is an ontology the set of objects relations concepts and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them
the most general ontologies are called upper ontologies which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain field of interest or area of concern
a truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge the set of facts that an average person knows
the semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic such as the web ontology language
ai research has developed tools to represent specific domains such as objects properties categories and relations between objects
situations events states and time
causes and effects
knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know
default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing
as well as other domains
among the most difficult problems in ai are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous
and the sub symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally
formal knowledge representations are used in content based indexing and retrieval
scene interpretation
clinical decision support
knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases
and other areas
an intelligent agent that can plan makes a representation of the state of the world makes predictions about how their actions will change it and make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choices
in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions
however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent reason under uncertainty and continuously re assess its environment and adapt
multi agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal
emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence
machine learning ml a fundamental concept of ai research since the field s inception
is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
unsupervised learning finds patterns in a stream of input
supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first and comes in two main varieties classification and numerical regression
classification is used to determine what category something belongs in the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs
regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change
both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as function approximators trying to learn an unknown possibly implicit function for example a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories spam or not spam
in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones
the agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space
transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem
computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization
natural language processing nlp
allows machines to read and understand human language
a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human written sources such as newswire texts
some straightforward applications of nlp include information retrieval question answering and machine translation
symbolic ai used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic
this failed to produce useful applications due to the intractability of logic and the breadth of commonsense knowledge
modern statistical techniques include co occurrence frequencies how often one word appears near another keyword spotting searching for a particular word to retrieve information transformer based deep learning which finds patterns in text and others
they have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level and by could generate coherent text machine perception
is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals and active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world
applications include speech recognition
facial recognition and object recognition
computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input ai is heavily used in robotics
localization is how a robot knows its location and maps its environment
when given a small static and visible environment this is easy however dynamic environments such as in endoscopy the interior of a patient s breathing body pose a greater challenge
motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into primitives such as individual joint movements
such movement often involves compliant motion a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object
robots can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood
for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate human computer interaction
however this tends to give na ve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are
moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject a machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence
there are several competing ideas about how to develop artificial general intelligence
hans moravec and marvin minsky argue that work in different individual domains can be incorporated into an advanced multi agent system or cognitive architecture with general intelligence
pedro domingos hopes that there is a conceptually straightforward but mathematically difficult master algorithm that could lead to agi
others believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain
or simulated child development
will someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges
many problems in ai can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many possible solutions reasoning can be reduced to performing a search
for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule
planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means ends analysis
robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space
simple exhaustive searches
are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers
the result is a search that is too slow or never completes
the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps
in some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal called pruning the search tree
heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies
heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size
a very different kind of search came to prominence in the s based on the mathematical theory of optimization
for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made
these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top
other related optimization algorithms include random optimization beam search and metaheuristics like simulated annealing
evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search
for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses
classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming
alternatively distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms
two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails
logic
is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well
for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning
and inductive logic programming is a method for learning
several different forms of logic are used in ai research
propositional logic involves truth functions such as or and not
first order logic
adds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other
fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between and to vague statements such as alice is old or rich or tall or hungry that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false
default logics non monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem
several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics
situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and time
causal calculus
belief calculus belief revision and modal logics
logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi agent systems have also been designed such as paraconsistent logics
many problems in ai including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information
ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics
bayesian networks
are a very general tool that can be used for various problems including reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm
learning using the expectation maximization algorithm
planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks
probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time e g hidden markov models or kalman filters
a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent
precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis
and information value theory
these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design
the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if diamond then pick up
controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems
classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match
they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai
these examples are known as observations or patterns
in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class
a class is a decision that has to be made
all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set
when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience
a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches
the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm
k nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid s
kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced k nearest neighbor in the s
the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability
neural networks are also used for classification
classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified such as the dataset size distribution of samples across classes dimensionality and the level of noise
model based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data
otherwise if no matching model is available and if accuracy rather than speed or scalability is the sole concern conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers especially svm tend to be more accurate than model based classifiers such as naive bayes on most practical data sets
neural networks
were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain
a simple neuron n accepts input from other neurons each of which when activated or fired casts a weighted vote for or against whether neuron n should itself activate
learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data one simple algorithm dubbed fire together wire together is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another
neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation in addition neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes
modern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data
they can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations
neural networks can be viewed as a type of mathematical optimization they perform gradient descent on a multi dimensional topology that was created by training the network
the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm
other learning techniques for neural networks are hebbian learning fire together wire together gmdh or competitive learning
the main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and recurrent neural networks which allow feedback and short term memories of previous input events
among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multi layer perceptrons and radial basis networks
deep learning
uses several layers of neurons between the network s inputs and outputs
the multiple layers can progressively extract higher level features from the raw input
for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces
deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition image classification and others
deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers
in a convolutional layer each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neuron s receptive field
this can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex
in a recurrent neural network the signal will propagate through a layer more than once
thus an rnn is an example of deep learning
rnns can be trained by gradient descent
however long term gradients which are back propagated can vanish that is they can tend to zero or explode that is they can tend to infinity known as the vanishing gradient problem
the long short term memory lstm technique can prevent this in most cases
specialized languages for artificial intelligence have been developed such as lisp prolog tensorflow and many others
hardware developed for ai includes ai accelerators and neuromorphic computing
ai is relevant to any intellectual task
modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here
frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect
in the s ai applications were at the heart of the most commercially successful areas of computing and have become a ubiquitous feature of daily life
ai is used in search engines such as google search
targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon
driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook
virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones and self driving cars
automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate
facial recognition apple s face id or microsoft s deepface
image labeling used by facebook apple s iphoto and tiktok
and spam filtering
there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve problems for specific industries or institutions
a few examples are
energy storage deepfakes medical diagnosis
military logistics or
supply chain management
game playing has been a test of ai s strength since the s
deep blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on may
in in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm s question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin
in march alphago won out of games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer go playing system to beat a professional go player without handicaps
other programs handle imperfect information games such as for poker at a superhuman level pluribus and cepheus
deepmind in the s developed a generalized artificial intelligence that could learn many diverse atari games on its own
by natural language processing systems such as the enormous gpt then by far the largest artificial neural network were matching human performance on pre existing benchmarks albeit without the system attaining a commonsense understanding of the contents of the benchmarks
deepmind s alphafold demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the d structure of a protein
other applications predict the result of judicial decisions create art such as poetry or painting and prove mathematical theorems
in wipo reported that ai was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of number of patent applications and granted patents the internet of things was estimated to be the largest in terms of market size
it was followed again in market size by big data technologies robotics ai d printing and the fifth generation of mobile services g
since ai emerged in the s ai related patent applications were filed by innovators and million scientific papers have been published by researchers with the majority of all ai related patent filings published since
companies represent out of the top ai patent applicants with universities or public research organizations accounting for the remaining four
the ratio of scientific papers to inventions has significantly decreased from in to in which is attributed to be indicative of a shift from theoretical research to the use of ai technologies in commercial products and services
machine learning is the dominant ai technique disclosed in patents and is included in more than one third of all identified inventions machine learning patents filed for a total of ai patents filed in with computer vision being the most popular functional application
ai related patents not only disclose ai techniques and applications they often also refer to an application field or industry
twenty application fields were identified in and included in order of magnitude telecommunications percent transportation percent life and medical sciences percent and personal devices computing and human computer interaction percent
other sectors included banking entertainment security industry and manufacturing agriculture and networks including social networks smart cities and the internet of things
ibm has the largest portfolio of ai patents with patent applications followed by microsoft with patent applications
ai s decisions making abilities raises the questions of legal responsibility and copyright status of created works
this issues are being refined in various jurisdictions
alan turing wrote in i propose to consider the question can machines think
he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour
the only thing visible is the behavior of the machine so it does not matter if the machine is conscious or has a mind or whether the intelligence is merely a simulation and not the real thing
he noted that we also don t know these things about other people but that we extend a polite convention that they are actually thinking
this idea forms the basis of the turing test
ai founder john mccarthy said artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence
russell and norvig agree and criticize the turing test
they wrote aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons other researchers and analysts disagree and have argued that ai should simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology
the intelligent agent paradigm
defines intelligent behavior in general without reference to human beings
an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success
any system that has goal directed behavior can be analyzed as an intelligent agent something as simple as a thermostat as complex as a human being as well as large systems such as firms biomes or nations
the intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the s and currently serves as the definition of the field
the paradigm has other advantages for ai
it provides a reliable and scientific way to test programs researchers can directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given goal function
it also gives them a common language to communicate with other fields such as mathematical optimization which is defined in terms of goals or economics which uses the same definition of a rational agent
no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history
the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks
this approach is mostly sub symbolic neat soft and narrow see below
critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers
symbolic ai or gofai simulated the high level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics
they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests
in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action
however the symbolic approach failed dismally on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning
moravec s paradox is the discovery that high level intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult
philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge
although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree
the issue is not resolved sub symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias
critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because sub symbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision
neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks
scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems
this issue was actively discussed in the s and s
but in the s mathematical methods and solid scientific standards became the norm a transition that russell and norvig termed the victory of the neats
finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems
soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation
soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks
ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence general ai directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field s long term goals
general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focussing on specific problems with specific solutions
the experimental sub field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively
the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do
this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior
mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field
stuart russell and peter norvig observe that most ai researchers don t care about the philosophy of ai as long as the program works they don t care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind
it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction
david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness
the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior
the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all
human information processing is easy to explain however human subjective experience is difficult to explain
for example it is easy to imagine a color blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like
computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing
computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind body problem
this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam
philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds
searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind
if a machine has a mind and subjective experience then it may also have sentience the ability to feel and if so then it could also suffer and thus it would be entitled to certain rights
any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights
this issue has been considered in fiction for centuries
and is now being considered by for example california s institute for the future however critics argue that the discussion is premature
a superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind
superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent
if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself
the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive self improvement
its intelligence would increase exponentially in an intelligence explosion and could dramatically surpass humans
science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario the singularity
because it is difficult or impossible to know the limits of intelligence or the capabilities of superintelligent machines the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable
robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either
this idea called transhumanism has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger
edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in
in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that we re in uncharted territory with ai
a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in long term unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed
subjective estimates of the risk vary widely for example michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimate of u s
jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classifies only of u s
jobs as high risk
unlike previous waves of automation many middle class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist states that the worry that ai could do to white collar jobs what steam power did to blue collar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously
jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for care related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy
ai provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments smart spyware face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets
terrorists criminals and rogue states may use other forms of weaponized ai such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons
by over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots
machine learning ai is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours
ai programs can become biased after learning from real world data
it is not typically introduced by the system designers but is learned by the program and thus the programmers are often unaware that the bias exists
bias can be inadvertently introduced by the way training data is selected
it can also emerge from correlations ai is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group
in some cases this assumption may be unfair
an example of this is compas a commercial program widely used by u s
courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist
propublica claims that the compas assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be overestimated than that of white defendants despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants
other examples where algorithmic bias can lead to unfair outcomes are when ai is used for credit rating or hiring
superintelligent ai may be able to improve itself to the point that humans could not control it
this could as physicist stephen hawking puts it spell the end of the human race
philosopher nick bostrom argues that sufficiently intelligent ai if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down
if this ai s goals do not fully reflect humanity s it might need to harm humanity to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down ultimately to better achieve its goal
he concludes that ai poses a risk to mankind however humble or friendly its stated goals might be
political scientist charles t
rubin argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would share our system of morality
the opinion of experts and industry insiders is mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly capable ai
stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates history professor yuval noah harari and spacex founder elon musk have all expressed serious misgivings about the future of ai
prominent tech titans including peter thiel amazon web services and musk have committed more than billion to nonprofit companies that champion responsible ai development such as openai and the future of life institute
mark zuckerberg ceo facebook has said that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans
other experts argue is that the risks are far enough in the future to not be worth researching
or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine
rodney brooks in particular has said that malevolent ai is still centuries away
friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans
eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk
machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions
the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas
machine ethics is also called machine morality computational ethics or computational morality
and was founded at an aaai symposium in
other approaches include wendell wallach s artificial moral agents
and stuart j
russell s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines
the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms
the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally
between and more than countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai
most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates usa and vietnam
others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia
the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology
henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november calling for a government commission to regulate ai
thought capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity
and have been a persistent theme in science fiction
a common trope in these works began with mary shelley s frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters
this includes such works as arthur c
clarke s and stanley kubrick s a space odyssey both with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix
in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture
isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories most notably the multivac series about a super intelligent computer of the same name
asimov s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics
while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimov s laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity
transhumanism the merging of humans and machines is explored in the manga ghost in the shell and the science fiction series dune
several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer
this appears in karel apek s r u r the films a i
artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k
dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence
as technology and research evolve and the world enters the third revolution of warfare following gunpowder and nuclear weapons the artificial intelligence arms race ensues between the united states china and russia three countries with the world s top five highest military budgets
intentions of being a world leader in ai research by have been declared by china s leader xi jinping and president putin of russia has stated that whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world
if russia were to become the leader in ai research president putin has stated russia s intent to share some of their research with the world so as to not monopolize the field similar to their current sharing of nuclear technologies maintaining science diplomacy relations the united states china and russia are some examples of countries that have taken their stances toward military artificial intelligence since as early as having established military programs to develop cyber weapons control lethal autonomous weapons and drones that can be used for surveillance
president putin announced that artificial intelligence is the future for all mankind and recognizes the power and opportunities that the development and deployment of lethal autonomous weapons ai technology can hold in warfare and homeland security as well as its threats
president putin s prediction that future wars will be fought using ai has started to come to fruition to an extent after russia invaded ukraine on february the ukrainian military is making use of the turkish bayraktar tb drones that still require human operation to deploy laser guided bombs but can take off land and cruise autonomously
ukraine has also been using switchblade drones supplied by the us and receiving information gathering by the united states s own surveillance operations regarding battlefield intelligence and national security about russia
similarly russia can use ai to help analyze battlefield data from surveillance footage taken by drones
reports and images show that russia s military has deployed kub bla suicide drones into ukraine with speculations of intentions to assassinate ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy
as research in the ai realm progresses there is pushback about the use of ai from the campaign to stop killer robots and world technology leaders have sent a petition to the united nations calling for new regulations on the development and use of ai technologies in including a ban on the use of lethal autonomous weapons due to ethical concerns for innocent civilian populations
with the ever evolving cyber attacks and generation of devices ai can be used for threat detection and more effective response by risk prioritization
with this tool some challenges are also presented such as privacy informed consent and responsible use
according to cisa the cyberspace is difficult to secure for the following factors the ability of malicious actors to operate from anywhere in the world the linkages between cyberspace and physical systems and the difficulty of reducing vulnerabilities and consequences in complex cyber networks
with the increased technological advances of the world the risk for wide scale consequential events rises
paradoxically the ability to protect information and create a line of communication between the scientific and diplomatic community thrives
the role of cybersecurity in diplomacy has become increasingly relevant creating the term of cyber diplomacy which is not uniformly defined and not synonymous with cyber defence
many nations have developed unique approaches to scientific diplomacy in cyberspace
dating back to when the czech national security authority nsa was appointed as the national authority for the cyber agenda
the role of cyber diplomacy strengthened in when the czech ministry of foreign affairs mfa detected a serious cyber campaign directed against its own computer networks
in three cyber diplomats were deployed to washington d c brussels and tel aviv with the goal of establishing active international cooperation focused on engagement with the eu and nato
the main agenda for these scientific diplomacy efforts is to bolster research on artificial intelligence and how it can be utilized in cybersecurity research development and overall consumer trust
czechinvest is a key stakeholder in scientific diplomacy and cybersecurity
for example in september they organized a mission to canada in september with a special focus on artificial intelligence
the main goal of this particular mission was a promotional effort on behalf of prague attempting to establish it as a future knowledge hub for the industry for interested canadian firms
cybersecurity is recognized as a governmental task dividing into three ministries of responsibility the federal ministry of the interior the federal ministry of defence and the federal foreign office
these distinctions promoted the creation of various institutions such as the german national office for information security the national cyberdefence centre the german national cyber security council and the cyber and information domain service
in a new strategy for artificial intelligence was established by the german government with the creation of a german french virtual research and innovation network holding opportunity for research expansion into cybersecurity
the adoption of the cybersecurity strategy of the european union an open safe and secure cyberspace document in by the european commission pushed forth cybersecurity efforts integrated with scientific diplomacy and artificial intelligence
efforts are strong as the eu funds various programs and institutions in the effort to bring science to diplomacy and bring diplomacy to science
some examples are the cyber security programme competence research innovation concordia which brings together member states cybersecurity for europe cse which brings together partners involving member states
in addition the european network of cybersecurity centres and competence hub for innovation and operations echo gathers partners with member states and sparta gathers partners involving member states
these efforts reflect the overall goals of the eu to innovate cybersecurity for defense and protection establish a highly integrated cyberspace among many nations and further contribute to the security of artificial intelligence
with the invasion of ukraine there has been a rise in malicious cyber activity against the united states ukraine and russia
a prominent and rare documented use of artificial intelligence in conflict is on behalf of ukraine using facial recognition software to uncover russian assailants and identify ukrainians killed in the ongoing war
though these governmental figures are not primarily focused on scientific and cyber diplomacy other institutions are commenting on the use of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity with that focus
for example georgetown university s center for security and emerging technology cset has the cyber ai project with one goal being to attract policymakers attention to the growing body of academic research whichexposes the exploitive consequences of ai and machine learning ml algorithms
this vulnerability can be a plausible explanation as to why russia is not engaging in the use of ai in conflict per andrew lohn a senior fellow at cset
in addition to use on the battlefield ai is being used by the pentagon to analyze data from the war analyzing to strengthen cybersecurity and warfare intelligence for the united states
as artificial intelligence grows and the overwhelming amount of news portrayed through cyberspace expands it is becoming extremely overwhelming for a voter to know what to believe
there are many intelligent codes referred to as bots written to portray people on social media with the goal of spreading miss information
the usa election is a victim of such actions
during the hillary clinton and donald trump campaign artificial intelligent bots from russia were spreading miss information about the candidates in order to help the trump campaign
analysts concluded that approximately of twitter tweets centered around the election were detected to come from bots
youtube in recent years has been used to spread political information as well
although there is no proof that the platform attempts to manipulate its viewers opinions youtubes ai algorithm recommends videos of similar variety
if a person begins to research right wing political podcasts then youtube s algorithm will recommend more right wing videos
the uprising in a program called deepfake a software used to replicate someone s face and words has also shown its potential threat
in a deepfake video of barack obama was released saying words he claims to have never said
while in a national election a deepfake will quickly be debunked the software has the capability to heavily sway a smaller local election
this tool holds a lot of potential for spreading misinformation and is monitored with great attention although it may be seen as a tool used for harm ai can help enhance election campaigns as well
ai bots can be programed to target articles with known misinformation
the bots can then indicate what is being misinformed to help shine light on the truth
ai can also be used to inform a person where each parts stands on a certain topic such as healthcare or climate change
the political leaders of a nation have heavy sway on international affairs
thus a political leader with a lack of interest for international collaborative scientific advancement can have a negative impact in the scientific diplomacy of that nation
the use of artificial intelligence ai has subtly grown to become part of everyday life
it is used every day in facial recognition software
it is the first measure of security for many companies in the form of a biometric authentication
this means of authentication allows even the most official organizations such as the united states internal revenue service to verify a person s identity via a database generated from machine learning
as of the year the united states irs requires those who do not undergo a live interview with an agent to complete a biometric verification of their identity via id me s facial recognition tool
in japan and south korea artificial intelligence software is used in the instruction of english language via the company riiid
riiid is a korean education company working alongside japan to give students the means to learn and use their english communication skills via engaging with artificial intelligence in a live chat
riid is not the only company to do this
an american company such as duolingo is very well known for their automated teaching of languages
babbel a german language learning program also uses artificial intelligence in its teaching automation allowing for european students to learn vital communication skills needed in social economic and diplomatic settings artificial intelligence will also automate the routine tasks that teachers need to do such as grading taking attendance and handling routine student inquiries
this enables the teacher to carry on with the complexities of teaching that an automated machine cannot handle
these include creating exams explaining complex material in a way that will benefit students individually and handling unique questions from students
unlike the human brain which possess generalized intelligence the specialized intelligence of ai can serve as a means of support to physicians internationally
the medical field has a diverse and profound amount of data in which ai can employ to generate a predictive diagnosis
researchers at an oxford hospital have developed artificial intelligence that can diagnose heart scans for heart disease and cancer
this artificial intelligence can pick up diminutive details in the scans that doctors may miss
as such artificial intelligence in medicine will better the industry giving doctors the means to precisely diagnose their patients using the tools available
the artificial intelligence algorithms will also be used to further improve diagnosis over time via an application of machine learning called precision medicine
furthermore the narrow application of artificial intelligence can use deep learning in order to improve medical image analysis
in radiology imaging ai uses deep learning algorithms to identify potentially cancerous lesions which is an important process assisting in early diagnosis
data analysis is a fundamental property of artificial intelligence that enables it to be used in every facet of life from search results to the way people buy product
according to newvantage partners over of top businesses have ongoing investments in artificial intelligence
according to ibm one of the world s leaders in technology of respondents from companies with over employees have adopted ai
recent data shows that the business market for artificial intelligence during the year was valued at billion
the business market for artificial intelligence is projected to be over billion by the year
to prevent harm ai deploying organizations need to play a central role in creating and deploying trustworthy ai in line with the principles of trustworthy ai and take accountability to mitigate the risks
with the exponential surge of artificial technology and communication the distribution of one s ideals and values has been evident in daily life
digital information is spread via communication apps such as whatsapp facebook meta snapchat instagram and twitter
however it is known that these sites relay specific information corresponding to data analysis
if a right winged individual were to do a google search google s algorithms would target that individual and relay data pertinent to that target audience
us president bill clinton noted in in the new century liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem
we know how much the internet has changed america and we are already an open society
however when the private sector uses artificial intelligence to gather data a shift in power from the state to the private sector may be seen
this shift in power specifically in large technological corporations could profoundly change how diplomacy functions in society
the rise in digital technology and usage of artificial technology enabled the private sector to gather immense data on the public which is then further categorized by race location age gender etc
the new york times calculates that the ten largest tech firms which have become gatekeepers in commerce finance entertainment and communications now have a combined market capitalization of more than trillion
in gross domestic product terms that would rank them as the world s third largest economy beyond the general lobbying of congressmen congresswomen companies such as facebook meta or google use collected data in order to reach their intended audiences with targeted information
multiple nations around the globe employ artificial intelligence to assist with their foreign policy decisions
the chinese department of external security affairs under the ministry of foreign affairs uses ai to review almost all its foreign investment projects for risk mitigation
the government of china plans to utilize artificial intelligence in its billion global infrastructure development plan called the belt and road initiative for political economic and environmental risk alleviation
over applications of artificial intelligence are being used by over united nations agencies in sectors ranging from health care dealing with issues such as combating covid to smart agriculture to assist the un in political and diplomatic relations
one example is the use of ai by the un global pulse program to model the effect of the spread of covid on internally displaced people idp and refugee settlements to assist them in creating an appropriate global health policy
novel ai tools such as remote sensing can also be employed by diplomats for collecting and analyzing data and near real time tracking of objects such as troop or refugee movements along borders in violent conflict zones
artificial intelligence can be used to mitigate vital cross national diplomatic talks to prevent translation errors caused by human translators
a major example is the anchorage meetings held between us and china aimed at stabilizing foreign relations only for it to have the opposite effect increasing tension and aggressiveness between the two nations due to translation errors caused by human translators
in the meeting when united states national security advisor to president joe biden jacob jeremiah sullivan stated we do not seek conflict but we welcome stiff competition and we will always stand up for our principles for our people and for our friends it was mistranslated into chinese as we will face competition between us and will present our stance in a very clear manner adding an aggressive tone to the speech
ai s ability for fast and efficient natural language processing and real time translation and transliteration makes it an important tool for foreign policy communication between nations and prevents unintended mistranslation
