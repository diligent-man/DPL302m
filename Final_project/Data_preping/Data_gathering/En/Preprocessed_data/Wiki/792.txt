ovary latin ovarium 'egg nut' found side body
ovary also secrete hormone play role menstrual cycle fertility
ovary progress many stage beginning prenatal period menopause
ovary whitish color located alongside lateral wall uterus region called ovarian fossa
ovarian fossa region bounded external iliac artery front ureter internal iliac artery
usually ovulation occurs one two ovary releasing egg menstrual cycle
side ovary closest fallopian tube connected infundibulopelvic ligament side point downwards attached uterus via ovarian ligament
ovary lie within peritoneal cavity either side uterus attached via fibrous cord called ovarian ligament
ovary uncovered peritoneal cavity tethered body wall via suspensory ligament ovary posterior extension broad ligament uterus
part broad ligament uterus cover ovary known mesovarium
ovarian pedicle made part fallopian tube mesovarium ovarian ligament ovarian blood vessels
surface ovary covered membrane consisting lining simple cuboidal-to-columnar shaped mesothelium called germinal epithelium
outer layer ovarian cortex consisting ovarian follicle stroma them
included follicle cumulus oophorus membrana granulosa granulosa cell inside corona radiata zona pellucida primary oocyte
theca follicle antrum liquor folliculi also contained follicle
hard distinguish cortex medulla follicle usually found medulla
follicular cell flat epithelial cell originate surface epithelium covering ovary
surrounded granulosa cell changed flat cuboidal proliferated produce stratified epithelium
since ovary able regulate hormone also play important role pregnancy fertility
egg cell oocyte released fallopian tube variety feedback mechanism stimulate endocrine system cause hormone level change
ovary site production periodical release egg cell female gametes
ovary developing egg cell oocyte mature fluid-filled follicles
typically one oocyte develops time others also mature simultaneously
follicle composed different type number cell according stage maturation size indicative stage oocyte development
oocyte completes maturation ovary surge luteinizing hormone secreted pituitary gland stimulates release oocyte rupture follicle process called ovulation
follicle remains functional reorganizes corpus luteum secretes progesterone order prepare uterus eventual implantation embryo
woman menopause testosterone produced ovary released directly blood stream
testosterone blood stream made conversion adrenal pre-androgens dhea androstenedione testosterone part body
estrogen responsible appearance secondary sex characteristic female puberty maturation maintenance reproductive organ mature functional state
progesterone function estrogen promoting menstrual cycle change endometrium
woman age experience decline reproductive performance leading menopause
although million oocyte present birth human ovary ovulate rest wasted
decline ovarian reserve appears occur constantly increasing rate age lead nearly complete exhaustion reserve age
ovarian reserve fertility decline age also parallel increase pregnancy failure meiotic error resulting chromosomally abnormal conceptions
ovarian reserve fertility perform optimally around year age
around year age menstrual cycle begin change follicle pool decrease significantly
variability aging could include environmental factor lifestyle habit genetic factors
woman inherited mutation dna repair gene brca undergo menopause prematurely suggesting naturally occurring dna damage oocyte repaired le efficiently woman inefficiency lead early reproductive failure
brca protein play key role type dna repair termed homologous recombinational repair known cellular process accurately repair dna double-strand breaks
showed dna double-strand break accumulate age human mouse primordial follicles
primordial follicle contain oocyte intermediate prophase stage meiosis
meiosis general process eukaryotic organism germ cell formed likely adaptation removing dna damage especially double-strand break germ line dna see meiosis origin function meiosis
also found expression key gene necessary homologous recombinational repair dna double-strand break brca mre rad atm decline age oocyte human mice
hypothesized dna double-strand break repair vital maintenance oocyte reserve decline efficiency repair age play key role ovarian aging
study identified genetic determinant ovarian ageing also found dna damage response process implicated suggests possible effect extending fertility woman would improve bone health reduce risk type diabetes increase risk hormone-sensitive cancers
variety testing method used order determine fertility based maternal age
method measuring amh anti-mullerian hormone level afc antral follicule count predict ovarian aging
amh level serve indicator ovarian aging since quality ovarian follicle determined
ovarian disease classified endocrine disorder disorder reproductive system
egg fails release follicle ovary ovarian cyst may form
woman follicle usual polycystic ovary syndrome inhibits follicle grow normally cause cycle irregularities
cryopreservation ovarian tissue often called ovarian tissue cryopreservation interest woman want preserve reproductive function beyond natural limit whose reproductive potential threatened cancer therapy example hematologic malignancy breast cancer
procedure take part ovary carry slow freezing storing liquid nitrogen whilst therapy undertaken
tissue thawed implanted near fallopian either orthotopic natural location heterotopic abdominal wall start produce new egg allowing normal conception take place
study procedure concluded ovarian tissue harvesting appears safe
ovarian tissue may also transplanted mouse immunocompromised scid mouse avoid graft rejection tissue harvested later mature follicle developed
former century medical author example galen referred woman's ovary female testes
ovary female analogous testis male gonad endocrine glands
ovary kind found female reproductive system many animal employ sexual reproduction including invertebrates
however develop different way invertebrate vertebrate truly homologous
many feature found human ovary common vertebrate including presence follicular cell tunica albuginea on
however many specie produce far greater number egg lifetime human fish amphibian may hundred even million fertile egg present ovary given time
specie fresh egg may developing germinal epithelium throughout life
corpus lutea found mammal elasmobranch fish specie remnant follicle quickly resorbed ovary
bird reptile monotreme egg relatively large filling follicle distorting shape ovary maturity
amphibian reptile ovarian medulla central part ovary hollow lymph-filled space
ovary teleost also often hollow case egg shed cavity open oviduct
certain nematode genus philometra parasitic ovary marine fish spectacular female long cm coiled ovary fish half length
although normal female vertebrate two ovary case species
bird platypus right ovary never matures left functional
exception include kiwi raptor ovary persist elasmobranch right ovary develops fully
primitive jawless fish teleost one ovary formed fusion paired organ embryo
