the ovary is an organ in the female reproductive system that produces an ovum
when released this travels down the fallopian tube into the uterus where it may become fertilized by a sperm
there is an ovary from latin ovarium egg nut found on each side of the body
the ovaries also secrete hormones that play a role in the menstrual cycle and fertility
the ovary progresses through many stages beginning in the prenatal period through menopause
it is also an endocrine gland because of the various hormones that it secretes
the ovaries are considered the female gonads
each ovary is whitish in color and located alongside the lateral wall of the uterus in a region called the ovarian fossa
the ovarian fossa is the region that is bounded by the external iliac artery and in front of the ureter and the internal iliac artery
this area is about cm x cm x cm in size
the ovaries are surrounded by a capsule and have an outer cortex and an inner medulla
the capsule is of dense connective tissue and is known as the tunica albuginea
usually ovulation occurs in one of the two ovaries releasing an egg each menstrual cycle
the side of the ovary closest to the fallopian tube is connected to it by infundibulopelvic ligament and the other side points downwards attached to the uterus via the ovarian ligament
other structures and tissues of the ovaries include the hilum
the ovaries lie within the peritoneal cavity on either side of the uterus to which they are attached via a fibrous cord called the ovarian ligament
the ovaries are uncovered in the peritoneal cavity but are tethered to the body wall via the suspensory ligament of the ovary which is a posterior extension of the broad ligament of the uterus
the part of the broad ligament of the uterus that covers the ovary is known as the mesovarium
the ovarian pedicle is made up part of the fallopian tube mesovarium ovarian ligament and ovarian blood vessels
the surface of the ovaries is covered with membrane consisting of a lining of simple cuboidal to columnar shaped mesothelium called the germinal epithelium
the outer layer is the ovarian cortex consisting of ovarian follicles and stroma in between them
included in the follicles are the cumulus oophorus membrana granulosa and the granulosa cells inside it corona radiata zona pellucida and primary oocyte
theca of follicle antrum and liquor folliculi are also contained in the follicle
also in the cortex is the corpus luteum derived from the follicles
the innermost layer is the ovarian medulla
it can be hard to distinguish between the cortex and medulla but follicles are usually not found in the medulla
follicular cells are flat epithelial cells that originate from surface epithelium covering the ovary
they are surrounded by granulosa cells that have changed from flat to cuboidal and proliferated to produce a stratified epithelium
the ovary also contains blood vessels and lymphatics
at puberty the ovary begins to secrete increasing levels of hormones
secondary sex characteristics begin to develop in response to the hormones
the ovary changes structure and function beginning at puberty
since the ovaries are able to regulate hormones they also play an important role in pregnancy and fertility
when egg cells oocytes are released from the fallopian tube a variety of feedback mechanisms stimulate the endocrine system which cause hormone levels to change
these feedback mechanisms are controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
messages from the hypothalamus are sent to the pituitary gland
in turn the pituitary gland releases hormones to the ovaries
from this signaling the ovaries release their own hormones
the ovaries are the site of production and periodical release of egg cells the female gametes
in the ovaries the developing egg cells or oocytes mature in the fluid filled follicles
typically only one oocyte develops at a time but others can also mature simultaneously
follicles are composed of different types and number of cells according to the stage of their maturation and their size is indicative of the stage of oocyte development
when an oocyte completes its maturation in the ovary a surge of luteinizing hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland which stimulates the release of the oocyte through the rupture of the follicle a process called ovulation
the follicle remains functional and reorganizes into a corpus luteum which secretes progesterone in order to prepare the uterus for an eventual implantation of the embryo
at maturity ovaries secrete estrogen androgen inhibin and progestogen
in women before menopause of testosterone is produced by the ovaries and released directly into the blood stream
the other of testosterone in the blood stream is made from conversion of the adrenal pre androgens dhea and androstenedione to testosterone in other parts of the body
estrogen is responsible for the appearance of secondary sex characteristics for females at puberty and for the maturation and maintenance of the reproductive organs in their mature functional state
progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy and the mammary glands for lactation
progesterone functions with estrogen by promoting menstrual cycle changes in the endometrium
as women age they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to menopause
this decline is tied to a decline in the number of ovarian follicles
although about million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary only about about of these ovulate and the rest are wasted
the decline in ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age
as ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions
the ovarian reserve and fertility perform optimally around years of age
around years of age the menstrual cycle begins to change and the follicle pool decreases significantly
the events that lead to ovarian aging remain unclear
the variability of aging could include environmental factors lifestyle habits or genetic factors
women with an inherited mutation in the dna repair gene brca undergo menopause prematurely suggesting that naturally occurring dna damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in these women and this inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure
the brca protein plays a key role in a type of dna repair termed homologous recombinational repair that is the only known cellular process that can accurately repair dna double strand breaks
titus et al
showed that dna double strand breaks accumulate with age in humans and mice in primordial follicles
primordial follicles contain oocytes that are at an intermediate prophase i stage of meiosis
meiosis is the general process in eukaryotic organisms by which germ cells are formed and it is likely an adaptation for removing dna damages especially double strand breaks from germ line dna see meiosis and origin and function of meiosis
homologous recombinational repair is especially promoted during meiosis
titus et al
also found that expression of key genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair of dna double strand breaks brca mre rad and atm decline with age in the oocytes of humans and mice
they hypothesized that dna double strand break repair is vital for the maintenance of oocyte reserve and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a key role in ovarian aging
a study identified genetic determinants of ovarian ageing also found that dna damage response processes are implicated and suggests that possible effects of extending fertility in women would improve bone health reduce risk of type diabetes and increase the risk of hormone sensitive cancers
a variety of testing methods can be used in order to determine fertility based on maternal age
many of these tests measure levels of hormones fsh and gnrh
methods such as measuring amh anti mullerian hormone levels and afc antral follicule count can predict ovarian aging
amh levels serve as an indicator of ovarian aging since the quality of ovarian follicles can be determined
ovarian diseases can be classified as endocrine disorders or as a disorders of the reproductive system
if the egg fails to release from the follicle in the ovary an ovarian cyst may form
small ovarian cysts are common in healthy women
some women have more follicles than usual polycystic ovary syndrome which inhibits the follicles to grow normally and this will cause cycle irregularities
cryopreservation of ovarian tissue often called ovarian tissue cryopreservation is of interest to women who want to preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer
the procedure is to take a part of the ovary and carry out slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen whilst therapy is undertaken
tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian either orthotopic on the natural location or heterotopic on the abdominal wall where it starts to produce new eggs allowing normal conception to take place
a study of procedures concluded that ovarian tissue harvesting appears to be safe
the ovarian tissue may also be transplanted into mice that are immunocompromised scid mice to avoid graft rejection and tissue can be harvested later when mature follicles have developed
in former centuries medical authors for example galen referred to a woman s ovaries as female testes
birds have only one functional ovary the left while the other remains vestigial
ovaries in females are analogous to testes in males in that they are both gonads and endocrine glands
ovaries of some kind are found in the female reproductive system of many animals that employ sexual reproduction including invertebrates
however they develop in a very different way in most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates and are not truly homologous
many of the features found in human ovaries are common to all vertebrates including the presence of follicular cells tunica albuginea and so on
however many species produce a far greater number of eggs during their lifetime than do humans so that in fish and amphibians there may be hundreds or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary at any given time
in these species fresh eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout life
corpora lutea are found only in mammals and in some elasmobranch fish in other species the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary
in birds reptiles and monotremes the egg is relatively large filling the follicle and distorting the shape of the ovary at maturity
amphibians and reptiles have no ovarian medulla the central part of the ovary is a hollow lymph filled space
the ovary of teleosts is also often hollow but in this case the eggs are shed into the cavity which opens into the oviduct
certain nematodes of the genus philometra are parasitic in the ovary of marine fishes and can be spectacular with females as long as cm coiled in the ovary of a fish half this length
although most normal female vertebrates have two ovaries this is not the case in all species
in most birds and in platypuses the right ovary never matures so that only the left is functional
exceptions include the kiwi and some but not all raptors in which both ovaries persist in some elasmobranchs only the right ovary develops fully
in the primitive jawless fish and some teleosts there is only one ovary formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo
