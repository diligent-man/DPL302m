Chinese martial arts often called by the umbrella terms kung fu ˈkʌŋ ˈfuː Chinese pinyin gōngfu Cantonese Yale gūng fū kuoshu gush or wushu wsh are multiple fighting styles that have developed over the centuries in Greater China
These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits identified as families of martial arts
Examples of such traits include Shaolinquan physical exercises involving All Other Animals mimicry or training methods inspired by Old Chinese philosophies religions and legends
Styles that focus on qi manipulation are called internal nijiāqun while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called external wijiāqun
Geographical association as in northern běiqun and southern nnqun is another popular classification method
Kung fu wushu and Cultivation are loanwords from Cantonese and Mandarin respectively that in English are used to refer to Chinese martial arts
However the Chinese terms kung fu and wushu listen Mandarin help·info Cantonese Yale muh seuht have distinct meanings
The Chinese equivalent of the term Chinese martial arts would be Zhongguo wushu Chinese pinyin zhōnggu wsh Mandarin
In Chinese the term kung fu refers to any skill that is acquired through learning or practice
It is a compound word composed of the words gōng meaning work achievement or merit and fū which is a particle or nominal suffix with diverse meanings
It is formed from the two Chinese characters w meaning martial or military and or sh which translates into art discipline skill or method
The term wushu has also become the name for the modern sport of wushu an exhibition and full-contact sport of bare-handed and weapon forms adapted and judged to a set of aesthetic criteria for points developed since in the People's Republic of China
Qunf is another Chinese term for Chinese martial arts
It means fist method or the law of the fist qun means boxing or fist and f means law way or method although as a compound term it usually translates as boxing or fighting technique The name of the Japanese martial art kempō is represented by the same hanzi characters
The genesis of Chinese martial arts has been attributed to the need for self-defense hunting techniques and military training in ancient China
Hand-to-hand combat and weapons practice were important in training ancient Chinese soldiers
Detailed knowledge about the state and development of Chinese martial arts became available from the Nanjing decade as the Central Guoshu Institute established by the Kuomintang regime made an effort to compile an encyclopedic survey of martial arts schools
Since the s the People's Republic of China has organized Chinese martial arts as an exhibition and full-contact sport under the heading of wushu
According to legend Chinese martial arts originated during the semi-mythical Xia Dynasty more than years ago
It is said the Yellow Emperor Huangdi legendary date of ascension BCE introduced the earliest fighting systems to China
The Yellow Emperor is described as a famous general who before becoming China's leader wrote lengthy treatises on medicine astrology and the martial arts
One of his main opponents was Chi You who was credited as the creator of jiao di a forerunner to the modern art of Chinese wrestling
The earliest references to Chinese martial arts are found in the Spring and Autumn Annals th century BCE where a hand-to-hand combat theory one that integrates notions of hard and soft techniques is mentioned
A combat wrestling system called jul or jiol is mentioned in the Classic of Rites
This combat system included techniques such as strikes throws joint manipulation and pressure point attacks
Jiao Di became a sport during the Qin Dynasty BCE
The Han History Bibliographies record that by the Former Han BCE CE there was a distinction between no-holds-barred weaponless fighting which it calls shǒub for which training manuals had already been written and sportive wrestling then known as jul
Wrestling is also documented in the Shǐ J Records of the Grand Historian written by Sima Qian ca
In the Tang Dynasty descriptions of sword dances were immortalized in poems by Li Bai
In the Song and Yuan dynasties xiangpu contests were sponsored by the imperial courts
The modern concepts of wushu were fully developed by the Ming and Qing dynasties
The ideas associated with Chinese martial arts changed with the evolution of Chinese society and over time acquired some philosophical bases Passages in the Zhuangzi a Taoist text pertain to the psychology and practice of martial arts
Zhuang Zi its eponymous author is believed to have lived in the th century BCE
The Tao Te Ching often credited to Lao Zi is another Taoist text that contains principles applicable to martial arts
According to one of the classic texts of Confucianism Zhou Li Archery and charioteering were part of the six arts Chinese pinyin liu yi including rites music calligraphy and mathematics of the Zhou Dynasty BCE
The Art of War written during the th century BCE by Sun Tzu deals directly with military warfare but contains ideas that are used in the Chinese martial arts
Taoist practitioners have been practicing Tao Yin physical exercises similar to Qigong that was one of the progenitors to T'ai chi ch'uan from as early as BCE
In CE Six Chapters of Hand Fighting were included in the Han Shu history of the Former Han Dynasty written by Pan Ku
Also the noted physician Hua Tuo composed the Five Animals Play—tiger deer monkey bear and bird around CE
Taoist philosophy and their approach to health and exercise have influenced the Chinese martial arts to a certain extent
Direct reference to Taoist concepts can be found in such styles as the Eight Immortals which uses fighting techniques attributed to the characteristics of each immortal
In CE a Shaolin temple was built in the Song mountain Henan province
The first monk who preached Buddhism there was the Indian monk named Buddhabhadra Ftubtulu simply called Batuo by the Chinese
There are historical records that Batuo's first Chinese disciples Huiguang and Sengchou both had exceptional martial skills
For example Sengchou's skill with the tin staff is even documented in the Chinese Buddhist canon
After Buddhabadra another Indian monk named Bodhidharma Ptdm also known as Damo by the Chinese came to Shaolin in CE
His Chinese disciple Huike was also a highly trained martial arts expert
There are implications that these first three Chinese Shaolin monks Huiguang Sengchou and Huike may have been military men before entering the monastic life
The Shaolin style of kung fu is regarded as one of the first institutionalized Chinese martial arts
The oldest evidence of Shaolin participation in combat is a stele from CE that attests to two occasions a defense of the Shaolin Monastery from bandits around CE and their subsequent role in the defeat of Wang Shichong at the Battle of Hulao in CE
From the th to the th centuries there are no extant documents that provide evidence of Shaolin participation in combat
Between the th and th centuries at least forty sources exist to provide evidence both that monks of Shaolin practiced martial arts and that martial practice became an integral element of Shaolin monastic life
The earliest appearance of the frequently cited legend concerning Bodhidharma's supposed foundation of Shaolin Kung Fu dates to this period
The origin of this legend has been traced to the Ming period's Yijin Jing or Muscle Change Classic a text written in attributed to Bodhidharma
References of martial arts practice in Shaolin appear in various literary genres of the late Ming the epitaphs of Shaolin warrior monks martial-arts manuals military encyclopedias historical writings travelogues fiction and poetry
However these sources do not point out any specific style that originated in Shaolin
These sources in contrast to those from the Tang period refer to Shaolin methods of armed combat
These include a skill for which Shaolin monks became famous the staff gn Cantonese gwan
The Ming General Qi Jiguang included a description of Shaolin Quan Fa Chinese WadeGiles Shao Lin Ch'an Fa lit
'Shaolin fist technique' Japanese Shorin Kempo and staff techniques in his book Ji Xiao Xin Shu which can translate as New Book Recording Effective Techniques
When this book spread across East Asia it had a great influence on the development of martial arts in regions such as Okinawa and Korea
Most fighting styles that are being practiced as traditional Chinese martial arts today reached their popularity within the th century
Some of these include Baguazhang Drunken Boxing Eagle Claw Five Animals Xingyi Hung Gar Monkey Bak Mei Pai Northern Praying Mantis Southern Praying Mantis Fujian White Crane Jow Ga Wing Chun and Taijiquan
The increase in the popularity of those styles is a result of the dramatic changes occurring within the Chinese society
In the Righteous and Harmonious Fists rose against foreign occupiers and Christian missionaries in China
This uprising is known in the West as the Boxer Rebellion due to the martial arts and calisthenics practiced by the rebels
Empress Dowager Cixi gained control of the rebellion and tried to use it against the foreign powers
The failure of the rebellion led ten years later to the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the creation of the Chinese Republic
The present view of Chinese martial arts is strongly influenced by the events of the Republican Period
In the transition period between the fall of the Qing Dynasty as well as the turmoil of the Japanese invasion and the Chinese Civil War Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public as many martial artists were encouraged to openly teach their art
At that time some considered martial arts as a means to promote national pride and build a strong nation
As a result many training manuals were published a training academy was created two national examinations were organized and demonstration teams traveled overseas
Numerous martial arts associations were formed throughout China and in various overseas Chinese communities
The Central Guoshu Academy Zhongyang Guoshuguan established by the National Government in and the Jing Wu Athletic Association founded by Huo Yuanjia in are examples of organizations that promoted a systematic approach for training in Chinese martial arts
A series of provincial and national competitions were organized by the Republican government starting in to promote Chinese martial arts
In at the th Olympic Games in Berlin a group of Chinese martial artists demonstrated their art to an international audience for the first time
The term kuoshu or guoshu meaning national art rather than the colloquial term gongfu was introduced by the Kuomintang in an effort to more closely associate Chinese martial arts with national pride rather than individual accomplishment
Chinese martial arts experienced rapid international dissemination with the end of the Chinese Civil War and the founding of the People's Republic of China on October
Many well known martial artists chose to escape from the PRC's rule and migrate to Taiwan Hong Kong and other parts of the world
Those masters started to teach within the overseas Chinese communities but eventually they expanded their teachings to include people from other ethnic groups
Within China the practice of traditional martial arts was discouraged during the turbulent years of the Chinese Cultural Revolution
Like many other aspects of traditional Chinese life martial arts were subjected to a radical transformation by the People's Republic of China to align them with Maoist revolutionary doctrine
The PRC promoted the committee-regulated sport of Wushu as a replacement for independent schools of martial arts
This new competition sport was disassociated from what was seen as the potentially subversive self-defense aspects and family lineages of Chinese martial arts
In the government established the All-China Wushu Association as an umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training
The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the lead in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts
During this period a national Wushu system that included standard forms teaching curriculum and instructor grading was established
Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level
The suppression of traditional teaching was relaxed during the Era of Reconstruction as Communist ideology became more accommodating to alternative viewpoints
In the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to reevaluate the teaching and practice of Wushu
In the Chinese National Research Institute of Wushu was established as the central authority for the research and administration of Wushu activities in the People's Republic of China
Changing government policies and attitudes towards sports in general led to the closing of the State Sports Commission the central sports authority in
This closure is viewed as an attempt to partially de-politicize organized sports and move Chinese sport policies towards a more market-driven approach
As a result of these changing sociological factors within China both traditional styles and modern Wushu approaches are being promoted by the Chinese government
Chinese martial arts are an integral element of th-century Chinese popular culture
Wuxia or martial arts fiction is a popular genre that emerged in the early th century and peaked in popularity during the s to s
Wuxia films were produced from the s
The Kuomintang suppressed wuxia accusing it of promoting superstition and violent anarchy
Because of this wuxia came to flourish in British Hong Kong and the genre of kung fu movie in Hong Kong action cinema became wildly popular coming to international attention from the s
The genre underwent a drastic decline in the late s as the Hong Kong film industry was crushed by economic depression
In the wake of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon there has been somewhat of a revival of Chinese-produced wuxia films aimed at an international audience including Zhang Yimou's Hero House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower as well as Su Chao-pin and John Woo's Reign of Assassins
China has a long history of martial arts traditions that includes hundreds of different styles
Over the past two thousand years many distinctive styles have been developed each with its own set of techniques and ideas
There are also common themes to the different styles which are often classified by families jiā sects pai or schools men
There are styles that mimic movements from animals and others that gather inspiration from various Chinese philosophies myths and legends
Some styles put most of their focus into the harnessing of qi while others concentrate on competition
Chinese martial arts can be split into various categories to differentiate them For example external and internal
Chinese martial arts can also be categorized by location as in northern and southern as well referring to what part of China the styles originated from separated by the Yangtze River Chinese martial arts may even be classified according to their province or city
The main perceived difference between northern and southern styles is that the northern styles tend to emphasize fast and powerful kicks high jumps and generally fluid and rapid movement while the southern styles focus more on strong arm and hand techniques and stable immovable stances and fast footwork
Examples of the northern styles include changquan and xingyiquan
Examples of the southern styles include Bak Mei Wuzuquan Choy Li Fut and Wing Chun
Chinese martial arts can also be divided according to religion imitative-styles and family styles such as Hung Gar
There are distinctive differences in the training between different groups of the Chinese martial arts regardless of the type of classification
However few experienced martial artists make a clear distinction between internal and external styles or subscribe to the idea of northern systems being predominantly kick-based and southern systems relying more heavily on upper-body techniques
Most styles contain both hard and soft elements regardless of their internal nomenclature
Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner's skills unbalanced or deficient as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole
If such differences did once exist they have since been blurred
Chinese martial arts training consists of the following components basics forms applications and weapons different styles place varying emphasis on each component
In addition philosophy ethics and even medical practice are highly regarded by most Chinese martial arts
A complete training system should also provide insight into Chinese attitudes and culture
The Basics are a vital part of any martial training as a student cannot progress to the more advanced stages without them
Basics are usually made up of rudimentary techniques conditioning exercises including stances
Basic training may involve simple movements that are performed repeatedly other examples of basic training are stretching meditation striking throwing or jumping
Without strong and flexible muscles management of Qi or breath and proper body mechanics it is impossible for a student to progress in the Chinese martial arts
A common saying concerning basic training in Chinese martial arts is as follows
Stances steps or are structural postures employed in Chinese martial arts training
They represent the foundation and the form of a fighter's base
Each style has different names and variations for each stance
Stances may be differentiated by foot position weight distribution body alignment etc
Stance training can be practiced statically the goal of which is to maintain the structure of the stance through a set time period or dynamically in which case a series of movements is performed repeatedly
The Horse stance q m bm b and the bow stance are examples of stances found in many styles of Chinese martial arts
In many Chinese martial arts meditation is considered to be an important component of basic training
Meditation can be used to develop focus mental clarity and can act as a basis for qigong training
The concept of qi or ch'i is encountered in a number of Chinese martial arts
Qi is variously defined as an inner energy or life force that is said to animate living beings as a term for proper skeletal alignment and efficient use of musculature sometimes also known as fa jin or jin or as a shorthand for concepts that the martial arts student might not yet be ready to understand in full
These meanings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
The existence of qi as a measurable form of energy as discussed in traditional Chinese medicine has no basis in the scientific understanding of physics medicine biology or human physiology
There are many ideas regarding the control of one's qi energy to such an extent that it can be used for healing oneself or others
Some styles believe in focusing qi into a single point when attacking and aim at specific areas of the human body
Such techniques are known as dim mak and have principles that are similar to acupressure
Most Chinese styles also make use of training in the broad arsenal of Chinese weapons for conditioning the body as well as coordination and strategy drills
Weapons training qxi is generally carried out after the student becomes proficient with the basic forms and applications training
The basic theory for weapons training is to consider the weapon as an extension of the body
It has the same requirements for footwork and body coordination as the basics
The process of weapon training proceeds with forms forms with partners and then applications
Most systems have training methods for each of the Eighteen Arms of Wushu shbābānbīngq in addition to specialized instruments specific to the system
Application refers to the practical use of combative techniques
Chinese martial arts techniques are ideally based on efficiency and effectiveness
Application includes non-compliant drills such as Pushing Hands in many internal martial arts and sparring which occurs within a variety of contact levels and rule sets
When and how applications are taught varies from style to style
Today many styles begin to teach new students by focusing on exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on
These drills are often semi-compliant meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique in order to allow its demonstrative clean execution
In more resisting drills fewer rules apply and students practice how to react and respond
'Sparring' refers to a more advanced format which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury
Competitive sparring disciplines include Chinese kickboxing Snshǒu and Chinese folk wrestling Shuāijiāo which were traditionally contested on a raised platform arena or Liti
Liti were used in public challenge matches first appeared in the Song Dynasty
The objective for those contests was to knock the opponent from a raised platform by any means necessary
San Shou represents the modern development of Lei Tai contests but with rules in place to reduce the chance of serious injury
Many Chinese martial art schools teach or work within the rule sets of Sanshou working to incorporate the movements characteristics and theory of their style
Chinese martial artists also compete in non-Chinese or mixed Combat sport including boxing kickboxing and Mixed martial arts
Forms or taolu Chinese pinyin tol in Chinese are series of predetermined movements combined so they can be practiced as a continuous set of movements
Forms were originally intended to preserve the lineage of a particular style branch and were often taught to advanced students selected for that purpose
Forms contained both literal representative and exercise-oriented forms of applicable techniques that students could extract test and train in through sparring sessions
Today many consider taolu to be one of the most important practices in Chinese martial arts
Traditionally they played a smaller role in training for combat application and took a back seat to sparring drilling and conditioning
Forms gradually build up a practitioner's flexibility internal and external strength speed and stamina and they teach balance and coordination
Many styles contain forms that use weapons of various lengths and types using one or two hands
Some styles focus on a certain type of weapon
Forms are meant to be both practical usable and applicable as well as to promote fluid motion meditation flexibility balance and coordination
Students are encouraged to visualize an attacker while training the form
There are two general types of taolu in Chinese martial arts
Most common are solo forms performed by a single student
There are also sparring forms — choreographed fighting sets performed by two or more people
Sparring forms were designed both to acquaint beginning fighters with basic measures and concepts of combat and to serve as performance pieces for the school
Weapons-based sparring forms are especially useful for teaching students the extension range and technique required to manage a weapon
The term taolu is a shortened version of Tao Lu Yun Dong an expression introduced only recently with the popularity of modern wushu
This expression refers to exercise sets and used in the context of athletics or sport
In contrast in traditional Chinese martial arts alternative terminologies for the training of 'sets or forms are
lian quan tao practicing a sequence of fists
lian quan jiao practicing fists and feet
dui da and dui lian fighting setsTraditional sparring sets called dui da or dui lian were an essential part of Chinese martial arts for centuries
Dui lian means to train by a pair of combatants opposing each other—the character lian refers to practice to train to perfect one's skill to drill
As well often one of these terms are also included in the name of fighting sets shuang yan paired practice zheng sheng to struggle with strength for victory di match the character suggests to strike an enemy and to break po
Generally there are or drills or 'exchangesgroupings' of attacks and counterattacks in each dui lian set
These drills were considered only generic patterns and never meant to be considered inflexible 'tricks'
Students practiced smaller partsexchanges individually with opponents switching sides in a continuous flow
Dui lian were not only sophisticated and effective methods of passing on the fighting knowledge of the older generation but they were also essential and effective training methods
The relationship between single sets and contact sets is complicated in that some skills cannot be developed with solo 'sets' and conversely with dui lian
Unfortunately it appears that most traditional combat oriented dui lian and their training methodology have disappeared especially those concerning weapons
In modern Chinese martial arts most of the dui lian are recent inventions designed for light props resembling weapons with safety and drama in mind
The role of this kind of training has degenerated to the point of being useless in a practical sense and at best is just performance
By the early Song period sets were not so much individual isolated technique strung together but rather were composed of techniques and counter technique groupings
It is quite clear that sets and fighting two-person sets have been instrumental in traditional Chinese martial arts for many hundreds of years—even before the Song Dynasty
There are images of two-person weapon training in Chinese stone painting going back at least to the Eastern Han Dynasty
According to what has been passed on by the older generations the approximate ratio of contact sets to single sets was approximately
In other words about of the 'sets' practiced at Shaolin were contact sets dui lian and two-person drill training
This ratio is in part evidenced by the Qing Dynasty mural at Shaolin
For most of its history Shaolin martial arts was mostly weapon-focused staves were used to defend the monastery not bare hands
Even the more recent military exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing Dynasties involved weapons
According to some traditions monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting so that they could protect the monastery
Although wrestling has been as sport in China for centuries weapons have been an essential part of Chinese wushu since ancient times
If one wants to talk about recent or 'modern' developments in Chinese martial arts including Shaolin for that matter it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting
During the Northern Song Dynasty - AD when platform fighting is known as Da Laitai Title Fights Challenge on Platform first appeared these fights were with only swords and staves
Although later when bare hand fights appeared as well it was the weapons events that became the most famous
These open-ring competitions had regulations and were organized by government organizations the public also organized some
The government competitions held in the capital and prefectures resulted in appointments for winners to military posts
Even though forms in Chinese martial arts are intended to depict realistic martial techniques the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat
Many forms have been elaborated upon on the one hand to provide better combat preparedness and on the other hand to look more aesthetically pleasing
One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher stretching kicks
These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are used in forms for exercise purposes
Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions
This has led to criticisms by traditionalists of the endorsement of the more acrobatic show-oriented Wushu competition
Historically forms were often performed for entertainment purposes long before the advent of modern Wushu as practitioners have looked for supplementary income by performing on the streets or in theaters
Documentation in ancient literature during the Tang Dynasty and the Northern Song Dynasty suggests some sets including two + person sets dui da also called dui lian became very elaborate and 'flowery' many mainly concerned with aesthetics
During this time some martial arts systems devolved to the point that they became popular forms of martial art storytelling entertainment shows
This created an entire category of martial arts known as Hua Fa Wuyi
During the Northern Song period it was noted by historians this type of training had a negative influence on training in the military
Many traditional Chinese martial artists as well as practitioners of modern sport combat have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the art than sparring and drill application while most continue to see traditional forms practice within the traditional context—as vital to both proper combat execution the Shaolin aesthetic as an art form as well as upholding the meditative function of the physical art form
Another reason why techniques often appear different in forms when contrasted with sparring application is thought by some to come from the concealment of the actual functions of the techniques from outsiders
Forms practice is mostly known for teaching combat techniques yet when practicing forms the practitioner focuses on posture breathing and performing the techniques of both right and left sides of the body
Its Chinese character is made of two parts the first meaning walk or stop zhǐ and the second meaning lance gē
This implies that wu is a defensive use of combat
The term wushu meaning martial arts goes back as far as the Liang Dynasty in an anthology compiled by Xiao Tong Prince Zhaoming d
The term is found in the second verse of a poem by Yan Yanzhi titled Huang Taizi Shidian Hui Zuoshi
The great man grows the many myriad things
He promotes fully the cultural mandatesTranslation from Echoes of the Past by Yan Yanzhi The term wushu is also found in a poem by Cheng Shao from the Ming Dynasty
The earliest term for 'martial arts' can be found in the Han History BC-AD was military fighting techniques bīng jqio
During the Song period c the name changed to martial arts wy
In the name was changed to national arts gush when the National Martial Arts Academy was established in Nanjing
The term reverted to wsh under the People's Republic of China during the early s
As forms have grown in complexity and quantity over the years and many forms alone could be practiced for a lifetime modern styles of Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms and do not practice application at all
These styles are primarily aimed at exhibition and competition and often include more acrobatic jumps and movements added for enhanced visual effect compared to the traditional styles
Those who generally prefer to practice traditional styles focused less on exhibition are often referred to as traditionalists
Some traditionalists consider the competition forms of today's Chinese martial arts as too commercialized and losing much of their original values
Traditional Chinese schools of martial arts such as the famed Shaolin monks often dealt with the study of martial arts not just as a means of self-defense or mental training but as a system of ethics
Wude can be translated as martial morality and is constructed from the words wu which means martial and de which means morality
Wude deals with two aspects Virtue of deed and Virtue of mind
Virtue of deed concerns social relations morality of mind is meant to cultivate the inner harmony between the emotional mind Xin and the wisdom mind Hui
The ultimate goal is reaching no extremity Wuji closely related to the Taoist concept of wu wei where both wisdom and emotions are in harmony with each other

Urban youth in New York City were still going from every borough to Time Square every night to watch the latest movies
Amongst these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where during this time hip-hop was beginning to take form
One of the pioneers responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was DJ Kool Herc who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them
From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or breakdancing a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves
The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences
Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and up rocking standing combat moves are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights
The dancers’ ability to improvise these moves led way to battles which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity skills and musicality
In a documentary Crazy Legs a member of breakdancing group Rock Steady Crew described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie where the one kung fu master says something along the lines of ‘hun your kung fu is good but mine is better’ then a fight erupts
Hip hop group Wu Tang Clan were prominently influenced by kung fu cinema
The name Wu Tang itself is a reference to the film Shaolin and Wu Tang
