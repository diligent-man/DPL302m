He is recognized as a disciple of Zen Master Jeongang the th patriarch and Zen Master of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism Zen Master Daewon received Dharma Transmission from Zen Master Jeongang When Master Daewon was his father died in front of his eyes and this experience left an indelible imprint on the young man's view of the world As soon as he was able to leave his house in he entered into the large monastery Hae in sa temple under the mentorship of his preceptor Master Pak In gok
Since he was motivated to understand about life and death he searched around the country for an enlightened master with whom he could practice with After practicing for several years he finally was able to meet with the famous Zen Master Jeongang sunim In while he was practicing at Dong hwa sa temple the following story has been left behind
Prior to the summer monastic retreat the abbot of the Dong hwa sa temple Wolsan sunim had publicly announced that the Zen Master Jeongang would be overseeing the month retreat so meditators from around the country gathered there to practice One evening during a session of sitting meditation all of the seats in the meditation hall were empty except for those of a couple elder monks The young Daewon thought this to be unusual and then saw a young monk furtively call him out quietly waving at him from outside the hall When he went to him the young monk told Daewon sunim that a group of monks were waiting for him up on the mountain out back Daewon sunim followed the young monk into the mountain and found a gathering of twenty monks waiting for him in stony silence Immediately upon seeing Daewon sunim one of the monks named Beopseong presently known as the Zen Master Jinje a disciple of Zen Master Hyanggok called out to him Say something about Bodhidharma's 'I don't know ' Kong an Koan Daewon sunim answered without a moment's hesitation Revealed Songam sunim who was standing nearby asked him about the Ansujeongdeung Kong an Koan How would you save yourself Daewon sunim spoke loudly An Su Jeong Deung All the gathered monks stood still with their lips pursed in silence as Daewon sunim turned around and walked away The next day after breakfast Myeongheo sunim who was serving as monitor for the retreat called a temple hearing to find out why the monks had been absent without notice the night before During the hearing all that had happened up on the mountain was laid out in the open and as a result the monks who had been absent during the sitting meditation session assumed their formal robes and bowed in penance before Zen Master Jeongang who was serving as the Josil of the temple at the time
The next day Zen Master Jeongang called on Daewon sunim He told Daewon that his first Song of Enlightenment was clear evidence of his enlightenment but that a Song of Enlightenment is customarily kept short To this Daewon sunim recited the second Song of Enlightenment he had composed when he saw the sun and the moon in the setting sky while passing the fields of Gimje After Zen Master Jeongang heard the second Song of Enlightenment he again asked Master Daewon to make up another song on the spot that would encapsulate the same stage of enlightenment Immediately upon this request Master Daewon produced the following song
Over the rock the wind passes through the pine trees
And below the mountain flies the golden oriole
There is not a trace even of the entire universe
But the monkey cries loudly under the moonlight Zen Master Jeongang listened to the first two lines with his eyes gently closed then upon hearing the last two lines he opened his eyes revealing delight However he did not stop there and asked once more When the others called you out on the mountain and Beopseong asked you to speak on the 'I don't know ' Kong an Koan you said 'Revealed ' If you were Emperor Wu of Liang how wouldyou respond to Bodhidharma's 'I don't know ' If I was Emperor Wu of Liang I'd respond by saying 'Even though there is no such thing as a saint wouldn't it be much better to enjoy the flowering of my virtue together just like this ' and take him by the hand Zen Master Jeongang spoke with astonishment How have you reached such a stage How could one say that he has reached it that he has it or that it is of his nature It is only just like this In this manner the reverend Daewon received Dharma Transmission from the Master Jeongang and in became the th patriarch in the Korean tradition of Zen
