the power is a microprocessor developed by international business machines ibm that implemented the bit powerpc and powerpc as instruction set architectures
released in the power succeeded the power and rs microprocessors enabling rs and eserver iseries models of as computer servers to run on the same processor as a step toward converging the two lines
the power was a multicore microprocessor with two cores on a single die the first non embedded microprocessor to do so
power chip was first commercially available multiprocessor chip
the original power had a clock speed of and ghz while an enhanced version the power reached a clock speed of ghz
the powerpc is a derivative of the power
the power has a unified l cache divided into three equal parts
each has its own independent l controller which can feed bytes of data per cycle
the core interface unit ciu connects each l controller to either the data cache or instruction cache in either of the two processors
the non cacheable nc unit is responsible for handling instruction serializing functions and performing any noncacheable operations in the storage topology
there is an l cache controller but the actual memory is off chip
the gx bus controller controls i o device communications and there are two byte wide gx buses one incoming and the other outgoing
the fabric controller is the master controller for the network of buses controlling communications for both l l controllers communications between power chips way way way way and power mcm s
trace and debug used for first failure data capture is provided
there is also a built in self test function bist and performance monitoring unit pmu
power on reset por is supported
the power implements a superscalar microarchitecture through high frequency speculative out of order execution using eight independent execution units
they are two floating point units fp two load store units ld two fixed point units fx a branch unit br and a conditional register unit cr
these execution units can complete up to eight operations per clock not including the br and cr units
each floating point unit can complete one fused multiply add per clock two operations
each load store unit can complete one instruction per clock
each fixed point unit can complete one instruction per clock the pipeline stages are
branch prediction
instruction fetch
decode crack and group formation
group dispatch and instruction issue
load store unit operation
load hit store
store hit load
load hit load
instruction execution pipelinethe power also came in a configuration using a multi chip module mcm containing four power dies in a single package with up to mb of shared l ecc cache per mcm
the power released in was an improved version of the power that ran at up to ghz
it contained million transistors measured mm and was fabricated in a m soi cmos process with eight layers of copper interconnect
