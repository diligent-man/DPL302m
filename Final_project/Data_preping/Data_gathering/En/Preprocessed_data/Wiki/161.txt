Geneva (/dʒɪˈniːvə/ jin-EE-və; French: Genève [ʒənɛv] (listen); Arpitan: Genèva [dzəˈnɛva] (listen)) is the second-most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland
Situated in the south west of the country, where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.
The city of Geneva (ville de Genève) had a population 201,818 in 2019 (Jan
estimate) within its small municipal territory of 16 km (6 sq mi), but the Canton of Geneva (the city and its closest Swiss suburbs and exurbs) had a population of 499,480 (Jan
2019 estimate) over 246 km (95 sq mi), and together with the suburbs and exurbs located in the canton of Vaud and in the French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie the cross-border Geneva metropolitan area as officially defined by Eurostat, which extends over 2,292 km (885 sq mi), had a population of 1,032,750 in Jan
2019 (Swiss estimates and French census).
Since 2013, the Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District (in the canton of Vaud), and the Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français (literally "Metropolitan hub of the French Genevan territory"), this last one a federation of eight French intercommunal councils, have formed the Grand Genève ("Greater Geneva"), a Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation (GLCT in French, a public entity under Swiss law) in charge of organizing cooperation within the cross-border metropolitan area of Geneva (in particular metropolitan transports)
The Grand Genève GLCT extends over 1,996 km (771 sq mi) and had a population of 1,025,316 in Jan
2019 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.5% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.5% on French territory.
Geneva is a global city, a financial centre, and a worldwide centre for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations and the Red Cross
Geneva hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world
It is also where the Geneva Conventions were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment of wartime non-combatants and prisoners of war
Together with, for instance, New York City (global headquarters of the UN), Basel (Bank for International Settlements), and Strasbourg (Council of Europe), Geneva is a city serving as the headquarters of one of the most important international organizations, without being the capital of a country.
In 2021, Geneva was ranked as the world's ninth most important financial centre for competitiveness by the Global Financial Centres Index, fifth in Europe behind London, Zürich, Frankfurt and Luxembourg
In 2019, Geneva was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Zürich and Basel
The city has been referred to as the world's most compact metropolis and the "Peace Capital"
In 2019, Mercer ranked Geneva as the thirteenth most expensive city in the world
In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings, second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power.
The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling Genava, probably from the Celtic *genawa- from the stem *genu- ("bend, knee"), in the sense of a bending river or estuary, an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian Genova).
The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as pagus major Genevensis or Comitatus Genevensis (also Gebennensis)
After 1400 it became the Genevois province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).
Geneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe, when the Romans took it in 121 BC
It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire, and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th.
In the Middle Ages, Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance
Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city
In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council
In the first half of the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the Swiss Confederacy.
In 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer and proponent of Calvinism, became the spiritual leader of the city and established the Republic of Geneva
By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own
France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782, an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means
In 1798, revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva
At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, on 1 June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the Swiss Confederation
In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted
Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.
Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva, where the Rhône flows out
It is surrounded by three mountain chains, each belonging to the Jura: the Jura main range lies north-westward, the Vuache southward, and the Salève south-eastward.
The city covers an area of 15.93 km (6.2 sq mi), while the area of the canton is 282 km (108.9 sq mi), including the two small exclaves of Céligny in Vaud
The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of 38 km (14.7 sq mi) and is sometimes referred to as petit lac (small lake)
The canton has only a 4.5 km-long (2.8 mi) border with the rest of Switzerland
Of 107.5 km (66.8 mi) of border, 103 are shared with France, the Département de l'Ain to the north and west and the Département de la Haute-Savoie to the south and east.
Of the land in the city, 0.24 km (0.093 sq mi), or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.5 km (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is forested
The rest of the land, 14.63 km (5.65 sq mi), or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), 0.49 km (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and 0.02 km (4.9 acres), or 0.1%, is wasteland.
Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%
Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops
Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.
The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 m (1,225.7 ft) and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton, two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age
This rock was chosen by General Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland
The second main river of Geneva is the Arve, which flows into the Rhône just west of the city centre
Mont Blanc can be seen from Geneva and is an hour's drive from the city.
The climate of Geneva is a temperate climate, more specifically an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb)
Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day
Summers are relatively warm
Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons
Ice storms near Lac Léman are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the Bise, a north-easterly wind
This can lead to severe icing in winter.
In summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the Bains des Pâquis
The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months
The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing
Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are less than three hours away by car
Mont Salève (1,379 m (4,524 ft)), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and Mont Blanc, the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix, which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva.
During the years 2000–2009, the mean yearly temperature was 11 °C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.
The highest temperature recorded in Genève–Cointrin was 39.7 °C (103.5 °F) in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was −20.0 °C (−4.0 °F) in February 1956.

The Administrative Council (Conseil administratif) constitutes the executive government of the city of Geneva and operates as a collegiate authority
It is composed of five councilors (French: Conseiller administratif/ Conseillère administrative), each presiding over a department
The president of the executive department acts as mayor (la maire/le maire)
In the governmental year 2021–2022, the Administrative Council is presided over by Madame la maire de Genève Frédérique Perler
Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council
Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years
The current term of (la législature) is from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2025
The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz
The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate
The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the Parc des Bastions.
As of 2020, Geneva's Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the Social Democratic Party (PS) and the Green Party (PES), and one member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC)
This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority
The last election was held on 15 March/5 April 2020
Except for the mayor, all other councillors have been elected for the first time.
The Municipal Council (Conseil municipal) holds legislative power
It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years
The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration
The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation with a seven percent threshold.
The sessions of the Municipal Council are public
Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance
Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council
The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall (Hôtel de Ville), in the old city.
The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15 March 2020 for the (législature) of 2020–2025
Currently, the Municipal Council consists of: 19 members of the Social Democratic Party (PS), 18 Green Party (PES), 14 Les Libéraux-Radicaux (PLR), 8 Christian Democratic People's Party (PDC); 7 Geneva Citizens' Movement (MCG), 7 Ensemble à Gauche (an alliance of the left parties PST-POP (Parti Suisse du Travail – Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidaritéS), 6 Swiss People's Party (UDC).
In the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the Green Party which received 26% (+14.6) of the vote
The next seven most popular parties were the PS (17.9%, -5.9), PLR (15.1%, -2.4), the UDC (12.6%, -3.7), the PdA/solidaritéS (10%, +1.3), the PDC (5.4%, -5.3), the pvl (5%, +2.9), and MCR (4.9%, -2.7)
In the federal election a total of 34,319 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 39.6%.
In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 23.8% of the vote
The next five most popular parties were the PLR (17.6%), the UDC (16.3%), the Green Party (11.4%), the PDC (10.7%), and the solidaritéS (8.8%)
In the federal election a total of 36,490 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.1%.
The city centre of Geneva is located only 1.9 km (1.2 mi) from the border of France
As a result, the urban area and the metropolitan area largely extend across the border on French territory
Due to the small size of the municipality of Geneva (16 km (6 sq mi)) and extension of the urban area over an international border, official bodies of transnational cooperation were developed as early as the 1970s to manage the cross-border Greater Geneva area at a metropolitan level.
In 1973, a Franco-Swiss agreement created the Comité régional franco-genevois ("Franco-Genevan Regional Committee", CRFG in French)
In 1997 an 'Urban planning charter' of the CRFG defined for the first time a planning territory called agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise ("Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area")
2001 saw the creation of a Comité stratégique de développement des transports publics régionaux ("Strategic Committee for the Developement of Regional Public Transports", DTPR in French), a committee which adopted in 2003 a 'Charter for Public Transports', first step in the development of a metropolitan, cross-border commuter rail network (see Léman Express).
In 2004, a public transnational body called Projet d’agglomération franco-valdo-genevois ("Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area project") was created to serve as the main body of metropolitan cooperation for the planning territory defined in 1997, with more local French councils taking part in this new public body than in the CRFG created in 1973
Finally in 2012 the Projet d’agglomération franco-valdo-genevois was renamed Grand Genève ("Greater Geneva"), and the following year it was transformed into a Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation (GLCT in French), a public entity under Swiss law, which now serves as the executive body of the Grand Genève.
The Grand Genève GLCT is made up of the Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District (in the canton of Vaud), and the Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français (literally "Metropolitan hub of the French Genevan territory"), this last one a federation of eight French intercommunal councils in Ain and Haute-Savoie
The Grand Genève GLCT extends over 1,996 km (771 sq mi)
and had a population of 1,025,316 in Jan
2019 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.5% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.5% on French territory.
Geneva does not have any sister relationships with other cities
It declares itself related to the entire world.
The city of Geneva (ville de Genève) had a population 201,818 in 2019 (Jan
estimate) within its small municipal territory of 16 km (6 sq mi)
The city of Geneva is at the centre of the Geneva metropolitan area, a Functional Urban Area (as per Eurostat methodology) which extends over Swiss territory (entire Canton of Geneva and part of the canton of Vaud) and French territory (parts of the departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie)
The Geneva Functional Urban Area covers a land area of 2,292 km (885 sq mi) (24.2% in Switzerland, 75.8% in France) and had 1,032,750 inhabitants in Jan
2019 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58,1% of them on Swiss territory and 41.9% on French territory.
The Geneva metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing in Europe
Its population rose from 870,208 in Jan
2008 to 1,032,750 in Jan
2019, which means the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.57% per year during those 11 years
Growth is higher in the French part of the metropolitan area (+2.01% per year between 2008 and 2019) than in the Swiss part (+1.29% per year between 2008 and 2019), as Geneva attracts many French commuters due to high Swiss salaries and a favorable Franco-Swiss tax regime for French residents working in Switzerland.
The official language of Geneva (both the city and the canton) is French
English is also common due to the high number of anglophone immigrants and foreigners working in international institutions and in the bank sector
As of 2000, 128,622 or 72.3% of the population speaks French as a first language, with English being the second most common (7,853 or 4.4%) language
7,462 inhabitants speak Spanish (or 4.2%), 7,320 speak Italian (4.1%), 7,050 speak German (4.0%) and 113 people who speak Romansh
As a result of immigration flows in the 1960s and 1980s, Portuguese is also spoken by a considerable proportion of the population.
In the city of Geneva, as of 2013, 48% of the population are resident foreign nationals
For a list of the largest groups of foreign residents see the cantonal overview
Over the last 10 years (1999–2009), the population has changed at a rate of 7.2%; a rate of 3.4% due to migration and at a rate of 3.4% due to births and deaths.
As of 2008, the gender distribution of the population was 47.8% male and 52.2% female

William Monter calculates that the city's total population was 12,000–13,000 in 1550, doubling to over 25,000 by 1560.
The historical population is given in the following chart:
The 2000 census recorded 66,491 residents (37.4% of the population) as Catholic, while 41,289 people (23.20%) belonged to no church or were agnostic or atheist, 24,105 (13.5%) belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church, and 8,698 (4.89%) were Muslim
There were also 3,959 members of an Orthodox church (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish
There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church
26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.
According to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt für Statistik 49.2% of the population were Christian, (34.2% Catholic, 8.8% Swiss Reformed (organized in the Protestant Church of Geneva) and 6.2% other Christians, mostly other Protestants), 38% of Genevans were non-religious, 6.1% were Muslim and 1.6% were Jews.
Geneva has historically been considered a Protestant city and was known as the Protestant Rome due to it being the base of John Calvin, William Farel, Theodore Beza and other Protestant reformers
Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly Catholic countries, as well as general secularization, has changed its religious landscape
As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group
Geneva forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg.
The World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation both have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre in Grand-Saconnex, Geneva
The World Communion of Reformed Churches, a worldwide organization of Presbyterian, Continental Reformed, Congregational and other Calvinist churches gathering more than 80 million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013
The Executive Committee of the World Communion of Reformed Churches voted in 2012 to move its offices to Hanover, Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland
The move was completed in 2013
Likewise, the Conference of European Churches have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels.
Prior to the Protestant Reformation the city was de jure and de facto Catholic
Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland
John Calvin went to Geneva in 1536 after William Farel encouraged him to do so
In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532
Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism
Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole
St
Pierre Cathedral was where Calvin and his Protestant reformers preached
It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the Reformed tradition
Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including William Farel and Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death.
Geneva was a shelter for Calvinists, but at the same time it persecuted Roman Catholics and others considered heretics
The case of Michael Servetus, an early Nontrinitarian, is notable
Condemned by both Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council
John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence.
In 1802, during its annexation to France under Napoleon I, the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See
Napoleon's common policy was to emancipate Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, and the other way around, as well as emancipating Jews
In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by Pope Pius VII and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the Diocese of Annecy
A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the separation of church and state, enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.
In 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the Swiss Criminal Code in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents
During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents

This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been popular across all ages
Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race.
Since 1818, a particular chestnut tree has been used as the official "herald of the spring" in Geneva
The sautier (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud
While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.
As this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year
During the 19th century many dates were in March or April
In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier)
In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year
The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud
In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February.

Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Genève, known as SIG
Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the lake; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater, originally formed by infiltration from the Arve
30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rhône (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny)
In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the waste incineration facility of Les Cheneviers
The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels.
Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat
