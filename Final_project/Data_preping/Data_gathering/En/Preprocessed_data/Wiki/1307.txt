The series posits that there have been a dozen incarnations of the warehouse before the present day th in South Dakota Warehouse was built between BC on the orders of Alexander the Great as a place to keep artifacts obtained by war After Alexander died the warehouse was moved to Egypt establishing the practice of locating the warehouse in the most powerful empire of the day under the reasoning that it will be best defended there Egypt's Ptolemaic rulers appointed a group of people known as the Regents to oversee the warehouse and act as its first agents and collectors of artifacts Warehouse lasted until the Roman conquest of Egypt Other warehouses throughout history include Warehouse in Western Roman Empire Italy Warehouse in Hunnic Empire until the death of Attila the Hun Warehouse in Byzantine Empire Warehouse in Cambodia under the Khmer Empire Warehouse in the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan Warehouse in Germany during the Holy Roman Empire Warehouse in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople until the death of Suleiman the Magnificent Warehouse in Mughal Empire India Warehouse in the Russian Empire under the Romanov Dynasty the Napoleonic War with Russia was an attempt to seize control of Warehouse and Warehouse in the United Kingdom from until It was during the time of Warehouse that the Regents began to employ agents to gather and protect artifacts This practice continued under Warehouse with British agents traveling further and further searching for artifacts to add to the collection
The next move brought the warehouse to South Dakota in the United States Unlike previous warehouses which were placed in the centers of their empires Warehouse was located in a remote area of South Dakota to hide it The first Warehouse was built in but the structure burned down because of an insufficient understanding of how to safely store artifacts The move to the rebuilt and current Warehouse occurred in at the onset of World War I The warehouse was designed by Thomas Edison Nikola Tesla and M C Escher while the warehouse's expansion joints were created by Albert Einstein
