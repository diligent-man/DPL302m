the series posits that there have been a dozen incarnations of the warehouse before the present day th in south dakota
warehouse was built between bc on the orders of alexander the great as a place to keep artifacts obtained by war
after alexander died the warehouse was moved to egypt establishing the practice of locating the warehouse in the most powerful empire of the day under the reasoning that it will be best defended there
egypt s ptolemaic rulers appointed a group of people known as the regents to oversee the warehouse and act as its first agents and collectors of artifacts
warehouse lasted until the roman conquest of egypt
other warehouses throughout history include warehouse in western roman empire italy warehouse in hunnic empire until the death of attila the hun warehouse in byzantine empire warehouse in cambodia under the khmer empire warehouse in the mongol empire under genghis khan warehouse in germany during the holy roman empire warehouse in the ottoman capital of constantinople until the death of suleiman the magnificent warehouse in mughal empire india warehouse in the russian empire under the romanov dynasty the napoleonic war with russia was an attempt to seize control of warehouse and warehouse in the united kingdom from until
it was during the time of warehouse that the regents began to employ agents to gather and protect artifacts
this practice continued under warehouse with british agents traveling further and further searching for artifacts to add to the collection
the next move brought the warehouse to south dakota in the united states
unlike previous warehouses which were placed in the centers of their empires warehouse was located in a remote area of south dakota to hide it

fields juggling balls that induce drunkenness and blackouts
others may have humorous effects such as ivan pavlov s bell which will call any dog to you but causes excessive drooling for hours and a magic kettle that grants wishes but produces a ferret if the wish is impossible
