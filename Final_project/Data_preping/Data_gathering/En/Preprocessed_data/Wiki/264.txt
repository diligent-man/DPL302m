The Republic of China ROC commonly recognised as the official designation of China from to was a country in East Asia based in Mainland China prior to the relocation of its central government to Taiwan as a result of the Chinese Civil War At a population of million in it was the world's most populous country Covering million square kilometres million square miles it consisted of provinces special administrative region regions special municipalities leagues and special banners The People's Republic of China PRC which rules mainland China today considers ROC as a country that ceased to exist since thus the history of ROC before is often referred to as Republican Era simplified Chinese traditional Chinese of China The ROC now based in Taiwan today considers itself a continuation of the country thus calling the period of its mainland rule as the Mainland Period simplified Chinese traditional Chinese of the Republic of China in Taiwan
The Republic was declared on January after the Xinhai Revolution which overthrew the Manchu led Qing dynasty the last imperial dynasty of China On February regent Empress Dowager Longyu signed the abdication decree on behalf of the Xuantong Emperor ending several millennia of Chinese monarchical rule Sun Yat sen the founder and its provisional president served only briefly before handing over the presidency to Yuan Shikai the leader of the Beiyang Army Sun's party the Kuomintang KMT then led by Song Jiaoren won the parliamentary election held in December However Song was assassinated on Yuan's orders shortly after and the Beiyang Army led by Yuan maintained full control of the Beiyang government who then proclaimed the Empire of China in before abolishing the short lived monarchy as a result of popular unrest After Yuan's death in the authority of the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty The mostly powerless government led to a fracturing of the country as cliques in the Beiyang Army claimed individual autonomy and clashed with each other So began the Warlord Era a decade of decentralized power struggles and prolonged armed conflict
The KMT under the leadership of Sun attempted multiple times to establish a national government in Canton After taking Canton for a third time in the KMT successfully established a rival government in preparation for a campaign to unify China In the KMT would enter into an alliance with the fledgling Chinese Communist Party CCP as a requirement for Soviet support General Chiang Kai shek who became the Chairman of the Kuomintang after Sun's death and subsequent power struggle in began the Northern Expedition in to overthrow the Beiyang government In Chiang moved the nationalist government to Nanking and purged the CCP beginning with the Shanghai massacre The latter event forced the CCP and KMT's left wing into armed rebellion marking the beginning of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of a rival nationalist government in Wuhan under Wang Jingwei However this rival government soon purged the communists as well and reconciled with Chiang's KMT After the Northern Expedition resulted in nominal unification under Chiang in disgruntled warlords formed an anti Chiang coalition These warlords would fight Chiang and his allies in the Central Plains War from to ultimately losing in the largest conflict of the Warlord Era
China experienced some industrialization during the s but suffered setbacks from conflicts between the Nationalist government in Nanjing the CCP remaining warlords and the Empire of Japan after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria Nation building efforts yielded to fight the Second Sino Japanese War in when a skirmish between the National Revolutionary Army and Imperial Japanese Army culminated in a full scale invasion by Japan Hostilities between the KMT and CCP partially subsided when shortly before the war they formed the Second United Front to resist Japanese aggression until the alliance broke down in The war lasted until the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II in China then regained control of the island of Taiwan and the Pescadores
Shortly after the Chinese Civil War between the KMT and CCP resumed with full scale fighting leading to the Constitution of the Republic of China replacing the Organic Law as the Republic's fundamental law Three years later in nearing the end of the civil war the CCP established the People's Republic of China in Beijing with the KMT led ROC moving its capital several times from Nanjing to Guangzhou followed by Chongqing then Chengdu and lastly Taipei The CCP emerged victorious and expelled the KMT and ROC government from the Chinese mainland The ROC later lost control of Hainan in and the Dachen Islands in Zhejiang in It has maintained control over Taiwan and other smaller islands
The ROC was a founding member of the League of Nations and later the United Nations including its Security Council seat where it maintained until when the People's Republic of China took over its membership It was also a member of the Universal Postal Union and the International Olympic Committee
During the mainland period the country was known in English as China or the Republic of China Internally Zhongguo Chinese lit 'middle country' Zhonghua or Jung hwa Chinese lit 'middle and beautiful' or Minguo Chinese lit 'people's country' were used as short forms of the official country name Zhonghua Minguo Chinese pinyin Chinese people's state in Chinese Both Beiyang government from to and Nationalist government from to used the name Republic of China as their official name
The country's official Chinese name Chunghwa Minkuo stemmed from the party manifesto of Tongmenghui in which says the four goals of the Chinese revolution was to expel the Manchu rulers to revive Chunghwa to establish a Republic and to distribute land equally among the people Chinese pinyin Q ch d l hu f Zh nghu chu ngl m ngu p ngj n d qu n The convener of Tongmenghui and Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat sen proposed the name Chunghwa Minkuo as the assumed name of the new country when the revolution succeeded After the Xinhai revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty in Sun further explained the meaning of the country's Chinese name in detail in
On October Sun again stressed that Chunghwa Minkuo means a state of the people
Taiwanese politician Mei Feng criticised the official English name of the state Republic of China fails to translate the Chinese character Min Chinese pinyin people according to Sun Yat sen's original interpretations while the name should instead be translated as the People's Republic of China which confuses with the current official name of mainland China under communist rule To avoid confusion the ROC government in Taiwan began to put an aside of Taiwan next to its official name since
A republic was formally established on January following the Xinhai Revolution which itself began with the Wuchang uprising on October successfully overthrowing the Qing dynasty and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China From its founding until the republic was based on mainland China Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism a Japanese invasion and a full scale civil war with central authority strongest during the Nanjing Decade when most of China came under the control of the authoritarian one party military dictatorship of the Kuomintang KMT
In at the end of World War II the Empire of Japan surrendered control of Taiwan and its island groups to the Allies and Taiwan was placed under the Republic of China's administrative control The communist takeover of mainland China in after the Chinese Civil War left the ruling Kuomintang with control over only Taiwan Penghu Kinmen Matsu and other minor islands With the loss of the mainland the ROC government retreated to Taiwan and the KMT declared Taipei the provisional capital Meanwhile the CCP took over all of mainland China and founded the People's Republic of China PRC in Beijing
In after over two thousand years of imperial rule a republic was established to replace the monarchy The Qing dynasty that preceded the republic had experienced instability throughout the th century and suffered from both internal rebellion and foreign imperialism A program of institutional reform proved too little and too late Only the lack of an alternative regime prolonged the monarchy's existence until
The Chinese Republic grew out of the Wuchang Uprising against the Qing government on October which is now celebrated annually as the ROC's national day also known as Double Ten Day Sun Yat sen had been actively promoting revolution from his bases in exile He now returned and on December Sun Yat sen was elected president by the Nanjing assembly which consisted of representatives from seventeen provinces On January he was officially inaugurated and pledged to overthrow the despotic government led by the Manchu consolidate the Republic of China and plan for the welfare of the people Sun's new government lacked military strength As a compromise he negotiated with Yuan Shikai the commander of the Beiyang Army promising Yuan the presidency of the republic if he were to remove the Qing emperor by force Yuan agreed to the deal and the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty Puyi was forced to abdicate in Song Jiaoren led the Kuomintang Party to electoral victories by fashioning his party's program to appeal to the gentry landowners and merchants Song was assassinated on March at the behest of Yuan Shikai
Yuan was elected president of the ROC in He ruled by military power and ignored the republican institutions established by his predecessor threatening to execute Senate members who disagreed with his decisions He soon dissolved the ruling Kuomintang KMT party banned secret organizations which implicitly included the KMT and ignored the provisional constitution An attempt at a democratic election in ended with the assassination of the elected candidate by a man recruited by Yuan Ultimately Yuan declared himself Emperor of China in The new ruler of China tried to increase centralization by abolishing the provincial system however this move angered the gentry along with the provincial governors who were usually military men Many provinces declared independence and became warlord states Increasingly unpopular and deserted by his supporters Yuan abdicated in and died of natural causes shortly thereafter China then declined into a period of warlordism Sun having been forced into exile returned to Guangdong in the south in and with the help of warlords and set up successive rival governments to the Beiyang government in Beijing having re established the KMT in October Sun's dream was to unify China by launching an expedition against the north However he lacked the military support and funding to turn it into a reality
Meanwhile the Beiyang government struggled to hold onto power and an open and wide ranging debate evolved regarding how China should confront the West In a student protest against the government's weak response to the Treaty of Versailles considered unfair by Chinese intellectuals led to the May Fourth movement whose demonstrations were against the danger of spreading Western influence replacing Chinese culture It was in this intellectual climate that the influence of Marxism spread and became popular leading to the founding of the CCP in
After Sun's death in March Chiang Kai shek became the leader of the Kuomintang In Chiang led the Northern Expedition with the intention of defeating the Beiyang warlords and unifying the country Chiang received the help of the Soviet Union and the CCP However he soon dismissed his Soviet advisers being convinced that they wanted to get rid of the KMT and take control Chiang decided to purge the Communists killing thousands of them At the same time other violent conflicts were taking place in China in the South where the CCP had superior numbers Nationalist supporters were being massacred Such events eventually led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and Communists Chiang Kai shek pushed the CCP into the interior and established a government with Nanking as its capital in By Chiang's army overthrew the Beiyang government and unified the entire nation at least nominally beginning the so called Nanjing Decade
Sun Yat sen's theory held that the KMT was to rebuild China in three phases a phase of military rule during which the KMT would take over power and reunite China by force a phase of political tutelage and finally a constitutional democratic phase In the Nationalists having taken power militarily and reunifying China started the second phase promulgating a provisional constitution and beginning the period of so called tutelage Criticized for instituting authoritarianism Chiang launched the New Life Movement to promote moral behavior and claimed the government was establishing a modern democratic society Among other things it created the Academia Sinica the Central Bank of China and other agencies In China for the first time sent a team to the Olympic Games Campaigns were mounted and laws passed to promote the rights of women The ease and speed of communication facilitated focusing on social problems especially those of remote villages The Rural Reconstruction Movement was one of many that took advantage of the new freedom to raise social consciousness The Nationalist government published a draft constitution on May
Continual wars plagued the government Those in the western border regions included the Kumul Rebellion the Sino Tibetan War and the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang Large areas of China proper remained under the semi autonomous rule of local warlords such as Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan provincial military leaders or warlord coalitions Nationalist rule was strongest in the eastern regions around the capital Nanjing The Central Plains War in the Japanese aggression in and the Red Army's Long March in led to more power for the central government but there continued to be foot dragging and even outright defiance as in the Fujian Rebellion of
Reformers and critics pushed for democracy and human rights but the task seemed difficult if not impossible The nation was at war and divided between Communists and Nationalists Corruption and lack of direction hindered reforms Chiang told the State Council Our organization becomes worse and worse many staff members just sit at their desks and gaze into space others read newspapers and still others sleep
Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese desires on China Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population Japan initiated the seizure of Manchuria in September and established the ex Qing emperor Puyi as head of the puppet state of Manchukuo in The loss of Manchuria and its potential for industrial development and war industries was a blow to the Kuomintang economy The League of Nations established at the end of World War I was unable to act in the face of Japanese defiance
The Japanese began to push south of the Great Wall into northern China and the coastal provinces Chinese fury against Japan was predictable but anger was also directed against Chiang and the Nanking government which at the time was more preoccupied with anti Communist extermination campaigns than with resisting the Japanese invaders The importance of internal unity before external danger was forcefully brought home in December when Chiang Kai shek in an event now known as the Xi'an Incident was kidnapped by Zhang Xueliang and forced to ally with the Communists against the Japanese in the Second Kuomintang CCP United Front
Chinese resistance stiffened after July when a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops outside Beiping Later Beijing near the Marco Polo Bridge This skirmish led to open although undeclared warfare between China and Japan Shanghai fell after a three month battle during which Japan suffered extensive casualties in both its army and navy The capital Nanking fell in December which was followed by mass murders and rapes known as the Nanking Massacre The national capital was briefly at Wuhan then removed in an epic retreat to Chongqing the seat of government until In the Japanese set up the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime with its capital in Nanking which proclaimed itself the legitimate Republic of China in opposition to Chiang Kai shek's government although its claims were significantly hampered due to its being a puppet state controlling limited amounts of territory
The United Front between the Kuomintang and the CCP had salutary effects for the beleaguered CCP despite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China the coastal regions and the rich Yangtze River Valley in central China After conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations administrative reforms and the land and tax reform measures favoring the peasants and the spread of their organizational network while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence Meanwhile northern China was infiltrated politically by Japanese politicians in Manchukuo using facilities such as the Wei Huang Gong
After its entry into the Pacific War during World War II the United States became increasingly involved in Chinese affairs As an ally it embarked in late on a program of massive military and financial aid to the hard pressed Nationalist Government In January both the United States and the United Kingdom led the way in revising their unequal treaties with China from the past Within a few months a new agreement was signed between the United States and the Republic of China for the stationing of American troops in China as part of the common war effort against Japan The United States sought unsuccessfully to reconcile the rival Kuomintang and Communists to make for a more effective anti Japanese war effort In December the Chinese Exclusion Acts of the s and subsequent laws enacted by the United States Congress to restrict Chinese immigration into the United States were repealed The wartime policy of the United States was meant to help China become a strong ally and a stabilizing force in postwar East Asia During the war China was one of the Big Four Allies of World War II and later one of the Four Policemen which was a precursor to China having a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council
In August with American help Nationalist troops moved to take the Japanese surrender in North China The Soviet Union encouraged to invade Manchuria to hasten the end of the war and allowed a Soviet sphere of influence there as agreed to at the Yalta Conference in February dismantled and removed more than half the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese Although the Chinese had not been present at Yalta they had been consulted and had agreed to have the Soviets enter the war in the belief that the Soviet Union would deal only with the Kuomintang government However the Soviet presence in northeast China enabled the Communists to arm themselves with equipment surrendered by the withdrawing Japanese army
In after the end of the war the Nationalist Government moved back to Nanjing The Republic of China emerged from the war nominally a great military power but actually a nation economically prostrate and on the verge of all out civil war The problems of rehabilitating the formerly Japanese occupied areas and of reconstructing the nation from the ravages of a protracted war were staggering The economy deteriorated sapped by the military demands of foreign war and internal strife by spiraling inflation and by Nationalist profiteering speculation and hoarding Starvation came in the wake of the war and millions were rendered homeless by floods and unsettled conditions in many parts of the country
On October following the Surrender of Japan the administration of Taiwan and Penghu Islands were handed over from Japan to China After the end of the war United States Marines were used to hold Beiping Beijing and Tianjin against a possible Soviet incursion and logistic support was given to Kuomintang forces in north and northeast China To further this end on September the st Marine Division charged with maintaining security in the areas of the Shandong Peninsula and the eastern Hebei arrived in China
In January through the mediation of the United States a military truce between the Kuomintang and the Communists was arranged but battles soon resumed Public opinion of the administrative incompetence of the Nationalist government was incited by the Communists during the nationwide student protest against the mishandling of the Shen Chong rape case in early and during another national protest against monetary reforms later that year The United States realizing that no American efforts short of large scale armed intervention could stop the coming war withdrew Gen George Marshall's American mission Thereafter the Chinese Civil War became more widespread battles raged not only for territories but also for the allegiance of sections of the population The United States aided the Nationalists with massive economic loans and weapons but no combat support
Belatedly the Republic of China government sought to enlist popular support through internal reforms However the effort was in vain because of rampant government corruption and the accompanying political and economic chaos By late the Kuomintang position was bleak The demoralized and undisciplined National Revolutionary Army proved to be no match for the Communists' motivated and disciplined People's Liberation Army The Communists were well established in the north and northeast Although the Kuomintang had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries and enjoyed considerable international support they were exhausted by the long war with Japan and in fighting among various generals They were also losing the propaganda war to the Communists with a population weary of Kuomintang corruption and yearning for peace
In January Beiping was taken by the Communists without a fight and its name changed back to Beijing Following the capture of Nanjing on April major cities passed from Kuomintang to Communist control with minimal resistance through November In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities Finally on October Communists led by Mao Zedong founded the People's Republic of China Chiang Kai shek declared martial law in May whilst a few hundred thousand Nationalist troops and two million refugees predominantly from the government and business community fled from mainland China to Taiwan There remained in China itself only isolated pockets of resistance On December Chiang proclaimed Taipei Taiwan the temporary capital of the Republic of China
During the Chinese Civil War both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities with millions of non combatants killed by both sides Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the civil war resulted in the death of between million and million people between and including deaths from forced conscription and massacres
The first Republic of China national government was established on January in Nanjing and was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People which state that the ROC shall be a democratic republic of the people to be governed by the people and for the people
Sun Yat sen was the provisional president Delegates from the provinces sent to confirm the government's authority formed the first parliament in The power of this government was limited with generals controlling both the central and northern provinces of China and short lived The number of acts passed by the government was few and included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives The parliament's authority soon became nominal violations of the Constitution by Yuan were met with half hearted motions of censure Kuomintang members of parliament who gave up their membership in the KMT were offered pounds Yuan maintained power locally by sending generals to be provincial governors or by obtaining the allegiance of those already in power
When Yuan died the parliament of was reconvened to give legitimacy to a new government However the real power passed to military leaders leading to the warlord period The impotent government still had its use when World War I began several Western powers and Japan wanted China to declare war on Germany to liquidate German holdings in China
In February the Fourth Plenary Session of the nd Kuomintang National Congress held in Nanjing passed the Reorganization of the Nationalist Government Act This act stipulated that the Nationalist Government was to be directed and regulated under the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang with the Committee of the Nationalist Government being elected by the KMT Central Committee Under the Nationalist Government were seven ministries Interior Foreign Affairs Finance Transport Justice Agriculture and Mines and Commerce in addition to institutions such as the Supreme Court Control Yuan and the General Academy
With the promulgation of the Organic Law of the Nationalist Government in October the government was reorganized into five different branches or yuan namely the Executive Yuan Legislative Yuan Judicial Yuan Examination Yuan as well as the Control Yuan The Chairman of the National Government was to be the head of state and commander in chief of the National Revolutionary Army Chiang Kai shek was appointed as the first chairman a position he would retain until The Organic Law also stipulated that the Kuomintang through its National Congress and Central Executive Committee would exercise sovereign power during the period of political tutelage that the KMT's Political Council would guide and superintend the Nationalist Government in the execution of important national affairs and that the Political Council has the power to interpret or amend the Organic Law
Shortly after the Second Sino Japanese War a long delayed constitutional convention was summoned to meet in Nanking in May Amidst heated debate this convention adopted many constitutional amendments demanded by several parties including the KMT and the Communist Party into the Constitution This Constitution was promulgated on December and came into effect on December Under it the Central Government was divided into the presidency and the five yuans each responsible for a part of the government None was responsible to the other except for certain obligations such as the president appointing the head of the Executive Yuan Ultimately the president and the yuans reported to the National Assembly which represented the will of the citizens
Under the new constitution the first elections for the National Assembly occurred in January and the assembly was summoned to meet in March It elected the president of the republic on March formally bringing an end to the KMT party rule started in although the president was a member of the KMT These elections though praised by at least one US observer were poorly received by the Communist Party which would soon start an open armed insurrection
Before the Nationalist government was ousted from the mainland the Republic of China had diplomatic relations with countries including Australia Canada Cuba Czechoslovakia Estonia France Germany Guatemala Honduras Italy Japan Latvia Lithuania Norway Panama Siam Soviet Union Spain the United Kingdom the United States and the Holy See The Republic of China was able to maintain most of these diplomatic ties at least initially following the retreat to Taiwan Chiang Kai shek had vowed to quickly return and liberate the mainland and assurance that became a cornerstone of the ROC's post foreign policy
Under the Atlantic Charter the Republic of China was entitled to a permanent seat on the UN Security Council UNSC
Though multiple objections were raised that the seat belonged to the lawful government of China which had to many become the PRC even arguably prior to their the official conclusion of the Chinese Civil War the ROC retained the permanent seat reserved for China on the UNSC until when it was supplanted by the PRC
The Republic of China retained hereditary nobility like the Han Chinese nobles Duke Yansheng and Celestial Masters and Tusi chiefdoms like the Chiefdom of Mangshi Chiefdom of Yongning who continued possessing their titles in the Republic of China from the previous dynasties
The military power of the Republic of China was inherited from the New Army mainly the Beiyang Army which later split into many factions and attacked each other The National Revolutionary Army was established by Sun Yat sen in in Guangdong with the goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang Originally organized with Soviet aid as a means for the KMT to unify China against warlordism the National Revolutionary Army fought many major engagements in the Northern Expedition against Beiyang Army warlords in the Second Sino Japanese War against the Imperial Japanese Army and in the Chinese Civil War against the People's Liberation Army
During the Second Sino Japanese War the armed forces of the CCP were nominally incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army while remaining under separate command but broke away to form the People's Liberation Army shortly after the end of the war With the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in and the formal end of the KMT party state the National Revolutionary Army was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces with the bulk of its forces forming the Republic of China Army which retreated to Taiwan in after their defeat in the Chinese Civil War Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army
In the early years of the Republic of China the economy remained unstable as the country was marked by constant warfare between different regional warlord factions The Beiyang government in Beijing experienced constant changes in leadership and this political instability led to stagnation in economic development until Chinese reunification in under the Kuomintang After this reunification China entered a period of relative stability despite ongoing isolated military conflicts and in the face of Japanese aggression in Shandong and Manchuria in a period known as the Nanjing Decade
Chinese industries grew considerably from to While the economy was hit by the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in and the Great Depression from to industrial output recovered to their earlier peak by This is reflected by the trends in Chinese GDP In China's GDP peaked at billion before falling to billion by and recovering to billion by By foreign investment in China totaled billion with Japan leading billion followed by the United Kingdom billion By however the capital investment had halted and dropped to only billion with the US and Britain being the leading investors
However the rural economy was hit hard by the Great Depression of the s in which an overproduction of agricultural goods lead to falling prices for China as well as an increase in foreign imports as agricultural goods produced in western countries were dumped in China In Chinese imports of rice amounted to million bushels compared with million in Other imports saw even more increases In million bushels of grain were imported compared with in This increased competition lead to a massive decline in Chinese agricultural prices and thus the income of rural farmers In agricultural prices were at percent of levels By rural incomes had fallen to percent of levels in some areas
In Japan invaded China and the resulting warfare laid waste to China Most of the prosperous east coast was occupied by the Japanese who committed atrocities such as the Nanjing massacre In one anti guerilla sweep in the Japanese killed up to civilians in a month The war was estimated to have killed between and million Chinese and destroyed all that Chiang had built up in the preceding decade Development of industries was severely hampered after the war by devastating civil conflict as well as the inflow of cheap American goods By Chinese industries operated at capacity and had of the output of pre war China
One effect of the war with Japan was a massive increase in government control of industries In government owned industries were only of GDP However the ROC government took control of many industries to fight the war In the ROC established a commission for industries and mines to supervise and control firms as well as instilling price controls By of Chinese industry was owned by the government
Following the surrender of Japan in World War II Japanese Taiwan was placed under the control of the ROC In the meantime the KMT renewed its struggle with the communists However the corruption and hyperinflation as a result of trying to fight the civil war resulted in mass unrest throughout the Republic and sympathy for the communists In addition the communists' promise to redistribute land gained them support among the large rural population In the communists captured Beijing and later Nanjing The People's Republic of China was proclaimed on October The Republic of China relocated to Taiwan where Japan had laid an educational groundwork
