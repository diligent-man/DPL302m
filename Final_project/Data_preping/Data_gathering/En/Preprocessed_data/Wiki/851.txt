the landing at saidor codenamed operation michaelmas was an allied amphibious landing at saidor papua new guinea on january as part of operation dexterity during world war ii
in allied hands saidor was a stepping stone towards madang the ultimate objective of general douglas macarthur s huon peninsula campaign
the capture of the airstrip at saidor also allowed construction of an airbase to assist allied air forces to conduct operations against japanese bases at wewak and hollandia
but macarthur s immediate objective was to cut off the imperial japanese troops retreating from sio in the face of the australian advance from finschhafen
following the landing at saidor the japanese elected to retreat rather than fight and withdrew over the foothills of the rugged finisterre range
for the japanese soldiers involved the march was a nightmare as they struggled through the jungles across the swollen rivers and over cliffs and mountains
men succumbed to fatigue disease starvation drowning and even exposure the nights in the finisterres being bitterly cold
hampered by the rugged terrain inclement weather signal failures misunderstandings over caution and above all the resolute and resourceful japanese us troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating japanese from slipping past them
after considerable construction effort in the face of wet weather the airbase was completed and proved useful
whereas the base at nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark there was no such problem at saidor
during march b liberator bombers staged through saidor for night attacks on hollandia
fighting in the south west pacific area in late and early was dominated by general douglas macarthur s operation cartwheel a series of operations directed at isolating and neutralising rabaul the main base of the imperial japanese forces in the south west pacific area
macarthur s original elkton iii plan called for australian troops to capture first lae then finschhafen and finally madang with a combination of airborne and amphibious assaults
however it was a long way from finschhafen to madang mi km
thinking in terms of a shore to shore operation which would be limited in radius of action to the distance that landing craft could sail in one night the commander of allied land forces general sir thomas blamey recommended in august that an intermediate objective be seized first
saidor was chosen as it had accessible beaches a harbour and a pre war airstrip and it was allocated the codename michaelmas by macarthur s general headquarters ghq
it was recognised that the capture of saidor might make that of madang unnecessary as both could cover the dampier and vitiaz straits and both would provide airbases close to the japanese base at wewak
for the time being though both were considered objectives
the battle of finschhafen prevented the early occupation of saidor
the japanese wrested back the initiative and threatened to derail macarthur s strategy but ultimately failed to dislodge the australian th division or prevent the occupation of the finschhafen area
with the battle won the th division initiated a pursuit of lieutenant general hataz adachi s retreating japanese eighteenth army on december
adachi was in a difficult and precarious position attempting to conduct a fighting withdrawal with his inland right flank vulnerable to attack from the australian th division in the ramu valley and his seaward left flank open to amphibious assault
that he had an opportunity to destroy adachi s army was not lost on macarthur who decided on december that saidor should be seized on or about january provided that operation backhander the landing at cape gloucester was proceeding satisfactorily
on december lieutenant general walter krueger the commander of alamo force received orders setting a target date for saidor of january
krueger selected the nd infantry division for the saidor operation as it was at goodenough island but no longer required for the new britain campaign
the assistant division commander brigadier general clarence a
martin was appointed commander of michaelmas task force which was built around the th infantry regimental combat team
the th infantry regiment had been rebuilt after the battle of buna gona and had received six weeks amphibious training in australia and a further three weeks training at milne bay
units assigned to the task force were at goodenough island milne bay oro bay lae finschhafen port moresby kiriwina arawe and cape cretin and in australia
the mission of michaelmas task force was to seize the saidor area establish facilities for a fighter group assist in the establishment of air forces in the area assist in the establishment of light naval forces in the area and construct minimal port and base facilities
notably it did not contain any explicit instruction to fight the japanese
lieutenant general frank berryman s australian ii corps would cooperate by exploitation along the coast while the australian th division would contain japanese forces in the bogadjim area by fighting patrols
maps were supplied by the australian survey corps
there was insufficient time and opportunity for ground reconnaissance so three beaches codenamed red white and blue on the west shore of dekays bay were chosen from aerial photographs
they proved to be narrow rocky and exposed to heavy seas
the intelligence staff at ghq in brisbane believed that there were no more than japanese forward of sio and only more between there and the madang area
they estimated that if the japanese decided to counter attack at saidor they would take a week to bring up men
accordingly martin elected to dispense with a preliminary aerial bombardment
removing this requirement permitted a dawn landing
the assault troops with their supplies and equipment had to be loaded on board the ships on december just five days after the assault on cape gloucester
rear admiral daniel e
barbey s vii amphibious force allotted landing ships tank lsts high speed transports apds and landing craft infantry lcis
a last minute hitch developed on december when it was discovered that only nine apds would be available
new embarkation tables were drawn up shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to lcis and the landing schedule was revised in the light of the reduced number of landing craft
the difficulty of simultaneously supplying operations at saidor arawe long island and cape gloucester was sufficiently daunting for krueger to request a postponement of the saidor operation but the commander of the allied naval forces and the united states seventh fleet vice admiral thomas c
kinkaid assured macarthur that enough supplies would be delivered and macarthur overruled krueger
i am most anxious that if humanly possible this operation take place as scheduled macarthur informed him its capture will have a vital strategic effect which will be lost if materially postponed
the ships and landing craft were escorted by the destroyers uss beale mahan drayton
lamson flusser reid smith and hutchins
the force arrived at dekays bay before dawn on january to find the shore obscured by low hanging clouds and drizzling rain
admiral barbey postponed h hour from to to provide more light for the naval bombardment and then to to allow the landing craft more time to form up
the destroyers fired inch rounds while rocket equipped lcis fired inch rockets
there was no concurrent aerial bombardment but fifth air force b liberators b mitchells and a havocs bombed saidor airstrip later that morning
the first wave reached the shore at about
the first four waves of landing craft personnel ramped lcp r from the apds arrived over the next minutes
each of the six lsts in the assault towed a landing craft mechanized lcm of the nd engineer special brigade two carried bulldozers two carried rocket equipped dukws and two carried spare diesel fuel
the lcms beached shortly before and the lsts soon after
the shore battalion nd engineer boat and shore regiment laid australian reinforcing company arc mesh to provide a roadway across the beach for vehicles
all six lsts were unloaded by
there was little opposition
eleven japanese soldiers were killed by the naval bombardment or assault troops
perhaps as many as transient japanese troops were in the saidor area all of whom fled into the interior
american casualties on the day of the landing came to one soldier killed and five wounded and two sailors drowned
nine japanese nakajima ki helen aircraft escorted by up to twenty a m zero zeke and kawasaki ki tony fighters bombed the beach area at
there were three more air raids during the night and over the course of the month but most were small
macarthur announced the landing in his communiqu the next day
since october the japanese strategy had been to conduct a fighting withdrawal in the face of macarthur s advance that would trade position to the end that the enemy offensive will be crushed as far forward as possible under the accumulation of losses
at general hitoshi imamura s japanese eighth area army headquarters at rabaul the staff debated whether the th and st divisions should attack saidor or slip past it and join up with the rest of the eighteenth army at wewak
in view of the poor condition of the th and st divisions imamura relieved the eighteenth army of responsibility for the sio area and ordered adachi to withdraw to madang
adachi had flown from madang to the st division s headquarters at kiari in late december and he received word of the landing at saidor shortly before heading overland to the th division s headquarters at sio where he received imamura s orders
he placed lieutenant general hidemitsu nakano of the st division in overall command of the forces east of saidor and ordered the st division to move from wewak to madang to defend that area
he then departed for madang by submarine
to harass saidor he withdrew eight companies from major general masutaro nakai s force facing major general alan vasey s australian th division in the finisterres
the nakai force deployed along the mot river around gambumi
it succeeded in repelling american attempts to cross the river until february when it withdrew its mission complete
however weakening the finisterres front provoked an australian attack resulting in the loss of the entire kankirei position
nakano organised the withdrawal of his force
he chose two routes one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of the foothills of the finisterres
initially the th division was to take the coastal route while the st and some naval units took the inland one but this was changed at the last minute and both divisions took the inland route
additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine
however the st division elected to move out rather than wait for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting
the st division had experience crossing the mountains before and nakano was confident of its ability to negotiate them
in the event one submarine was discovered by allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective while a second was discovered and sunk
a third got through but it was a small type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies which were distributed among units of the th division
the difficulty of the march had been underestimated and sick and wounded men had to make their way through trackless regions
lieutenant general kane yoshihara the chief of staff of the eighteenth army recalled the march
the first troops reached madang on february and the whole movement was complete by february
eighteenth army anticipated that units reaching madang would probably have lost much of their equipment as was indeed the case so stores were gathered together from distant wewak and hansa and collected together near madang
in addition emergency articles such as some food shoes and clothing were collected near the mouth of the minderi river supplied by the nakai detachment
american patrols which attempted to reach the track in the sindaman area encountered aggressive japanese patrols
an observation post in the mountains at mambit counted japanese troops passing through yagoyoga between and february and between and february
perhaps another passed through before february
from prisoners of war the michaelmas task force built up a fairly complete and accurate picture of the identity and strength of the opposing japanese forces
on january martin received intelligence from alamo force to the effect that the japanese were concentrating around sio and would attempt to force their way through to madang
in response to a request from martin for reinforcements the st and rd battalion combat teams of the th infantry regiment were sent to reinforce saidor arriving on january
martin came to believe that an advance to the east and an attack on the withdrawing enemy would provide an opportunity to destroy the japanese before they could organise an attack on the saidor position
krueger did not immediately give martin permission for such an operation
there was still the possibility of japanese attack and the nd infantry division was required for the upcoming hansa bay operation
on january a visiting staff officer from alamo force was asked to raise the possibility with krueger
however on january martin received a letter stating that the mission of the michaelmas task force remained unchanged and a radiogram was received on january to the effect that this was not consistent with krueger s wishes
on february martin received a garbled radiogram from krueger that indicated that the earlier restrictive message of january had itself been garbled and on february a radiogram was received authorising offensive action
plans were immediately made but on february contact was made with elements of the australian th division which had relieved the th division on january
this closed the gap on the east flank
the australian official historian david dexter concluded that
there were daily clashes between american and japanese patrols
the most significant occurred on january
a patrol from the st battalion th infantry regiment led by first lieutenants george j
hess and james e
barnett with enlisted men set out to reconnoitre the area around cape iris
the patrol initially moved parallel to the coast but near the village of teterei it changed direction and headed towards the beach
on reaching it the patrol was attacked by the japanese
it attempted to withdraw along the beach but found it blocked and was forced to return to the beach near teterei
the patrol then divided into three groups which attempted to make their way back through the jungle
the groups under barnett and sergeant aaron meyers made it to the american lines
the one under hess reached the mot river but were unable to cross due to the swift current
meyers informed the battalion commander lieutenant colonel gordon m
clarkson of the situation and they quickly assembled a party to go to hess s aid
they reached the river as hess was attempting to swim across with a rope but was being swept downstream and formed a human chain to grab him
at that point a japanese machine gun opened fire on the rescue party killing staff sergeant victor l
olson and fatally wounding clarkson
sergeant thomas reed managed to drag clarkson away but he died soon after
the rescue party was forced to withdraw
eight of the men in hess s group including hess were able to reach american lines during the night
eight americans were killed including clarkson nine were wounded and six were missing none of whom was seen alive again japanese were reported killed
for this action four men were awarded the distinguished service cross including hess and posthumously clarkson and ten received the silver star
with a large construction programme engineers made up of michaelmas task force
an engineer section headquarters was organised on december only nine days before landing consisting of five officers and five enlisted men
later a jeep and a driver were borrowed from the th engineer battalion to provide transportation
the officers did not know each other and therefore were unaware of each other s capabilities
as it turned out none of them had experience with amphibious operations and only one had experience in airbase construction although this was to be their most important task
saidor had an existing grass civilian airstrip
before they had abandoned it in australian troops had sabotaged the airstrip by digging trenches across the runway
these were quickly filled in and the overgrown kunai grass was flattened by driving ton trucks over it
by the afternoon of january ft m of runway was ready for use
a piper cub took off from it the next day
the rd engineer aviation battalion arrived on january and improved the strip permitting twelve c skytrains loaded with ammunition to land on january
alamo force wanted an all weather runway ft m by ft m preferably where a second parallel runway could be constructed if need be
construction of the second runway was requested by the fifth air force on january
the th engineer squadron survey detachment laid out a new runway oriented about from the existing airstrip
the michaelmas task force engineers had the entire site stripped leaving the subgrade exposed
this was a serious error as from to january there were only three days during which it did not rain and in mm of rain fell over the period quite normal for the time of year
as a result construction was delayed
gravel was taken from the nankina river which was laid up to ft cm deep and topped with crushed aggregate
the rains and frequent rolling gave a good water bound surface
part was sealed with bitumen but delays caused by the weather prevented it all being sealed before being overlaid with marston mats
the runway was declared ready for emergency landings on february but the surface deteriorated under use
the runway was finally completed on march
construction of the taxiways and dispersal areas continued through april with the airbase being complete and in operation on may
on march the engineers began construction of the bulk petroleum installation
storage was provided for barrels t of avgas in one barrel t tank and five barrel t tanks
a fuel jetty was constructed allowing tankers to discharge into a pipeline which ran over a catwalk to the storage tanks
work was completed on april
considerable effort had to be expended on road construction
the th engineer aviation battalion had to be assigned to road work the task being beyond the resources of the shore battalion
gravel was laid up to ft cm thick
by late january the weather and damage to the roads by heavy military traffic forced the engineers to impose a ban on morning road use
by midday the sun had dried out the roads and traffic could resume
initially the nankina river could be forded but the heavy seasonal rains turned it into a fast flowing torrent
a portable bridge was flown in from milne bay and erected in a day but it took two weeks to construct the approaches
in the meantime the troops on the other side had to be supplied by water
to open up the most suitable area for camp sites another bridge had to be erected over the nakina
this was a permanent bridge with concrete abutments
a rise in the river level of ft m complicated work but the ft m bridge opened to traffic on february
local labour was supplied by an australian new guinea administrative unit angau detachment initially consisting of eight australian army officers and eleven native police
a week after the landing native labourers were brought in from lae
initially the angau detachment found it difficult to lure the frightened local people in from the bush but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the american perimeter large numbers began to walk in
angau established a native settlement in the biding river area
by february native labourers were at work
they constructed camps for the americans carried supplies to units in the mountains and brought back the wounded and worked in the hospital
angau also carried out patrols providing intelligence on the japanese positions
the amphibian engineers had brought six lcms on the first day
these were joined by another six towed by the six lsts that arrived on the second day
within days the rocky beaches and reefs had caused nine to be damaged so badly that they had to be sent back to cape cretin for repairs
later in january the rest of b company nd engineer boat and shore regiment was sent to saidor
a ft m lighter wharf was begun on january and completed on march
the unseasoned local timber used in its construction soon took a battering from heavily loaded barges bumping into them in high seas and had to be replaced with steel piles
a ft m liberty ship wharf was completed on may
other construction activities included jetties for servicing pt boats landings for lsts a bed hospital opened on may a quartermaster dump and a staging area for
saidor was soon in use by the fifth air force
its base at nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark but there was no such problem at saidor
during march b liberator bombers staged through saidor for night attacks on hollandia
a raid on hollandia on april encountered a weather front that closed nadzab and the other fields in the markham valley
more than aircraft made their way to saidor
an f lightning and a b mitchell collided on the runway and two aircraft cracked up on landing but the other aircraft that made it to saidor eventually returned to their bases
krueger reported that michaelmas task force tried hard to block these escape routes
but the torrential rain the ruggedness of the country with its impenetrable rain forests and jungles and impassable rivers and the resistance of enemy troops pushed forward from madang to guard the trails leading eastward made this effort fall short of success
australian commanders were critical
in a letter to blamey berryman who had visited krueger in an attempt to ensure that the japanese would not escape wrote that about semi starved ill equipped and dispirited japanese bypassed saidor
it was disappointing that the fruits of victory were not fully reaped and that once again the remnants of the st division escaped our clutches lieutenant general sir leslie morshead of new guinea force reported to blamey that michaelmas task force appeared not to have made any appreciable effort to cut off the retreating japanese
sadly for the men of the nd infantry division many of these japanese would later have to be fought again under less advantageous circumstances in the battle of driniumor river
krueger officially terminated operation dexterity of which michaelmas was a part on february
all that remained now was the final act of the huon peninsula campaign the capture of madang
in the australian th division s advance from sio to saidor between january and the end of february japanese were killed found dead and japanese prisoners were taken
australian and papuan casualties came to killed and wounded
the us nd infantry division at saidor killed japanese and captured while losing killed wounded missing
