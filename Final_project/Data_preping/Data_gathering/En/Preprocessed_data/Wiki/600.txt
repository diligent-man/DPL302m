s ren aabye kierkegaard s r n k rk rd sorr n keer k gard us also r gor danish s n py k i k k listen may november was a danish theologian philosopher poet social critic and religious author who is widely considered to be the first existentialist philosopher
he wrote critical texts on organized religion christianity morality ethics psychology and the philosophy of religion displaying a fondness for metaphor irony and parables
much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a single individual giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment
he was against literary critics who defined idealist intellectuals and philosophers of his time and thought that swedenborg hegel fichte schelling schlegel and hans christian andersen were all understood far too quickly by scholars
kierkegaard s theological work focuses on christian ethics the institution of the church the differences between purely objective proofs of christianity the infinite qualitative distinction between man and god and the individual s subjective relationship to the god man jesus the christ which came through faith
much of his work deals with christian love
he was extremely critical of the doctrine and practice of christianity as a state controlled religion like the church of denmark
his psychological work explored the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices
kierkegaard s early work was written under the various pseudonyms to present distinctive viewpoints that interact in complex dialogue
he explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints each under a different pseudonym
he wrote many upbuilding discourses under his own name and dedicated them to the single individual who might want to discover the meaning of his works
notably he wrote science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way
christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective to become a subject while scientists can learn about the world by observation kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation alone could reveal the inner workings of the world of the spirit
some of kierkegaard s key ideas include the concept of subjective and objective truths the knight of faith the recollection and repetition dichotomy angst the infinite qualitative distinction faith as a passion and the three stages on life s way
kierkegaard wrote in danish and the reception of his work was initially limited to scandinavia but by the turn of the th century his writings were translated into french german and other major european languages
by the mid th century his thought exerted a substantial influence on philosophy theology and western culture
kierkegaard was born to an affluent family in copenhagen
his mother ane s rensdatter lund kierkegaard had served as a maid in the household before marrying his father michael pedersen kierkegaard
she was an unassuming figure quiet and not formally educated
her granddaughter henriette lund wrote that she wielded the sceptre with joy and protected s ren and peter like a hen protecting her chicks
she also wielded influence on her children so that later peter said that his brother preserved many of their mother s words in his writings
his father on the other hand was a well to do wool merchant from jutland
he was a very stern man to all appearances dry and prosaic but under his rustic cloak demeanor he concealed an active imagination which not even his great age could blunt
he was also interested in philosophy and often hosted intellectuals at his home
the young kierkegaard read the philosophy of christian wolff
kierkegaard who followed his father s beliefs as a child was heavily influenced by michael s devotion to wolffian rationalism which caused his father to retire partly to pursue more of wolff s writings
he also preferred the comedies of ludvig holberg the writings of johann georg hamann gotthold ephraim lessing edward young and plato
the figure of socrates who kierkegaard encountered in plato s dialogues would prove to be a phenomenal influence on the philosopher s later interest in irony as well as his frequent deployment of indirect communication
copenhagen in the s and s had crooked streets where carriages rarely went
kierkegaard loved to walk them
in kierkegaard wrote i had real christian satisfaction in the thought that if there were no other there was definitely one man in copenhagen whom every poor person could freely accost and converse with on the street that if there were no other there was one man who whatever the society he most commonly frequented did not shun contact with the poor but greeted every maidservant he was acquainted with every manservant every common laborer our lady s church was at one end of the city where bishop mynster preached the gospel
at the other end was the royal theatre where fru heiberg performed
based on a speculative interpretation of anecdotes in kierkegaard s unpublished journals especially a rough draft of a story called the great earthquake some early kierkegaard scholars argued that michael believed he had earned god s wrath and that none of his children would outlive him
he is said to have believed that his personal sins perhaps indiscretions such as cursing the name of god in his youth or impregnating ane out of wedlock necessitated this punishment
though five of his seven children died before he did both kierkegaard and his brother peter christian kierkegaard outlived him
peter who was seven years kierkegaard s elder later became bishop in aalborg
julia watkin thought michael s early interest in the moravian church could have led him to a deep sense of the devastating effects of sin
kierkegaard came to hope that no one would retain their sins even though they have been forgiven
and by the same token that no one who truly believed in the forgiveness of sin would live their own life as an objection against the existence of forgiveness
he made the point that cato committed suicide before caesar had a chance to forgive him
this fear of not finding forgiveness is devastating
edna h
hong quoted kierkegaard in her book forgiveness is a work as well as a grace and kierkegaard wrote about forgiveness in
in samuel barber set to music kierkegaard s prayer father in heaven hold not our sins up against us but hold us up against our sins so that the thought of you when it wakens in our soul and each time it wakens should not remind us of what we have committed but of what you did forgive not of how we went astray but of how you did save us
from to kierkegaard attended the school of civic virtue stre borgerdyd gymnasium when the school was situated in klarebodeme where he studied latin and history among other subjects
during his time there he was described as very conservative someone who would honour the king love the church and respect the police
he frequently got into altercations with fellow students and was ambivalent towards his teachers
he went on to study theology at the university of copenhagen
he had little interest in historical works philosophy dissatisfied him and he couldn t see dedicating himself to speculation
he said what i really need to do is to get clear about what am i to do not what i must know he wanted to lead a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge
kierkegaard didn t want to be a philosopher in the traditional or hegelian sense and he didn t want to preach a christianity that was an illusion
but he had learned from his father that one can do what one wills and his father s life had not discredited this theory
one of the first physical descriptions of kierkegaard comes from an attendee hans br chner at his brother peter s wedding party in i found his appearance almost comical
he was then twenty three years old he had something quite irregular in his entire form and had a strange coiffure
his hair rose almost six inches above his forehead into a tousled crest that gave him a strange bewildered look another comes from kierkegaard s niece henriette lund
when s ren kierkegaard was a little boy he was of slender and delicate appearance and ran about in a little coat of red cabbage color
he used to be called fork by his father because of his tendency developed quite early toward satirical remarks
although a serious almost austere tone pervaded the kierkegaards house i have the firm impression that there was a place for youthful vivacity too even though of a more sedate and home made kind than one is used to nowadays
the house was open for an old fashioned hospitality he was also described quaintly attired slight and small
kierkegaard s mother was a nice little woman with an even and happy disposition according to a grandchild s description
she was never mentioned in kierkegaard s works
ane died on july age possibly from typhus
his father died on august age
on august kierkegaard wrote my father died on wednesday the th at a m
i so deeply desired that he might have lived a few years more
right now i feel there is only one person e
boesen with whom i can really talk about him
he was a faithful friend troels frederik lund his nephew was instrumental in providing biographers with much information regarding s ren kierkegaard
lund was a good friend of georg brandes and julius lange
here is an anecdote about his father from kierkegaard s journals
according to samuel hugo bergmann kierkegaard s journals are one of the most important sources for an understanding of his philosophy
kierkegaard wrote over pages in his journals on events musings thoughts about his works and everyday remarks
the entire collection of danish journals journalen was edited and published in volumes consisting of separate bindings including indices
the first english edition of the journals was edited by alexander dru in
the style is literary and poetic in manner
kierkegaard wanted to have regine his fianc e see below as his confidant but considered it an impossibility for that to happen so he left it to my reader that single individual to become his confidant
his question was whether or not one can have a spiritual confidant
he wrote the following in his concluding postscript with regard to the essential truth a direct relation between spirit and spirit is unthinkable
if such a relation is assumed it actually means that the party has ceased to be spirit
kierkegaard s journals were the source of many aphorisms credited to the philosopher
the following passage from august is perhaps his most oft quoted aphorism and a key quote for existentialist studies
he wrote this way about indirect communication in the same journal entry
one must first learn to know himself before knowing anything else
not until a man has inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning only then is he free of that irksome sinister traveling companion that irony of life which manifests itself in the sphere of knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not knowing socrates just as god created the world from nothing
but in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue
here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path then hurls him into the abyss of despair
often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought after all things cannot be otherwise only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation
frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again
when he struggles along the right path rejoicing in having overcome temptation s power there may come at almost the same time right on the heels of perfect victory an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down like sisyphus from the height of the crag
often when a person has concentrated on something a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything
as in the case of a man who weary of life is about to throw himself into the thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst as in tuberculosis
in vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here
s ren kierkegaard s journals papers ia gilleleie august although his journals clarify some aspects of his work and life kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much
abrupt changes in thought repetitive writing and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track
consequently there are many varying interpretations of his journals
kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future
in december he wrote were i to die now the effect of my life would be exceptional much of what i have simply jotted down carelessly in the journals would become of great importance and have a great effect for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was and is my right
an important aspect of kierkegaard s life generally considered to have had a major influence on his work was his broken engagement to regine olsen
kierkegaard and olsen met on may and were instantly attracted to each other but sometime around august he had second thoughts
in his journals kierkegaard wrote idealistically about his love for her
on september kierkegaard formally proposed to olsen
he soon felt disillusioned about his prospects
he broke off the engagement on august though it is generally believed that the two were deeply in love
in his journals kierkegaard mentions his belief that his melancholy made him unsuitable for marriage but his precise motive for ending the engagement remains unclear
later on he wrote i owe everything to the wisdom of an old man and to the simplicity of a young girl the old man in this statement is said to be his father while olsen was the girl
martin buber said kierkegaard does not marry in defiance of the whole nineteenth century
kierkegaard then turned his attention to his examinations
on may he wrote i have no alternative than to suppose that it is god s will that i prepare for my examination and that it is more pleasing to him that i do this than actually coming to some clearer perception by immersing myself in one or another sort of research for obedience is more precious to him than the fat of rams the death of his father and the death of poul m ller also played a part in his decision
on september kierkegaard wrote and defended his master s thesis on the concept of irony with continual reference to socrates
the university panel considered it noteworthy and thoughtful but too informal and witty for a serious academic thesis
the thesis dealt with irony and schelling s lectures which kierkegaard had attended with mikhail bakunin jacob burckhardt and friedrich engels each had come away with a different perspective
kierkegaard graduated from university on october with a magister artium master of arts
his family s inheritance of approximately rigsdaler enabled him to fund his work and living expenses including servants
kierkegaard published some of his works using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author
whether being published under pseudonym or not kierkegaard s central writing on religion was fear and trembling and either or is considered to be his magnum opus
pseudonyms were used often in the early th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author s own
kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication
in writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular
he has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to christianity
after on the concept of irony with continual reference to socrates his master s thesis under frederik christian sibbern da he wrote his first book under the pseudonym johannes climacus after john climacus between and
de omnibus dubitandum est latin everything must be doubted was not published until after his death
kierkegaard s magnum opus either or was published february it was mostly written during kierkegaard s stay in berlin where he took notes on schelling s philosophy of revelation
either or includes essays of literary and music criticism and a set of romantic like aphorisms as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith
edited by victor eremita the book contained the papers of an unknown a and b which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary
eremita had a hard time putting the papers of a in order because they were not straightforward
b s papers were arranged in an orderly fashion
both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals
each approached the idea of first love from an aesthetic and an ethical point of view
the book is basically an argument about faith and marriage with a short discourse at the end telling them they should stop arguing
eremita thinks b a judge makes the most sense
kierkegaard stressed the how of christianity as well as the how of book reading in his works rather than the what
three months after the publication of either or may he published two upbuilding discourses and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books
these discourses were published under kierkegaard s own name and are available as eighteen upbuilding discourses today
david f
swenson first translated the works in the s and titled them the edifying discourses however in howard v
and edna h
hong translated the works again but called them the upbuilding discourses
the word upbuilding was more in line with kierkegaard s thought after when he wrote christian deliberations about works of love
an upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn t the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself
the discourse or conversation should be upbuilding which means one would build up the other person or oneself rather than tear down to build up
kierkegaard said although this little book which is called discourses not sermons because its author does not have authority to preach upbuilding discourses not discourses for upbuilding because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher wishes to be only what it is a superfluity and desires only to remain in hiding
on october kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses
fear and trembling was published under the pseudonym johannes de silentio
repetition is about a young man s ren kierkegaard who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl regine olsen to god
he tries to see if the new science of psychology can help him understand himself
constantin constantius who is the pseudonymous author of that book is the psychologist
at the same time he published three upbuilding discourses under his own name which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others
these three books all published on the same day are an example of kierkegaard s method of indirect communication
kierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from god or not and concludes by saying it does not depend then merely upon what one sees but what one sees depends upon how one sees all observation is not just a receiving a discovering but also a bringing forth and insofar as it is that how the observer himself is constituted is indeed decisive god s love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is
during he published two three and four more upbuilding discourses just as he did in but here he discussed how an individual might come to know god
theologians philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of god
this is direct communication and kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians philosophers and historians associations but not at all useful for the single individual who is interested in becoming a christian
kierkegaard always wrote for that single individual whom i with joy and gratitude call my reader the single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost
reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about
love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are
he also wrote several more pseudonymous books in philosophical fragments prefaces and the concept of anxiety and finished the year up with four upbuilding discourses
he used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them
he doesn t believe the question about god s existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made
he says it s up to the single individual to make the fruit of the holy spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities
christendom wanted to define god s attributes once and for all but kierkegaard was against this
his love for regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view
kierkegaard believed each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations
in an earlier book he had said to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning and in another no generation has learned to love from another no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one and finally in he wrote those true christians who in every generation live a life contemporaneous with that of christ have nothing whatsoever to do with christians of the preceding generation but all the more with their contemporary christ
his life here on earth attends every generation and every generation severally as sacred history but in the whole generation and every individual in the generation is a participant in one s having faith
he was against the hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a third term that comes between the single individual and the object of desire
kierkegaard wrote in if a person can be assured of the grace of god without needing temporal evidence as a middleman or as the dispensation advantageous to him as interpreter then it is indeed obvious to him that the grace of god is the most glorious of all he was against mediation and settled instead on the choice to be content with the grace of god or not
it s the choice between the possibility of the temporal and the eternal mistrust and belief and deception and truth subjective and objective
these are the magnitudes of choice
he always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison
this is how kant put it in and kierkegaard put it in kierkegaard believed god comes to each individual mysteriously
he published three discourses on imagined occasions first called thoughts on crucial situations in human life in david f
swenson s translation under his own name on april and stages on life s way edited by hilarius bookbinder april
the stages is a sequel to either or which kierkegaard did not think had been adequately read by the public and in stages he predicted that two thirds of the book s readers will quit before they are halfway through out of boredom they will throw the book away he knew he was writing books but had no idea who was reading them
his sales were meager and he had no publicist or editor
he was writing in the dark so to speak
many of his readers have been and continue to be in the dark about his intentions
he explained himself in his journal what i have understood as the task of the authorship has been done
it is one idea this continuity from either or to anti climacus the idea of religiousness in reflection
the task has occupied me totally for it has occupied me religiously i have understood the completion of this authorship as my duty as a responsibility resting upon me he advised his reader to read his books slowly and also to read them aloud since that might aid in understanding
he used indirect communication in his writings by for instance referring to the religious person as the knight of hidden inwardness in which he s different from everyone else even though he looks like everyone else because everything is hidden within him
he put it this way in you are indistinguishable from anyone else among those whom you might wish to resemble those who in the decision are with the good they are all clothed alike girdled about the loins with truth clad in the armor of righteousness wearing the helmet of salvation
kierkegaard was aware of the hidden depths inside of each single individual
the hidden inwardness is inventive in deceiving or evading others
much of it is afraid of being seen and entirely disclosed
therefore all calm and in the intellectual sense dispassionate observers who eminently know how to delve searchingly and penetratingly into the inner being these very people judge with such infinite caution or refrain from it entirely because enriched by observation they have a developed conception of the enigmatic world of the hidden and because as observers they have learned to rule over their passions
only superficial impetuous passionate people who do not understand themselves and for that reason naturally are unaware that they do not know others judge precipitously
those with insight those who know never do this
kierkegaard imagined hidden inwardness several ways in
imagine hidden in a very plain setting a secret chest in which the most precious is placed there is a spring that must be pressed but the spring is concealed and the pressure must be of a certain force so that an accidental pressure cannot be sufficient
the hope of eternity is concealed within a person s innermost being in the same way and hardship is the pressure
when the pressure is put on the concealed spring and forcefully enough the content appears in all its glory soren kierkegaard christian discourses hong p
imagine a kernel of grain placed in the earth if it is to grow what does it need first of all space it must have space
next pressure there must also be pressure sprouting is making space for itself in opposition
eternity s hope is placed in a person s innermost being in the same way
but hardship makes space by setting everything else aside everything provisional which is brought to despair thus hardship s pressure is what draws forth soren kierkegaard christian discourses hong p
imagine as indeed is the case an animal that has a defense weapon with which it defends itself but which it uses only in mortal danger
eternity s hope is in a person s innermost being in the same way hardship is the mortal danger
imagine a creeping animal that nevertheless has wings that it can use when it is brought to an extremity but for everyday use it does not find it worth the trouble to use them
eternity s hope is in a person s innermost being in the same way he has wings but he must be brought to an extremity in order to discover them or in order to develop them or in order to use them soren kierkegaard christian discourses hong p
he was writing about the subjective inward nature of god s encounter with the individual in many of his books and his goal was to get the single individual away from all the speculation that was going on about god and christ
speculation creates quantities of ways to find god and his goods but finding faith in christ and putting the understanding to use stops all speculation because then one begins to actually exist as a christian or in an ethical religious way
he was against an individual waiting until certain of god s love and salvation before beginning to try to become a christian
he defined this as a special type of religious conflict the germans call anfechtung contesting or disputing
in kierkegaard s view the church should not try to prove christianity or even defend it
it should help the single individual to make a leap of faith the faith that god is love and has a task for that very same single individual
he wrote the following about fear and trembling and love as early as fear and trembling is not the primus motor in the christian life for it is love but it is what the oscillating balance wheel is to the clock it is the oscillating balance wheel of the christian life
kierkegaard identified the leap of faith as the good resolution
kierkegaard discussed the knight of faith in works of love by using the story of jesus healing the bleeding woman who showed the originality of faith by believing that if she touched jesus robe she would be healed
she kept that secret within herself
if doubt is the beginning then god is lost long before the end and the individual is released from always having a task but also from always having the comfort that there is always a task
but if the consciousness of guilt is the beginning then the beginning of doubt is rendered impossible and then the joy is that there is always a task
the joy then is that it is eternally certain that god is love more specifically understood the joy is that there is always a task
as long as there is life there is hope but as long as there is a task there is life and as long as there is life there is hope indeed the task itself is not merely a hope for a future time but is a joyful present

kierkegaard wrote his concluding unscientific postscript to philosophical fragments in and here he tried to explain the intent of the first part of his authorship
he said christianity will not be content to be an evolution within the total category of human nature an engagement such as that is too little to offer to a god
neither does it even want to be the paradox for the believer and then surreptitiously little by little provide him with understanding because the martyrdom of faith to crucify one s understanding is not a martyrdom of the moment but the martyrdom of continuance the second part of his authorship was summed up in practice in christianity early kierkegaardian scholars such as theodor w
adorno and thomas henry croxall argue that the entire authorship should be treated as kierkegaard s own personal and religious views
this view leads to confusions and contradictions which make kierkegaard appear philosophically incoherent
later scholars such as the post structuralists interpreted kierkegaard s work by attributing the pseudonymous texts to their respective authors
postmodern christians present a different interpretation of kierkegaard s works
kierkegaard used the category of the individual to stop the endless either or
kierkegaard s most important pseudonyms in chronological order were
victor eremita editor of either or
a writer of many articles in either or
judge william author of rebuttals to a in either or
johannes de silentio author of fear and trembling
constantine constantius author of the first half of repetition
young man author of the second half of repetition
vigilius haufniensis author of the concept of anxiety
nicolaus notabene author of prefaces
hilarius bookbinder editor of stages on life s way
johannes climacus author of philosophical fragments and concluding unscientific postscript
inter et inter author of the crisis and a crisis in the life of an actress
h h author of two minor ethical religious essays
anti climacus author of the sickness unto death and practice in christianity
kierkegaard explained his pseudonyms this way in his concluding unscientific postscript all of these writings analyze the concept of faith on the supposition that if people are confused about faith as kierkegaard thought the inhabitants of christendom were they will not be in a position to develop the virtue
faith is a matter of reflection in the sense that one cannot have the virtue unless one has the concept of virtue or at any rate the concepts that govern faith s understanding of self world and god
on december peder ludvig m ller who studied at the university of copenhagen at the same time as kierkegaard published an article indirectly criticizing stages on life s way
the article complimented kierkegaard for his wit and intellect but questioned whether he would ever be able to master his talent and write coherent complete works
m ller was also a contributor to and editor of the corsair a danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing
kierkegaard published a sarcastic response charging that m ller s article was merely an attempt to impress copenhagen s literary elite
kierkegaard wrote two small pieces in response to m ller the activity of a traveling esthetician and dialectical result of a literary police action
the former focused on insulting m ller s integrity while the latter was a directed assault on the corsair in which kierkegaard after criticizing the journalistic quality and reputation of the paper openly asked the corsair to satirize him
kierkegaard s response earned him the ire of the paper and its second editor also an intellectual of kierkegaard s own age me r aron goldschmidt
over the next few months the corsair took kierkegaard up on his offer to be abused and unleashed a series of attacks making fun of kierkegaard s appearance voice and habits
for months kierkegaard perceived himself to be the victim of harassment on the streets of denmark
in a journal entry dated march kierkegaard made a long detailed explanation of his attack on m ller and the corsair and also explained that this attack made him rethink his strategy of indirect communication
there had been much discussion in denmark about the pseudonymous authors until the publication of concluding unscientific postscript to philosophical fragments february where he openly admitted to be the author of the books because people began wondering if he was in fact a christian or not
several journal entries from that year shed some light on what kierkegaard hoped to achieve
this book was published under an earlier pseudonym johannes climacus
on march he published two ages a literary review under his own name
a critique of the novel two ages in some translations two generations written by thomasine christine gyllembourg ehrensv rd kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of modernity and its passionless attitude towards life
kierkegaard writes that the present age is essentially a sensible age devoid of passion
the trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual
in this kierkegaard attacked the conformity and assimilation of individuals into the crowd which became the standard for truth since it was the numerical
how can one love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame as part of his analysis of the crowd kierkegaard accused newspapers of decay and decadence
kierkegaard stated christendom had lost its way by recognizing the crowd as the many who are moved by newspaper stories as the court of last resort in relation to the truth
truth comes to a single individual not all people at one and the same time
just as truth comes to one individual at a time so does love
one doesn t love the crowd but does love their neighbor who is a single individual
he says never have i read in the holy scriptures this command you shall love the crowd even less you shall ethico religiously recognize in the crowd the court of last resort in relation to the truth
kierkegaard began to write again in the three part edifying discourses in diverse spirits
it included purity of heart is to will one thing what we learn from the lilies in the field and from the birds in the air and the gospel of sufferings
he asked what does it mean to be a single individual who wants to do the good what does it mean to be a human being what does it mean to follow christ he now moves from upbuilding edifying discourses to christian discourses however he still maintains that these are not sermons
a sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks
later in he wrote devotional discourses and godly discourses is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy is it really hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task oh no but this is hopelessness to will with all one s might but there is no task
thus only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before god for if he is guilty there is indeed always something to do only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task only then is there hopelessness
upbuilding discourses in various spirits hong p
works of love followed these discourses on september
both books were authored under his own name
it was written under the themes love covers a multitude of sins and love builds up
peter and corinthians kierkegaard believed that all human speech even divine speech of holy scripture about the spiritual is essentially metaphorical speech
to build up is a metaphorical expression
one can never be all human or all spirit one must be both
later in the same book kierkegaard deals with the question of sin and forgiveness
he uses the same text he used earlier in three upbuilding discourses love hides a multitude of sins
peter
he asks if one who tells his neighbors faults hides or increases the multitude of sins
in he published christian discourses under his own name and the crisis and a crisis in the life of an actress under the pseudonym inter et inter
christian discourses deals the same theme as the concept of anxiety angst
the text is the gospel of matthew verses
this was the same passage he had used in his what we learn from the lilies in the field and from the birds of the air of
he wrote
kierkegaard tried to explain his prolific use of pseudonyms again in the point of view of my work as an author his autobiographical explanation for his writing style
the book was finished in but not published until after his death by his brother christian peter kierkegaard
walter lowrie mentioned kierkegaard s profound religious experience of holy week as a turning point from indirect communication to direct communication regarding christianity
however kierkegaard stated that he was a religious author throughout all of his writings and that his aim was to discuss the problem of becoming a christian with a direct polemic against the monstrous illusion we call christendom
he expressed the illusion this way in his christian address thoughts which wound from behind for edification
he wrote three discourses under his own name and one pseudonymous book in
he wrote the lily in the field and the bird of the air
three devotional discourses three discourses at the communion on fridays and two ethical religious essays
the first thing any child finds in life is the external world of nature
this is where god placed his natural teachers
he s been writing about confession and now openly writes about holy communion which is generally preceded by confession
this he began with the confessions of the esthete and the ethicist in either or and the highest good peace in the discourse of that same book
his goal has always been to help people become religious but specifically christian religious
he summed his position up earlier in his book the point of view of my work as an author but this book was not published until
the second edition of either or was published early in
later that year he published the sickness unto death under the pseudonym anti climacus
he s against johannes climacus who kept writing books about trying to understand christianity
here he says let others admire and praise the person who pretends to comprehend christianity
i regard it as a plain ethical task perhaps requiring not a little self denial in these speculative times when all the others are busy with comprehending to admit that one is neither able nor supposed to comprehend it sickness unto death was a familiar phrase in kierkegaard s earlier writings
this sickness is despair and for kierkegaard despair is a sin
despair is the impossibility of possibility
kierkegaard writes
in practice in christianity september his last pseudonymous work he stated in this book originating in the year the requirement for being a christian is forced up by the pseudonymous authors to a supreme ideality this work was called training in christianity when walter lowrie translated it in
he now pointedly referred to the acting single individual in his next three publications for self examination two discourses at the communion on fridays and in judge for yourselves
judge for yourselves was published posthumously in
here is an interesting quote from for self examination if in observing the present state of the world and life in general from a christian point of view one had to say and from a christian point of view with complete justification it is a disease
and if i were a physician and someone asked me what do you think should be done i would answer the first thing the unconditional condition for anything to be done consequently the very first thing that must be done is create silence bring about silence god s word cannot be heard and if in order to be heard in the hullabaloo it must be shouted deafeningly with noisy instruments then it is not god s word create silence
ah everything is noisy and just as strong drink is said to stir the blood so everything in our day even the most insignificant project even the most empty communication is designed merely to jolt the senses and to stir up the masses the crowd the public noise
and man this clever fellow seems to have become sleepless in order to invent ever new instruments to increase noise to spread noise and insignificance with the greatest possible haste and on the greatest possible scale
yes everything is soon turned upside down communication is indeed soon brought to its lowest point in regard to meaning and simultaneously the means of communication are indeed brought to their highest with regard to speedy and overall circulation for what is publicized with such hot haste and on the other hand what has greater circulation than rubbish oh create silence soren kierkegaard for self examination p
in kierkegaard wrote his two discourses at the communion on fridays where he once more discussed sin forgiveness and authority using that same verse from peter that he used twice in with his three upbuilding discourses
kierkegaard began his book either or with a question are passions then the pagans of the soul reason alone baptized he didn t want to devote himself to thought or speculation like hegel did
faith hope love peace patience joy self control vanity kindness humility courage cowardliness pride deceit and selfishness
these are the inner passions that thought knows little about
hegel begins the process of education with thought but kierkegaard thinks we could begin with passion or a balance between the two a balance between goethe and hegel
he was against endless reflection with no passion involved
but at the same time he did not want to draw more attention to the external display of passion but the internal hidden passion of the single individual
kierkegaard clarified this intention in his journals
schelling put nature first and hegel put reason first but kierkegaard put the human being first and the choice first in his writings
he makes an argument against nature here and points out that most single individuals begin life as spectators of the visible world and work toward knowledge of the invisible world
suppose that it were not one man who traveled from jericho to jerusalem but there were two and both of them were assaulted by robbers and maimed and no traveler passed by
suppose then that one of them did nothing but moan while the other forgot and surmounted his own suffering to speak comfortingly friendly words or what involved great pain dragged himself to some water to fetch the other a refreshing drink
or suppose that they were both bereft of speech but one of them in his silent prayer sighed to god also for the other was he then not merciful if someone has cut off my hands then i cannot play the zither and if someone has cut off my feet then i cannot dance and if i lie crippled on the shore then i cannot throw myself into the sea to rescue another person s life and if i myself am lying with a broken arm or leg then i cannot plunge into the flames to save another s life but i can still be merciful
i have often pondered how a painter might portray mercifulness but i have decided that it cannot be done
as soon as a painter is to do it it becomes dubious whether it is mercifulness or it is something else

seek ye first god s kingdom and his righteousness matthew
but what does this mean what have i to do or what sort of effort is it that can be said to seek or pursue the kingdom of god shall i try to get a job suitable to my talents and powers in order thereby to exert an influence no thou shalt first seek god s kingdom
shall i then give all my fortune to the poor no thou shalt first seek god s kingdom
shall i then go out to proclaim this teaching to the world no thou shalt first seek god s kingdom
but then in a certain sense it is nothing i shall do
yes certainly in a certain it is nothing thou shalt in the deepest sense make thyself nothing become nothing before god learn to keep silent in this silence is the beginning which is first to seek god s kingdom
in this wise a godly wise one gets to the beginning by going in a sense backwards
the beginning is not that with which one begins but at which one arrives at the beginning backwards
the beginning is this art of becoming silent for to be silent as nature is is not an art
it is man s superiority over the beasts to be able to speak but in relation to god it can easily become the ruin of man who is able to speak that he is too willing to speak
god is love man is as one says to a child a silly little thing even so far as his own wellbeing is concerned
only in much fear and trembling can a man walk with god in much fear and trembling
but to talk in much fear and trembling is difficult for as a sense of dread causes the bodily voice to fail so also does much fear and trembling render the voice mute in silence
this the true man of prayer knows well and he who was not the true man of prayer learned precisely this by praying

kierkegaard s final years were taken up with a sustained outright attack on the church of denmark by means of newspaper articles published in the fatherland f drelandet and a series of self published pamphlets called the moment jeblikket also translated as the instant
these pamphlets are now included in kierkegaard s attack upon christendom
the moment was translated into german and other european languages in and again in
kierkegaard first moved to action after professor soon bishop hans lassen martensen gave a speech in church in which he called the recently deceased bishop jacob peter mynster a truth witness one of the authentic truth witnesses
kierkegaard explained in his first article that mynster s death permitted him at last to be frank about his opinions
he later wrote that all his former output had been preparations for this attack postponed for years waiting for two preconditions both his father and bishop mynster should be dead before the attack and he should himself have acquired a name as a famous theologic writer
kierkegaard s father had been mynster s close friend but s ren had long come to see that mynster s conception of christianity was mistaken demanding too little of its adherents
kierkegaard strongly objected to the portrayal of mynster as a truth witness
kierkegaard described the hope the witness to the truth has in and in his journals
kierkegaard s pamphlets and polemical books including the moment criticized several aspects of church formalities and politics
according to kierkegaard the idea of congregations keeps individuals as children since christians are disinclined from taking the initiative to take responsibility for their own relation to god
he stressed that christianity is the individual here the single individual
furthermore since the church was controlled by the state kierkegaard believed the state s bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee the welfare of its members
more members would mean more power for the clergymen a corrupt ideal
this mission would seem at odds with christianity s true doctrine which to kierkegaard is to stress the importance of the individual not the whole
thus the state church political structure is offensive and detrimental to individuals since anyone can become christian without knowing what it means to be christian
it is also detrimental to the religion itself since it reduces christianity to a mere fashionable tradition adhered to by unbelieving believers a herd mentality of the population so to speak
kierkegaard always stressed the importance of the conscience and the use of it
nonetheless kierkegaard has been described as profoundly lutheran
before the tenth issue of his periodical the moment could be published kierkegaard collapsed on the street
he stayed in the hospital for over a month and refused communion
at that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine
he told emil boesen a friend since childhood who kept a record of his conversations with kierkegaard that his life had been one of immense suffering which may have seemed like vanity to others but he did not think it so
kierkegaard died in frederiks hospital after over a month possibly from complications from a fall from a tree in his youth
it has been suggested by professor kaare weismann and philosopher jens staubrand that kierkegaard died from pott disease a form of tuberculosis
he was interred in the assistens kirkeg rd in the n rrebro section of copenhagen
at kierkegaard s funeral his nephew henrik lund caused a disturbance by protesting kierkegaard s burial by the official church
lund maintained that kierkegaard would never have approved had he been alive as he had broken from and denounced the institution
lund was later fined for his disruption of a funeral
in september the western literary messenger wrote while martensen with his wealth of genius casts from his central position light upon every sphere of existence upon all the phenomena of life s ren kierkegaard stands like another simon stylites upon his solitary column with his eye unchangeably fixed upon one point in the danish national church published his obituary
kierkegaard did have an impact there judging from the following quote from their article the fatal fruits which dr
kierkegaard show to arise from the union of church and state have strengthened the scruples of many of the believing laity who now feel that they can remain no longer in the church because thereby they are in communion with unbelievers for there is no ecclesiastical discipline
changes did occur in the administration of the church and these changes were linked to kierkegaard s writings
the church noted that dissent was something foreign to the national mind
on april the church enacted new policies every member of a congregation is free to attend the ministry of any clergyman and is not as formerly bound to the one whose parishioner he is
in march compulsory infant baptism was abolished
debates sprang up over the king s position as the head of the church and over whether to adopt a constitution
grundtvig objected to having any written rules
immediately following this announcement the agitation occasioned by kierkegaard was mentioned
kierkegaard was accused of weigelianism and darbyism but the article continued to say one great truth has been made prominent viz namely that there exists a worldly minded clergy that many things in the church are rotten that all need daily repentance that one must never be contented with the existing state of either the church or her pastors
hans martensen was the subject of a danish article dr
kierkegaard against dr
martensen by hans peter kofoed hansen that was published in untranslated and martensen mentioned him extensively in christian ethics published in
kierkegaard s assertion is therefore perfectly justifiable that with the category of the individual the cause of christianity must stand and fall that without this category pantheism had conquered unconditionally
from this at a glance it may be seen that kierkegaard ought to have made common cause with those philosophic and theological writers who specially desired to promote the principle of personality as opposed to pantheism
this is however far from the case
for those views which upheld the category of existence and personality in opposition to this abstract idealism did not do this in the sense of an either or but in that of a both and
they strove to establish the unity of existence and idea which may be specially seen from the fact that they desired system and totality
martensen accused kierkegaard and alexandre vinet of not giving society its due
he said both of them put the individual above society and in so doing above the church another early critic was magn s eir ksson who criticized martensen and wanted kierkegaard as his ally in his fight against speculative theology
august strindberg was influenced by the danish individualistic philosopher kierkegaard while a student at uppsala university and mentioned him in his book growth of a soul as well as zones of the spirit
edwin bjorkman credited kierkegaard as well as henry thomas buckle and eduard von hartmann with shaping strindberg s artistic form until he was strong enough to stand wholly on his own feet the dramatist henrik ibsen is said to have become interested in kierkegaard as well as the norwegian national writer and poet bj rnstjerne bj rnson who named one of his characters s ren pedersen in his book in god s way
kierkegaard s father s name was michael pedersen kierkegaard
several of kierkegaard s works were translated into german from onward including excerpts from practice in christianity from fear and trembling and concluding unscientific postscript four upbuilding discourses and christian discourses and the lillis of the field and the birds of the air according to kierkegaard s international reception northern and western europe toma i by john stewart see p ff the sickness unto death twelve speeches by s ren kierkegaard by julius fricke stages on life s way b rthold
otto pfleiderer in the philosophy of religion on the basis of its history claimed that kierkegaard presented an anti rational view of christianity
he went on to assert that the ethical side of a human being has to disappear completely in his one sided view of faith as the highest good
he wrote kierkegaard can only find true christianity in entire renunciation of the world in the following of christ in lowliness and suffering especially when met by hatred and persecution on the part of the world
hence his passionate polemic against ecclesiastical christianity which he says has fallen away from christ by coming to a peaceful understanding with the world and conforming itself to the world s life
true christianity on the contrary is constant polemical pathos a battle against reason nature and the world its commandment is enmity with the world its way of life is the death of the naturally human
an article from an dictionary of religion revealed a good idea of how kierkegaard was regarded at that time stating having never left his native city more than a few days at a time excepting once when he went to germany to study schelling s philosophy
he was the most original thinker and theological philosopher the north ever produced
his fame has been steadily growing since his death and he bids fair to become the leading religio philosophical light of germany
not only his theological but also his aesthetic works have of late become the subject of universal study in europe
the first academic to draw attention to kierkegaard was fellow dane georg brandes who published in german as well as danish
brandes gave the first formal lectures on kierkegaard in copenhagen and helped bring him to the attention of the european intellectual community
brandes published the first book on kierkegaard s philosophy and life s ren kierkegaard ein literarisches charakterbild
autorisirte deutsche ausg which adolf hult said was a misconstruction of kierkegaard s work and falls far short of the truth
brandes compared him to hegel and tycho brahe in reminiscences of my childhood and youth
brandes also discussed the corsair affair in the same book
brandes opposed kierkegaard s ideas in the edition of the britannica
brandes compared kierkegaard to nietzsche as well
he also mentioned kierkegaard extensively in volume of his volume work main currents in nineteenth century literature in german and danish english
swedish author waldemar rudin published s ren kierkegaards person och f rfattarskap ett f rs k in
during the s japanese philosophers began disseminating the works of kierkegaard
tetsuro watsuji was one of the first philosophers outside of scandinavia to write an introduction on his philosophy in
harald h ffding wrote an article about him in a brief history of modern philosophy
h ffding mentioned kierkegaard in philosophy of religion and the american journal of theology printed an article about hoffding s philosophy of religion
then h ffding repented of his previous convictions in the problems of philosophy
h ffding was also a friend of the american philosopher william james and although james had not read kierkegaard s works as they were not yet translated into english he attended the lectures about kierkegaard by h ffding and agreed with much of those lectures
james favorite quote from kierkegaard came from h ffding we live forwards but we understand backwards
kierkegaard wrote of moving forward past the irresolute good intention the yes of the promise is sleep inducing but the no spoken and therefore audible to oneself is awakening and repentance is usually not far away
the one who says i will sir is at the same moment pleased with himself the one who says no becomes almost afraid of himself
but this difference if very significant in the first moment and very decisive in the next moment yet if the first moment is the judgment of the momentary the second moment is the judgment of eternity
this is precisely why the world is so inclined to promises inasmuch as the world is the momentary and at the moment a promise looks very good
this is why eternity is suspicious of promises just as it is suspicious of everything momentary
and so it is also with the one who rich in good intentions and quick to promise moves backward further and further away from the good
by means of the intention and the promise he is facing in the direction of the good is turned toward the good but is moving backward further and further away from it
with every renewed intention and promise it looks as if he took a step forward and yet he is not merely standing still but he is actually taking a step backward
the intention taken in vain the unfulfilled promise leaves despondency dejection that in turn perhaps soon blazes up into an even more vehement intention which leaves only greater listlessness
just as the alcoholic continually needs a stronger and stronger stimulant in order to become intoxicated likewise the one who has become addicted to promises and good intentions continually needs more and more stimulation in order to go backward

one thing james did have in common with kierkegaard was respect for the single individual and their respective comments may be compared in direct sequence as follows a crowd is indeed made up of single individuals it must therefore be in everyone s power to become what he is a single individual no one is prevented from being a single individual no one unless he prevents himself by becoming many
to become a crowd to gather a crowd around oneself is on the contrary to distinguish life from life even the most well meaning one who talks about that can easily offend a single individual in his book a pluralistic universe james stated that individuality outruns all classification yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general label
as these heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other the life of philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing and complaints of being misunderstood
but there are signs of clearing up for which both oxford and harvard are partly to be thanked
the encyclopaedia of religion and ethics had an article about kierkegaard in
the article began
friedrich von h gel wrote about kierkegaard in his book eternal life a study of its implications and applications where he said kierkegaard the deep melancholy strenuous utterly uncompromising danish religionist is a spiritual brother of the great frenchman blaise pascal and of the striking english tractarian hurrell froude who died young and still full of crudity yet left an abiding mark upon all who knew him well
john george robertson wrote an article called soren kierkegaard in notwithstanding the fact that during the last quarter of a century we have devoted considerable attention to the literatures of the north the thinker and man of letters whose name stands at the head of the present article is but little known to the english speaking world
the norwegians ibsen and bj rnson have exerted a very real power on our intellectual life and for bj rnson we have cherished even a kind of affection
but kierkegaard the writer who holds the indispensable key to the intellectual life of scandinavia to whom denmark in particular looks up as her most original man of genius in the nineteenth century we have wholly overlooked robertson wrote previously in cosmopolis about kierkegaard and nietzsche

swenson wrote a biography of s ren kierkegaard in
lee m
hollander translated parts of either or fear and trembling stages on life s way and preparations for the christian life practice in christianity into english in with little impact
swenson wrote about kierkegaard s idea of armed neutrality in and a lengthy article about s ren kierkegaard in
swenson stated it would be interesting to speculate upon the reputation that kierkegaard might have attained and the extent of the influence he might have exerted if he had written in one of the major european languages instead of in the tongue of one of the smallest countries in the world
austrian psychologist wilhelm stekel referred to kierkegaard as the fanatical follower of don juan himself the philosopher of don juanism in his book disguises of love
german psychiatrist and philosopher karl jaspers stated he had been reading kierkegaard since and compared kierkegaard s writings with friedrich hegel s phenomenology of mind and the writings of friedrich nietzsche
jaspers saw kierkegaard as a champion of christianity and nietzsche as a champion for atheism
later in karl jaspers emphasized kierkegaard s and nietzsche s continuing importance for modern philosophy
albert barthod began translating kierkegaard s works into german as early as
hermann gottsche published kierkegaard s journals in
it had taken academics years to arrange his journals
kierkegaard s main works were translated into german by christoph schrempf from onwards

jon stewart from the university of copenhagen has written extensively about s ren kierkegaard
kierkegaard s influence on karl barth s early theology is evident in the epistle to the romans
if i have a system it is limited to a recognition of what kierkegaard called the infinite qualitative distinction and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance god is in heaven
and thou art on earth the relation between such a god and such a man and the relation between such a man and such a god is for me the theme of the bible and the essence of philosophy
philosophers name this krisis of human perception the prime cause the bible holds at the same cross roads the figure of jesus christ
when i am faced by such a document as the epistle of paul to the romans i embark on its interpretation on the assumption that he is confronted with the same unmistakable and unmeasurable significance of that relation as i myself am confronted with and that it is this situation which moulds his thought and its expression
karl barth the epistle to the romans preface originally published in german barth read at least three volumes of kierkegaard s works practice in christianity the moment and an anthology from his journals and diaries
almost all key terms from kierkegaard which had an important role in the epistle to the romans can be found in practice in christianity
the concept of the indirect communication the paradox and the moment of practice in christianity in particular confirmed and sharpened barth s ideas on contemporary christianity and the christian life wilhelm pauk wrote in karl barth prophet of a new christianity that kierkegaard s use of the latin phrase finitum non capax infiniti the finite does not or cannot comprehend the infinite summed up barth s system
david g
kingman and adolph keller each discussed barth s relationship to kierkegaard in their books the religious educational values in karl barth s teachings and karl barth and christian unity
keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others
students of kierkegaard became a group of dissatisfied excited radicals when under barthianism
eduard geismar who gave lectures on kierkegaard in march wasn t radical enough for them
barthianism was opposed to the objective treatment of religious questions and to the sovereignty of man in the existential meeting with the transcendent god
but just as students of hegel broke off into right and left so did the german followers of barth
barth endorses the main theme from kierkegaard but also reorganizes the scheme and transforms the details
he expands the theory of indirect communication to the field of christian ethics he applies the concept of unrecognizability to the christian life
he coins the concept of the paradox of faith since the form of faith entails a contradictory encounter of god and human beings
he also portrayed the contemporaneity of the moment when in crisis a human being desperately perceives the contemporaneity of christ
in regard to the concept of indirect communication the paradox and the moment the kierkegaard of the early barth is a productive catalyst
william hubben compared kierkegaard to dostoevsky in his book four prophets of our destiny later titled dostoevsky kierkegaard nietzsche and kafka
in morton white wrote about the word exists and kierkegaard s idea of god s is ness
john daniel wild noted as early as that kierkegaard s works had been translated into almost every important living language including chinese japanese and korean and it is now fair to say that his ideas are almost as widely known and as influential in the world as those of his great opponent hegel still the most potent of world philosophers
mortimer j
adler wrote the following about kierkegaard in for kierkegaard man is essentially an individual not a member of a species or race and ethical and religious truth is known through individual existence and decision through subjectivity not objectivity
systems of thought and a dialectic such as hegel s are matters merely of thought which cannot comprise individual existence and decision
such systems leave out said kierkegaard the unique and essential spermatic point the individual ethically and religiously conceived and existentially accentuated
similarly in the works of the american author henry david thoreau writing at the same time as kierkegaard there is an emphasis on the solitary individual as the bearer of ethical responsibility who when he is right carries the preponderant ethical weight against the state government and a united public opinion when they are wrong
the solitary individual with right on his side is always a majority of one

by william ernest hocking
in life magazine traced the history of existentialism from heraclitus bc and parmenides over the argument over the unchanging one as the real and the state of flux as the real
from there to the old testament psalms and then to jesus and later from jacob boehme to rene descartes and blaise pascal and then on to nietzsche and paul tillich
dostoevski and camus are attempts to rewrite descartes according to their own lights and descartes is the forefather of sartre through the fact that they both used a literary style the article goes on to say kierkegaard s comparatively early and manifold philosophical and theological reception in germany was one of the decisive factors of expanding his works influence and readership throughout the world
important for the first phase of his reception in germany was the establishment of the journal zwischen den zeiten between the ages in by a heterogeneous circle of protestant theologians karl barth emil brunner rudolf bultmann and friedrich gogarten
their thought would soon be referred to as dialectical theology
at roughly the same time kierkegaard was discovered by several proponents of the jewish christian philosophy of dialogue in germany namely by martin buber ferdinand ebner and franz rosenzweig
in addition to the philosophy of dialogue existential philosophy has its point of origin in kierkegaard and his concept of individuality
martin heidegger sparsely refers to kierkegaard in being and time obscuring how much he owes to him
walter kaufmann discussed sartre jaspers and heidegger in relation to kierkegaard and kierkegaard in relation to the crisis of religion in the s
later kierkegaard s fear and trembling series two and the sickness unto death series three were included in the penguin great ideas series two and three
kierkegaard has been called a philosopher a theologian the father of existentialism both atheistic and theistic variations a literary critic a social theorist a humorist a psychologist and a poet
two of his influential ideas are subjectivity and the notion popularly referred to as leap of faith
however the danish equivalent to the english phrase leap of faith does not appear in the original danish nor is the english phrase found in current english translations of kierkegaard s works
kierkegaard does mention the concepts of faith and leap together many times in his works
the leap of faith is his conception of how an individual would believe in god or how a person would act in love
faith is not a decision based on evidence that say certain beliefs about god are true or a certain person is worthy of love
no such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love
faith involves making that commitment anyway
kierkegaard thought that to have faith is at the same time to have doubt
so for example for one to truly have faith in god one would also have to doubt one s beliefs about god the doubt is the rational part of a person s thought involved in weighing evidence without which the faith would have no real substance
someone who does not realize that christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous
for example it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists when one is looking at it and touching it
in the same way to believe or have faith in god is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to god and yet still has faith in god
kierkegaard writes doubt is conquered by faith just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world
kierkegaard also stresses the importance of the self and the self s relation to the world as being grounded in self reflection and introspection
he argued in concluding unscientific postscript to philosophical fragments that subjectivity is truth and truth is subjectivity this has to do with a distinction between what is objectively true and an individual s subjective relation such as indifference or commitment to that truth
people who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently
two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor
this is how kierkegaard put it what a priceless invention statistics are what a glorious fruit of culture what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula the tale is told about you of antiquity
schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at god yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life in other words kierkegaard says who has the more difficult task the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor s distance from everyday life or the learner who should put it to use this is how it was summed up in
kierkegaard primarily discusses subjectivity with regard to religious matters
as already noted he argues that doubt is an element of faith and that it is impossible to gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of god or the life of christ
the most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the christian doctrines are true but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true he or she would not be genuinely religious at all
faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines
kierkegaard s famous philosophical th century critics include theodor adorno and emmanuel levinas
non religious philosophers such as jean paul sartre and martin heidegger supported many aspects of kierkegaard s philosophical views but rejected some of his religious views
one critic wrote that adorno s book kierkegaard construction of the aesthetic is the most irresponsible book ever written on kierkegaard because adorno takes kierkegaard s pseudonyms literally and constructs a philosophy that makes him seem incoherent and unintelligible
another reviewer says that adorno is far away from the more credible translations and interpretations of the collected works of kierkegaard we have today
levinas main attack on kierkegaard focused on his ethical and religious stages especially in fear and trembling
levinas criticises the leap of faith by saying this suspension of the ethical and leap into the religious is a type of violence the leap of faith of course is presented by a pseudonym thus not representing kierkegaard s own view but intending to prompt the exact kind of discussion engaged in by his critics
he states kierkegaardian violence begins when existence is forced to abandon the ethical stage in order to embark on the religious stage the domain of belief
but belief no longer sought external justification
even internally it combined communication and isolation and hence violence and passion
that is the origin of the relegation of ethical phenomena to secondary status and the contempt of the ethical foundation of being which has led through nietzsche to the amoralism of recent philosophies
levinas pointed to the judeo christian belief that it was god who first commanded abraham to sacrifice isaac and that an angel commanded abraham to stop
if abraham were truly in the religious realm he would not have listened to the angel s command and should have continued to kill isaac
to levinas transcending ethics seems like a loophole to excuse would be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable
one interesting consequence of levinas critique is that it seemed to reveal that levinas viewed god as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent
however one of kierkegaard s central points in fear and trembling was that the religious sphere entails the ethical sphere abraham had faith that god is always in one way or another ethically in the right even when he commands someone to kill
therefore deep down abraham had faith that god as an absolute moral authority would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice
he was making the point that god as well as the god man christ doesn t tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in stages on life s way
i conceive of god as one who approves in a calculated vigilance i believe that he approves of intrigues and what i have read in the sacred books of the old testament is not of a sort to dishearten me
the old testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to god and that at a later period christ said to his disciples these things i said not unto you from the beginning i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now so here is a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth
soren kierkegaard quidam s diary from stages on life s way
lowrie translation pp
sartre objected to the existence of god if existence precedes essence it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect
in being and nothingness sartre s phrasing is that god would be a pour soi a being for itself a consciousness who is also an en soi a being in itself a thing which is a contradiction in terms
critics of sartre rebutted this objection by stating that it rests on a false dichotomy and a misunderstanding of the traditional christian view of god
kierkegaard has judge vilhelm express the christian hope this way in either or
either the first contains promise for the future is the forward thrust the endless impulse
or the first does not impel the individual the power which is in the first does not become the impelling power but the repelling power it becomes that which thrusts away
thus for the sake of making a little philosophical flourish not with the pen but with thought god only once became flesh and it would be vain to expect this to be repeated
soren kierkegaard either or ii
lowrie translation pp
sartre agreed with kierkegaard s analysis of abraham undergoing anxiety sartre calls it anguish but claimed that god told abraham to do it
in his lecture existentialism is a humanism sartre wondered whether abraham ought to have doubted whether god actually spoke to him
in kierkegaard s view abraham s certainty had its origin in that inner voice which cannot be demonstrated or shown to another the problem comes as soon as abraham wants to be understood
to kierkegaard every external proof or justification is merely on the outside and external to the subject
kierkegaard s proof for the immortality of the soul for example is rooted in the extent to which one wishes to live forever
faith was something that kierkegaard often wrestled with throughout his writing career under both his real name and behind pseudonyms he explored many different aspects of faith
these various aspects include faith as a spiritual goal the historical orientation of faith particularly toward jesus christ faith being a gift from god faith as dependency on a historical object faith as a passion and faith as a resolution to personal despair
