kierkegaard's famous philosophical -century critic include theodor adorno emmanuel levinas
non-religious philosopher jean-paul sartre martin heidegger supported many aspect kierkegaard's philosophical view rejected religious views
one critic wrote adorno's book kierkegaard construction aesthetic irresponsible book ever written kierkegaard adorno take kierkegaard's pseudonym literally construct philosophy make seem incoherent unintelligible
another reviewer say adorno far away credible translation interpretation collected work kierkegaard today
levinas' main attack kierkegaard focused ethical religious stage especially fear trembling
levinas criticises leap faith saying suspension ethical leap religious type violence leap faith course presented pseudonym thus representing kierkegaard's view intending prompt exact kind discussion engaged critics
state kierkegaardian violence begin existence forced abandon ethical stage order embark religious stage domain belief
even internally combined communication isolation hence violence passion
origin relegation ethical phenomenon secondary status contempt ethical foundation ha led nietzsche amoralism recent philosophies
levinas pointed judeo-christian belief wa god first commanded abraham sacrifice isaac angel commanded abraham stop
abraham truly religious realm would listened angel's command continued kill isaac
levinas transcending ethic seems like loophole excuse would-be murderer crime thus unacceptable
one interesting consequence levinas' critique seemed reveal levinas viewed god projection inner ethical desire rather absolute moral agent
however one kierkegaard's central point fear trembling wa religious sphere entail ethical sphere abraham faith god always one way another ethically right even command someone kill
therefore deep abraham faith god absolute moral authority would never allow end something ethically heinous murdering child passed test blind obedience versus moral choice
wa making point god well god-man christ tell people everything sending mission reiterated stage life's way
conceive god one approves calculated vigilance believe approves intrigue read sacred book old testament sort dishearten me
old testament furnishes example abundantly shrewdness nevertheless well pleasing god later period christ said disciple thing said unto beginning yet many thing say unto ye cannot bear teleological suspension ethical rule telling whole truth
sartre objected existence god existence precedes essence follows meaning term sentient sentient cannot complete perfect
nothingness sartre's phrasing god would pour-soi being-for-itself consciousness also en-soi being-in-itself thing contradiction terms
critic sartre rebutted objection stating rest false dichotomy misunderstanding traditional christian view god
kierkegaard ha judge vilhelm express christian hope way eitheror
either first contains promise future forward thrust endless impulse
first doe impel individual power first doe become impelling power repelling power becomes thrust away
thus sake making little philosophical flourish pen thought-god became flesh would vain expect repeated
sartre agreed kierkegaard's analysis abraham undergoing anxiety sartre call anguish claimed god told abraham it
lecture existentialism humanism sartre wondered whether abraham ought doubted whether god actually spoke him
kierkegaard's view abraham's certainty origin inner voice cannot demonstrated shown another problem come soon abraham want understood
kierkegaard every external proof justification merely outside external subject
kierkegaard's proof immortality soul example rooted extent one wish live forever
