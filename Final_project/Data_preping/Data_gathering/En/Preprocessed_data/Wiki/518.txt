wicca english w k is a modern pagan religion
scholars of religion categorise it as both a new religious movement and as part of the occultist stream of western esotericism
it was developed in england during the first half of the th century and was introduced to the public in by gerald gardner a retired british civil servant
wicca draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practices
wicca has no central authority figure
its traditional core beliefs principles and practices were originally outlined in the s and s by gardner and an early high priestess doreen valiente
the early practices were disseminated through published books and in secret written and oral teachings passed along to their initiates
there are many variations on the core structure and the religion grows and evolves over time
it is divided into a number of diverse lineages sects and denominations referred to as traditions each with its own organisational structure and level of centralisation
due to its decentralized nature there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes wicca
some traditions collectively referred to as british traditional wicca btw strictly follow the initiatory lineage of gardner and consider the term wicca to apply only to similar traditions but not to newer eclectic traditions
wicca is typically duotheistic worshipping and or working with a goddess and a god
these are traditionally viewed as the triple goddess and the horned god respectively
these deities may be regarded in a henotheistic way as having many different divine aspects which can in turn be identified with many diverse pagan deities from different historical pantheons
for this reason they are sometimes referred to as the great goddess and the great horned god with the adjective great connoting a deity that contains many other deities within their own nature
some wiccans refer to the goddess deity as the lady and the god deity as the lord in this context when lord and lady are used as adjectives it is another way of referring to them as a divine figure
these two deities are sometimes viewed as facets of a greater pantheistic divinity which is regarded as an impersonal force or process rather than a personal deity
while duotheism or bitheism is traditional in wicca broader wiccan beliefs range from polytheism to pantheism or monism even to goddess monotheism
wiccan celebrations encompass both the cycles of the moon known as esbats and commonly associated with the goddess female deity and the cycles of the sun seasonally based festivals known as sabbats and commonly associated with the horned god male deity
an unattributed statement known as the wiccan rede is a popular expression of wiccan morality although it is not universally accepted by wiccans
wicca often involves the ritual practice of magic though it is not always necessary
scholars of religious studies classify wicca as a new religious movement and more specifically as a form of modern paganism
cited as the largest best known most influential and most extensively academically studied form of paganism within the movement it has been identified as sitting on the former end of the eclectic to reconstructionist spectrum
several academics have also categorised wicca as a form of nature religion a term that is also embraced by many of its practitioners and as a mystery religion
however given that wicca also incorporates the practice of magic several scholars have referred to it as a magico religion
wicca is also a form of western esotericism and more specifically a part of the esoteric current known as occultism
academics like wouter hanegraaff and tanya luhrmann have categorised wicca as part of the new age although other academics and many wiccans themselves dispute this categorisation
although recognised as a religion by academics some evangelical christians have attempted to deny it legal recognition as such while some wiccan practitioners themselves eschew the term religion associating the latter purely with organised religion instead favouring spirituality or way of life
although wicca as a religion is distinct from other forms of contemporary paganism there has been much cross fertilization between these different pagan faiths accordingly wicca has both influenced and been influenced by other pagan religions thus making clear cut distinctions between them more difficult for religious studies scholars to make
the terms wizard and warlock are generally discouraged in the community
in wicca denominations are referred to as traditions while non wiccans are often termed cowans
when the religion first came to public attention it was commonly called witchcraft
for instance gerald gardner the man regarded as the father of wicca referred to it as the craft of the wise witchcraft and the witch cult during the s
there is no evidence that he ever called it wicca although he did refer to the collective community of pagan witches as the wica with one c
as a name for the religion wicca developed in britain during the s
it is not known who precisely invented the term wicca in reference to the religion although one possibility is that it might have been gardner s rival charles cardell who was referring to it as the craft of the wiccens by
the first recorded use of the word wicca appears in and it had been popularised to the extent that several british practitioners founded a newsletter called the wiccan in
although pronounced differently the modern english term wicca is derived from the old english wicca witt and wicce witt e the masculine and feminine term for witch respectively that was used in anglo saxon england
by adopting it for modern usage wiccans were both symbolically cementing their presumed connection to the ancient pre christian past and adopting a self designation that would be less controversial than witchcraft
the scholar of religion and wiccan priestess joanne pearson noted that while the words witch and wicca are therefore linked etymologically they are used to emphasize different things today
in early sources wicca referred to the entirety of the religion rather than specific traditions
in ensuing decades members of certain traditions those known as british traditional wicca began claiming that only they should be termed wiccan and that other forms of the religion must not use it
from the late s onwards various books propagating wicca were published that again used the former broader definition of the word
thus by the s there were two competing definitions of the word wicca in use among the pagan and esoteric communities one broad and inclusive the other smaller and exclusionary
although there are exceptions among scholars of pagan studies it is the older inclusive use of the term which has gained wider usage
conversely in various forms of popular culture such as television programs buffy the vampire slayer and charmed the word wicca has been used as a synonym for witchcraft more generally including in non religious and non pagan forms
alongside wicca two other names often used for the religion by its practitioners are witchcraft and the craft
using the word witchcraft in this context can result in confusion both with other non religious forms of witchcraft as well as other religions such as satanism and luciferianism whose practitioners also sometimes describe themselves as witches
another term sometimes used as a synonym for wicca is pagan witchcraft although there are also other forms of modern paganism such as types of heathenry which also practice magic and thus could be described as pagan witchcraft
from the s onward various wiccans began describing themselves as traditional witches although this term was also employed by practitioners of other magico religious traditions like luciferianism
theological views within wicca are diverse
the religion encompasses theists atheists and agnostics with some viewing the religion s deities as entities with a literal existence and others viewing them as jungian archetypes or symbols
even among theistic wiccans there are divergent beliefs and wicca includes pantheists monotheists duotheists and polytheists
common to these divergent perspectives however is that wicca s deities are viewed as forms of ancient pre christian divinities by its practitioners
most early wiccan groups adhered to the duotheistic worship of a horned god and a mother goddess with practitioners typically believing that these had been the ancient deities worshipped by the hunter gatherers of the old stone age whose veneration had been passed down in secret right to the present
this theology derived from egyptologist margaret murray s claims about the witch cult in her book the witch cult in western europe published by oxford university press in she claimed that this cult had venerated a horned god at the time of the early modern witch trials but centuries before it had also worshipped a mother goddess
this duotheistic horned god mother goddess structure was embraced by gardner who claimed that it had stone age roots and remains the underlying theological basis to his gardnerian tradition
gardner claimed that the names of these deities were to be kept secret within the tradition although in they were publicly revealed to be cernunnos and aradia the secret gardnerian deity names were subsequently changed
although different wiccans attribute different traits to the horned god he is most often associated with animals and the natural world but also with the afterlife and he is furthermore often viewed as an ideal role model for men
the mother goddess has been associated with life fertility and the springtime and has been described as an ideal role model for women
wicca s duotheism has been compared to the taoist system of yin and yang
other wiccans have adopted the original gardnerian god goddess duotheistic structure but have adopted deity forms other than that of the horned god and mother goddess
for instance the god has been interpreted as the oak king and the holly king as well as the sun god son lover god and vegetation god
he has also been seen in the roles of the leader of the wild hunt and the lord of death
the goddess is often portrayed as a triple goddess thereby being a triadic deity comprising a maiden goddess a mother goddess and a crone goddess each of whom has different associations namely virginity fertility and wisdom
other wiccan conceptualisations have portrayed her as a moon goddess and as a menstruating goddess
according to the anthropologist susan greenwood in wicca the goddess is a symbol of self transformation she is seen to be constantly changing and a force for change for those who open themselves up to her
gardner stated that beyond wicca s two deities was the supreme deity or prime mover an entity that was too complex for humans to understand
this belief has been endorsed by other prominent practitioners who have referred to it as the cosmic logos supreme cosmic power or godhead
gardner envisioned this supreme deity as a deist entity who had created the under gods among them the god and goddess but who was not otherwise involved in the world alternately other wiccans have interpreted such an entity as a pantheistic being of whom the god and goddess are facets
although gardner criticised monotheism citing the problem of evil explicitly monotheistic forms of wicca developed in the s when the u s based church of wicca developed a theology rooted in the worship of what they described as one deity without gender
in the s dianic wiccan groups developed which were devoted to a singular monotheistic goddess this approach was often criticised by members of british traditional wiccan groups who lambasted such goddess monotheism as an inverted imitation of christian theology
as in other forms of wicca some goddess monotheists have expressed the view that the goddess is not an entity with a literal existence but rather a jungian archetype
as well as pantheism and duotheism many wiccans accept the concept of polytheism thereby believing that there are many different deities
some accept the view espoused by the occultist dion fortune that all gods are one god and all goddesses are one goddess that is that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are respectively aspects of one supernal god and goddess
with this mindset a wiccan may regard the germanic ostre hindu kali and catholic virgin mary each as manifestations of one supreme goddess and likewise the celtic cernunnos the ancient greek dionysus and the judeo christian yahweh as aspects of a single archetypal god
a more strictly polytheistic approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right
the wiccan writers janet farrar and gavin bone have postulated that wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures tending to embrace a more traditionally pagan worldview
some wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical archetypes or thoughtforms thereby technically allowing them to be atheists
such a view was purported by the high priestess vivianne crowley herself a psychologist who considered the wiccan deities to be jungian archetypes that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual
it was for this reason she said the goddess and god manifest to us in dream and vision
wiccans often believe that the gods are not perfect and can be argued with
many wiccans also adopt a more explicitly polytheistic or animistic world view of the universe as being replete with spirit beings
in many cases these spirits are associated with the natural world for instance as genius loci fairies and elementals
in other cases such beliefs are more idiosyncratic and atypical the prominent wiccan sybil leek for instance endorsed a belief in angels
belief in the afterlife varies among wiccans and does not occupy a central place within the religion
as the historian ronald hutton remarked the instinctual position of most wiccans
seems to be that if one makes the most of the present life in all respects then the next life is more or less certainly going to benefit from the process and so one may as well concentrate on the present
it is nevertheless a common belief among wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death
understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions with feri wicca for instance having adopted a belief from hawaiian religion that the human being has three souls
although not accepted by all wiccans a belief in reincarnation is the dominant afterlife belief within wicca having been originally espoused by gardner
understandings of how the cycle of reincarnation operates differ among practitioners the prominent wiccan raymond buckland for instance insisted that human souls would only incarnate into human bodies whereas other wiccans believe that a human soul can incarnate into any life form
there is also a common wiccan belief that any witches will come to be reincarnated as future witches an idea originally expressed by gardner
gardner also articulated the view that the human soul rested for a period between bodily death and its incarnation with this resting place commonly being referred to as the summerland among the wiccan community
this allows many wiccans to believe that mediums can contact the spirits of the deceased a belief adopted from spiritualism
many wiccans believe in magic a manipulative force exercised through the practice of witchcraft or sorcery
many wiccans agree with the definition of magic offered by ceremonial magicians such as aleister crowley who declared that magic was the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will while another prominent ceremonial magician macgregor mathers stated that it was the science of the control of the secret forces of nature
many wiccans believe magic to be a law of nature as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science and as such they do not view it as being supernatural but a part of what leo martello calls the super powers that reside in the natural
some wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses to achieve surprising results whilst other wiccans do not claim to know how magic works merely believing that it does because they have observed it to be so
during ritual practices which are often staged in a sacred circle wiccans cast spells or workings intended to bring about real changes in the physical world
common wiccan spells include those used for healing for protection fertility or to banish negative influences
many early wiccans such as alex sanders sybil leek and alex winfield referred to their own magic as white magic which contrasted with black magic which they associated with evil and satanism
sanders also used the similar terminology of left hand path to describe malevolent magic and right hand path to describe magic performed with good intentions terminology that had originated with the occultist helena blavatsky in the th century
some modern wiccans however have stopped using the white black magic and left right hand path dichotomies arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil
scholars of religion rodney stark and william bainbridge claimed in that wicca had reacted to secularisation by a headlong plunge back into magic and that it was a reactionary religion which would soon die out
this view was heavily criticised in by the historian ronald hutton who claimed that the evidence displayed the very opposite that a large number of wiccans were in jobs at the cutting edge of scientific culture such as computer technology
traditionally the term witchcraft has meant the use of magic to cause harm and misfortune to others as opposed to helpful white magic
the historian wouter hanegraaff noted that the wiccan view of witchcraft was an outgrowth of romantic semi scholarship
he noted that gardner like some previous writers viewed the witch as a positive antitype which derives much of its symbolic force from its implicit criticism of dominant judaeo christian and enlightenment values
hanegraaff noted that wiccans dismissed various elements traditionally associated with witchcraft namely infanticide cannibalism satanism and sexual orgies by claiming that these were either misunderstandings or fictions invented by the early modern witch hunters
pearson noted that wicca provides a framework in which the image of oneself as a witch can be explored and brought into a modern context
pearson suggested that wiccans identify with the witch because she is imagined as powerful she can make people sleep for one hundred years she can see the future she can curse and kill as well as heal and of course she can turn people into frogs
identifying as a witch also enables wiccans to link themselves with those persecuted in the witch trials of the early modern period often referred to by wiccans as the burning times
various practitioners have made the historically inaccurate claim that nine million people were executed as witches in the early modern period thus drawing comparisons with the killing of six million jews in the holocaust and presenting themselves as modern witches as persecuted minorities
wicca has been characterised as a life affirming religion
practitioners typically present themselves as a positive force against the powers of destruction which threaten the world
there exists no dogmatic moral or ethical code followed universally by wiccans of all traditions however a majority follow a code known as the wiccan rede which states an it harm none do what ye will
this is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act along with the necessity of taking responsibility for what follows from one s actions and minimising harm to oneself and others
another common element of wiccan morality is the law of threefold return which holds that whatever benevolent or malevolent actions a person performs will return to that person with triple force or with equal force on each of the three levels of body mind and spirit similar to the eastern idea of karma
the wiccan rede was most likely introduced into wicca by gerald gardner and formalised publicly by doreen valiente one of his high priestesses
the threefold law was an interpretation of wiccan ideas and ritual made by monique wilson and further popularised by raymond buckland in his books on wicca
many wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in doreen valiente s charge of the goddess these being mirth reverence honour humility strength beauty power and compassion
in valiente s poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites reflecting a dualism that is common throughout wiccan philosophy
some lineaged wiccans also observe a set of wiccan laws commonly called the craft laws or ardanes of which exist in the gardnerian tradition and of which are in the alexandrian tradition
valiente one of gardner s original high priestesses argued that the first thirty of these rules were most likely invented by gerald gardner himself in mock archaic language as the by product of inner conflict within his bricket wood coven the others were later additions made by alex sanders during the s
in british traditional wicca sex complementarity is a basic and fundamental working principle with men and women being seen as a necessary presence to balance each other out
this may have derived from gardner s interpretation of murray s claim that the ancient witch cult was a fertility religion
thus many practitioners of british traditional wicca have argued that gay men and women are not capable of correctly working magic without mixed sex pairings
although gerald gardner initially demonstrated an aversion to homosexuality claiming that it brought down the curse of the goddess it is now generally accepted in all traditions of wicca with groups such as the minoan brotherhood openly basing their philosophy upon it
the scholar of religion joanne pearson noted that in her experience most wiccans take a realistic view of living in the real world replete with its many problems and do not claim that the gods have all the answers to these
she suggested that wiccans do not claim to seek perfection but instead wholeness or completeness which includes an acceptance of traits like anger weakness and pain
she contrasted the wiccan acceptance of an interplay between light and dark against the new age focus on white light
similarly the scholar of religion geoffrey samuel noted that wiccans devote a perhaps surprising amount of attention to darkness and death
many wiccans are involved in environmentalist campaigns
many traditions hold a belief in the five classical elements although they are seen as symbolic representations of the phases of matter
these five elements are invoked during many magical rituals notably when consecrating a magic circle
the five elements are air fire water earth and aether or spirit where aether unites the other four elements
various analogies have been devised to explain the concept of the five elements for instance the wiccan ann marie gallagher used that of a tree which is composed of earth with the soil and plant matter water sap and moisture fire through photosynthesis and air the formation of oxygen from carbon dioxide all of which are believed to be united through spirit
traditionally in the gardnerian craft each element has been associated with a cardinal point of the compass air with east fire with south water with west earth with north and the spirit with centre
however some wiccans such as frederic lamond have claimed that the set cardinal points are only those applicable to the geography of southern england where wicca evolved and that wiccans should determine which directions best suit each element in their region
for instance those living on the east coast of north america should invoke water in the east and not the west because the colossal body of water the atlantic ocean is to their east
other craft groups have associated the elements with different cardinal points for instance robert cochrane s clan of tubal cain associated earth with south fire with east water with west and air with north and each of which were controlled over by a different deity who were seen as children of the primary horned god and goddess
the five elements are symbolised by the five points of the pentagram the most prominently used symbol of wicca
the wiccan high priestess and journalist margot adler stated that wiccan rituals were not dry formalised repetitive experiences but performed with the intent of inducing a religious experience in the participants thereby altering their consciousness
she noted that many wiccans remain skeptical about the existence of the supernatural but remain involved in wicca because of its ritual experiences she quoted one as saying that i love myth dream visionary art
the craft is a place where all of these things fit together beauty pageantry music dance song dream the wiccan practitioner and historian aidan kelly claimed that the practices and experiences within wicca were more important than the beliefs stating it s a religion of ritual rather than theology
the ritual is first the myth is second similarly adler stated that wicca permits total skepticism about even its own methods myths and rituals
the anthropologist susan greenwood characterised wiccan rituals as a form of resistance to mainstream culture
she saw these rituals as a healing space away from the ills of the wider culture one in which female practitioners can redefine and empower themselves
wiccan rituals usually take place in private
the reclaiming tradition has utilised its rituals for political purposes
many rituals within wicca are used when celebrating the sabbats worshipping the deities and working magic
often these take place on a full moon or in some cases a new moon which is known as an esbat
in typical rites the coven or solitary assembles inside a ritually cast and purified magic circle
casting the circle may involve the invocation of the guardians of the cardinal points alongside their respective classical elements air fire water and earth
once the circle is cast a seasonal ritual may be performed prayers to the god and goddess are said and spells are sometimes worked these may include various forms of raising energy including raising a cone of power to send healing or other magic to persons outside of the sacred space
in constructing his ritual system gardner drew upon older forms of ceremonial magic in particular those found in the writings of aleister crowley
the classical ritual scheme in british traditional wicca traditions is
purification of the sacred space and the participants
casting the circle
calling of the elemental quarters
cone of power
drawing down the gods
spellcasting
great rite
wine cakes chanting dancing games
farewell to the quarters and participantsthese rites often include a special set of magical tools
these usually include a knife called an athame a wand a pentacle and a chalice but other tools include a broomstick known as a besom a cauldron candles incense and a curved blade known as a boline
an altar is usually present in the circle on which ritual tools are placed and representations of the god and the goddess may be displayed
before entering the circle some traditions fast for the day and or ritually bathe
after a ritual has finished the god goddess and guardians are thanked the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed
a central aspect of wicca particularly in gardnerian and alexandrian wicca often sensationalised by the media is the traditional practice of working in the nude also known as skyclad
this practice seemingly derives from a line in aradia charles leland s supposed record of italian witchcraft
many wiccans believe that performing rituals skyclad allows power to flow from the body in a manner unimpeded by clothes
some also note that it removes signs of social rank and differentiation and thus encourages unity among the practitioners
some wiccans seek legitimacy for the practice by stating that various ancient societies performed their rituals while nude
one of wicca s best known liturgical texts is the charge of the goddess
the most commonly used version used by wiccans today is the rescension of doreen valiente who developed it from gardner s version
gardner s wording of the original charge added extracts from aleister crowley s work including the book of the law especially from ch spoken by nuit the star goddess thus linking modern wicca irrevocably to the principles of thelema
valiente rewrote gardner s version in verse keeping the material derived from aradia but removing the material from crowley
other traditions wear robes with cords tied around the waist or even normal street clothes
in certain traditions ritualised sex magic is performed in the form of the great rite whereby a high priest and high priestess invoke the god and goddess to possess them before performing sexual intercourse to raise magical energy for use in spellwork
in nearly all cases it is instead performed in token thereby merely symbolically using the athame to symbolise the penis and the chalice to symbolise the womb
for some wiccans the ritual space is a space of resistance in which the sexual morals of christianity and patriarchy can be subverted and for this reason they have adopted techniques from the bdsm subculture into their rituals
publicly many wiccan groups have tended to excise the role of sex magic from their image
this has served both to escape the tabloid sensationalism that has targeted the religion since the s and the concerns surrounding the satanic ritual abuse hysteria in the s and s
wiccans celebrate several seasonal festivals of the year commonly known as sabbats
collectively these occasions are termed the wheel of the year
most wiccans celebrate a set of eight of these sabbats however other groups such as those associated with the clan of tubal cain only follow four
in the rare case of the ros an bucca group from cornwall only six are adhered to
the four sabbats that are common to all british derived groups are the cross quarter days sometimes referred to as greater sabbats
the names of these festivals are in some cases taken from the old irish fire festivals and the welsh god mabon though in most traditional wiccan covens the only commonality with the celtic festival is the name
gardner himself made use of the english names of these holidays stating that the four great sabbats are candlemass sic may eve lammas and halloween the equinoxes and solstices are celebrated also in the egyptologist margaret murray s the witch cult in western europe and the god of the witches in which she dealt with what she believed had been a historical witch cult she stated that the four main festivals had survived christianisation and had been celebrated in the pagan witchcraft religion
subsequently when wicca was first developing in the s through to the s many of the early groups such as robert cochrane s clan of tubal cain and gerald gardner s bricket wood coven adopted the commemoration of these four sabbats as described by murray
the other four festivals commemorated by many wiccans are known as lesser sabbats
they are the solstices and the equinoxes and they were only adopted in by members of the bricket wood coven before they were subsequently adopted by other followers of the gardnerian tradition
they were eventually adopted by followers of other traditions like alexandrian wicca and the dianic tradition
the names of these holidays that are commonly used today are often taken from germanic pagan holidays
however the festivals are not reconstructive in nature nor do they often resemble their historical counterparts instead they exhibit a form of universalism
the rituals that are observed may display cultural influences from the holidays from which they take their names as well as influences from other unrelated cultures
various rites of passage can be found within wicca
perhaps the most significant of these is an initiation ritual through which somebody joins the craft and becomes a wiccan
in british traditional wiccan traditions there is a line of initiatory descent that goes back to gerald gardner and from him is said to go back to the new forest coven however the existence of this coven remains unproven
gardner himself claimed that there was a traditional length of a year and a day between when a person began studying the craft and when they were initiated although he frequently broke this rule with initiates
in btw initiation only accepts someone into the first degree
to proceed to the second degree an initiate has to go through another ceremony in which they name and describe the uses of the ritual tools and implements
it is also at this ceremony that they are given their craft name
by holding the rank of second degree a btw is considered capable of initiating others into the craft or founding their own semi autonomous covens
the third degree is the highest in btw and it involves the participation of the great rite either actual or symbolically and in some cases ritual flagellation which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado masochistic overtones
by holding this rank an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven
according to new age religious scholar james r
lewis in his book witchcraft today an encyclopaedia of wiccan and neopagan traditions a high priestess becomes a queen when she has successfully hived off her first new coven under a new third degree high priestess in the orthodox gardnerian system
she then becomes eligible to wear the moon crown
the sequence of high priestess and queens traced back to gerald gardner is known as a lineage and every orthodox gardnerian high priestess has a set of lineage papers proving the authenticity of her status
this three tier degree system following initiation is largely unique to btw and traditions heavily based upon it
the cochranian tradition which is not btw but based upon the teachings of robert cochrane does not have the three degrees of initiation merely having the stages of novice and initiate
some solitary wiccans also perform self initiation rituals to dedicate themselves to becoming a wiccan
the first of these to be published was in paul huson s mastering witchcraft and unusually involved recitation of the lord s prayer backwards as a symbol of defiance against the historical witch hunt
subsequent more overtly pagan self initiation rituals have since been published in books designed for solitary wiccans by authors like doreen valiente scott cunningham and silver ravenwolf
handfasting is another celebration held by wiccans and is the commonly used term for their weddings
some wiccans observe the practice of a trial marriage for a year and a day which some traditions hold should be contracted on the sabbat of lughnasadh as this was the traditional time for trial telltown marriages among the irish
a common marriage vow in wicca is for as long as love lasts instead of the traditional christian till death do us part
the first known wiccan wedding ceremony took part in amongst the bricket wood coven between frederic lamond and his first wife gillian
infants in wiccan families may be involved in a ritual called a wiccaning which is analogous to a christening
the purpose of this is to present the infant to the god and goddess for protection
parents are advised to give their children the gift of wicca in a manner suitable to their age
in accordance with the importance put on free will in wicca the child is not expected or required to adhere to wicca or other forms of paganism should they not wish to do so when they reach adulthood
in wicca there is no set sacred text such as the christian bible jewish tanakh hindu gita or islamic quran although there are certain scriptures and texts that various traditions hold to be important and influence their beliefs and practices
gerald gardner used a book containing many different texts in his covens known as the book of shadows among other names which he would frequently add to and adapt
in his book of shadows there are texts taken from various sources including charles godfrey leland s aradia or the gospel of the witches and the works of th th century occultist aleister crowley whom gardner knew personally
also in the book are examples of poetry largely composed by gardner and his high priestess doreen valiente the most notable of which is the charge of the goddess
similar in use to the grimoires of ceremonial magicians the book contained instructions for how to perform rituals and spells as well as religious poetry and chants like eko eko azarak to use in those rituals
gardner s original intention was that every copy of the book would be different because a student would copy from their initiators but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective however amongst many gardnerian witches today particularly in the united states all copies of the book are kept identical to the version that the high priestess monique wilson copied from gardner with nothing being altered
the book of shadows was originally meant to be kept a secret from non initiates into btw but parts of the book have been published by authors including charles cardell lady sheba janet farrar and stewart farrar
the pentacle is a symbol commonly used by wiccans
wiccans often understand the pentacle s five points as representing each of the five elements earth air fire water and aether spirit
it is also regarded as a symbol of the human with the five points representing the head arms and legs
there is no overarching organisational structure to wicca
in wicca all practitioners are considered to be priests and priestesses
wicca generally requires a ritual of initiation
in the s through to the s when the wiccan movement was largely confined to lineaged groups such as gardnerian wicca and alexandrian wicca a tradition usually implied the transfer of a lineage by initiation
however with the rise of more and more such groups often being founded by those with no previous initiatory lineage the term came to be a synonym for a religious denomination within wicca
there are many such traditions and there are also many solitary practitioners who do not align themselves with any particular lineage working alone
some covens have formed but who do not follow any particular tradition instead choosing their influences and practices eclectically
those traditions which trace a line of initiatory descent back to gerald gardner include gardnerian wicca alexandrian wicca and the algard tradition because of their joint history they are often referred to as british traditional wicca particularly in north america
other traditions trace their origins to different figures even if their beliefs and practices have been influenced to a greater or lesser extent by gardner
these include cochrane s craft and the tradition both of which trace their origins to robert cochrane feri which traces itself back to victor anderson and gwydion pendderwen and dianic wicca whose followers often trace their influences back to zsuzsanna budapest
some of these groups prefer to refer to themselves as witches thereby distinguishing themselves from the btw traditions who more typically use the term wiccan see etymology
during the s viviane crowley an initiate of both the gardnerian and alexandrian traditions merged the two
pearson noted that wicca has evolved and at times mutated quite dramatically into completely different forms
wicca has also been customized to the various national contexts into which it has been introduced for instance in ireland the veneration of ancient irish deities has been incorporated into wicca
lineaged wicca is organised into covens of initiated priests and priestesses
covens are autonomous and are generally headed by a high priest and a high priestess working in partnership being a couple who have each been through their first second and third degrees of initiation
occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second degree initiates in which case they come under the rule of the parent coven
initiation and training of new priesthood is most often performed within a coven environment but this is not a necessity and a few initiated wiccans are unaffiliated with any coven
most covens would not admit members under the age of
they often do not advertise their existence and when they do do so through pagan magazines
some organise courses and workshops through which prospective members can come along and be assessed
a commonly quoted wiccan tradition holds that the ideal number of members for a coven is thirteen though this is not held as a hard and fast rule
indeed many u s
covens are far smaller though the membership may be augmented by unaffiliated wiccans at open rituals
pearson noted that covens typically contained between five and ten initiates
they generally avoid mass recruitment due to the feasibility of finding spaces large enough to bring together greater numbers for rituals and because larger numbers inhibit the sense of intimacy and trust that covens utilise
some covens are short lived but others have survived for many years
covens in the reclaiming tradition are often single sex and non hierarchical in structure
coven members who leave their original group to form another separate coven are described as having hived off in wicca
initiation into a coven is traditionally preceded by an apprenticeship period of a year and a day
a course of study may be set during this period
in some covens a dedication ceremony may be performed during this period some time before the initiation proper allowing the person to attend certain rituals on a probationary basis
some solitary wiccans also choose to study for a year and a day before their self dedication to the religion
various high priestesses and high priests have reported being put on a pedestal by new initiates only to have those students later kick away the pedestal as they develop their own knowledge and experience of wicca
within a coven different members may be respected for having particular knowledge of specific areas such as the qabalah astrology or the tarot
based on her experience among british traditional wiccans in the uk pearson stated that the length of time between becoming a first degree initiate and a second was typically two to five years
some practitioners nevertheless chose to remain as first degree initiates rather than proceed to the higher degrees
a large number of wiccans do not exclusively follow any single tradition or even are initiated
these eclectic wiccans each create their own syncretic spiritual paths by adopting and reinventing the beliefs and rituals of a variety of religious traditions connected to wicca and broader paganism
while the origins of modern wiccan practice lie in covenantal activity of select few initiates in established lineages eclectic wiccans are more often than not solitary practitioners uninitiated in any tradition
a widening public appetite especially in the united states made traditional initiation unable to satisfy demand for involvement in wicca
since the s larger more informal often publicly advertised camps and workshops began to take place
this less formal but more accessible form of wicca proved successful
eclectic wicca is the most popular variety of wicca in america and eclectics now significantly outnumber lineaged wiccans
eclectic wicca is not necessarily the complete abandonment of tradition
eclectic practitioners may follow their own individual ideas and ritual practices while still drawing on one or more religious or philosophical paths
eclectic approaches to wicca often draw on earth religion and ancient egyptian greek saxon anglo saxon celtic asian jewish and polynesian traditions
in contrast to the british traditional wiccans reclaiming wiccans and various eclectic wiccans the sociologist douglas ezzy argued that there existed a popularized witchcraft that was driven primarily by consumerist marketing and is represented by movies television shows commercial magazines and consumer goods
books and magazines in this vein were targeted largely at young girls and included spells for attracting or repelling boyfriends money spells and home protection spells
he termed this new age witchcraft and compared individuals involved in this to the participants in the new age
wicca was founded in england between and representing what the historian ronald hutton called the only full formed religion which england can be said to have given the world
characterised as an invented tradition by scholars wicca was created from the patchwork adoption of various older elements many taken from pre existing religious and esoteric movements
pearson characterised it as having arisen from the cultural impulses of the fin de si cle
wicca took as its basis the witch cult hypothesis
this was the idea that those persecuted as witches during the early modern period in europe were not as the persecutors had claimed followers of satanism nor were they innocent people who confessed to witchcraft under threat of torture as had long been the historical consensus but rather that they were adherents of a surviving pre christian pagan religion
this theory had been first expressed by the german professor karl ernest jarcke in before being endorsed by german franz josef mone and then the french historian jules michelet
in the late th century it was then adopted by two americans matilda joslyn gage and charles leland the latter of whom promoted a variant of it in his book aradia or the gospel of the witches
the theory s most prominent advocate was the english egyptologist margaret murray who promoted it in a series of books most notably s the witch cult in western europe and s the god of the witches
almost all of murray s peers regarded the witch cult theory as incorrect and based on poor scholarship
however murray was invited to write the entry on witchcraft for the edition of the encyclop dia britannica which was reprinted for decades and became so influential that according to folklorist jacqueline simpson murray s ideas became so entrenched in popular culture that they will probably never be uprooted simpson noted that the only contemporary member of the folklore society who took murray s theory seriously was gerald gardner who used it as the basis for wicca
murray s books were the sources of many well known motifs which have often been incorporated into wicca
the idea that covens should have members was developed by murray based on a single witness statement from one of the witch trials as was her assertion that covens met on the cross quarter days four times per year
murray was very interested in ascribing naturalistic or religious ceremonial explanations to some of the more fantastic descriptions found in witch trial testimony
for example many of the confessions included the idea that satan was personally present at coven meetings
murray interpreted this as a witch priest wearing horns and animal skins and a pair of forked boots to represent his authority or rank most mainstream folklorists on the other hand have argued that the entire scenario was always fictitious and does not require a naturalistic explanation but gardner enthusiastically adopted many of murray s explanations into his own tradition
the witch cult theory represented the historical narrative around which wicca built itself with the early wiccans claiming to be the survivors of this ancient pagan religion
other influences upon early wicca included various western esoteric traditions and practices among them ceremonial magic aleister crowley and his religion of thelema freemasonry spiritualism and theosophy
to a lesser extent wicca also drew upon folk magic and the practices of cunning folk
it was further influenced both by scholarly works on folkloristics particularly james frazer s the golden bough as well as romanticist writings like robert graves the white goddess and pre existing modern pagan groups such as the order of woodcraft chivalry and druidism
it was during the s that the first evidence appears for the practice of a pagan witchcraft religion what would be recognisable now as wicca in england
it seems that several groups around the country in such places as norfolk cheshire and the new forest had set themselves up as continuing in the tradition of murray s witch cult albeit with influences coming from disparate sources such as ceremonial magic folk magic freemasonry theosophy romanticism druidry classical mythology and asian religions
according to gerald gardner s account in witchcraft today and the meaning of witchcraft wicca is the survival of a european witch cult that was persecuted during the witch trials
theories of an organised pan european witch cult as well as mass trials thereof have been largely discredited but it is still common for wiccans to claim solidarity with witch trial victims
the notion of the survival of wiccan traditions and rituals from ancient sources is contested by most recent researchers who suggest that wicca is a th century creation which combines elements of freemasonry and th century occultism
historians such as ronald hutton have noted that wicca predates the modern new age movement and also differs markedly in its general philosophy
in his book the triumph of the moon bristol university history professor ronald hutton researched the wiccan claim that ancient pagan customs have survived into modern times after being christianised in medieval times as folk practices
hutton found that most of the folk customs which are claimed to have pagan roots such as the maypole dance actually date from the middle ages
he concluded that the idea that medieval revels were pagan in origin is a legacy of the protestant reformation
the history of wicca starts with gerald gardner the father of wicca in the mid th century
gardner was a retired british civil servant and amateur anthropologist with a broad familiarity in paganism and occultism
he claimed to have been initiated into a witches coven in new forest hampshire in the late s
intent on perpetuating this craft gardner founded the bricket wood coven with his wife donna in the s after buying the naturist fiveacres country club
much of the coven s early membership was drawn from the club s members and its meetings were held within the club grounds
many notable figures of early wicca were direct initiates of this coven including dafo doreen valiente jack bracelin frederic lamond dayonis eleanor bone and lois bourne
the witchcraft religion became more prominent beginning in with the repeal of the witchcraft act of after which gerald gardner and then others such as charles cardell and cecil williamson began publicising their own versions of the craft
gardner and others never used the term wicca as a religious identifier simply referring to the witch cult witchcraft and the old religion
however gardner did refer to witches as the wica
during the s the name of the religion normalised to wicca
gardner s tradition later termed gardnerianism soon became the dominant form in england and spread to other parts of the british isles
following gardner s death in the craft continued to grow unabated despite sensationalism and negative portrayals in british tabloids with new traditions being propagated by figures like robert cochrane sybil leek and most importantly alex sanders whose alexandrian wicca which was predominantly based upon gardnerian wicca albeit with an emphasis placed on ceremonial magic spread quickly and gained much media attention
around this time the term wicca began to be commonly adopted over witchcraft and the faith was exported to countries like australia and the united states
during the s a new generation joined wicca who had been influenced by the counterculture of the s
many brought environmentalist ideas with them into the movement as reflected by the formation of groups like the uk based pagans against nukes
in the u s victor anderson cora anderson and gwydion pendderwen established feri wicca
it was in the united states and in australia that new home grown traditions sometimes based upon earlier regional folk magical traditions and often mixed with the basic structure of gardnerian wicca began to develop including victor anderson s feri tradition joseph wilson s tradition aidan kelly s new reformed orthodox order of the golden dawn and eventually zsuzsanna budapest s dianic wicca each of which emphasised different aspects of the faith
it was also around this time that books teaching people how to become witches themselves without formal initiation or training began to emerge among them paul huson s mastering witchcraft and lady sheba s book of shadows
similar books continued to be published throughout the s and s fuelled by the writings of such authors as doreen valiente janet farrar stewart farrar and scott cunningham who popularised the idea of self initiation into the craft
among witches in canada anthropologist dr
heather botting n e harden of the university of victoria has been one of the most prominent having been the first recognized wiccan chaplain of a public university
she is the original high priestess of coven celeste
in the s amid ever rising numbers of self initiates the popular media began to explore witchcraft in fictional films like the craft and television series like charmed introducing numbers of young people to the idea of religious witchcraft
this growing demographic was soon catered to through the internet and by authors like silver ravenwolf much to the criticism of traditional wiccan groups and individuals
in response to the way that wicca was increasingly portrayed as trendy eclectic and influenced by the new age movement many witches turned to the pre gardnerian origins of the craft and to the traditions of his rivals like cardell and cochrane describing themselves as following traditional witchcraft
prominent groups within this traditional witchcraft revival included andrew chumbley s cultus sabbati and the cornish ros an bucca coven
originating in britain wicca then spread to north america australasia continental europe and south africa
the actual number of wiccans worldwide is unknown and it has been noted that it is more difficult to establish the numbers of members of neopagan faiths than many other religions due to their disorganised structure
however adherents com an independent website which specialises in collecting estimates of world religions cites over thirty sources with estimates of numbers of wiccans principally from the usa and the uk
from this they developed a median estimate of members
as of doyle white suggested that there were hundreds of thousands of practising wiccans around the globe
in the wiccan high priestess and academic psychologist vivianne crowley suggested that wicca had been less successful in propagating in countries whose populations were primarily roman catholic
she suggested that this might be because wicca s emphasis on a female divinity was more novel to people raised in protestant dominant backgrounds
on the basis of her experience pearson concurred that this was broadly true
wicca has been described as a non proselytizing religion
in pearson noted that there were very few individuals who had grown up as wiccans although increasing numbers of wiccan adults were themselves parents
many wiccan parents did not refer to their children as also being wiccan believing it important that the latter are allowed to make their own choices about their religious identity when they are old enough
from her fieldwork among members of the reclaiming tradition in california during the anthropologist jone salomonsen found that many described joining the movement following an extraordinary experience of revelation
based on their analysis of internet trends the sociologists of religion douglas ezzy and helen berger argued that by the phenomenal growth that wicca has experienced in preceding years had slowed
from her survey of british wiccans pearson found that most wiccans were aged between and with the average age being around
she noted that as the wiccan community aged so the proportion of older practitioners would increase
she found roughly equal proportions of men and women and found that were from protestant backgrounds which was consistent with the dominance of protestantism in britain at large
pearson s survey also found that half of british wiccans featured had a university education and that they tended to work in healing professions like medicine or counselling education computing and administration
she noted that there thus was a certain homogeneity about the background of british wiccans
in the united kingdom census figures on religion were first collected in no detailed statistics were reported outside of the six main religions
for the census a more detailed breakdown of responses was reported with people identifying themselves as pagans as wiccans and a further describing their religion as witchcraft
in the united states the american religious identification survey has shown significant increases in the number of self identified wiccans from in to in and in
wiccans have also made up significant proportions of various groups within that country for instance wicca is the largest non christian faith practised in the united states air force with airmen identifying themselves as such
in the pew research center estimated of the us population people identified as wiccan or pagan based on a sample size of
in a pew research center study estimated the number of wiccans in the united states to be at least million
wicca emerged in predominantly christian england and from its inception the religion encountered opposition from certain christian groups as well as from the popular tabloids like the news of the world
some christians still believe that wicca is a form of satanism despite important differences between these two religions
detractors typically depict wicca as a form of malevolent satanism a characterisation that wiccans reject
due to negative connotations associated with witchcraft many wiccans continue the traditional practice of secrecy concealing their faith for fear of persecution
revealing oneself as a wiccan to family friends or colleagues is often termed coming out of the broom closet
attitudes to christianity vary within the wiccan movement stretching from outright rejection to a willingness to work alongside christians in interfaith endeavours
the religious studies scholar graham harvey wrote that the popular and prevalent media image of wicca is mostly inaccurate
pearson similarly noted that popular and media perceptions of wicca have often been misleading
in the united states a number of legal decisions have improved and validated the status of wiccans especially dettmer v
landon in
however wiccans have encountered opposition from some politicians and christian organisations including former president of the united states george w
bush who stated that he did not believe wicca to be a religion
in the united states department of veterans affairs after years of dispute added the pentacle to the list of emblems of belief that can be included on government issued markers headstones and plaques honoring deceased veterans

gary botting pan the original high priestess and high priest of coven celeste and founding elders of the aquarian tabernacle church successfully campaigned the british columbian government and the federal government in to allow them to perform recognised wiccan weddings to become prison and hospital chaplains and in the case of heather botting to become the first officially recognized wiccan chaplain in a public university
the oath based system of many wiccan traditions makes it difficult for outsider scholars to study them
for instance after the anthropologist tanya luhrmann revealed information about what she learned as an initiate of a wiccan coven in her academic study various wiccans were upset believing that she had broken the oaths of secrecy taken at initiation
