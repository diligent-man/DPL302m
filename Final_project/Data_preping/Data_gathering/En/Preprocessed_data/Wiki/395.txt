main step process production chlorobenzene benzene hydrochloric acid oxygen subsequent hydrolysis chlorobenzene phenol
first step us either copper iron chloride catalyst expose material air at
second step resulting chlorobenzene introduced steam silicon catalyst hydrolyses chlorobenzene giving phenol hydrogen chloride recycled back first step
due two step nature raschig-hooker process used produce either chlorobenzene phenol
ability recycle hydrogen chloride made raschig-hooker process preferable dow bayer process
reaction however take place high temperature acidic environment hydrogen chloride vapor therefore industrial setting must use highly corrosion resistant equipment reaction
raschig-hooker process doe recycle hydrogen chloride produce use catalyst need replaced
harsh chemical environment use catalyst large energy consumption ha made target green chemistry alternatives
first step reaction run conversion prevent second addition chlorine atom desired chlorobenzene
second step share low conversion rate high selectivity first step
small amount conversion per reaction offset monetary benefit recycling hydrogen chloride due large initial cost reaction
therefore raschig-hooker process needed run high concentration large reactor industrially economica
