the united states congress is the legislature of the federal government of the united states
it is bicameral being composed of a lower body the house of representatives and an upper body the senate
the congress meets in the united states capitol in washington d c
both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election though vacancies in the senate may be filled by a governor s appointment
congress has voting members senators and representatives
the vice president of the united states has a vote in the senate only when senators are evenly divided
the house of representatives has six non voting members
the sitting of a congress is for a two year term at present beginning every other january
elections are held every even numbered year on election day
the members of the house of representatives are elected for the two year term of a congress
the reapportionment act of establishes that there be representatives and the uniform congressional redisistricting act requires that they be elected from single member constituencies or districts
it is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the united states census results provided that each state has at least one congressional representative
each senator is elected at large in their state for a six year term with terms staggered so every two years approximately one third of the senate is up for election
each state regardless of population or size has two senators so currently there are senators for the states
article one of the united states constitution requires that members of congress must be at least years old house or at least years old senate have been a citizen of the united states for seven house or nine senate years and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent
members in both chambers may stand for re election an unlimited number of times
the congress was created by the constitution of the united states and first met in replacing in its legislative function the congress of the confederation
although not legally mandated in practice since the th century congress members are typically affiliated with one of the two major parties the democratic party or the republican party and only rarely with a third party or independents affiliated with no party
in the case of the latter the lack of affiliation with a political party does not mean that such members are unable to caucus with members of the political parties
members can also switch parties at any time although this is quite uncommon
article one of the united states constitution states all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives the house and senate are equal partners in the legislative process legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers
however the constitution grants each chamber some unique powers
the senate ratifies treaties and approves presidential appointments while the house initiates revenue raising bills
the house initiates impeachment cases while the senate decides impeachment cases
a two thirds vote of the senate is required before an impeached person can be removed from office
the term congress can also refer to a particular meeting of the legislature
a congress covers two years the current one the th congress began on january and will end on january
since the adoption of the twentieth amendment to the united states constitution the congress has started and ended at noon on the third day of january of every odd numbered year
members of the senate are referred to as senators members of the house of representatives are referred to as representatives congressmen or congresswomen
scholar and representative lee h
hamilton asserted that the historic mission of congress has been to maintain freedom and insisted it was a driving force in american government and a remarkably resilient institution
congress is the heart and soul of our democracy according to this view even though legislators rarely achieve the prestige or name recognition of presidents or supreme court justices one wrote that legislators remain ghosts in america s historical imagination one analyst argues that it is not a solely reactive institution but has played an active role in shaping government policy and is extraordinarily sensitive to public pressure
several academics described congress
congress is constantly changing and is constantly in flux
in recent times the american south and west have gained house seats according to demographic changes recorded by the census and includes more women and minorities
while power balances among the different parts of government continue to change the internal structure of congress is important to understand along with its interactions with so called intermediary institutions such as political parties civic associations interest groups and the mass media
the congress of the united states serves two distinct purposes that overlap local representation to the federal government of a congressional district by representatives and a state s at large representation to the federal government by senators
most incumbents seek re election and their historical likelihood of winning subsequent elections exceeds percent
the historical records of the house of representatives and the senate are maintained by the center for legislative archives which is a part of the national archives and records administration
congress is directly responsible for the governing of the district of columbia the current seat of the federal government
the first continental congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the thirteen colonies of north america
on july the second continental congress adopted the declaration of independence referring to the new nation as the united states of america
the articles of confederation in created the congress of the confederation a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions
congress had executive but not legislative authority and the federal judiciary was confined to admiralty and lacked authority to collect taxes regulate commerce or enforce laws
government powerlessness led to the convention of which proposed a revised constitution with a two chamber or bicameral congress
smaller states argued for equal representation for each state
the two chamber structure had functioned well in state governments
a compromise plan the connecticut compromise was adopted with representatives chosen by population benefiting larger states and exactly two senators chosen by state governments benefiting smaller states
the ratified constitution created a federal structure with two overlapping power centers so that each citizen as an individual was subjected to both the power of state government and the national government
to protect against abuse of power each branch of government executive legislative and judicial had a separate sphere of authority and could check other branches according to the principle of the separation of powers
furthermore there were checks and balances within the legislature since there were two separate chambers
the new government became active in
political scientist julian e
zelizer suggested there were four main congressional eras with considerable overlap and included the formative era s s the partisan era s s the committee era s s and the contemporary era present
federalists and anti federalists jostled for power in the early years as political parties became pronounced
with the passage of the constitution and the bill of rights the anti federalist movement was exhausted
some activists joined the anti administration party that james madison and thomas jefferson were forming about to oppose policies of treasury secretary alexander hamilton it soon became the democratic republican party or the jeffersonian republican party and began the era of the first party system
thomas jefferson s election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties in
john marshall th chief justice of the supreme court empowered the courts by establishing the principle of judicial review in law in the landmark case marbury v
madison in effectively giving the supreme court a power to nullify congressional legislation
these years were marked by growth in the power of political parties
the watershed event was the civil war which resolved the slavery issue and unified the nation under federal authority but weakened the power of states rights
the gilded age was marked by republican dominance of congress
during this time lobbying activity became more intense particularly during the administration of president ulysses s
grant in which influential lobbies advocated for railroad subsidies and tariffs on wool
immigration and high birth rates swelled the ranks of citizens and the nation grew at a rapid pace
the progressive era was characterized by strong party leadership in both houses of congress as well as calls for reform sometimes reformers would attack lobbyists as corrupting politics
the position of speaker of the house became extremely powerful under leaders such as thomas reed in and joseph gurney cannon
the senate was effectively controlled by a half dozen men
a system of seniority in which long time members of congress gained more and more power encouraged politicians of both parties to seek long terms
committee chairmen remained influential in both houses until the reforms of the s
important structural changes included the direct popular election of senators according to the seventeenth amendment ratified on april with positive effects senators more sensitive to public opinion and negative effects undermining the authority of state governments
supreme court decisions based on the constitution s commerce clause expanded congressional power to regulate the economy
one effect of popular election of senators was to reduce the difference between the house and senate in terms of their link to the electorate
lame duck reforms according to the twentieth amendment reduced the power of defeated and retiring members of congress to wield influence despite their lack of accountability
the great depression ushered in president franklin roosevelt and strong control by democrats and historic new deal policies
roosevelt s election in marked a shift in government power towards the executive branch
numerous new deal initiatives came from the white house rather than being initiated by congress
president roosevelt pushed his agenda in congress by detailing executive branch staff to friendly senate committees a practice that ended with the legislative reorganization act of
the democratic party controlled both houses of congress for many years
during this time republicans and conservative southern democrats formed the conservative coalition
democrats maintained control of congress during world war ii
congress struggled with efficiency in the postwar era partly by reducing the number of standing congressional committees
southern democrats became a powerful force in many influential committees although political power alternated between republicans and democrats during these years
more complex issues required greater specialization and expertise such as space flight and atomic energy policy
senator joseph mccarthy exploited the fear of communism during the second red scare and conducted televised hearings
in democratic candidate john f
kennedy narrowly won the presidency and power shifted again to the democrats who dominated both houses of congress until
congress enacted johnson s great society program to fight poverty and hunger
the watergate scandal had a powerful effect of waking up a somewhat dormant congress which investigated presidential wrongdoing and coverups the scandal substantially reshaped relations between the branches of government suggested political scientist bruce j
schulman
partisanship returned particularly after one analyst attributes partisan infighting to slim congressional majorities which discouraged friendly social gatherings in meeting rooms such as the board of education
congress began reasserting its authority
lobbying became a big factor despite the federal election campaign act
political action committees or pacs could make substantive donations to congressional candidates via such means as soft money contributions
while soft money funds were not given to specific campaigns for candidates the money often benefited candidates substantially in an indirect way and helped reelect candidates
reforms such as the bipartisan campaign reform act limited campaign donations but did not limit soft money contributions
one source suggests post watergate laws amended in meant to reduce the influence of wealthy contributors and end payoffs instead legitimized pacs since they enabled individuals to band together in support of candidates
from to pacs grew from to and donations leaped from million to million along with concern over pac influence in congress
in there were business labor and special interest pacs including ones for lawyers electricians and real estate brokers
from to members of congress received half or more of their campaign cash from pacs
from to the house expanded delegates along with their powers and privileges representing u s
citizens in non state areas beginning with representation on committees for puerto rico s resident commissioner in
in a delegate for the district of columbia was authorized and in new delegate positions were established for u s
virgin islands and guam
saw an additional delegate for american samoa and another for the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands began in
these six members of congress enjoy floor privileges to introduce bills and resolutions and in recent congresses they vote in permanent and select committees in party caucuses and in joint conferences with the senate
they have capitol hill offices staff and two annual appointments to each of the four military academies
while their votes are constitutional when congress authorizes their house committee of the whole votes recent congresses have not allowed for that and they cannot vote when the house is meeting as the house of representatives
in the late th century the media became more important in congress s work
analyst michael schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused more roads to open up in congress for individual representatives to influence decisions
norman ornstein suggested that media prominence led to a greater emphasis on the negative and sensational side of congress and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage
others saw pressure to squeeze a political position into a thirty second soundbite
a report characterized congress in as being unproductive gridlocked and setting records for futility
in october with congress unable to compromise the government was shut down for several weeks and risked a serious default on debt payments causing of the public to say they would fire every member of congress including their own representative
one report suggested congress posed the biggest risk to the u s
economy because of its brinksmanship down to the wire budget and debt crises and indiscriminate spending cuts resulting in slowed economic activity and keeping up to two million people unemployed
there has been increasing public dissatisfaction with congress with extremely low approval ratings which dropped to in october
on january the congress gathered to confirm the election of joe biden when supporters of the outgoing president donald trump violently entered the building
the session of congress ended prematurely and congress representatives evacuated
trump supporters occupied congress until d c police evacuated the area
the event was the first time since the burning of washington that the united states congress was forcefully occupied
various social and structural barriers have prevented women from gaining seats in congress
in the early th century women s domestic roles and the inability to vote forestalled opportunities to run for and hold public office
the two party system and the lack of term limits favored incumbent white men making the widow s succession in which a woman temporarily took over a seat vacated by the death of her husband the most common path to congress for white women
women candidates began making substantial inroads in the later th century due in part to new political support mechanisms and public awareness of their underrepresentation in congress
recruitment and financial support for women candidates were rare until the second wave feminism movement when activists moved into electoral politics
beginning in the s donors and political action committees like emily s list began recruiting training and funding women candidates
watershed political moments like the confirmation of clarence thomas and the presidential election created momentum for women candidates resulting in the year of the woman and the election of members of the squad respectively
women of color faced additional challenges that made their ascension to congress even more difficult
jim crow laws voter suppression and other forms of structural racism made it virtually impossible for women of color to reach congress prior to
the passage of the passage of the voting rights act that year and the elimination of race based immigration laws in the s opened the possibility for black asian american latina and other non white women candidates to run for congress
still racially polarized voting racial stereotypes and lack of institutional support prevented and continue to prevent women of color from reaching congress as easily as their white counterparts
senate elections which require victories in statewide electorates have been particularly difficult for women color
carol moseley braun became the first woman of color to reach the senate in
the second woman of color mazie hirono was not seated until
article one of the constitution creates and sets forth the structure and most of the powers of congress
sections one through six describe how congress is elected and gives each house the power to create its own structure
section seven lays out the process for creating laws and section eight enumerates numerous powers
section nine is a list of powers congress does not have and section ten enumerates powers of the state some of which may only be granted by congress
constitutional amendments have granted congress additional powers
congress also has implied powers derived from the constitution s necessary and proper clause
congress has authority over financial and budgetary policy through the enumerated power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states
there is vast authority over budgets although analyst eric patashnik suggested that much of congress s power to manage the budget has been lost when the welfare state expanded since entitlements were institutionally detached from congress s ordinary legislative routine and rhythm another factor leading to less control over the budget was a keynesian belief that balanced budgets were unnecessary
the sixteenth amendment in extended congressional power of taxation to include income taxes without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration
the constitution also grants congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds and this power of the purse is one of congress s primary checks on the executive branch
congress can borrow money on the credit of the united states regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states and coin money
generally both the senate and the house of representatives have equal legislative authority although only the house may originate revenue and appropriation bills
congress has an important role in national defense including the exclusive power to declare war to raise and maintain the armed forces and to make rules for the military
some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped congress s constitutionally defined task of declaring war
while historically presidents initiated the process for going to war they asked for and received formal war declarations from congress for the war of the mexican american war the spanish american war world war i and world war ii although president theodore roosevelt s military move into panama in did not get congressional approval
in the early days after the north korean invasion of president truman described the american response as a police action
according to time magazine in u s
presidents had ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of times in michael kinsley wrote that congress s war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the constitution and that the real erosion of congress s war power began after world war ii disagreement about the extent of congressional versus presidential power regarding war has been present periodically throughout the nation s history
congress can establish post offices and post roads issue patents and copyrights fix standards of weights and measures establish courts inferior to the supreme court and make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof
article four gives congress the power to admit new states into the union
one of congress s foremost non legislative functions is the power to investigate and oversee the executive branch
congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by congress s subpoena power
some critics have charged that congress has in some instances failed to do an adequate job of overseeing the other branches of government
in the plame affair critics including representative henry a
waxman charged that congress was not doing an adequate job of oversight in this case
there have been concerns about congressional oversight of executive actions such as warrantless wiretapping although others respond that congress did investigate the legality of presidential decisions
political scientists ornstein and mann suggested that oversight functions do not help members of congress win reelection
congress also has the exclusive power of removal allowing impeachment and removal of the president federal judges and other federal officers
there have been charges that presidents acting under the doctrine of the unitary executive have assumed important legislative and budgetary powers that should belong to congress
so called signing statements are one way in which a president can tip the balance of power between congress and the white house a little more in favor of the executive branch according to one account
past presidents including ronald reagan george h
bush bill clinton and george w
bush have made public statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it and commentators including the american bar association have described this practice as against the spirit of the constitution
there have been concerns that presidential authority to cope with financial crises is eclipsing the power of congress
in george f
will called the capitol building a tomb for the antiquated idea that the legislative branch matters
the constitution enumerates the powers of congress in detail
in addition other congressional powers have been granted or confirmed by constitutional amendments
the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments gave congress authority to enact legislation to enforce rights of african americans including voting rights due process and equal protection under the law
generally militia forces are controlled by state governments not congress
congress also has implied powers deriving from the constitution s necessary and proper clause which permit congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof
broad interpretations of this clause and of the commerce clause the enumerated power to regulate commerce in rulings such as mcculloch v
maryland have effectively widened the scope of congress s legislative authority far beyond that prescribed in section eight
constitutional responsibility for the oversight of washington d c the federal district and national capital and the u s
territories of guam american samoa puerto rico the u s
virgin islands and the northern mariana islands rests with congress
the republican form of government in territories is devolved by congressional statute to the respective territories including direct election of governors the d c
mayor and locally elective territorial legislatures
each territory and washington d c elects a non voting delegate to the u s
house of representatives as they have throughout congressional history
they possess the same powers as other members of the house except that they may not vote when the house is meeting as the house of representatives
they are assigned offices and allowances for staff participate in debate and appoint constituents to the four military service academies for the army navy air force and coast guard
washington d c citizens alone among u s
territories have the right to directly vote for the president of the united states although the democratic and republican political parties nominate their presidential candidates at national conventions which include delegates from the five major territories
representative lee h
hamilton explained how congress functions within the federal government
to me the key to understanding it is balance
the founders went to great lengths to balance institutions against each other balancing powers among the three branches congress the president and the supreme court between the house of representatives and the senate between the federal government and the states among states of different sizes and regions with different interests between the powers of government and the rights of citizens as spelled out in the bill of rights
no one part of government dominates the other the constitution provides checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government
its authors expected the greater power to lie with congress as described in article one
the influence of congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on factors such as congressional leadership presidential political influence historical circumstances such as war and individual initiative by members of congress
the impeachment of andrew johnson made the presidency less powerful than congress for a considerable period afterwards
the th and st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson franklin d
roosevelt richard nixon ronald reagan and george w
however in recent years congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the congressional budget and impoundment control act of and the war powers resolution
nevertheless the presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the th century
executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret in return knowing they may be in the dark about executive branch activity congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies
many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies and this is a task that congress is ill suited for
congress is slow open divided and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or do a good job of overseeing such activity according to one analysis
the constitution concentrates removal powers in the congress by empowering and obligating the house of representatives to impeach both executive and judicial officials for treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors
impeachment is a formal accusation of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official
the senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments
a simple majority in the house is required to impeach an official however a two thirds majority in the senate is required for conviction
a convicted official is automatically removed from office in addition the senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding office in the future
impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this however a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law
in the history of the united states the house of representatives has impeached sixteen officials of whom seven were convicted
another resigned before the senate could complete the trial
only three presidents have ever been impeached andrew johnson in bill clinton in donald trump in and
the trials of johnson clinton and the trial of trump all ended in acquittal in johnson s case the senate fell one vote short of the two thirds majority required for conviction
in richard nixon resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the house judiciary committee indicated he would eventually be removed from office
the senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming cabinet officials judges and other high officers by and with the advice and consent of the senate
it confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon
furthermore treaties negotiated by the president must be ratified by a two thirds majority vote in the senate to take effect
as a result presidential arm twisting of senators can happen before a key vote for example president obama s secretary of state hillary clinton urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with russia in
the house of representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials other than in filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president in such a case a majority vote in each house is required to confirm a president s nomination of a vice president
in the supreme court established judicial review of federal legislation in marbury v
madison holding however that congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the court itself
the constitution did not explicitly stated that the courts may exercise judicial review however the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers
alexander hamilton for example mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in federalist no
originalists on the supreme court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should might or could have said
judicial review means that the supreme court can nullify a congressional law
it is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially
in for example the supreme court struck down provisions of a congressional act of in its dred scott decision
at the same time the supreme court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations
the congressional inquiry into st
clair s defeat of was the first congressional investigation of the executive branch
investigations are conducted to gather information on the need for future legislation to test the effectiveness of laws already passed and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches
committees may hold hearings and if necessary compel individuals to testify when investigating issues over which it has the power to legislate by issuing subpoenas
witnesses who refuse to testify may be cited for contempt of congress and those who testify falsely may be charged with perjury
most committee hearings are open to the public the house and senate intelligence committees are the exception important hearings are widely reported in the mass media and transcripts published a few months afterwards
congress in the course of studying possible laws and investigating matters generates an incredible amount of information in various forms and can be described as a publisher
indeed it publishes house and senate reports and maintains databases which are updated irregularly with publications in a variety of electronic formats
congress also plays a role in presidential elections
both houses meet in joint session on the sixth day of january following a presidential election to count the electoral votes and there are procedures to follow if no candidate wins a majority
the main result of congressional activity is the creation of laws most of which are contained in the united states code arranged by subject matter alphabetically under fifty title headings to present the laws in a concise and usable form
congress is split into two chambers house and senate and manages the task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas
some members of congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees
further congress has ancillary organizations such as the government accountability office and the library of congress to help provide it with information and members of congress have staff and offices to assist them as well
in addition a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests
the committee structure permits members of congress to study a particular subject intensely
it is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before congress
as time goes by members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects
committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire congress about choices and trade offs
the choice of specialty may be influenced by the member s constituency important regional issues prior background and experience
senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap
some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation for example the house ways and means committee has considerable influence over house affairs
committees write legislation
while procedures such as the house discharge petition process can introduce bills to the house floor and effectively bypass committee input they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action
committees have power and have been called independent fiefdoms
legislative oversight and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and subcommittees which gather information evaluate alternatives and identify problems
they propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber
in addition they perform the function of oversight by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing
at the start of each two year session the house elects a speaker who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party s leader
in the senate the vice president is the ex officio president of the senate
in addition the senate elects an officer called the president pro tempore
pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the senate s majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control
accordingly the senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new congress
in both the house and senate the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber
the library of congress was established by an act of congress in
it is primarily housed in three buildings on capitol hill but also includes several other sites the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped in washington d c the national audio visual conservation center in culpeper virginia a large book storage facility located at fort meade maryland and multiple overseas offices
the library had mostly law books when it was burned by a british raiding party during the war of but the library s collections were restored and expanded when congress authorized the purchase of thomas jefferson s private library
one of the library s missions is to serve congress and its staff as well as the american public
it is the largest library in the world with nearly million items including books films maps photographs music manuscripts graphics and materials in languages
the congressional research service part of the library of congress provides detailed up to date and non partisan research for senators representatives and their staff to help them carry out their official duties
it provides ideas for legislation helps members analyze a bill facilitates public hearings makes reports consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements
it has been called the house s think tank and has a staff of about employees
the congressional budget office or cbo is a federal agency which provides economic data to congress
it was created as an independent non partisan agency by the congressional budget and impoundment control act of
it helps congress estimate revenue inflows from taxes and helps the budgeting process
it makes projections about such matters as the national debt as well as likely costs of legislation
it prepares an annual economic and budget outlook with a mid year update and writes an analysis of the president s budgetary proposals for the senate s appropriations committee
the speaker of the house and the senate s president pro tempore jointly appoint the cbo director for a four year term
lobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence congressional decisions to reflect their clients needs
lobby groups and their members sometimes write legislation and whip bills
in there were approximately federal lobbyists in washington d c
they explain to legislators the goals of their organizations
some lobbyists represent non profit organizations and work pro bono for issues in which they are personally interested
congress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting known as partisanship
the period after the civil war was marked by partisanship as is the case today
it is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible
some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades but that an alternation of control of congress between democrats and republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution
a term of congress is divided into two sessions one for each year congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session
a new session commences on january each year unless congress decides differently
the constitution requires congress to meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the capitol without the consent of the other house
joint sessions of the united states congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both house and senate
these sessions include counting electoral votes after a presidential election and the president s state of the union address
the constitutionally mandated report normally given as an annual speech is modeled on britain s speech from the throne was written by most presidents after jefferson but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with wilson in
joint sessions and joint meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the house except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president acting as the president of the senate presides
ideas for legislation can come from members lobbyists state legislatures constituents legislative counsel or executive agencies
anyone can write a bill but only members of congress may introduce bills
most bills are not written by congress members but originate from the executive branch interest groups often draft bills as well
the usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review
a proposal is usually in one of these forms
bills are laws in the making
a house originated bill begins with the letters h r for house of representatives followed by a number kept as it progresses
joint resolutions
there is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly a joint resolution originating from the house for example begins h j res followed by its number
concurrent resolutions affect only the house and senate and accordingly are not presented to the president
in the house they begin with h con res
simple resolutions concern only the house or only the senate and begin with h res or s res representatives introduce a bill while the house is in session by placing it in the hopper on the clerk s desk
it is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage
drafting statutes requires great skill knowledge and experience and sometimes take a year or more
sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction
joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war
on the other hand concurrent resolutions passed by both houses and simple resolutions passed by only one house do not have the force of law but express the opinion of congress or regulate procedure
bills may be introduced by any member of either house
however the constitution states all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives while the senate cannot originate revenue and appropriation bills it has the power to amend or reject them
congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels
each chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the constitution or prescribed by law
in the house a rules committee guides legislation in the senate a standing rules committee is in charge
each branch has its own traditions for example the senate relies heavily on the practice of getting unanimous consent for noncontroversial matters
house and senate rules can be complex sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before a bill can become a law
members sometimes turn to outside experts to learn about proper congressional procedures
each bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the government accountability office
most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as agriculture or appropriations
the house has twenty standing committees the senate has sixteen
standing committees meet at least once each month
almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes publicly to close the meeting
a committee might call for public hearings on important bills
each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party
witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill
then a bill may go to what is called a mark up session where committee members debate the bill s merits and may offer amendments or revisions
committees may also amend the bill but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments
after debate the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house
if a bill is tabled then it is rejected
if amendments are extensive sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so called clean bill with a new number
both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used
generally members who have been in congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power
a bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex and begins with an enacting formula such as be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled consideration of a bill requires itself a rule which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate time limits possibility of further amendments and such
each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak
sometimes opponents seek to recommit a bill which means to change part of it
generally discussion requires a quorum usually half of the total number of representatives before discussion can begin although there are exceptions
the house may debate and amend the bill the precise procedures used by the house and senate differ
a final vote on the bill follows
once a bill is approved by one house it is sent to the other which may pass reject or amend it
for the bill to become law both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill
if the second house amends the bill then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a conference committee an ad hoc committee that includes both senators and representatives sometimes by using a reconciliation process to limit budget bills
both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as pay as you go or paygo which discourages members from considering acts that increase budget deficits
if both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee the bill passes otherwise it fails
the constitution specifies that a majority of members a quorum be present before doing business in each house
however the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a quorum call demonstrates the contrary and debate often continues despite the lack of a majority
voting within congress can take many forms including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting
both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout aye or no and the presiding officer announces the result
the constitution however requires a recorded vote if demanded by one fifth of the members present or when voting to override a presidential veto
if the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial a recorded vote usually happens
the senate uses roll call voting in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators each senator stating aye or no when their name is announced
in the senate the vice president may cast the tie breaking vote if present when the senators are equally divided
the house reserves roll call votes for the most formal matters as a roll call of all representatives takes quite some time normally members vote by using an electronic device
in the case of a tie the motion in question fails
most votes in the house are done electronically allowing members to vote yea or nay or present or open
members insert a voting id card and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose in addition paper ballots are used occasionally yea indicated by green and nay by red
one member cannot cast a proxy vote for another
congressional votes are recorded on an online database
after passage by both houses a bill is enrolled and sent to the president for approval
the president may sign it making it law or veto it perhaps returning it to congress with the president s objections
a vetoed bill can still become law if each house of congress votes to override the veto with a two thirds majority
finally the president may do nothing neither signing nor vetoing the bill and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days not counting sundays according to the constitution
but if congress is adjourned during this period presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it the maneuver is known as a pocket veto and cannot be overridden by the adjourned congress
senators face reelection every six years and representatives every two
reelections encourage candidates to focus their publicity efforts at their home states or districts
running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing according to some critics
although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of congress in touch with voters
nevertheless incumbent members of congress running for reelection have strong advantages over challengers
they raise more money because donors fund incumbents over challengers perceiving the former as more likely to win and donations are vital for winning elections
one critic compared being elected to congress to receiving life tenure at a university
another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering
after each ten year census states are allocated representatives based on population and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party
as a result reelection rates of members of congress hover around percent causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class
academics such as princeton s stephen macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering in the u s
both senators and representatives enjoy free mailing privileges called franking privileges while these are not intended for electioneering this rule is often skirted by borderline election related mailings during campaigns
in the cost of running for congress in utah was but costs have climbed
the biggest expense is television advertisements
today s races cost more than a million dollars for a house seat and six million or more for a senate seat
since fundraising is vital members of congress are forced to spend ever increasing hours raising money for their re election
nevertheless the supreme court has treated campaign contributions as a free speech issue
some see money as a good influence in politics since it enables candidates to communicate with voters
few members retire from congress without complaining about how much it costs to campaign for reelection
critics contend that members of congress are more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens
elections are influenced by many variables
some political scientists speculate there is a coattail effect when a popular president or party position has the effect of reelecting incumbents who win by riding on the president s coattails although there is some evidence that the coattail effect is irregular and possibly declining since the s
some districts are so heavily democratic or republican that they are called a safe seat any candidate winning the primary will almost always be elected and these candidates do not need to spend money on advertising
but some races can be competitive when there is no incumbent
if a seat becomes vacant in an open district then both parties may spend heavily on advertising in these races in california in only four of twenty races for house seats were considered highly competitive
since members of congress must advertise heavily on television this usually involves negative advertising which smears an opponent s character without focusing on the issues
negative advertising is seen as effective because the messages tend to stick however these advertisements sour the public on the political process in general as most members of congress seek to avoid blame
one wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election which leads to a culture of risk avoidance a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors and concentrating publicity efforts in the members home districts
prominent founding fathers writing in the federalist papers felt that elections were essential to liberty that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential and that frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured in however few americans were familiar with leaders of congress
the percentage of americans eligible to vote who did in fact vote was in but has been falling since although there was a slight upward trend in the election
public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job congress is doing have in the last few decades hovered around with some variation
scholar julian zeliger suggested that the size messiness virtues and vices that make congress so interesting also create enormous barriers to our understanding the institution
unlike the presidency congress is difficult to conceptualize other scholars suggest that despite the criticism congress is a remarkably resilient institution
its place in the political process is not threatened
it is rich in resources and that most members behave ethically
they contend that congress is easy to dislike and often difficult to defend and this perception is exacerbated because many challengers running for congress run against congress which is an old form of american politics that further undermines congress s reputation with the public
an additional factor that confounds public perceptions of congress is that congressional issues are becoming more technical and complex and require expertise in subjects such as science engineering and economics
as a result congress often cedes authority to experts at the executive branch
since congress has dropped ten points in the gallup confidence poll with only nine percent having a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in their legislators
since gallup poll has reported congress s approval rating among americans at or below three times
public opinion of congress plummeted further to in october after parts of the u s
government deemed nonessential government shut down
when the constitution was ratified in the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one
the connecticut compromise gave every state large and small an equal vote in the senate
since each state has two senators residents of smaller states have more clout in the senate than residents of larger states
but since the population disparity between large and small states has grown in for example california had seventy times the population of wyoming
critics such as constitutional scholar sanford levinson have suggested that the population disparity works against residents of large states and causes a steady redistribution of resources from large states to small states
however others argue that the connecticut compromise was deliberately intended by the founding fathers to construct the senate so that each state had equal footing not based on population and contend that the result works well on balance
a major role for members of congress is providing services to constituents
constituents request assistance with problems
providing services helps members of congress win votes and elections and can make a difference in close races
congressional staff can help citizens navigate government bureaucracies
one academic described the complex intertwined relation between lawmakers and constituents as home style
one way to categorize lawmakers according to political scientist richard fenno is by their general motivation
reelection these are lawmakers who never met a voter they didn t like and provide excellent constituent services
good public policy legislators who burnish a reputation for policy expertise and leadership
power in the chamber lawmakers who spend serious time along the rail of the house floor or in the senate cloakroom ministering to the needs of their colleagues
famous legislator henry clay in the mid th century was described as an issue entrepreneur who looked for issues to serve his ambitions members of congress enjoy parliamentary privilege including freedom from arrest in all cases except for treason felony and breach of the peace and freedom of speech in debate
this constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions
the term arrest has been interpreted broadly and includes any detention or delay in the course of law enforcement including court summons and subpoenas
the rules of the house strictly guard this privilege a member may not waive the privilege on their own but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so
senate rules however are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose
the constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses providing in the speech or debate clause of the constitution that for any speech or debate in either house they shall not be questioned in any other place accordingly a member of congress may not be sued in court for slander because of remarks made in either house although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches and may punish members who transgress
obstructing the work of congress is a crime under federal law and is known as contempt of congress
each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case
if convicted in court an individual found guilty of contempt of congress may be imprisoned for up to one year
the franking privilege allows members of congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense
though they are not permitted to send election materials borderline material is often sent especially in the run up to an election by those in close races
indeed some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers

some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median american income of for men and for women
others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government
another criticism is that members of congress have access to free or low cost medical care in the washington d c area
the petition to remove health care subsidies for members of congress and their families garnered over signatures on the website change org
in january it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of congress were millionaires
congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute
others have criticized the wealth of members of congress
representative jim cooper of tennessee told harvard professor lawrence lessig that a chief problem with congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving that congress was a farm league for k street instead of on public service
members elected since are covered by the federal employees retirement system fers
like other federal employees congressional retirement is funded through taxes and participants contributions
members of congress under fers contribute of their salary into the fers retirement plan and pay of their salary in social security taxes
and like federal employees members contribute one third of the cost of health insurance with the government covering the other two thirds
the size of a congressional pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest three years of their salary
by law the starting amount of a member s retirement annuity may not exceed of their final salary
in the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under the civil service retirement system csrs was while those who retired under fers or in combination with csrs was
members of congress make fact finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing
for example the wall street journal reported in that lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense had included spas per night extra unused rooms and shopping excursions
lawmakers respond that traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in washington and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations
by the twenty seventh amendment changes to congressional pay may not take effect before the next election to the house of the representatives
