budai chinese pinyin b d i korean romanized podae japanese romanized hotei vietnamese b i was a chinese monk who is often identified with and venerated as maitreya buddha in chan buddhism
with the spread of chan buddhism he also came to be venerated in vietnam korea and japan
he is said to have lived around the th century in the wuyue kingdom
his name literally means cloth sack and refers to the bag that he is conventionally depicted as carrying as he wanders aimlessly
his jolly nature humorous personality and eccentric lifestyle distinguish him from most buddhist masters or figures
he is almost always shown smiling or laughing hence his nickname in chinese the laughing buddha
as he is traditionally depicted as overweight he is also referred to as the fat buddha especially in the western world
the main textual evidence pointing to budai resides in a collection of chan buddhist monks biographies known as the transmission of the lamp
budai has origins centered around cult worship and local legend
he is traditionally depicted as a fat bald monk wearing a simple robe
he carries his few possessions in a cloth sack being poor but content
he would excitingly entertain the adoring children that followed him and was known for patting his large belly happily
his figure appears throughout chinese culture as a representation of both contentment and abundance
budai attracted the townspeople around him as he was able to predict people s fortunes and even weather patterns
the wandering monk was often inclined to sleep anywhere he came to even outside for his mystical powers could ward off the bitter colds of snow and his body was left unaffected
a recovered death note dated to or a d which the monk himself wrote claims that he is an incarnation of maitreya the buddha of the future
a body allegedly belonging to budai was embalmed and displayed at the eastern section of the great hall at yuelin temple in fenghua district zhejiang
an account exists of the post mortem appearances of budai the laughing buddha recorded in the ching te ch uan teng lu the transmission of the lamp written between and ce by the monk shi daoyuan
in the third month of the third year of cheng ming ad the master proclaimed his approaching parinirvana
at the yueh lin temple he took up his seat cross legged on a flat stone below the eastern veranda and spoke the following verse
maitreya the veritable maitreya divides his body into ten thousand million parts
from time to time appearing among men he proclaims the truth to the men of that era but they naturally do not recognise him
when he had finished reciting this verse he quietly died
afterwards there were men in his neighbourhood who saw the master carrying his bag as before and walking
because of this the monks vied with one another in painting his likeness
now in the yueh lin temple in the eastern part of the great hall is preserved his body embalmed and people in many places speak of his re apparition as a proven fact
budai was one of several uncommitted saints that became incorporated into the chan pantheon
similar eccentric figures from the lamp histories were never officially inducted or appropriated into the chan patriarchal line
instead these obscure figures represented the special transmission that occurred during the early to mid th century
this transmission did not rely on patriarchal lineage legitimacy but instead used the peculiar personalities and qualities of various folkloric figures to illustrate the chan tradition s new commitment to the idea of awakening and the propagation of chan to a larger congregation
the chan masters dahui zonggao and hongzhi zhengjue were both leaders in the initial merging of local legend and buddhist tradition
they hoped the induction of likable and odd figures would attract all types of people to the chan tradition no matter their gender social background or complete understanding of the dharma and patriarchal lineage
bernard faure summarizes this merging of local legend and chan tradition by explaining one strategy in chan for domesticating the occult was to transform thaumaturges into tricksters by playing down their occult powers and stressing their thus world aspect the movement allocated the figures as religious props and channeled their extraordinary charismas into the lens of the chan pantheon in order to appeal to a larger population
ultimately budai was revered from both a folkloric standpoint as a strange wandering vagabond of the people as well as from his newfound personage within the context of the chan tradition as a mendicant priest who brought abundance fortune and joy to all he encountered with the help of his mystical cloth sack bag
budai is almost always depicted with his cloth sack that looks like a large bag
the bag serves as a prominent motif within the context of chan buddhism as it represents abundance prosperity and contentment
ink paintings such as these attributed to budai often had an inscription and seal that signaled to high ranking officials
for example budai and jiang mohe was inscribed by chusi fanqi who was closely related to song lian and wei su
after chan buddhism was transmitted to japan around the th century as zen buddhism the devout monastics and laymen of the area utilized figure painting to portray the characters central to this awakening period of zen art
many of the eccentric personalities that were inducted into the zen tradition like budai were previously wrapped up in the established culture and folklore of japan
the assimilation and reapplication of these wondrous charismas to the zen pantheon assisted in the expansion of the zen tradition
as the images demonstrate budai is most jubilant when in the presence of others especially children
when depicted with other gods in the seven lucky gods budai maintains a solemn or even depressed countenance
budai s round figure comes into practical use through the sculpting of the incense box th century that splits the monk s body into two halves
the newer images such as hotei and children carrying lanterns th century employs much more color dramatization of physical features and detail than the older pieces such as hotei from mokuan reien that employs much more wispy and heavily contrasting outlines of his figure with no color or assumed setting
japanese iconography like that of zen master hakuin ekaku shows budai in a multiplicity of representative actions like entertaining passerbies sheltering children under an umbrella and meditating using his sack as a cushion
in an especially known motif budai appears smoking in a kiseru and exhaling otafuku an ugly but charming prostitute that embodies zen happiness in a humorous reflection of the tradition according to which shandao exhaled amida kannon and seishi with a prayer
the smooth lumpfish is known in japan as hotei uo budai fish due to its rotund appearance
in the western world budai is often mistaken for gautama buddha himself and thus is nicknamed the fat buddha
angida was one of the original eighteen arhats
according to legend angida was a talented indian snake catcher whose aim was to catch venomous snakes to prevent them from biting passers by
angida would also remove the snake s venomous fangs and release them
due to his kindness he was able to attain bodhi
in chinese art angida is sometimes portrayed as budai being rotund laughing and carrying a bag
in thailand budai is sometimes confused with the arhat kacc na known in thailand as phra sangkajai or phra sangkachai
buddha praised phra sangkajai for his excellence in explaining sophisticated concepts of the dhamma in an easily and correctly understandable manner
phra sangkajai is also known for composing the madhupindika sutta
one story from thai folklore relates that phra sangkajai was so handsome that even a man once wanted him for a wife
to avoid a similar situation phra sangkajai decided to transform himself into a fat monk
another tale says he was so attractive that angels and men often compared him with the buddha
he considered this inappropriate so disguised himself in an unpleasantly fat body
although both budai and phra sangkajai may be found in both thai and chinese temples phra sangkajai is found more often in thai temples and budai in chinese temples
two points to distinguish them from one another are
phra sangkajai has a trace of hair on his head looking similar to the buddha s while budai is clearly bald
phra sangkajai wears the robes in theravada fashion with the robes folded across one shoulder leaving the other uncovered
budai wears the robes in chinese style covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered in mongolia budai is called enkh amaglan khan which is identical to the mongolian name for the kangxi emperor
because of this budai is often mistaken for the kangxi emperor
