the church was founded by the lombard arechis ii of benevento around as testified by numerous privileges signed by him some of which are in the museum of samnium near the church
the edifice was modeled on the palatine chapel of the lombard king liutprand in pavia and after the defeat of desiderius by charlemagne and the fall of the lombard kingdom in northern italy it became the national church of the lombards who had taken shelter in the duchy of benevento
the church was part of a large program of construction which would legitimate arechis claim as the highest lombard authority after his failed attempt to acquire the title of king and the renaming of the duchy as a principality
arechis dedicated it to holy wisdom hagia sophia in greek like the hagia sophia church of constantine in constantinople he also annexed a nearby benediction convent which had been dependent on the abbey of montecassino
the convent was placed under the leadership of his sister gariperga
the sanctuary also housed the relics of saint mercurius which putatively had been abandoned in near quintodecimo by the eastern roman emperor constans ii
the church was severely damaged by an earthquake in and another in which collapsed the original dome and some later medieval additions
cardinal orsini the future pope benedict xiii had the church rebuilt in baroque style
the restoration work started in transformed the plan from a stellar to a circular one added two side chapels and changed the appearance of the apse of the fa ade and of the pillars
further the frescoes which decorated the interior were mostly destroyed today only a few fragments depicting the stories of christ and mary remain
the church is on a central plan with a diameter of metres ft inspired by that of hagia sophia
in the center there are six columns perhaps taken from the city s ancient temple of isis placed at the vertices of a hexagon and connected by arches which support the dome
the internal hexagon is surrounded by a decagonal ring with eight pillars in white limestone and two columns at the sides of the entrance
the area of the three apses is circular but the central and frontal parts form part of a star interrupted by the portal with four niches in the corners
in most of the original appearance was restored basing on evidence from historical documentation with the exception of the baroque fa ade
in the exterior embedded in the th century fa ade is a romanesque portal whose lunette has a th century bas relief
the latter was originally part of the prothyrum now destroyed and depicts christ enthroned between the virgin st marcurius and gregory the abbot
the portal is flanked by two columns supporting another arch
the structure was influenced by a variety of sources
the elevated central body recalls the no longer extant church of santa maria in pertica of pavia while the articulation of the volumes shows the influence of byzantine architecture
aside from some modern statues artworks include the late th to early th century frescoes of which only fragments survive in the two side apses the annunciation of zacharias mutism of zacharias the annunciation and the visitation
they were executed by artists linked to the school of illuminators from benevento
the bell tower was built by abbot gregory ii while under the rule of pandulf iii of salerno as testified by an inscription in lombard script and protected the sepulchre of arechis ii
it collapsed in the earthquake of and was rebuilt in in a different position
the church has a cloister from the th century constructed in part of fragments of earlier buildings
the cloister gives access to the samnium museum with sections of remains from antiquity and the middle ages
these include an obelisk one of the two that once decorated the temple of isis
the other one can be still seen in the city s central piazza papiniano
