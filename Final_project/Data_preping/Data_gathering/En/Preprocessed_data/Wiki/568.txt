jacques paul migne french mi october october was a french priest who published inexpensive and widely distributed editions of theological works encyclopedias and the texts of the church fathers with the goal of providing a universal library for the catholic priesthood
the patrologia latina and the patrologia graeca along with the monumenta germaniae historica are among the great th century contributions to the scholarship of patristics and the middle ages
within the roman catholic church migne s editions put many original texts for the first time into the hands of the priesthood
migne was born in saint flour cantal and studied theology at the university of orl ans
he was ordained in and placed in charge of the parish of puiseaux in the diocese of orl ans where his uncompromisingly catholic and royalist sympathies did not coincide with local patriotism and the new regime of the citizen king
in after falling out with his bishop over a pamphlet he had published he went to paris and on november started a journal l univers religieux which he intended to keep free of political influence
it quickly gained subscribers and he edited it for three years
it afterwards became his co editor louis veuillot s ultramontane organ l univers migne was until june owner of the daily v rit formerly the journal des faits which being limited to reproducing other newspapers described itself as the impartial echo of all opinions
migne believed in the power of the press and the value of information widely distributed
in he opened his great publishing house the ateliers catholiques at petit montrouge in paris s outlying th arrondissement
he published numerous religious works in rapid succession meant for lesser clergy at prices that ensured wide circulation and bypassed the bookselling establishment with direct subscriptions
these works were reproduced from the best available texts generally without requesting permission
his publishing house was complemented during the second empire by painter artists workhalls for the decoration of churches three of their main works in the style of eug ne delacroix still remain in the choir of the church of saint john the baptist of audresselles in pas de calais france
the ateliers also produced and sold a variety of religious items
in time the ateliers catholiques became the largest privately held press in france
however on the night of february a devastating fire which began in the printing plant destroyed migne s establishment
five hundred thousand plates stacked in piles melted in an instant they are now enormous blocks on the most bizarre forms reported le monde illustr
despite his insurance contracts migne was only able to retrieve a pittance
shortly afterwards mgr georges darboy archbishop of paris forbade the continuance of the business and even suspended him from his priestly functions
the franco prussian war of inflicted further losses
then from the curia of pope pius ix came a decree condemning the use of mass stipends to purchase books which specifically called out migne and his publications
migne died in paris
he died without ever regaining his former success and his imprimerie catholique passed in into the hands of garnier fr res
the best known of his publications are scripturae sacrae cursus completus complete course in sacred scripture which assembled a wide repertory of commentaries on each of the books of the bible and theologiae cursus each of them in vols collection des auteurs sacr s vols encyclop die th ologique vols
however the three great series that have made his reputation were patrologiae cursus completus latin series patrologia latina in vols
greek series patrologia graeca first published in latin vols then published with greek text and latin translation vols
though scholars have always criticised them these hastily edited inexpensive and widely distributed texts have only slowly been replaced during a century and a half with more critically edited modern editions
though the cheap paper of the originals has made them fragile today the scope of the patrologia still makes it unique and valuable when modern editions do not yet exist
it is a far more complete collection of patristic and later literature than anything that has appeared subsequently or is likely to
to create so much so quickly migne reprinted the best or latest earlier editions available to him
in the pg the latin translations were often made in the renaissance before any greek text had been printed and so do not necessarily match the greek text very accurately
the indexes themselves are useful for locating references in the patristic writings
the collection is available through google books and archive org
migne s ateliers catholiques employed steam powered presses and by some workers
on average it published a book every ten days for thirty years
