Shravana Kumara Hindi श्रवण कुमार mentioned in the ancient Hindu text Rāmāyana known for his filial piety towards his parents was killed accidentally by King Dasharatha
Shravana Kumara's parents Shantanu and Gyanvanti Malaya were hermits
When they became aged Shravana wanted them to take to the four most sacred places of Hindu pilgrimage to purify the soul
Since Shravana Kumara could not afford the transport he decided to put each parent in a basket and tie each basket to an end of a bamboo pole which he would carry on his shoulder while on their pilgrimage
According to Punjabi folklore Shravana's mother was distantly related to King Dasharatha as his sister
According to the Ramayana while hunting in the forest of Ayodhya then-Prince Dasharatha heard a sound near a lake and unleashed an arrow hoping to hit an animal
When he crossed the lake to collect his kill he found that his arrow had fatally struck a teenage boy who was bleeding
The injured boy was Shravana who then told Dasharatha he had come to the lake to collect water for his sick and aged parents who were both blind and whom he had been carrying on a sling
With his dying breath Shravana requested Dasharatha to take water to his parents and to tell them what happened
Shravana then succumbed to his wounds and when Dasharatha took water for his parents and told them of his tragic mistake they were unable to bear the shock
Despite acknowledging that it was an accident they cursed Dasharatha that he too would experience 'Putrashoka' Sanskrit 'putra' is childson and 'shoka' is grief grief due to loss of a son
Thus Shravana's sick and thirsty parents died without drinking water
This curse turned out to be true when King Dasharatha had to suffer the exile of his eldest and most beloved and Rama who had to be exiled at his own orders it was actually his second queen Kaikeyi's wish that could not be ignored since he had promised her a boon years back when she had saved his life
Local tradition holds that the place where Shravana died was named 'Sarvan' in Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh in India and the spot where Dasharatha shot his arrow came to be known as 'Sarwara' and the place where Shravana's parents died is called 'Samadha'
An old and dilapidated memorial for Shravana on the banks of the lake is now withering away
Mukhed in Nanded district of Maharashtra has a samadhi shrine dedicated to Shravana
