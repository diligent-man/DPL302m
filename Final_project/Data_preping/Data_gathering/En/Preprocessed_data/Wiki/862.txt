the constitution of the czech republic czech stava esk republiky is the supreme law of the czech republic
the current constitution was adopted by the czech national council on december
it entered into force on january replacing the constitution of czechoslovakia and the constitutional act no
col when czechoslovakia gave way to the slovak republic and the czech republic in a peaceful dissolution
the constitution is a constitutional act and together with other constitutional acts constitutes the so called constitutional order of the czech republic or the constitution with a small c
while the charter of fundamental rights and basic freedoms listina z kladn ch pr v a svobod no
coll an equally important constitutional act asserts human and civil rights the constitution is concerned with state sovereignty and territorial integrity and defines the institutions governing the state
the constitution is divided into a preamble and chapters
the fundamental provisions are followed by long chapters on the legislative power the executive power the cabinet and the president and the judicial power the constitutional court and other courts and shorter chapters on the supreme audit office the czech national bank and territorial self government concluding with interim provisions
as of april the constitution has been amended eight times
the most important amendments are act no
providing the legal framework for the accession to the eu in and act no
coll which came into force on october and provided for the election of the president by popular vote
at the th meeting of the national assembly of the czechoslovak socialist republic on october a bill called the constitutional act on the czechoslovak federation was introduced jointly by the czech national council the slovak national council and the czechoslovak cabinet
the bill was enacted the same day as constitutional act no
on its entry into force on january it created the czech socialist republic and the slovak socialist republic both of them on an equal footing within the federation
the act stipulated in article paragraph that both republics would in due course enact their own constitutions and also envisaged the creation of three constitutional courts
the plan however was not followed through due to the onset of the period of normalization
in fact czechoslovakia only functioned as a federation until the enactment of constitutional act no
in december
its explanatory notes clearly and openly articulate the need for strengthening of the structural role of the central government of the federation
this act introduced direct changes and additions which undid the original plan for federation and took away most of the powers of the federal republics
consequently in czechoslovakia became essentially a centrally governed country with only prima facie attributes of a federation
the need for a new federal constitution was first announced officially at the th congress of the communist party of czechoslovakia in spring
a working group fronted by mari n alfa was set up in to draft this and in november a strong committee of the communist party and the national front was created led by milo jake
the constitution was expected to be enacted after the th congress of the communist party during the course of
in its last draft it was to be a single constitution serving both the federation and the two republics and in contrast with its predecessor did not include the leading role of the communist party and somewhat expanded the list of basic human rights
in autumn a group of members of the federal assembly proposed the constitutional act on the mode of enactment of the new constitutions of the czechoslovak socialist republic the czech socialist republic and the slovak socialist republic
despite not having seen the drafts of the constitutions themselves on october the national assemblies of both countries approved this proposal
the resolution of the czech national council was promulgated as act
and the resolution of the slovak national council as act no
these constitutional acts were intended as a prerequisite for the enactment of a single three in one constitution serving the federation and both republics
through the consent of both national councils both republics waived their entitlement to their own constitutions
however the events of the velvet revolution in quickly changed everything
as early as the plenary session of the slovak national council on november deputy majer asked whether it would be necessary to re enact the provision on the way of enactment together with the new constitution or whether the resolution of the slovak national council from the end of october would stay intact
in its next session on december the slovak national council had withdrawn its consent of october in resolution no
the czech national council enacted a similar provision as resolution no
on december
subsequently several constitutional acts were enacted which were supposed to pave the way towards the creation or rather restoration of the federation
both republics had passed constitutional acts on their symbols and had had a number of powers devolved to them which were hitherto vested in federal bodies
however neither the constitution of the federation nor the constitutions of either of the republics had been enacted prior to the election of
on and june elections were held for the federal assembly of the czech and slovak federative republic parliament the czech national council and the slovak national council
in the czech republic the civic democratic party won the election in its electoral programme the party spoke of either a functional federation or separation although keeping the federation was the preferred option
in slovak republic the winner was the movement for a democratic slovakia whose election promise was to acquire international legal subjectivity for slovakia although this was clearly inconsistent with the continuation of the shared state the party convinced voters that it did not rule out the existence of the federation
the constitution of the slovak republic was enacted on september and came into force on october three months before the dissolution of czechoslovakia
the making of the constitution of the czech republic also commenced soon after the election
two committees were set up a government committee and a committee of the presidium of the czech national council
the government committee was chaired by v clav klaus its other members were jan kalvoda cyril svoboda filip ediv ji vlach vojt ch cepl daniel kroupa v clav benda v clav pe ich jan litomisk miloslav v born v clav novotn miroslav sylla pavel z eck and du an hendrych
the members of the committee of the czech national council were marek benda ji b l pavel hirsch anton n hrazd ra ivana jan hana marvanov ivan ma ek jaroslav ortman ji payne anna r schov v t zslav sochor milan uhde and jan vik
in august it was agreed that the government committee would be entrusted with drafting the constitution
there were several possible starting points for the new constitution
the secretary of the government committee cyril svoboda summed them up to take the czechoslovak constitution of as a point of departure to rework the existing constitution of the czech and slovak federative republic or to draft a brand new one
svoboda as well as several other members of the committee were in favour of the first option to make use of the constitution of the first czechoslovak republic
one of the major obstacles seemed to be the status of the charter of fundamental rights and freedoms
it had been declared a part of the legal system by constitutional act no
coll which required other constitutional acts to comply with it
v clav klaus was totally opposed to the charter in any form
in particular he was against the wording of article of the charter concerning a right to information klaus would have preferred the wording a right to search out information instead and he also disagreed with the charter granting a right to organize in trade unions and a right to reward for work vested in article
miroslav v born proposed a solution to the problem introducing the idea of the so called constitutional order although influential jurists filip knapp were critical of it
between and october work on the final draft of the constitution commenced in karlovy vary
the first few articles were taken from older drafts the articles on executive power were penned by miroslav and jind i ka syllovi
the articles on the powers of the president were written by cyril svoboda those concerning the powers of the cabinet by du an hendrych and the articles on the judiciary by franti ek zoul k
hendrych also drafted chapters on the czech national bank and the supreme audit office while pavel z eck drafted chapters on territorial self government
on october three experts on constitutional law arrived to review the draft pavel pe ka vladim r kloko ka and pavel holl nder
the explanatory notes were written by cyril svoboda and milena pol kov on the weekend before it was due to be presented to prime minister klaus
in all four different drafts were created during the preparation of the constitution written respectively by the government the czechoslovak social democratic party the communist party of bohemia and moravia and the liberal social union
only the first of these was read in the czech national council
the government bill of the constitution of the czech republic was read in the czech national council on december
it was introduced by v clav klaus the prime minister of the czech republic
out of a number of changes proposed during the reading only deputy pavel hir s proposal was incorporated returning into the bill proportional voting system for the chamber of deputies and two round run off system for the senate
the result of the vote was announced by the chair of the czech national assembly milan uhde out of deputies present who registered their vote were against abstained and by votes in its support the constitution of the czech republic has been enacted
the constitution of the czech republic is a written constitution having been promulgated in the official journal the collection of laws
with reference to the provision of the article paragraph of the constitution which states that for the enactment of a constitutional act of all deputies must agree and of senators present changing the constitution is a more difficult procedure than changing an ordinary statute making it an entrenched constitution in the typology of constitutions
despite the tradition of entrenched constitutions throughout czech history some voiced the opinion during the preparation of the constitution of the czech republic that this one should be flexible
with regard to karl loewenstein s ontological classification of constitutions the czech constitution can be characterized as normative
the political process is carried out by the rules set out in it
high level of correspondence between the constitution and reality also makes it a real constitution
despite being heavily influenced by the czechoslovak constitutional charter of the czech constitution is an original one
it has been agreed on through a political process
most of the preamble was written by v clav havel and edited by milan uhde
the text recalls the history of czech statehood and goes on to declare the basic values of the state mentioning democracy and thanks to havel the civic society
the provisions of article of the constitution enshrine fundamental principles of the whole constitutional system of the czech republic
it defines the state as a republic as sovereign unitary and democratic rechtsstaat state characterized by the rule of law based on respect to rights and freedoms of the citizen and man
the word sovereign means that the czech republic is fully capable of holding rights and carrying out legal acts and is a full subject of international law independent of any other power
such sovereignty may however be voluntarily limited by membership in an international organisation this is the so called shared or pooled sovereignty as is the case with the czech republic and the european union
the term unitary makes it clear that the state is not a federation or confederation
the definition of the czech republic as a democratic rechtsstaat stresses the combination of the two principles democracy and the rule of law
to modify either of these two is forbidden by article of the constitution
the term rechtsstaat should not be understood merely formally but substantively
the constitutional court confirmed this in its adjudications
as early as december it ruled the constitution accepts and respects the principle of legality as a part of the overall concept of a rechtsstaat it does not merely link positive law to formal legality it also subordinates the construction and application of legal norms to the substantive meaning of their content it makes it a premise of law that it respects basic constitutive values of democratic society and measures the application of legal norms by these values
the statement that the czech republic is a state based on respecting the rights and freedoms of man and citizen defines the purpose of the state which is binding for the government
this is closely related to the provision of article pronouncing the charter a part of the constitutional order and article forbidding everyone including those legislating constitutional acts to change the fundamental requisites of the democratic rechtsstaat
the second paragraph added to the constitution in the so called euro amendment adopts the basic principle of international law to honestly fulfil all international obligations
from this article a duty arises for the government namely the legislature not to enact laws which would impede compliance with international legal obligations
as a part of the application of international legal norms the case law of international judicial institutions responsible for application of such norms must be taken into account
in his gettysburg address abraham lincoln spoke of three features of democracy government of the people by the people for the people
government of the people is enshrined in article paragraph of the constitution which postulates the sovereignty of the people and the division of government into executive power legislative power and judicial power
the sovereignty of the people is not a legal principle but a political principle it means that it is the people who have the right to create the system of values institutions and procedures through which the state is governed
no government body can exist unless it derived its legitimacy from the people directly or indirectly
paragraph makes it possible for future enactment of a constitutional act that would introduce some institutions of direct democracy namely via referendum
the cabinet s draft of the constitution did not contain such a provision as the civic democratic party and the civic democratic alliance were opposed to referendums
in the end it did find its way into the constitution with support from some social democratic deputies and at the insistence of v clav havel
although several drafts of a constitutional act on referendum had been prepared since the enactment of the constitution the only nationwide referendum conducted so far was the referendum on the accession of the czech republic to the european union
paragraphs and embody the principle of enumerated powers and the silence of law principle
the principle of enumerated powers requires that the power of the state can only be applied in such cases within such boundaries and by such means as is stipulated by law
the silence of law principle in contrast states that everyone may do everything law does not prohibit and is not required to do anything unless it is imposed on him by law
this provision is similar to article of the charter
where the constitution talks of every citizen the charter widens its to everyone
article incorporating the charter of fundamental rights and freedoms into the constitutional order of the czech republic is not a provision typical for a constitution
it was not before december that it was incorporated into the constitution based on political deal
while the government s draft at first did not contain any reference to the charter future drafts at least mentioned it in interim and final provisions which was considered inadequate to its importance
in the end all committees of the czech national council proposed in december that a reference to the charter be incorporated into the first section of the constitution
the charter hitherto part of constitutional act coll was disconnected from it and newly enacted in an extraordinary resolution of the presidium of the czech national council and published as no
this has later been used to question the normative nature of the charter
similar reference to a statute regulating fundamental rights and freedoms was also enshrined in austria s december constitution dezemberverfassung of and the second interim constitution of the czechoslovak republic no
and following
article states that fundamental rights and freedoms are subject to judicial protection
these rights are not limited to those enshrined in the charter but also includes those in other constitutional regulations and international treaties
the political system of the czech republic is defined in article which also ascribes irreplaceable role to political parties
article is dedicated to political decision making enshrining the principles of majority rule coupled with the protection of minorities
article enshrining the protection of nature was not a part of the cabinet s draft of the constitution
it was written by v clav havel convinced that there should be an environmental paragraph in the constitution
in the upshot only a curtailed version of havel s proposal made it into the constitution
article is a basic provision granting the principle of territorial self government
such a provision is indispensable as it is a substantial constitutive feature of democratic rechsstaat as well as a requirement of the european charter of local self government
territorial self government is further detailed in articles
there are three basic rules laid out in article stating that the constitution can only be changed by a constitutional act par
that not even such a change can remove or disrupt the substantive core of the constitution par
and that not even construction or interpretation of legal regulations can remove or disrupt this core par
the second paragraph stating that changing substantial features of a democratic state is not admissible is what is known as entrenched substantive core of the constitution
historically such entrenchment clause first appeared in the first constitution of the french republic of august stating that republican form of government can not be revised
identical construction is in the current constitution of france
another important historical instance of entrenched clause in a constitution was enshrined in the basic law for the federal republic of germany of in reaction to development of
firstly it states that the basic law can only be changed by a statute that explicitly modifies or amends the wording of the basic law
secondly it contains a provision which sets the substantive core beyond the reach of powers of the constitution maker
this is called imperative of unchangeability or eternity clause
unlike its czech counterpart the eternity clause ewigkeitsklausul of the german basic law does specify what its substantive core is the subdivision of the federation into states the states powers in lawmaking the dignity of a human the principles of a democratic social state the sovereignty of the people the division of powers the limitation of government by law and the right to resist
article of the constitution embeds key provisions in relation to incorporation of international law into domestic law
until the euro amendment came into effect it bestowed legal power akin to constitutional order onto international treaties on human rights and fundamental freedoms
the amendment has extended the treaties this applies to and also granted them priority of application
articles a and b have been added into the constitution by the euro amendment in reaction to the accession of the czech republic to the eu
article a set the condition on the transfer of powers on an international organization or institution
article b stipulates that regarding issues obligations arising from such a membership it is a duty of the cabinet to inform the parliament and a right of the chambers of the parliament to give their opinion
constitutional grounds for defining what is czech national territory are article also stipulates that a constitutional act is necessary to modify czech republic s national borders
article sets rules about the acquisition and loss of czech citizenship
in a bill of a constitutional act on citizenship was drafted which said explicitly that there was no legal claim to being granted czech citizenship
this was likely an attempt to overcome case law of the supreme administrative court which has adjudicated that there is a right to czech citizenship
prague is declared the capital in article
while details are left to a statute article lists the symbols of the czech republic the coat of arms the official colours the national flag the flag of the president the official seal and the national anthem
chapter two vests legislative and constitution making power in the czech parliament
article stipulates that legislative power belongs to the parliament consisting of two chambers the chamber of deputies and the senate
article says that the chamber of deputies has members elected for a four year term the election is based upon proportional system representation while the senate has members elected for years the election is based upon majority system election being held every two year to select one third of them
article specifies election schedule
article regulates active suffrage or the right to be elected and the election process
it provides for the ways in which specific executive powers shall be delineated between the president of the republic and the government as headed by the prime minister
the chapter also outlines the nature of the direct election of the president by the public as well as the limitations of presidential power in selecting a government
articles
in article the constitution states that the judicial power shall be carried out in the name of the republic by courts of law independent on the legislature and the executive
the in the name of republic formula contained here is also quoted in each substantive ruling of a czech court
article lays out the requirement of independence and impartiality of judges and in effect of all the decision by the judiciary
articles is dedicated to the constitutional court of the czech republic and states that it is only to be governed by the constitution
limiting its powers by a regular statute for example is out of question
the judges nominated by the senate and named by the president for the period of years are granted immunity akin to the one members of parliament enjoy
articles describe the court system comprising the supreme court of the czech republic the supreme administrative court high courts regional courts and district courts
the constitution establishes the supreme control office article
in article the constitution establishes the position and competences of the czech national bank cnb
it assign the cnb the role of central bank with the primary purpose of maintaining price stability
external interventions into its activities must be permitted by law
it was the then governor of the national bank josef to ovsk who requested that the bank s position be incorporated into the constitution
as the lawyers drafting the document could not find a way of placing it within the three powers the bank was given its own chapter
the constitution provides the basis for local government by dividing the territory of the republic into self governing territorial districts and regions articles
the document concludes by weighing in on a number of so called interim issues which mainly applied to the republic in its first year of existence
chiefly it specifically delineates what officers or laws of the former czech government as a constituent part of the czechoslovak federal republic remained in force until the czech republic produced new officeholders or laws under the provisions found elsewhere in the constitution
of the provisions of this chapter by far the most lasting has been article which made the charter of fundamental rights and freedoms a part of the constitution
this move has commonality with the way in which the bill of rights was quickly annexed to the us constitution granting czech citizens specific personal rights that would be extremely difficult for a future czech government to abrogate articles
stability has always been a characteristic of constitutional law of the czech republic and czechoslovakia and their constitutions the sum of all constitutional acts
since the constitution came into force it has only been modified a few times and the amendments did not have a major impact on the czech constitutional system
the first act of parliament modifying the constitution was constitutional act no
coll on the creation of higher self governing units and amending constitutional act of the czech national assembly no
coll the constitution of the czech republic
it created higher territorial self governing units as assumed by article paragraph of the constitution
the wording of the constitution was further changed by constitutional act no
coll relating to accession of the czech republic into the north atlantic alliance in
the act changed provisions of the constitution on matters such as deployment of armed forces stay of allied armed forces on the territory of the czech republic participation of the country in the defence systems of international organisations and division of powers between the cabinet and the parliament in such matters
another modification to the constitution brought constitutional act no
the cabinet has prepared an amendment of the constitution in february but this has been this rejected by the chamber of deputies in second reading
part of the bill proposed the change of article of the constitution in preparation for the new wording of act no
on the czech national bank
as a result of the rejection by the legislature the act on the czech national bank became incompatible with the constitution
the new wording of the act which entailed the necessity to modify the constitution has become a necessity as a consequence and a requirement of the treaty establishing the european economic community and the protocol on the statute of the european system of central banks and the european central bank attached to this treaty
a new bill has been drafted limited to a technicality replacing the stability of currency by the stability of prices in article
passed on october the so called euro amendment was a rather important change to the constitution
having entered into effect on june act no
added paragraph into article stating that the country abides by obligations arising from international law
it changed article hitherto ascribing high legal force only to international treaties on basic human rights and freedoms broadening it to grant this higher legal force to all promulgated international treaties which the parliament agreed to ratify
articles a and b have been added providing guidelines on the conditions of transfer of powers to an international organisation or organisations
with respect to obligations arising from the membership in such a body the cabinet has the duty to inform the parliament and both chambers of the parliament have the right to give their opinion
several other articles have been changed including the list of laws that are binding for a judge of the constitutional court
the opposition of a part of the political class towards the introduction of features of direct democracy was the reason for a one off provision to have been incorporated into the constitution for the referendum on the accession of the czech republic to the european union published as constitutional act no
constitutional act no
has in essence been prepared back in by the standing committee of the senate for the constitution of the czech republic and parliamentary procedures
the act has introduced the possibility of self dissolution of the chamber of deputies in reaction to a previous ruling by the constitutional court which had annulled the constitutional act on the shortening of the fifth electoral term of the chamber of deputies
at the same time the act fixed a loophole in the constitution which had not foreseen and provided for the situation when the president would not be able to call elections
in june the government introduced into the chamber of deputies a bill of a constitutional act providing for president to be elected by popular vote
the bill has been approved by the chamber of deputies in december and by the senate in february
until the new constitutional act no
entered into force on october president was elected at a joint session of both chambers of the parliament
the election was supposed to take place within days before the incumbent president s term of office ended or days after in case it ended prematurely
the powers of president have been modified too
to order that a criminal procedure must not be commenced or had it been commenced that it not be continued the president now needs co action of the government
while the general entry into force of the act has been fixed in advance for the coming presidential election for the part of the act regarding the liability of president for high treason and the condition for bringing a constitutional action against the president by the senate a later date has been set march
