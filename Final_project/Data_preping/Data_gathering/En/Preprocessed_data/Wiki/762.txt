its narrator expresses disdain for the inventor of the cigarette not so much for its health concerns as he says he is a smoker himself and it hasn t killed him yet but because of its addictive effect on nicotine slaves he goes on to describe two situations a tense poker game and a date with a beautiful woman that are interrupted because the other person has a nicotine craving and needs a cigarette
