The song is written in the talking blues style Its narrator expresses disdain for the inventor of the cigarette not so much for its health concerns as he says he is a smoker himself and it hasn't killed him yet but because of its addictive effect on nicotine slaves He goes on to describe two situations a tense poker game and a date with a beautiful woman that are interrupted because the other person has a nicotine craving and needs a cigarette Williams sarcastically quips that when the smoker eventually dies from the effects of their addiction that they tell Saint Peter that they need a smoke before entering the golden gate
