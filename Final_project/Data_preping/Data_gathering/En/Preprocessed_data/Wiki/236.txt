justice in its broadest sense is the principle that people receive that which they deserve with the interpretation of what then constitutes deserving being impacted upon by numerous fields with many differing viewpoints and perspectives including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics rationality law religion equity and fairness
the state will sometimes endeavour to increase justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings
consequently the application of justice differs in every culture
early theories of justice were set out by the ancient greek philosophers plato in his work the republic and aristotle in his nicomachean ethics
throughout history various theories have been established
advocates of divine command theory have said that justice issues from god
in the s philosophers such as john locke said that justice derives from natural law
social contract theory said that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone
in the s utilitarian philosophers such as john stuart mill said that justice is based on the best outcomes for the greatest number of people
theories of distributive justice study what is to be distributed between whom they are to be distributed and what is the proper distribution
egalitarians have said that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality
john rawls used a social contract theory to say that justice and especially distributive justice is a form of fairness
robert nozick and others said that property rights also within the realm of distributive justice and natural law maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system
theories of retributive justice say that wrongdoing should be punished to ensure justice
the closely related restorative justice also sometimes called reparative justice is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders
in his dialogue republic plato uses socrates to argue for justice that covers both the just person and the just city state
justice is a proper harmonious relationship between the warring parts of the person or city
hence plato s definition of justice is that justice is the having and doing of what is one s own
a just man is a man in just the right place doing his best and giving the precise equivalent of what he has received
this applies both at the individual level and at the universal level
a person s soul has three parts reason spirit and desire
similarly a city has three parts socrates uses the parable of the chariot to illustrate his point a chariot works as a whole because the two horses power is directed by the charioteer
lovers of wisdom philosophers in one sense of the term should rule because only they understand what is good
if one is ill one goes to a medic rather than a farmer because the medic is expert in the subject of health
similarly one should trust one s city to an expert in the subject of the good not to a mere politician who tries to gain power by giving people what they want rather than what s good for them
socrates uses the parable of the ship to illustrate this point the unjust city is like a ship in open ocean crewed by a powerful but drunken captain the common people a group of untrustworthy advisors who try to manipulate the captain into giving them power over the ship s course the politicians and a navigator the philosopher who is the only one who knows how to get the ship to port
for socrates the only way the ship will reach its destination the good is if the navigator takes charge
advocates of divine command theory say that justice and indeed the whole of morality is the authoritative command of god
murder is wrong and must be punished for instance because god says it so
some versions of the theory assert that god must be obeyed because of the nature of his relationship with humanity others assert that god must be obeyed because he is goodness itself and thus doing what he says would be best for everyone
a meditation on the divine command theory by plato can be found in his dialogue euthyphro
called the euthyphro dilemma it goes as follows is what is morally good commanded by god because it is morally good or is it morally good because it is commanded by god the implication is that if the latter is true then justice is beyond mortal understanding if the former is true then morality exists independently from god and is therefore subject to the judgment of mortals
a response popularized in two contexts by immanuel kant and c
lewis is that it is deductively valid to say that the existence of an objective morality implies the existence of god and vice versa
for advocates of the theory that justice is part of natural law e g john locke justice involves the nature of man
in republic by plato the character thrasymachus argues that justice is the interest of the strong merely a name for what the powerful or cunning ruler has imposed on the people
advocates of the social contract say that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone or in many versions from what they would agree to under hypothetical conditions including equality and absence of bias
this account is considered further below under justice as fairness
the absence of bias refers to an equal ground for all people involved in a disagreement or trial in some cases
according to utilitarian thinkers including john stuart mill justice is not as fundamental as we often think
rather it is derived from the more basic standard of rightness consequentialism what is right is what has the best consequences usually measured by the total or average welfare caused
so the proper principles of justice are those that tend to have the best consequences
these rules may turn out to be familiar ones such as keeping contracts but equally they may not depending on the facts about real consequences
either way what is important is those consequences and justice is important if at all only as derived from that fundamental standard
mill tries to explain our mistaken belief that justice is overwhelmingly important by arguing that it derives from two natural human tendencies our desire to retaliate against those who hurt us or the feeling of self defense and our ability to put ourselves imaginatively in another s place sympathy
so when we see someone harmed we project ourselves into their situation and feel a desire to retaliate on their behalf
if this process is the source of our feelings about justice that ought to undermine our confidence in them
theories of distributive justice need to answer three questions
what goods are to be distributed is it to be wealth power respect opportunities or some combination of these things
between what entities are they to be distributed humans dead living future sentient beings the members of a single society nations
what is the proper distribution equal meritocratic according to social status according to need based on property rights and non aggression distributive justice theorists generally do not answer questions of who has the right to enforce a particular favored distribution while property rights theorists say that there is no favored distribution rather distribution should be based simply on whatever distribution results from lawful interactions or transactions that is transactions which are not illicit
this section describes some widely held theories of distributive justice and their attempts to answer these questions
social justice encompasses the just relationship between individuals and their society often considering how privileges opportunities and wealth ought to be distributed among individuals
social justice is also associated with social mobility especially the ease with which individuals and families may move between social strata
social justice is distinct from cosmopolitanism which is the idea that all people belong to a single global community with a shared morality
social justice is also distinct from egalitarianism which is the idea that all people are equal in terms of status value or rights as social justice theories do not all require equality
for example sociologist george c
homans suggested that the root of the concept of justice is that each person should receive rewards that are proportional to their contributions
economist friedrich hayek said that the concept of social justice was meaningless saying that justice is a result of individual behavior and unpredictable market forces
social justice is closely related to the concept of relational justice which is about the just relationship with individuals who possess features in common such as nationality or who are engaged in cooperation or negotiation
in his a theory of justice john rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice and especially distributive justice is a form of fairness an impartial distribution of goods
rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind a veil of ignorance that denies us all knowledge of our personalities social statuses moral characters wealth talents and life plans and then asks what theory of justice we would choose to govern our society when the veil is lifted if we wanted to do the best that we could for ourselves
we don t know who in particular we are and therefore can t bias the decision in our own favour
so the decision in ignorance models fairness because it excludes selfish bias
rawls said that each of us would reject the utilitarian theory of justice that we should maximize welfare see below because of the risk that we might turn out to be someone whose own good is sacrificed for greater benefits for others
instead we would endorse rawls s two principles of justice
each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all
social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both
to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged consistent with the just savings principle and
attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity this imagined choice justifies these principles as the principles of justice for us because we would agree to them in a fair decision procedure
rawls s theory distinguishes two kinds of goods the good of liberty rights and social and economic goods i e
wealth income and power and applies different distributions to them equality between citizens for equality unless inequality improves the position of the worst off for
in one sense theories of distributive justice may assert that everyone should get what they deserve
theories vary on the meaning of what is deserved
the main distinction is between theories that say the basis of just deserts ought to be held equally by everyone and therefore derive egalitarian accounts of distributive justice and theories that say the basis of just deserts is unequally distributed on the basis of for instance hard work and therefore derive accounts of distributive justice by which some should have more than others
according to meritocratic theories goods especially wealth and social status should be distributed to match individual merit which is usually understood as some combination of talent and hard work
according to needs based theories goods especially such basic goods as food shelter and medical care should be distributed to meet individuals basic needs for them
marxism is a needs based theory expressed succinctly in marx s slogan from each according to his ability to each according to his need
according to contribution based theories goods should be distributed to match an individual s contribution to the overall social good
in anarchy state and utopia robert nozick said that distributive justice is not a matter of the whole distribution matching an ideal pattern but of each individual entitlement having the right kind of history
it is just that a person has some good especially some property right if and only if they came to have it by a history made up entirely of events of two kinds
just acquisition especially by working on unowned things and
just transfer that is free gift sale or other agreement but not theft i e
by force or fraud if the chain of events leading up to the person having something meets this criterion they are entitled to it that they possess it is just and what anyone else does or doesn t have or need is irrelevant
on the basis of this theory of distributive justice nozick said that all attempts to redistribute goods according to an ideal pattern without the consent of their owners are theft
in particular redistributive taxation is theft
some property rights theorists such as nozick also take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and say that property rights based justice also has the effect of maximizing the overall wealth of an economic system
they explain that voluntary non coerced transactions always have a property called pareto efficiency
the result is that the world is better off in an absolute sense and no one is worse off
they say that respecting property rights maximizes the number of pareto efficient transactions in the world and minimized the number of non pareto efficient transactions in the world i e
transactions where someone is made worse off
the result is that the world will have generated the greatest total benefit from the limited scarce resources available in the world
further this will have been accomplished without taking anything away from anyone unlawfully
according to the utilitarian justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals
this may require sacrifice of some for the good of others so long as everyone s good is taken impartially into account
utilitarianism in general says that the standard of justification for actions institutions or the whole world is impartial welfare consequentialism and only indirectly if at all to do with rights property need or any other non utilitarian criterion
these other criteria might be indirectly important to the extent that human welfare involves them
but even then such demands as human rights would only be elements in the calculation of overall welfare not uncrossable barriers to action
theories of retributive justice involve punishment for wrongdoing and need to answer three questions
why punish
who should be punished
what punishment should they receive this section considers the two major accounts of retributive justice and their answers to these questions
utilitarian theories look forward to the future consequences of punishment while retributive theories look back to particular acts of wrongdoing and attempt to balance them with deserved punishment
according to the utilitarian justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals
punishment fights crime in three ways
deterrence
the credible threat of punishment might lead people to make different choices well designed threats might lead people to make choices that maximize welfare
this matches some strong intuitions about just punishment that it should generally be proportional to the crime
rehabilitation
punishment might make bad people into better ones
for the utilitarian all that bad person can mean is person who s likely to cause unwanted things like suffering
so utilitarianism could recommend punishment that changes someone such that they are less likely to cause bad things
security incapacitation
perhaps there are people who are irredeemable causers of bad things
if so imprisoning them might maximize welfare by limiting their opportunities to cause harm and therefore the benefit lies within protecting society so the reason for punishment is the maximization of welfare and punishment should be of whomever and of whatever form and severity are needed to meet that goal
this may sometimes justify punishing the innocent or inflicting disproportionately severe punishments when that will have the best consequences overall perhaps executing a few suspected shoplifters live on television would be an effective deterrent to shoplifting for instance
it also suggests that punishment might turn out never to be right depending on the facts about what actual consequences it has
the retributivist will think consequentialism is mistaken
if someone does something wrong we must respond by punishing for the committed action itself regardless of what outcomes punishment produces
wrongdoing must be balanced or made good in some way and so the criminal deserves to be punished
it says that all guilty people and only guilty people deserve appropriate punishment
this matches some strong intuitions about just punishment that it should be proportional to the crime and that it should be of only and all of the guilty
however it is sometimes said that retributivism is merely revenge in disguise
however there are differences between retribution and revenge the former is impartial and has a scale of appropriateness whereas the latter is personal and potentially unlimited in scale
restorative justice also sometimes called reparative justice is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders instead of satisfying abstract legal principles or punishing the offender
victims take an active role in the process while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions to repair the harm they ve done by apologizing returning stolen money or community service
it is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community rather than the state
restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability
some modern philosophers have said that utilitarian and retributive theories are not mutually exclusive
for example andrew von hirsch in his book doing justice suggested that we have a moral obligation to punish greater crimes more than lesser ones
however so long as we adhere to that constraint then utilitarian ideals would play a significant secondary role
it has been said that systematic or programmatic political and moral philosophy in the west begins in plato s republic with the question what is justice according to most contemporary theories of justice justice is overwhelmingly important john rawls claims that justice is the first virtue of social institutions as truth is of systems of thought in classical approaches evident from plato through to rawls the concept of justice is always construed in logical or etymological opposition to the concept of injustice
such approaches cite various examples of injustice as problems which a theory of justice must overcome
a number of post world war ii approaches do however challenge that seemingly obvious dualism between those two concepts
justice can be thought of as distinct from benevolence charity prudence mercy generosity or compassion although these dimensions are regularly understood to also be interlinked
justice is the concept of cardinal virtues of which it is one
metaphysical justice has often been associated with concepts of fate reincarnation or divine providence i e with a life in accordance with a cosmic plan
the equivalence of justice and fairness has been historically and culturally established
in political theory liberalism includes two traditional elements liberty and equality
most contemporary theories of justice emphasize the concept of equality including rawls theory of justice as fairness
for ronald dworkin a complex notion of equality is the sovereign political virtue
dworkin raises the question of whether society is under a duty of justice to help those responsible for the fact that they need help
complications arise in distinguishing matters of choice and matters of chance as well as justice for future generations in the redistribution of resources that he advocates
law raises important and complex issues about equality fairness and justice
there is an old saying that all are equal before the law
the belief in equality before the law is called legal egalitarianism
in criticism of this belief the author anatole france said in in its majestic equality the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread with this saying france illustrated the fundamental shortcoming of a theory of legal equality that remains blind to social inequality the same law applied to all may have disproportionately harmful effects on the least powerful
relational justice seeks to examine the connections between individuals and focuses on their relations in societies with respect to how these relationships are established and configured
in a normative view this focus includes an understanding of what these relations should be
in a political view this focus includes the method of organizing persons in society
rawls theory of justice stakes out the task of justice as equalizing the distribution of primary social goods to benefit the worst off in society
however his distributive scheme and other distributive accounts of justice do not directly consider power relations between and among individuals
nor do they address such political considerations as various structures of decision making such as divisions of labor culture or the construction of social meanings
even rawls own basic value of self respect cannot be said to be amenable to distribution
iris marion young charges that distributive accounts of justice fail to provide an adequate way of conceptualizing political justice in that they fail to take into account many of the demands of ordinary life and that a relational view of justice grounded upon understanding the differences among social groups offers a better approach one which acknowledges unjust power relations among individuals groups and institutional structures
young kim also takes a relational approach to the question of justice but departs from iris marion young s political advocacy of group rights and instead he emphasizes the individual and moral aspects of justice
as to its moral aspects he said that justice includes responsible actions based on rational and autonomous moral agency with the individual as the proper bearer of rights and responsibilities
politically he maintains that the proper context for justice is a form of liberalism with the traditional elements of liberty and equality together with the concepts of diversity and tolerance
equality before the law is one of the basic principles of classical liberalism
classical liberalism calls for equality before the law not for equality of outcome
classical liberalism opposes pursuing group rights at the expense of individual rights
in addition to equality individual liberty serves as a core notion of classical liberalism
as to the liberty component british social and political theorist philosopher and historian of ideas isaiah berlin identifies positive and negative liberty in two concepts of liberty subscribing to a view of negative liberty in the form of freedom from governmental interference
he further extends the concept of negative liberty in endorsing john stuart mills harm principle the sole end for which mankind are warranted individually and collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self protection which represents a classical liberal view of liberty
jews christians and muslims traditionally believe that justice is a present real right and specifically governing concept along with mercy and that justice is ultimately derived from and held by god
according to the bible such institutions as the mosaic law were created by god to require the israelites to live by and apply his standards of justice
the hebrew bible describes god as saying about the judeo christian patriarch abraham no for i have chosen him that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the lord by doing righteousness and justice genesis nrsv
the psalmist describes god as having righteousness and justice as the foundation of his throne psalms nrsv
the new testament also describes god and jesus christ as having and displaying justice often in comparison with god displaying and supporting mercy matthew
in criminal law a sentence forms the final explicit act of a judge ruled process and also the symbolic principal act connected to his function
the sentence can generally involve a decree of imprisonment a fine and or other punishments against a defendant convicted of a crime
laws may specify the range of penalties that can be imposed for various offenses and sentencing guidelines sometimes regulate what punishment within those ranges can be imposed given a certain set of offense and offender characteristics
the most common purposes of sentencing in legal theory are
in civil cases the decision is usually known as a verdict or judgment rather than a sentence
civil cases are settled primarily by means of monetary compensation for harm done damages and orders intended to prevent future harm for example injunctions
under some legal systems an award of damages involves some scope for retribution denunciation and deterrence by means of additional categories of damages beyond simple compensation covering a punitive effect social disapprobation and potentially deterrence and occasionally disgorgement forfeit of any gain even if no loss was caused to the other party
evolutionary ethics and evolution of morality suggest evolutionary bases for the concept of justice
biosocial criminology research says that human perceptions of what is appropriate criminal justice are based on how to respond to crimes in the ancestral small group environment and that these responses may not always be appropriate for today s societies
studies at ucla in have indicated that reactions to fairness are wired into the brain and that fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats
this is consistent with the notion that being treated fairly satisfies a basic need
research conducted in at emory university involving capuchin monkeys demonstrated that other cooperative animals also possess such a sense and that inequity aversion may not be uniquely human
in a world where people are interconnected but they disagree institutions are required to instantiate ideals of justice
these institutions may be justified by their approximate instantiation of justice or they may be deeply unjust when compared with ideal standards consider the institution of slavery
justice is an ideal the world fails to live up to sometimes due to deliberate opposition to justice despite understanding which could be disastrous
the question of institutive justice raises issues of legitimacy procedure codification and interpretation which are considered by legal theorists and by philosophers of law
the united nations sustainable development goal emphasizes the need for strong institutions in order to uphold justice
