algebra essentially considered computation similar arithmetic non-numerical mathematical objects
example fundamental theorem algebra belongs theory equation nowadays considered belonging algebra fact every proof must use completeness real number algebraic property
article describes history theory equation called algebra origin emergence algebra separate area mathematics
word algebra derived arabic word al-jabr come treatise written year medieval persian mathematician muhammad ibn al-khwrizm whose arabic title kitb al-mutaar f isb al-abr wa-l-muqbala translated compendious book calculation completion balancing
according one history certain term al-jabr muqabalah mean usual interpretation similar implied previous translation
word 'al-jabr' presumably meant something like 'restoration' 'completion' seems refer transposition subtracted term side equation word 'muqabalah' said refer 'reduction' 'balancing'that cancellation like term opposite side equation
arabic influence spain long time al-khwarizmi found quixote word 'algebrista' used bone-setter 'restorer' term used al-khwarizmi describe operation introduced reduction balancing referring transposition subtracted term side equation cancellation like term opposite side equation
algebra always make use symbolism ubiquitous mathematics instead went three distinct stages
thing plus one equal two possibly thing plus equals
rhetorical algebra wa first developed ancient babylonian remained dominant century
syncopated algebra symbolism used doe contain characteristic symbolic algebra
instance may restriction subtraction may used within one side equation case symbolic algebra
syncopated algebraic expression first appeared diophantus' arithmetica rd century ad followed brahmagupta's brahma sphuta siddhanta century
early step toward seen work several islamic mathematician ibn al-banna - century al-qalasadi century although fully symbolic algebra wa developed franois vite century
later ren descartes century introduced modern notation example use xsee showed problem occurring geometry expressed solved term algebra cartesian geometryequally important use lack symbolism algebra wa degree equation addressed
quadratic equation played important role early algebra throughout history early modern period quadratic equation classified belonging one three categories
rhetorical syncopated stage symbolic algebra geometric constructive algebra wa developed classical greek vedic indian mathematician algebraic equation solved geometry
addition three stage expressing algebraic idea author recognized four conceptual stage development algebra occurred alongside change expression
date back babylonian continued greek wa later revived omar khayym
static equation-solving stage objective find number satisfying certain relationships
move away geometric stage date back diophantus brahmagupta algebra decisively move static equation-solving stage al-khwarizmi introduced generalized algorithmic process solving algebraic problems
idea function began emerging sharaf al-dn al-ts algebra decisively move dynamic function stage gottfried leibniz
abstract algebra largely product centuriesthe origin algebra traced ancient babylonian developed positional number system greatly aided solving rhetorical algebraic equations
babylonian interested exact solution rather approximation would commonly use linear interpolation approximate intermediate values
one famous tablet plimpton tablet created around bc give table pythagorean triple represents advanced mathematics prior greek mathematics
babylonian algebra wa much advanced egyptian algebra time whereas egyptian mainly concerned linear equation babylonian concerned quadratic cubic equations
babylonian developed flexible algebraic operation able add equal equal multiply side equation like quantity eliminate fraction factors
familiar many simple form factoring three-term quadratic equation positive root many cubic equation although known able reduce general cubic equation
ancient egyptian algebra dealt mainly linear equation babylonian found equation elementary developed mathematics higher level egyptians

known written arithmetica treatise wa originally thirteen book first six survived
arithmetica ha little common traditional greek mathematics since divorced geometric method different babylonian mathematics diophantus concerned primarily exact solution determinate indeterminate instead simple approximations
usually rather difficult tell whether given diophantine equation solvable
evidence suggests diophantus even realized could two solution quadratic equation
arithmetica diophantus first use symbol unknown number well abbreviation power number relationship operation thus used known syncopated algebra
main difference diophantine syncopated algebra modern algebraic notation former lacked special symbol operation relation exponentials
displaystyle mathrm k upsilon overline alpha zeta overline iota pitchfork delta upsilon overline beta mathrm overline alpha
unlike modern notation coefficient come variable addition represented juxtaposition terms
literal symbol-for-symbol translation diophantus's syncopated equation modern symbolic equation would following
clarify modern parenthesis plus used equation rewritten as
arithmetica collection solved problem specific number postulational development general method explicitly explained although generality method may intended attempt find solution equations
arithmetica doe contain solved problem involving several unknown quantity solved possible expressing unknown quantity term one them
earliest known indian mathematical document dated around middle first millennium bc around century bc
recurring theme indian mathematics among others determinate indeterminate linear quadratic equation simple mensuration pythagorean triples
work brahmagupta solves general quadratic equation positive negative roots
modified form old babylonian rule brahmagupta may familiar with
wa first give general solution linear diophantine equation
unlike diophantus gave one solution indeterminate equation brahmagupta gave integer solution brahmagupta used example diophantus ha led historian consider possibility greek influence brahmagupta's work least common babylonian source
addition wa indicated placing number side side subtraction placing dot subtrahend division placing divisor dividend similar modern notation without bar

al-khwarizmi died around ce wrote half dozen mathematical astronomical work based indian sindhind
one al-khwarizmi's famous book entitled al-jabr wa'l muqabalah compendious book calculation completion balancing give exhaustive account solving polynomial second degree
book also introduced fundamental concept reduction balancing referring transposition subtracted term side equation cancellation like term opposite side equation
al-jabr divided six chapter deal different type formula
first chapter al-jabr deal equation whose square equal roots
sixth final chapter deal root number equal squares
al-jabr al-khwarizmi us geometric proof doe recognize root
also recognizes discriminant must positive described method completing square though doe justify procedure
greek influence shown al-jabr's geometric foundation one problem taken heron
make use lettered diagram coefficient equation specific number since way expressing parameter could express geometrically although generality method intended
al-khwarizmi likely know diophantus's arithmetica became known arab sometime century

omar khayym provided arithmetic geometric solution quadratic equation gave geometric solution general cubic equation since mistakenly believed arithmetic solution impossible
method solving cubic equation using intersecting conic used menaechmus archimedes ibn al-haytham alhazen omar khayym generalized method cover cubic equation positive roots
century sharaf al-dn al-ts wrote al-mu'adalat treatise equation dealt eight type cubic equation positive solution five type cubic equation may positive solutions
used would later known ruffini-horner method numerically approximate root cubic equation
also developed concept maximum minimum curve order solve cubic equation may positive solutions
understood importance discriminant cubic equation used early version cardano's formula find algebraic solution certain type cubic equations
scholar roshdi rashed argue sharaf al-din discovered derivative cubic polynomial realized significance scholar connect solution idea euclid archimedes
state question whether equation ha solution depends whether function left side reach value
early century jamshd al-ksh developed early form newton's method numerically solve equation
al-ksh also developed decimal fraction claimed discovered himself
lennart berggrenn note wa mistaken decimal fraction first used five century baghdadi mathematician abu'l-hasan al-uqlidisi early century
al-hassr mathematician morocco specializing islamic inheritance jurisprudence century developed modern symbolic mathematical notation fraction numerator denominator separated horizontal bar
ab al-hasan ibn al al-qalasd wa last major medieval arab algebraist made first attempt creating algebraic notation since ibn al-banna two century earlier wa first make attempt since diophantus brahmagupta ancient times
syncopated notation predecessor however lacked symbol mathematical operations
al-qalasadi took first step toward introduction algebraic symbolism using letter place number using short arabic word initial letter mathematical symbols
death hypatia signal close library alexandria mathematical center doe death boethius signal end mathematics western roman empire
although wa work done athens came close byzantine emperor justinian closed pagan philosophical schools
scholar fled west towards hospitable east particularly towards persia found king chosroes established might termed athenian academy exile
treaty justinian chosroes would eventually return scholar eastern empire
dark age european mathematics wa nadir mathematical research consisting mainly commentary ancient treatise research wa centered byzantine empire
end medieval period set fall constantinople turk in
century saw flood translation arabic latin century european mathematics wa beginning rival mathematics lands
century solution cubic equation fibonacci representative beginning revival european algebra

although mathematical notion function wa implicit trigonometric logarithmic table existed day gottfried leibniz wa first employ explicitly denote several geometric concept derived curve abscissa ordinate tangent chord perpendicular
leibniz realized coefficient system linear equation could arranged array called matrix manipulated find solution system any
leibniz also discovered boolean algebra symbolic logic also relevant algebra
explained andrew warwick cambridge university student early century practiced mixed mathematics exercise based physical variable space time weight
time association variable physical quantity faded away mathematical technique grew
eventually mathematics wa concerned completely abstract polynomial complex number hypercomplex number concepts
application physical situation wa called applied mathematics mathematical physic field mathematics expanded include abstract algebra
instance issue constructible number showed mathematical limitation field galois theory wa developed
title father algebra frequently credited persian mathematician al-khwarizmi supported historian mathematics carl benjamin boyer solomon gandz bartel leendert van der waerden
however point debatable title sometimes credited hellenistic mathematician diophantus
support diophantus point algebra found al-jabr elementary algebra found arithmetica arithmetica syncopated al-jabr fully rhetorical
however mathematics historian kurt vogel argues diophantus holding title mathematics wa much algebraic ancient babylonians
support al-khwarizmi point fact gave exhaustive explanation algebraic solution quadratic equation positive root wa first teach algebra elementary form sake whereas diophantus wa primarily concerned theory numbers
al-khwarizmi also introduced fundamental concept reduction balancing originally used term al-jabr refer referring transposition subtracted term side equation cancellation like term opposite side equation
supporter al-khwarizmi point algebra longer concerned series problem resolved exposition start primitive term combination must give possible prototype equation henceforward explicitly constitute true object study also point treatment equation sake generic manner insofar doe simply emerge course solving problem specifically
