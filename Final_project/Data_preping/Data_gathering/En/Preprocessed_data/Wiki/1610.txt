in finance a non deliverable forward ndf is an outright forward or futures contract in which counterparties settle the difference between the contracted ndf price or rate and the prevailing spot price or rate on an agreed notional amount
it is used in various markets such as foreign exchange and commodities
ndfs are also known as forward contracts for differences fcd
ndfs are prevalent in some countries where forward fx trading has been banned by the government usually as a means to prevent exchange rate volatility
the ndf market is an over the counter market
ndfs began to trade actively in the s
ndf markets developed for emerging markets with capital controls where the currencies could not be delivered offshore
most ndfs are cash settled in us dollars usd
the more active banks quote ndfs from between one month to one year although some would quote up to two years upon request
the most commonly traded ndf tenors are imm dates but banks also offer odd dated ndfs
ndfs are typically quoted with the usd as the reference currency and the settlement amount is also in usd
below is a non exhaustive list of currencies where non deliverable forwards are traded
not all non convertible currencies have a ndf market e g

a currency may be convertible by some market participants while being non convertible to others
an ndf is a short term cash settled currency forward between two counterparties
on the contracted settlement date the profit or loss is adjusted between the two counterparties based on the difference between the contracted ndf rate and the prevailing spot fx rates on an agreed notional amount
the features of an ndf include
notional amount this is the face value of the ndf which is agreed between the two counterparties
it should again be noted that there is never any intention to exchange the notional amounts in the two currencies
fixing date this is the day and time whereby the comparison between the ndf rate and the prevailing spot rate is made
this is essentially days before the settlement day
settlement date or delivery date this is the day when the difference is paid or received
it is usually one or two business days after the fixing date
contracted ndf rate the rate agreed on the transaction date and is essentially the outright forward rate of the currencies dealt
prevailing spot rate or fixing spot rate the rate on the fixing date usually provided by the central bank and commonly calculated by calling a number of dealers in the market for a quote at a specified time of day and taking the average
the exact method of determining the fixing rate is agreed when a trade is initiated because an ndf is a cash settled instrument the notional amount is never exchanged
the only exchange of cash flows is the difference between the ndf rate and the prevailing spot market rate that is determined on the fixing date and exchanged on the settlement date applied to the notional i e
cash flow ndf rate spot rate notional
consequently since ndf is a non cash off balance sheet item and since the principal sums do not move ndf bears much lower counter party risk
ndfs are committed short term instruments both counterparties are committed and are obliged to honor the deal
nevertheless either counterparty can cancel an existing contract by entering into another offsetting deal at the prevailing market rate
an investor enters into a forward agreement to purchase a notional amount n of the base currency at the contracted forward rate f and would pay nf units of the quoted currency
on the fixing date that investor would theoretically be able to sell the notional amount n of the base currency at the prevailing spot rate s earning ns units of the quoted currency

the base currency is usually the more liquid and more frequently traded currency for example us dollar or euros
ndfs can be used to create a foreign currency loan in a currency which may not be of interest to the lender
for example the borrower wants dollars but wants to make repayments in euros
so the borrower receives a dollar sum and repayments will still be calculated in dollars but payment will be made in euros using the current exchange rate at time of repayment
the lender wants to lend dollars and receive repayments in dollars
so at the same time as disbursing the dollar sum to the borrower the lender enters into a non deliverable forward agreement with a counterparty for example on the chicago market that matches the cash flows from the foreign currency repayments
effectively the borrower has a synthetic euro loan the lender has a synthetic dollar loan and the counterparty has an ndf contract with the lender
under certain circumstances the rates achievable using synthetic foreign currency lending may be lower than borrowing in the foreign currency directly implying that there is a possibility for arbitrage
although this is theoretically identical to a second currency loan with settlement in dollars the borrower may face basis risk the possibility that a difference arises between the swap market s exchange rate and the exchange rate on the home market
the lender also bears counterparty risk
the borrower could in theory enter into ndf contracts directly and borrow in dollars separately and achieve the same result
ndf counterparties however may prefer to work with a limited range of entities such as those with a minimum credit rating
it is estimated that between and per cent of ndf trading is speculative
the main difference between the outright forward deals and the non deliverable forwards is that the settlement is made in dollars since the dealer or counterparty can not settle in the alternative currency of the deal
