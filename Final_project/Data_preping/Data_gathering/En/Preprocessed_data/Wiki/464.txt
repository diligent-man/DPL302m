disney is the only major film studio out of the big five that does not currently offer regular tours of their studio lot to the general public
since the mid s adventures by disney has offered tours of the studio but only as an integral component of their southern california tour package

prior to the official opening of the burbank lot in the walt disney studios was situated at several different locations in los angeles
during summer walt disney created the disney bros
cartoon studio in his uncle robert disney s garage which was located at kingswell avenue in the los feliz neighborhood of los angeles just east of hollywood
this garage has been on display at the stanley ranch museum in garden grove since the s several blocks away from disneyland
his brother roy o
disney was also in los angeles at the time
in october the brothers leased office space on the rear side of a real estate agency s office at kingswell avenue
on october walt disney accepted an offer from margaret winkler of universal studios to distribute the new alice comedies starring virginia davis
it was also at this site where on january walt disney met his future wife lillian bounds an ink and paint girl whom he personally hired
in february the studio moved next door to an office of its own at kingswell avenue
the late robert disney s residence and the small office building that is home to and kingswell avenue have survived to the present and are still in use
in walt disney placed a deposit on a new considerably larger lot at hyperion avenue and the studio moved there in january
it was here where after a train journey with his wife lillian walt created the character of mickey mouse in
here too the first three strip technicolor animated film the silly symphony flowers and trees and the first animated cartoon using disney s multiplane camera the old mill were created
in the hyperion studio produced disney s first full length animated feature film snow white and the seven dwarfs
disney s staff began to grow to a substantial size at the hyperion studio and disney legends such as disney s nine old men began their careers there
the hyperion studio site was sold in and divided between two different industrial manufacturers and in a subsequent owner demolished what was left of the studio complex and replaced it with the supermarket and shopping center that stand there today
to honor the company s former headquarters from to the name hyperion has been reused over the years by the walt disney company for multiple divisions and attractions including hyperion books and the hyperion theater at disney california adventure park
the current walt disney studios located at south buena vista street burbank was made possible by the revenue from the release of snow white and the seven dwarfs
walt disney and his staff began the move from the old studio at hyperion avenue in silver lake from december to january
designed primarily by kem weber under the supervision of walt disney and his brother roy the burbank disney studio buildings are the only studios that have been owned by the walt disney company to survive from the golden age of filming
a bungalow the shorts building and other small buildings that were located at the hyperion avenue location were moved to burbank
disney purposely planned his new burbank studio around the animation process
the large animation building stood in the center of the campus while adjacent outlying buildings were constructed for the ink and paint departments the camera and editing departments and the other various functions of the studio
tunnels linked some of the buildings to allow movement of animation materials without exposing them to the outside elements and the lot also included a movie theatre a sound stage and a commissary
the disney feature the reluctant dragon which combined live action with animated sequences and starred robert benchley served as a tour of the then new studio
it was later frequently seen and toured on various disney television programs
the attack on pearl harbor by imperial japan on december brought america into world war ii
united states army soldiers of the st anti aircraft artillery aaa gun battalion occupied walt disney studios the day after the attack for eight months in the period of the west coast invasion scare earning disney as the only hollywood studio to come under military occupation in history
during the war disney regularly produced propaganda and training films for the u s
government including its armed forces to increase morale among americans that the fight against the axis powers was waged for a just cause
in the years after the war the studio began regular work on live action features as they needed the money
though their first films were shot in england the necessity to build live action facilities still arose
lacking the capital to do it themselves jack webb offered to put up some of the money to build live action soundstages in exchange for the right to use them webb used them to shoot much of the dragnet tv series
during this time backlots for exterior shots were also built and remained standing at the studios until after a major change in management in
in after the corporate restructuring of walt disney productions into the walt disney company the studio lot was remodeled to accommodate more live action production space and administrative offices
the studio lot is now home to multiple offices and administration buildings and seven soundstages
it is bounded by south buena vista street on the west west alameda street on the north south keystone street on the east and west riverside drive on the south
it sits in an area of burbank where the street grid is offset at a diagonal but most of the original buildings and roads within the campus itself were laid out in alignment with the cardinal directions

the team disney structure is sometimes called the seven dwarfs building
it has large sculpted caryatids of the seven dwarfs holding up the roof of the eastern fa ade an homage to the animated film snow white and the seven dwarfs which provided walt disney with the revenue to purchase the burbank lot
each statue is feet meters tall with the exception of the sized dopey at top
the building is located opposite the frank g

in the building was featured in hollywood pictures film spy hard
on january in honor of michael eisner s year leadership of the company the team disney building was rededicated as team disney the michael d
eisner building
disney legends plaza located between the team disney the michael d
eisner building and the frank g
wells building is the central hub for the disney legends award and pays homage to its recipients
dedicated on october the plaza features the partners statue of walt disney and mickey mouse designed by imagineer blaine gibson along with a replica statue of roy o
disney and minnie mouse which can also be found at the magic kingdom park
located on the pillars in the plaza are bronze plaques featuring receivers of the disney legends award
the plaques feature the recipient s name reason for gaining the award and the person s handprints and signature if they were alive at the time they received the award
most famously legendary animator and imagineer ward kimball s plaque features an extra finger a reminder of kimball s sense of humor
if however the award was presented posthumously an image of the disney legends statue is engraved instead of the traditional handprints and signature
the plaza formerly featured a small fountain to honor the legends but that was since removed due to water leakage
this building is dedicated to the former president of the walt disney company from to frank g
wells
the building opened in and was dedicated by wells s widow luanne wells and company ceo michael eisner
the five story building has a usable area of square feet m with three underground parking levels accommodating parking spaces
the construction was completed in two phases phase i in august and phase ii in july
the frank g
wells building was specifically designed for walt disney television animation and the division formerly had offices located on the third floor
the division has since moved to the grand central creative campus in nearby glendale california
it is distinctly recognizable through its giant movie reel and film strip on the building s exterior
the building is currently home to the walt disney archives studio mail center marvel studios the disney music group a screening room various multipurpose rooms and one of the three extant multiplane cameras which is on display in the lobby
it was formerly home to walt disney television various management offices and the human resources department
the archives are located on the ground floor and are open to all cast members they also have additional storage and restricted areas on other floors
the studio s starbucks coffee shop is also located on the ground floor
the three story former main building for walt disney animation studios was completed in based on a streamline moderne design by industrial designer and architect kem weber
it is considered the jewel of the original studio buildings
walt disney personally supervised the eight wing double h design ensuring as many rooms as possible had windows which allowed natural light into the building to help the animators while working
many disney animated features were drawn here including dumbo bambi cinderella alice in wonderland peter pan lady and the tramp sleeping beauty one hundred and one dalmatians the jungle book the aristocats the rescuers and the fox and the hound
the animation for the black cauldron was the last to be completed at the site
the animation building initially served as the creative and administrative nucleus for the entire studio
walt s brother roy o
disney who ran the company s financial operations shared a wing with the accounting and legal departments on the first floor which was where the animators in betweeners and clean up artists worked
the d wing s ground floor was the longtime domain of disney s nine old men and over the years other prominent animators and artists such as bill tytla fred moore norm ferguson preston blair eyvind earle tyrus wong mary blair andreas deja floyd norman john lasseter glen keane john musker and ron clements worked in the building
on the second floor were office suites for the directors and studios for the background and layout artists
the story department was located on the third floor along with offices and a rehearsal room for disney s composers and arrangers
suite h on the third floor of the animation building s h wing was walt s headquarters
the five room space included his two adjacent offices a formal corner office for signing contracts and meeting with important visitors and a working office where he huddled with key staff to develop ideas for his films television shows and theme parks
the latter had a kitchenette hidden behind wood paneling that retracted at the touch of a button as walt often ate lunch at his desk
also in the suite was his secretary s office featuring displays of his numerous awards and a lounge area where walt would relax after pm with a drink scotch mist was his cocktail of choice and a back massage from the studio nurse before going home
walt s suite was closed after his death in and not reused until after his personal items had been carefully archived
over the years these items were used in museum exhibits recreating his offices primarily at disney resorts
in under the auspices of the walt disney archives suite h was restored as closely as possible to the condition in which walt left it with many of the original furnishings and objects
walt disney company ceo bob iger dedicated the restoration on december of that year
in it was opened for viewing by studio employees special guests and gold members of the disney fan club d
a little known feature of the animation building was its private rooftop annex the penthouse club a perk for male employees who could afford its membership fees
it had a gymnasium run by a full time athletic instructor a bar a barber shop steam baths massage tables pool and poker tables and an outdoor patio which members tended to use for nude sunbathing
the entrance displayed a mural painted by animator fred moore depicting a bevy of nude or semi nude women surrounding a drunken single man bearing a certain resemblance to moore himself
by the early s the gym activities had ceased and it became a casual lounge for studio veterans
the penthouse space has been shuttered for years and the fred moore mural removed to an unknown location
the basement housed the test camera department which shot test loops of animation drawings in progress
animators and directors would view these loops on moviola machines to check the work before submitting it to ink and paint
a utility tunnel linked the animation building with the neighboring ink and paint building and the camera and cutting departments
it was built to ensure that the original animation drawings and painted cels could be safely transported from one location to another without being exposed to bad weather or other outside elements
the tunnel is still maintained and a length of it is open to d tours
a popular point of interest for studio visitors is pluto s corner outside the animation building s a wing at the southwestern end of the block
there one can see three paw prints embedded in the street curbside beneath a fire hydrant
a hind paw print is missing humorously suggesting that pluto used the hydrant to mark his territory
nearby is the often photographed signpost indicating the site s location at the corner of mickey avenue and dopey drive with directions to various studio departments as they existed in walt s era
today only the street names remain the same
according to longtime disney archivist dave smith the street sign the only one of its kind on the disney lot was installed as a temporary prop for the studio tour segment of the disney feature the reluctant dragon and never removed
in during the production of the great mouse detective released in disney s animation department was moved off the burbank lot into a cluster of old hangars warehouses and trailers located about two miles east km in glendale at the former site of the grand central airport
prior to the opening of the team disney burbank building in disney executives used the animation building as corporate offices
in animation production moved back to burbank across the street from the main studios with the opening of the walt disney feature animation building
today the original animation building is used primarily to house offices for various film and television producers who have distribution deals with disney
its exterior was a primary location for the film saving mr
banks though the interiors including walt s offices were recreated at an outside studio
completed in at a cost of the water tower was one of the first structures to emerge at the new disney studio
it stands feet meters high and originally held gallons of water
towers such as these provided an emergency water supply in case of fire and were a standard feature of major hollywood studios of the era examples of which can still be seen at the warner bros paramount and sony pictures studios formerly mgm lots
roy disney however insisted that the disney studio s water tower be built with six legs instead of the usual four claiming it was more aesthetically pleasing
the tower is no longer used for water storage and stands as an identifying symbol of disney s burbank studio
in the top portion of the holding tank was painted white and for the first time emblazoned with the image of mickey mouse the official mascot of the walt disney company
it was the model for the earffel tower which stood at disney s hollywood studios theme park near orlando florida from to and the replica at walt disney studios park in disneyland paris to the present though the original has never been decorated with mickey mouse ears on top
the roy o
disney building is located next to the animation building and held the office of roy o
disney to whom the building is dedicated
the building used to be the main administration building on the studio lot prior to the opening of the team disney the michael d
eisner building
today it is home to disney s legal department
stage was completed between and and is the original disney soundstage on the burbank lot
the soundstage was designed to replace a smaller stage at the former hyperion avenue studio
although walt disney studios predominantly made animated films the soundstage was built in order to film leopold stokowski s segments in the film fantasia
during world war ii the stage was used for repairing army vehicles
the soundstage was formerly dedicated to fantasia for it being the first motion picture that was filmed in the building
the stage is the smallest on the lot at sq ft
it features a sq ft underwater tank and is still in active use
on june it was dedicated to mousketeer annette funicello as it was the original shooting stage for the mickey mouse club
constructed from and opening in april stage is the second oldest soundstage on the walt disney studios lot and at feet m one of the largest in los angeles
it was built and financed by a joint agreement between walt disney and director jack webb who used the stage for the filming of the television series dragnet
in october stage began production on the first series of the mickey mouse club
from to and prior to the opening of the facilities at glendale california wed enterprises now walt disney imagineering occupied soundstage to build multiple attractions for disneyland including the mark twain riverboat
since then stage has been used for the filming of multiple attractions for walt disney parks and resorts
during the filming of armageddon the filmmakers discovered the feet high tall stage was not tall enough to hold one of the asteroid seen in the film
the floor was removed and an additional feet was dug down to accommodate the degree set for the scene
in soundstage was dedicated to english actress julie andrews because parts of mary poppins and parts of the then current filming of the princess diaries took place inside this particular soundstage
stage was completed in and designed especially for the film leagues under the sea
the stage is sq ft and contains an operational sq ft water tank that is divided into two parts for underwater and special effects filming
the tank area was also used heavily beginning in the s as disney pioneered the use of the sodium screen process
in the s stage was equipped with the first computerized motion control system
the aces animated camera effects system was designed by disney engineers and broke new ground with technology which has become one of the foundations of current special effects photography
stage which was completed in was first used for darby o gill and the little people
upon completing years of service in stage was divided into two new television studios creating the new stage and stage
stage is known as the home improvement stage as that series was filmed here from to
stage is currently inhabited by black ish
stages and built in are the newest soundstages at the walt disney studios
these audience rated stages provide comprehensive production support with computer controlled access high volume air conditioning and adjoining production support building
they are built on the former back lot and are located behind the frank g
wells building
both stages are square feet m each and are in frequent use at the studios
popular productions here have included my wife and kids the muppets simple rules for dating my teenage daughter the geena davis show and brothers and sisters
the bungalow was built in as the original home of the disney publicity and comic strip departments
it was constructed at the disney studios on hyperion avenue in hollywood and moved to the burbank location as part of the construction process in
at the disney burbank lot the building housed many support services over the years
payroll publicity support traffic and finally the post office were located in the building
the structure is the last remaining example of the california bungalow type architecture that remains from the hyperion studio facility
its attractive style and utility dating back to the early years of the company give it a special place in the history of the disney lot
the seat theater another original building on the burbank lot shows first run disney films for studio employees and guests
it has plush stadium seating and has been upgraded over the years to keep pace with new technology in the exhibition of films
food and drink are not allowed inside
throughout its history the theater has also been used for post production sound mixing
according to the disney production services website the main theater is a state of the art digital sound dubbing and screening facility that was first used to mix the sound for fantasia in
sound mixers blend dialogue music and sound effects tracks to the various levels appropriate for a movie theater
the acoustics are designed to simulate a theater that is three quarters full
although the theater is empty during the mixing session extra padding in the seats and specially designed walls absorb and reflect the sound
this helps the sound mixers to know what the final product will sound like when it is released to the public
the signage above the entrance says simply theatre
the name main theater is used to distinguish the venue from several smaller screening rooms situated throughout the studio
in walt s era these were called sweatboxes where animation test reels and the daily rushes of his live action features were shown for his approval
the ink and paint building was where animators drawings were inked onto transparent cels and then the cels were painted
it was built with high ceilings and a sophisticated central ventilation system so that the staff members would not be overcome by toxic paint fumes
one section was used as a special paint mixing laboratory to provide disney cartoons with the widest possible spectrum of colors
three interior courtyards provided northern light for the artists and also served as outdoor break areas
it was a self contained structure with its own cafeteria lounge and rooftop sundeck
the sequestered layout reflected workplace attitudes of the era
as was common in the american animation industry of disney s day the ink and paint departments were staffed exclusively by women
in the early s disney employed over ink and paint girls at a starting salary of a week as opposed to a week for experienced animators
a disney employment brochure of the time stated women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen as that work is performed entirely by young men the only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear celluloid sheets with india ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side with paint according to directions men and women at the disney studio were not encouraged to fraternize and the cloistered atmosphere of the ink and paint building led wags on the lot to call it the nunnery
the basement of the ink and paint building was the location of disney s famous morgue where artwork from the studio s films was stored for possible future use
in a episode of his disneyland tv series walt took viewers into the morgue and after some ghoulish fun on the room s name explained its real function
in this archival material was moved to its current location at the disney animation research library in glendale california
technological advances in animation such as the advent of xerography in the early s and the development of caps in the late s ultimately made traditional ink and paint techniques obsolete at the disney studio
the last disney animated feature to employ inked and painted cels was the little mermaid
today the ink and paint building is primarily used for office space though its original paint mixing lab has been preserved and is used for the creation of limited edition disney artwork created on site
the camera building built in was where animation backgrounds and cels were traditionally photographed onto film
unique original features were the de dusting chambers that personnel painted cels and other materials had to pass through before entering so no trace of dust or lint would show up in the photography
in it housed two multiplane cameras each standing feet meters high and occupying its own room and two conventional camera set ups
a third multiplane camera was subsequently constructed
since the camera building has been occupied by what is now buena vista imaging which provides photo optical and digital imaging services for films and television
another original site on the burbank lot it is the longtime home of disney s editing facilities
the building s name derives from the traditional method of physically cutting and splicing films shot on nitrate and after safety stock
today it employs video editing techniques
the two story shorts building is one of the most significant remnants of disney s former hyperion studio
it originally consisted of two buildings constructed in and to accommodate the company s rapidly expanding animation department
the structure was called the animation building no
and walt and roy disney had their offices there prior to the move to burbank
the animation for scores of disney shorts of the s including the band concert and the oscar winning the old mill was created in this complex and it was here that walt hatched his risky idea for america s first full length animated feature snow white and the seven dwarfs
in the two buildings were disassembled transported to disney s new burbank lot and reconstructed as a single t shaped edifice with the addition of a loading dock
the window of walt s old second floor office can be seen directly above the dock
the colloquial name shorts building was apparently a nod to its historical past as no further animation would be done on the premises
since its relocation the building has served the studio in support capacities housing the publicity comic strip foreign relations hair and makeup and wardrobe fitting departments
the lot s studio operations department is now located here
formerly known as the walt disney feature animation building the roy e
disney building is the current home of walt disney animation studios which sits to the south across riverside drive
it was designed by the firm robert a m
stern architects
construction was completed in
as noted above in disney animation was moved out of the studio lot and into a cluster of old buildings in glendale
during michael eisner s restructuring of the walt disney company the studio s animation division was spun off to officially create walt disney feature animation as a separate subsidiary of the company and in it came back to burbank when its new home opened
the new studio is a colorful architectural landmark adorned by a foot tall version of the fantasia sorcerer s hat which once housed the office of roy disney former head of walt disney animation studios
it also displays the word animation on giant letters on its south side to passersby on the ventura freeway
in following the death of roy disney the building was renamed and rededicated in his honor by disney president and ceo bob iger
after disney s purchase of abc in a new headquarters for the television network was constructed across riverside drive next to the walt disney feature animation building
the abc building was designed by aldo rossi and is connected to the lot by a blue serpentine bridge that crosses over riverside drive
the abc building also houses the offices of other subsidiaries such as abc signature and walt disney studios motion pictures
a two story square foot facility dedicated to post production utilities and other similar technical services
opened in december the center is the home of disney digital studio services
this private cafeteria and grill opened in as walt disney s studio restaurant and is now named the buena vista caf
along with stage the cutting building and the main theater it is one of the few original buildings on the burbank lot still serving its initial purpose
the commissary offers breakfast and lunch options for studio employees and guests with indoor and outdoor seating
it once had an executive dining area called the coral room where walt disney occasionally lunched
the site was extensively remodeled in but walt s favorite dish chili served with crackers remains on the menu
buena vista caf is currently open monday through friday from am to pm
the grill shuts down at pm pre packaged foods snacks and beverages can be purchased until closing time
there is a newer commissary at the abc studios building across from the main disney lot on riverside drive in burbank
