Batura Sar Urdu بتورا سر also referred to as Batura I is the th highest mountain on Earth and the th highest in Pakistan It is the highest peak of the Batura Muztagh which is the westernmost subrange of the Karakoram range It forms the apex of the Batura Wall a continuously high part of the backbone of the Batura Muztagh
Alternate forms of the name of this peak are Batura Batura I and Batura I East
Batura Sar and the Batura Wall lie near the middle of the Batura Muztagh between Bar valley Nagar and Gojal Hunza which is the only part of the Karakoram which is west of the Hunza Nagar River The river curves around the southwest west and northwest sides of the Batura Muztagh Batura wall bisects Gojal hunza and Bar Valley NagarIn turn the Upper HunzaGojal Valley lies in the Hunza District of the Gilgit Baltistan
In addition to being one of the highest mountains in the world Batura Sar is also the second most prominent peak in the Karakoram range Since it lies at the northwest end of the Karakoram there is no higher peak north or west of it in the world
The Batura Wall is notable for being a long approximately km and imposing ridge over m Batura is a very ridgelike peak not a pointed spire
Although it is just slightly higher according to the usual figures than nearby Rakaposhi it is not nearly as famous since it is set back much further from the Hunza Valley
Climbing began in the Batura Muztagh later than in other parts of the Karakoram and despite Batura Sar's height it has seen little climbing activity
A climber named Matthias Rebitsch is recorded by Neate as having been in the icefall area this is presumably the Batura First Ice Flow on the north side of the peak in The peak was attempted in by three British and two German climbers but they all died probably in an avalanche Some of the climbers may have gotten near the summit
The first ascent of the peak was in by the Göppingen Karakoram Himalaya Expedition led by Dr Alexander Schlee They placed their base camp on the Baltar Glacier below the South Face of the peak on May Hubert Bleicher and Herbert Oberhofer reached the summit on June
The first ascent route climbed first from the Eastern Baltar Glacier up and over Batokshi Peak called Saddle Peak by the first expedition to Batokshi Pass called the Batura Saddle It then climbed diagonally up and northeast to East Ridge and thence to the summit The route used five camps above base camp
The second ascent of the peak was in by an Austrian group who climbed a new route to the left of the first ascent route
The Himalayan Index lists an ascent in but this is contradicted by Neate's book so the status of this is unclear
The year saw the third or fourth ascent of Batura Sar by another Polish German expedition led by Piotr Młotecki They used the first ascent route however they failed in an additional goal of reaching Batura I West
The Himalayan Index lists five other failed attempts on the peak these include a winter attempt by an Austrian group in However there seems to have been little or no activity on the north side of the mountain since the s
The first ascent route is outlined above The first ascent party reported ice up to degrees
but they do not record the use of any extensive fixed ropes They noted the weather and repeated storms as the primary difficulty
