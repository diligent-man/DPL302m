faced with growing separatism gorbachev sought to restructure the soviet union into a less centralized state
on august the russian sfsr was scheduled to sign a new union treaty that would have converted the soviet union into a federation of independent republics with a common president foreign policy and military
it was strongly supported by the central asian republics which needed the economic advantages of a common market to prosper
however it would have meant some degree of continued communist party control over economic and social life
more radical reformists were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required even if the eventual outcome meant the disintegration of the soviet union into several independent states
independence also accorded with yeltsin s desires as president of the rsfsr as well as those of regional and local authorities to get rid of moscow s pervasive control
in contrast to the reformers lukewarm response to the treaty the conservatives patriots and russian nationalists of the ussr still strong within the cpsu and the military were opposed to weakening the soviet state and its centralized power structure
on august gorbachev s vice president gennady yanayev prime minister valentin pavlov defense minister dmitry yazov kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov and other senior officials acted to prevent the union treaty from being signed by forming the general committee on the state emergency which put gorbachev on holiday in foros crimea under house arrest and cut off his communications
the coup leaders issued an emergency decree suspending political activity and banning most newspapers
thousands of muscovites came out to defend the white house the russian federation s parliament and yeltsin s office the symbolic seat of russian sovereignty at the time
the organizers of the coup tried but ultimately failed to arrest yeltsin who rallied opposition to the coup by making speeches from atop a tank
the special forces dispatched by the coup leaders took up positions near the white house but members refused to storm the barricaded building
the coup leaders also neglected to jam foreign news broadcasts so many muscovites watched it unfold live on cnn
even the isolated gorbachev was able to stay abreast of developments by tuning into the bbc world service on a small transistor radio
after three days on august the coup collapsed
the organizers were detained and gorbachev was reinstated as president albeit with his power much depleted
on august gorbachev resigned as the general secretary the central committee of the communist party of the soviet union and dissolved all party units in the government
on the same day the supreme soviet of the ukrainian ssr passed a declaration of independence of ukraine calling for a national referendum on the independence of ukraine from the soviet union
five days later the supreme soviet of the soviet union indefinitely suspended all cpsu activity on soviet territory effectively ending communist rule in the soviet union and dissolving the only remaining unifying force in the country
gorbachev established a state council of the soviet union on september designed to bring him and the highest officials of the remaining republics into a collective leadership able to appoint a premier of the soviet union it never functioned properly though ivan silayev de facto took the post through the committee on the operational management of the soviet economy and the inter republican economic committee and tried to form a government though with rapidly shrinking powers
the soviet union collapsed with dramatic speed in the last quarter of
ukraine was the first of republics to secede from the union between august and december largely out of fear of another coup
by the end of september gorbachev no longer had the ability to influence events outside of moscow
he was challenged even there by yeltsin who had begun taking over what remained of the soviet government including the kremlin
on september general assembly resolution numbers and admitted estonia latvia and lithuania to the united nations conforming to security council resolution numbers and passed on september without a vote
on november yeltsin who had by then taken over much of the soviet government issued a decree banning all communist party activities on russian territory
by november most newspapers referred to the country as the former soviet union
the final round of the soviet union s collapse began on december
that day a ukrainian popular referendum resulted in percent of ukraine s voters voting to affirm the independence declaration passed in august and formally secede from the union
the secession of ukraine long second only to russia in economic and political power ended any realistic chance of gorbachev keeping the soviet union together even on a limited scale
the leaders of the three slavic republics russia ukraine and belarus formerly byelorussia agreed to discuss possible alternatives to the union
on december the leaders of russia ukraine and belarus secretly met in belavezhskaya pushcha in western belarus and signed the belavezha accords which proclaimed the soviet union had ceased to exist and announced formation of the commonwealth of independent states cis as a looser association to take its place
they also invited other republics to join the cis
gorbachev called it an unconstitutional coup
however by this time there was no longer any reasonable doubt that as the preamble of the accords put it the ussr as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality is ceasing its existence
on december the agreement was ratified by the verkhovna rada of ukraine and the supreme council of belarus
on december the supreme soviet of the russian sfsr formally ratified the belavezha accords denounced the union treaty and recalled the russian deputies from the supreme soviet of the ussr
the legality of this ratification raised doubts among some members of the russian parliament since according to the constitution of the rsfsr of consideration of this document was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the congress of people s deputies of the rsfsr
however no one in either russia or the kremlin objected
any objections from the latter would have likely had no effect since the soviet government had effectively been rendered impotent long before december
a number of lawyers believe that the denunciation of the union treaty was meaningless since it became invalid in with the adoption of the first constitution of the ussr
in the state duma had voiced the same position later that day gorbachev hinted for the first time that he was considering stepping down
on the surface it appeared that the largest republic had formally seceded
however this is not the case as russia apparently took the line that it was not possible to secede from a country that no longer existed
on december along with european countries the european economic community and four non european countries the three baltic republics and nine of the twelve remaining soviet republics signed the european energy charter in the hague as sovereign states
on the same day members of the lower house of the union parliament council of the union held a meeting of people s deputies of the soviet union
the meeting adopted a statement in connection with the signing of the belovezhskaya agreement and its ratification by the parliaments of russia belarus and ukraine in which it noted that it considers the decisions made on the liquidation of state power and administration bodies illegal and not meeting the current situation and the vital interests of the peoples and stated that in the event further complication of the situation in the country reserves the right to convene in the future the congress of people s deputies of the ussr
on december the upper chamber of the supreme soviet of the ussr council of republics adopted a statement according to which it accepts with understanding the agreement on the creation of the commonwealth of independent states and considers it a real guarantee of a way out of the acute political and economic crisis
doubts remained over whether the belavezha accords had legally dissolved the soviet union since they were signed by only three republics
however on december representatives of of the remaining republics all except estonia georgia latvia and lithuania signed the alma ata protocol which confirmed the dissolution of the union and formally established the cis
they also accepted gorbachev s resignation
the command of the armed forces of the ussr was entrusted to the minister of defense yevgeny shaposhnikov
even at this moment gorbachev hadn t made any formal plans to leave the scene yet
however with a majority of republics now agreeing that the soviet union no longer existed gorbachev bowed to the inevitable telling cbs news that he would resign as soon as he saw that the cis was indeed a reality
in a nationally televised speech in the evening of december gorbachev resigned as president of the soviet union or as he put it i hereby discontinue my activities at the post of president of the ussr he declared the office extinct and all of its powers such as control of the nuclear arsenal were ceded to yeltsin
a week earlier gorbachev had met with yeltsin and accepted the fait accompli of the soviet union s dissolution
on the same day the supreme soviet of the russian sfsr adopted a statute to change russia s legal name from russian soviet federative socialist republic to russian federation showing that it was now a fully sovereign non communist state
on the night of december at p m
moscow time after gorbachev appeared on television the soviet flag was lowered and the state anthem of the soviet union was played for the last time and the russian tricolor was raised in its place at pm symbolically marking the end of the soviet union
in his parting words gorbachev defended his record on domestic reform and d tente but conceded the old system collapsed before a new one had time to start working on that same day the president of the united states george h
bush held a brief televised speech officially recognizing the independence of the remaining republics
on december the soviet of republics the upper chamber of the supreme soviet of the soviet union voted the soviet union out of existence the lower chamber the soviet of the union had been unable to work since december when the recall of the russian deputies left it without a quorum
the following day yeltsin moved into gorbachev s former office though the russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier
the soviet armed forces were placed under the command of the commonwealth of independent states but were eventually subsumed by the newly independent republics with the bulk becoming the armed forces of the russian federation
by the end of the few remaining soviet institutions that had not been taken over by russia ceased operation and individual republics assumed the central government s role
the alma ata protocol also addressed other issues including un membership
notably russia was authorized to assume the soviet union s un membership including its permanent seat on the security council
the soviet ambassador to the un delivered a letter signed by russian president yeltsin to the un secretary general dated december informing him that by virtue of the alma ata protocol russia was the successor state to the ussr
after being circulated among the other un member states with no objection raised the statement was declared accepted on the last day of the year december
in april the congress of people s deputies of russia refused to ratify the belovezhskaya agreements and to exclude references to the constitution and laws of the ussr from the text of the constitution of the rsfsr
according to some russian politicians this was one of the reasons for the political crisis of september october
in a referendum on december a new russian constitution was adopted in which there was no mention of the union state
according to the scholar marcel h
van herpen the end of the soviet union also marked the end of russian colonialism and imperialism
however russia invaded georgia in ukraine in and ukraine again in
the breakup of the soviet union saw a massive impact in the sporting world
before its dissolution the soviet football team had just qualified for euro but its place was instead taken by the cis national football team
after the tournament the former soviet republics competed as separate independent nations with fifa allocating the soviet team s record to russia
before the start of the winter olympics in albertville and the summer olympics in barcelona the olympic committee of the soviet union formally existed until march when it disbanded but it was succeeded by the russian olympic committee
however of the former soviet republics competed together as the unified team and marched under the olympic flag in barcelona where they finished first in the medal rankings
separately lithuania latvia and estonia also competed as independent nations in the games
the unified team also competed in albertville earlier in the year represented by six of the twelve ex republics and finished second in the medal ranking at those games
afterwards the individual nocs of the non baltic former republics were established
some nocs made their debuts at the winter olympic games in lillehammer and others did so at the summer olympic games in atlanta
members of the unified team at the summer olympics in barcelona consisted of armenia azerbaijan belarus georgia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan moldova russia tajikistan turkmenistan ukraine and uzbekistan
at those summer games the unified team secured gold medals silver medals and bronze medals four medals more than second place united states and more than third place germany
in addition to great team success the unified team also saw great personal success
vitaly scherbo of belarus secured six gold medals for the team in gymnastics and also became the most decorated athlete of the summer games
gymnastics athletics wrestling and swimming were the strongest sports for the team as the four combined earned gold medals and medals in total
only six of the countries competed earlier at the winter olympics in albertville armenia belarus kazakhstan russia ukraine and uzbekistan
the unified team placed second three fewer medals than germany
however much like the summer games the unified team had the most decorated medalist in the winter games as well with lyubov yegorova of russia a cross country skier winning five total medals
the soviet union s calling code of is still used by russia and kazakhstan
between and many newly independent republics implemented their own numbering plans such as belarus and ukraine
the internet domain su remains in use alongside the internet domains of the newly created countries

in according to gallup of ukrainians said that the dissolution of the soviet union did more harm than good with only saying it did more good than harm
however a similar poll conducted in by a ukrainian group showed only ukrainians regretting the soviet collapse and not regretting it
the breakdown of economic ties that followed the soviet collapse led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standard of living in post soviet states and the former eastern bloc which was even worse than the great depression
poverty and economic inequality surged between and and between and with the gini ratio increasing by an average of points for all former socialist countries

july georgiahistoriography on the soviet collapse can be roughly classified in two groups intentionalist accounts and structuralist accounts
intentionalist accounts contend that soviet collapse was not inevitable and resulted from the policies and decisions of specific individuals usually gorbachev and yeltsin
one characteristic example of intentionalist writing is the historian archie brown s the gorbachev factor which argues gorbachev was the main force in soviet politics at least from to and even later and that he largely spearheaded the political reforms and developments as opposed to being led by events
that was especially true of the policies of perestroika and glasnost market initiatives and foreign policy stance as the political scientist george breslauer has seconded by labelling gorbachev a man of the events
in a slightly different vein david kotz and fred weir have contended that soviet elites were responsible for spurring on both nationalism and capitalism from which they could personally benefit which is demonstrated also by their continued presence in the higher economic and political echelons of post soviet republics
in contrast structuralist accounts take a more deterministic view in which soviet dissolution was an outcome of deeply rooted structural issues which planted a time bomb
for example edward walker has argued that minority nationalities were denied power at the union level confronted by a culturally destabilizing form of economic modernization and subjected to a certain amount of russification but they were at the same time strengthened by several policies pursued by the soviet government indigenization of leadership support for local languages etc
over time they created conscious nations
furthermore the basic legitimating myth of the soviet federative system that it was a voluntary and mutual union of allied peoples eased the task of secession and independence
on january russian president vladimir putin supported that view by calling lenin s support of the right of secession for the soviet republics a delayed action bomb
an opinion piece by gorbachev in april stated the nuclear meltdown at chernobyl years ago this month even more than my launch of perestroika was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the soviet union
the end of the soviet union caught many people by surprise
before many thought that soviet collapse was impossible or unlikely
