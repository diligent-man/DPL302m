Faced with growing separatism Gorbachev sought to restructure the Soviet Union into a less centralized state On August the Russian SFSR was scheduled to sign a New Union Treaty that would have converted the Soviet Union into a federation of independent republics with a common president foreign policy and military It was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics which needed the economic advantages of a common market to prosper However it would have meant some degree of continued Communist Party control over economic and social life
More radical reformists were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required even if the eventual outcome meant the disintegration of the Soviet Union into several independent states Independence also accorded with Yeltsin's desires as president of the RSFSR as well as those of regional and local authorities to get rid of Moscow's pervasive control In contrast to the reformers' lukewarm response to the treaty the conservatives patriots and Russian nationalists of the USSR still strong within the CPSU and the military were opposed to weakening the Soviet state and its centralized power structure
On August Gorbachev's vice president Gennady Yanayev Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov and other senior officials acted to prevent the union treaty from being signed by forming the General Committee on the State Emergency which put Gorbachev on holiday in Foros Crimea under house arrest and cut off his communications The coup leaders issued an emergency decree suspending political activity and banning most newspapers
Thousands of Muscovites came out to defend the White House the Russian Federation's parliament and Yeltsin's office the symbolic seat of Russian sovereignty at the time The organizers of the coup tried but ultimately failed to arrest Yeltsin who rallied opposition to the coup by making speeches from atop a tank The special forces dispatched by the coup leaders took up positions near the White House but members refused to storm the barricaded building The coup leaders also neglected to jam foreign news broadcasts so many Muscovites watched it unfold live on CNN Even the isolated Gorbachev was able to stay abreast of developments by tuning into the BBC World Service on a small transistor radio
After three days on August the coup collapsed The organizers were detained and Gorbachev was reinstated as president albeit with his power much depleted
On August Gorbachev resigned as the general secretary the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and dissolved all party units in the government On the same day the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR passed a Declaration of Independence of Ukraine calling for a national referendum on the independence of Ukraine from the Soviet Union Five days later the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union indefinitely suspended all CPSU activity on Soviet territory effectively ending Communist rule in the Soviet Union and dissolving the only remaining unifying force in the country Gorbachev established a State Council of the Soviet Union on September designed to bring him and the highest officials of the remaining republics into a collective leadership able to appoint a premier of the Soviet Union it never functioned properly though Ivan Silayev de facto took the post through the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy and the Inter Republican Economic Committee and tried to form a government though with rapidly shrinking powers
The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed in the last quarter of Ukraine was the first of republics to secede from the Union between August and December largely out of fear of another coup By the end of September Gorbachev no longer had the ability to influence events outside of Moscow He was challenged even there by Yeltsin who had begun taking over what remained of the Soviet government including the Kremlin

The final round of the Soviet Union's collapse began on December That day a Ukrainian popular referendum resulted in percent of Ukraine's voters voting to affirm the independence declaration passed in August and formally secede from the Union The secession of Ukraine long second only to Russia in economic and political power ended any realistic chance of Gorbachev keeping the Soviet Union together even on a limited scale The leaders of the three Slavic republics Russia Ukraine and Belarus formerly Byelorussia agreed to discuss possible alternatives to the union

On December the agreement was ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the Supreme Council of Belarus
On December the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR formally ratified the Belavezha Accords denounced the Union Treaty and recalled the Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the USSR The legality of this ratification raised doubts among some members of the Russian parliament since according to the Constitution of the RSFSR of consideration of this document was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR However no one in either Russia or the Kremlin objected Any objections from the latter would have likely had no effect since the Soviet government had effectively been rendered impotent long before December A number of lawyers believe that the denunciation of the union treaty was meaningless since it became invalid in with the adoption of the first constitution of the USSR In the State Duma had voiced the same position Later that day Gorbachev hinted for the first time that he was considering stepping down On the surface it appeared that the largest republic had formally seceded However this is not the case as Russia apparently took the line that it was not possible to secede from a country that no longer existed
On December along with European countries the European Economic Community and four non European countries the three Baltic Republics and nine of the twelve remaining Soviet republics signed the European Energy Charter in the Hague as sovereign states On the same day members of the lower house of the union parliament Council of the Union held a meeting of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union The meeting adopted a statement in connection with the signing of the Belovezhskaya Agreement and its ratification by the parliaments of Russia Belarus and Ukraine in which it noted that it considers the decisions made on the liquidation of state power and administration bodies illegal and not meeting the current situation and the vital interests of the peoples and stated that in the event further complication of the situation in the country reserves the right to convene in the future the Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR
On December the upper chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Council of Republics adopted a statement according to which it accepts with understanding the Agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States and considers it a real guarantee of a way out of the acute political and economic crisis
Doubts remained over whether the Belavezha Accords had legally dissolved the Soviet Union since they were signed by only three republics However on December representatives of of the remaining republics all except Estonia Georgia Latvia and Lithuania signed the Alma Ata Protocol which confirmed the dissolution of the Union and formally established the CIS They also accepted Gorbachev's resignation The command of the Armed Forces of the USSR was entrusted to the Minister of Defense Yevgeny Shaposhnikov Even at this moment Gorbachev hadn't made any formal plans to leave the scene yet However with a majority of republics now agreeing that the Soviet Union no longer existed Gorbachev bowed to the inevitable telling CBS News that he would resign as soon as he saw that the CIS was indeed a reality
In a nationally televised speech in the evening of December Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union or as he put it I hereby discontinue my activities at the post of President of the USSR He declared the office extinct and all of its powers such as control of the nuclear arsenal were ceded to Yeltsin A week earlier Gorbachev had met with Yeltsin and accepted the fait accompli of the Soviet Union's dissolution On the same day the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR adopted a statute to change Russia's legal name from Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to Russian Federation showing that it was now a fully sovereign non communist state

On December the Soviet of Republics the upper chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union voted the Soviet Union out of existence the lower chamber the Soviet of the Union had been unable to work since December when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier The Soviet Armed Forces were placed under the command of the Commonwealth of Independent States but were eventually subsumed by the newly independent republics with the bulk becoming the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation By the end of the few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased operation and individual republics assumed the central government's role
The Alma Ata Protocol also addressed other issues including UN membership Notably Russia was authorized to assume the Soviet Union's UN membership including its permanent seat on the Security Council The Soviet Ambassador to the UN delivered a letter signed by Russian President Yeltsin to the UN Secretary General dated December informing him that by virtue of the Alma Ata Protocol Russia was the successor state to the USSR After being circulated among the other UN member states with no objection raised the statement was declared accepted on the last day of the year December
In April the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia refused to ratify the Belovezhskaya Agreements and to exclude references to the Constitution and laws of the USSR from the text of the Constitution of the RSFSR According to some Russian politicians this was one of the reasons for the political crisis of September October In a referendum on December a new Russian constitution was adopted in which there was no mention of the union state

The breakdown of economic ties that followed the Soviet collapse led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standard of living in post Soviet states and the former Eastern Bloc which was even worse than the Great Depression Poverty and economic inequality surged between and and between and with the Gini ratio increasing by an average of points for all former socialist countries Even before the Russian financial crisis the Russian GDP was half of what it had been in the early s
In the decades following the end of the Cold War only five or six of the post Soviet states are on a path to joining the wealthy capitalist states of the West and most are falling behind some to such an extent that over years will be needed before they catch up to how they were before the end of communism In a study by the economist Steven Rosefielde he calculated that there were million premature deaths in Russia from to which he partly blames on the shock therapy that came with the Washington Consensus

March Armenia Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Moldova Tajikistan Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
July GeorgiaHistoriography on the Soviet collapse can be roughly classified in two groups intentionalist accounts and structuralist accounts
Intentionalist accounts contend that Soviet collapse was not inevitable and resulted from the policies and decisions of specific individuals usually Gorbachev and Yeltsin One characteristic example of intentionalist writing is the historian Archie Brown's The Gorbachev Factor which argues Gorbachev was the main force in Soviet politics at least from to and even later and that he largely spearheaded the political reforms and developments as opposed to being led by events That was especially true of the policies of perestroika and glasnost market initiatives and foreign policy stance as the political scientist George Breslauer has seconded by labelling Gorbachev a man of the events In a slightly different vein David Kotz and Fred Weir have contended that Soviet elites were responsible for spurring on both nationalism and capitalism from which they could personally benefit which is demonstrated also by their continued presence in the higher economic and political echelons of post Soviet republics
In contrast structuralist accounts take a more deterministic view in which Soviet dissolution was an outcome of deeply rooted structural issues which planted a time bomb For example Edward Walker has argued that minority nationalities were denied power at the Union level confronted by a culturally destabilizing form of economic modernization and subjected to a certain amount of Russification but they were at the same time strengthened by several policies pursued by the Soviet government indigenization of leadership support for local languages etc Over time they created conscious nations Furthermore the basic legitimating myth of the Soviet federative system that it was a voluntary and mutual union of allied peoples eased the task of secession and independence On January Russian President Vladimir Putin supported that view by calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet republics a delayed action bomb
An opinion piece by Gorbachev in April stated The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl years ago this month even more than my launch of perestroika was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union
The end of the Soviet Union caught many people by surprise Before many thought that Soviet collapse was impossible or unlikely
Photographs of the fall of the USSR by photojournalist Alain Pierre Hovasse a first hand witness of these events
