the kingdom of france old french reaume de france middle french royaulme de france french royaume de france is the historiographical name or umbrella term given to various political entities of france in the medieval and early modern period
it was among the most powerful states in europe and a great power from the high middle ages onward
it was also an early colonial power with possessions around the world
france originated as west francia francia occidentalis the western half of the carolingian empire with the treaty of verdun
a branch of the carolingian dynasty continued to rule until when hugh capet was elected king and founded the capetian dynasty
the territory remained known as francia and its ruler as rex francorum king of the franks well into the high middle ages
the first king calling himself rex francie king of france was philip ii in and officially from
from then france was continuously ruled by the capetians and their cadet lines the valois and bourbon until the monarchy was abolished in during the french revolution
the kingdom of france was also ruled in personal union with the kingdom of navarre over two time periods and after which the institutions of navarre were abolished and it was fully annexed by france though the king of france continued to use the title king of navarre through the end of the monarchy
france in the middle ages was a de centralised feudal monarchy
in brittany and catalonia now a part of spain the authority of the french king was barely felt
lorraine and provence were states of the holy roman empire and not yet a part of france
initially west frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father s lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture which became codified in the salic law
during the late middle ages rivalry between the capetian dynasty rulers of the kingdom of france and their vassals the house of plantagenet who also ruled the kingdom of england as part of their so called competing angevin empire resulted in many armed struggles
the most notorious of them all are the series of conflicts known as the hundred years war in which the kings of england laid claim to the french throne
emerging victorious from said conflicts france subsequently sought to extend its influence into italy but was defeated by spain and the holy roman empire in the ensuing italian wars
france in the early modern era was increasingly centralised the french language began to displace other languages from official use and the monarch expanded his absolute power albeit in an administrative system the ancien r gime complicated by historic and regional irregularities in taxation legal judicial and ecclesiastic divisions and local prerogatives
religiously france became divided between the catholic majority and a protestant minority the huguenots which led to a series of civil wars the wars of religion
the wars of religion crippled france but triumph over spain and the habsburg monarchy in the thirty years war made france the most powerful nation on the continent once more
the kingdom became europe s dominant cultural political and military power in the th century under louis xiv
in parallel france developed its first colonial empire in asia africa and in the americas
from the th to the th centuries the first french colonial empire stretched from a total area at its peak in to over square kilometres sq mi the second largest empire in the world at the time behind only the spanish empire
colonial conflicts with great britain led to the loss of much of its north american holdings by
french intervention in the american revolutionary war helped secure the independence of the new united states of america but was costly and achieved little for france
the kingdom of france adopted a written constitution in but the kingdom was abolished a year later and replaced with the first french republic
the monarchy was restored by the other great powers in and lasted except for the hundred days in until the french revolution of
during the later years of the elderly charlemagne s rule the vikings made advances along the northern and western perimeters of the kingdom of the franks
after charlemagne s death in his heirs were incapable of maintaining political unity and the empire began to crumble
the treaty of verdun of divided the carolingian empire into three parts with charles the bald ruling over west francia the nucleus of what would develop into the kingdom of france
charles the bald was also crowned king of lotharingia after the death of lothair ii in but in the treaty of meerssen was forced to cede much of lotharingia to his brothers retaining the rhone and meuse basins including verdun vienne and besan on but leaving the rhineland with aachen metz and trier in east francia
viking incursions up the loire the seine and other inland waterways increased
during the reign of charles the simple normans under rollo from scandinavia settled along the seine downstream from paris in a region that came to be known as normandy
the carolingians were to share the fate of their predecessors after an intermittent power struggle between the two dynasties the accession in of hugh capet duke of france and count of paris established the capetian dynasty on the throne
with its offshoots the houses of valois and bourbon it was to rule france for more than years
the old order left the new dynasty in immediate control of little beyond the middle seine and adjacent territories while powerful territorial lords such as the th and th century counts of blois accumulated large domains of their own through marriage and through private arrangements with lesser nobles for protection and support
the area around the lower seine became a source of particular concern when duke william took possession of the kingdom of england by the norman conquest of making himself and his heirs the king s equal outside france where he was still nominally subject to the crown
henry ii inherited the duchy of normandy and the county of anjou and married france s newly single ex queen eleanor of aquitaine who ruled much of southwest france in
after defeating a revolt led by eleanor and three of their four sons henry had eleanor imprisoned made the duke of brittany his vassal and in effect ruled the western half of france as a greater power than the french throne
however disputes among henry s descendants over the division of his french territories coupled with john of england s lengthy quarrel with philip ii allowed philip ii to recover influence over most of this territory
after the french victory at the battle of bouvines in the english monarchs maintained power only in southwestern duchy of guyenne
the death of charles iv of france in without male heirs ended the main capetian line
under salic law the crown could not pass through a woman philip iv s daughter was isabella whose son was edward iii of england so the throne passed to philip vi son of charles of valois
this in addition to a long standing dispute over the rights to gascony in the south of france and the relationship between england and the flemish cloth towns led to the hundred years war of
the following century was to see devastating warfare peasant revolts the english peasants revolt of and the jacquerie of in france and the growth of nationalism in both countries
the losses of the century of war were enormous particularly owing to the plague the black death usually considered an outbreak of bubonic plague which arrived from italy in spreading rapidly up the rhone valley and thence across most of the country it is estimated that a population of some million in modern day france at the time of the hearth tax returns had been reduced years later by percent or more
the renaissance era was noted for the emergence of powerful centralized institutions as well as a flourishing culture much of it imported from italy
the kings built a strong fiscal system which heightened the power of the king to raise armies that overawed the local nobility
in paris especially there emerged strong traditions in literature art and music
the prevailing style was classical
the ordinance of villers cotter ts was signed into law by francis i in
largely the work of chancellor guillaume poyet it dealt with a number of government judicial and ecclesiastical matters
articles and the most famous called for the use of the french language in all legal acts notarised contracts and official legislation
after the hundred years war charles viii of france signed three additional treaties with henry vii of england maximilian i of habsburg and ferdinand ii of aragon respectively at taples senlis and in barcelona
these three treaties cleared the way for france to undertake the long italian wars which marked the beginning of early modern france
french efforts to gain dominance resulted only in the increased power of the habsburg house
barely were the italian wars over when france was plunged into a domestic crisis with far reaching consequences
despite the conclusion of a concordat between france and the papacy granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical appointments france was deeply affected by the protestant reformation s attempt to break the hegemony of catholic europe
a growing urban based protestant minority later dubbed huguenots faced ever harsher repression under the rule of francis i s son king henry ii
after henry ii s death in a joust the country was ruled by his widow catherine de medici and her sons francis ii charles ix and henry iii
renewed catholic reaction headed by the powerful dukes of guise culminated in a massacre of huguenots starting the first of the french wars of religion during which english german and spanish forces intervened on the side of rival protestant and catholic forces
opposed to absolute monarchy the huguenot monarchomachs theorized during this time the right of rebellion and the legitimacy of tyrannicide
the wars of religion culminated in the war of the three henrys in which henry iii assassinated henry de guise leader of the spanish backed catholic league and the king was murdered in return
after the assassination of both henry of guise and henry iii the conflict was ended by the accession of the protestant king of navarre as henry iv first king of the bourbon dynasty and his subsequent abandonment of protestantism expedient of effective in his acceptance by most of the catholic establishment and by the pope and his issue of the toleration decree known as the edict of nantes which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil equality
france s pacification under henry iv laid much of the ground for the beginnings of france s rise to european hegemony
france was expansive during all but the end of the seventeenth century the french began trading in india and madagascar founded quebec and penetrated the north american great lakes and mississippi established plantation economies in the west indies and extended their trade contacts in the levant and enlarged their merchant marine
henry iv s son louis xiii and his minister cardinal richelieu elaborated a policy against spain and the holy roman empire during the thirty years war which had broken out in germany
after the death of both king and cardinal the peace of westphalia secured universal acceptance of germany s political and religious fragmentation but the regency of anne of austria and her minister cardinal mazarin experienced a civil uprising known as the fronde which expanded into a franco spanish war
the treaty of the pyrenees formalised france s seizure of the spanish territory of roussillon after the crushing of the ephemeral catalan republic and ushered a short period of peace
the ancien r gime a french term rendered in english as old rule or simply former regime refers primarily to the aristocratic social and political system of early modern france under the late valois and bourbon dynasties
the administrative and social structures of the ancien r gime were the result of years of state building legislative acts like the ordinance of villers cotter ts internal conflicts and civil wars but they remained a confusing patchwork of local privilege and historic differences until the french revolution brought about a radical suppression of administrative incoherence
for most of the reign of louis xiv the sun king france was the dominant power in europe aided by the diplomacy of cardinal richelieu s successor as the king s chief minister cardinal jules mazarin
cardinal mazarin oversaw the creation of a french royal navy that rivalled england s expanding it from ships to almost
the size of the army was also considerably increased
renewed wars the war of devolution and the franco dutch war brought further territorial gains artois and western flanders and the free county of burgundy previously left to the empire in but at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival royal powers and a legacy of an increasingly enormous national debt
an adherent of the theory of the divine right of kings which advocates the divine origin of temporal power and any lack of earthly restraint of monarchical rule louis xiv continued his predecessors work of creating a centralized state governed from the capital of paris
he sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism still persisting in parts of france and by compelling the noble elite to regularly inhabit his lavish palace of versailles built on the outskirts of paris succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy many members of which had participated in the earlier fronde rebellion during louis minority youth
by these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in france that endured years until the french revolution
mccabe says critics used fiction to portray the degraded turkish court using the harem the sultan court oriental despotism luxury gems and spices carpets and silk cushions as an unfavorable analogy to the corruption of the french royal court
the king sought to impose total religious uniformity on the country repealing the edict of nantes in
the infamous practice of dragonnades was adopted whereby intentionally rough soldiers were quartered in the homes of protestant families and allowed to have their way with them stealing raping torturing and killing adults and infants in their hovels
it is estimated that anywhere between and protestants fled france during the wave of persecution that followed the repeal following huguenots beginning a hundred and fifty years earlier until the end of the th century costing the country a great many intellectuals artisans and other valuable people
persecution extended to unorthodox roman catholics like the jansenists a group that denied free will and had already been condemned by the popes
louis was no theologian and understood little of the complex doctrines of jansenism satisfying himself with the fact that they threatened the unity of the state
in this he garnered the friendship of the papacy which had previously been hostile to france because of its policy of putting all church property in the country under the jurisdiction of the state rather than that of rome
in november the spanish king charles ii died ending the habsburg line in that country
louis had long waited for this moment and now planned to put a bourbon relative philip duke of anjou on the throne
essentially spain was to become a perpetual ally and even obedient satellite of france ruled by a king who would carry out orders from versailles
realizing how this would upset the balance of power the other european rulers were outraged
however most of the alternatives were equally undesirable
for example putting another habsburg on the throne would end up recreating the grand multi national empire of charles v of the holy roman empire german first reich spain and the two sicilies which would also grossly upset the power balance
after nine years of exhausting war the last thing louis wanted was another conflict
however the rest of europe would not stand for his ambitions in spain and so the long war of the spanish succession began a mere three years after the war of the grand alliance aka war of the league of augsburg had just concluded
the reign of louis xv saw an initial return to peace and prosperity under the regency of philippe ii duke of orl ans whose policies were largely continued by cardinal fleury prime minister in all but name
the exhaustion of europe after two major wars resulted in a long period of peace only interrupted by minor conflicts like the war of the polish succession from to
large scale warfare resumed with the war of the austrian succession
but alliance with the traditional habsburg enemy the diplomatic revolution of against the rising power of britain and prussia led to costly failure in the seven years war and the loss of france s north american colonies
on the whole the th century saw growing discontent with the monarchy and the established order
louis xv was a highly unpopular king for his sexual excesses overall weakness and for losing canada to the british
a strong ruler like louis xiv could enhance the position of the monarchy while louis xv weakened it
the writings of the philosophes such as voltaire were a clear sign of discontent but the king chose to ignore them
he died of smallpox in and the french people shed few tears at his passing
while france had not yet experienced the industrial revolution that was beginning in britain the rising middle class of the cities felt increasingly frustrated with a system and rulers that seemed silly frivolous aloof and antiquated even if true feudalism no longer existed in france
upon louis xv s death his grandson louis xvi became king
initially popular he too came to be widely detested by the s
he was married to an austrian archduchess marie antoinette
french intervention in the american war of independence was also very expensive
with the country deeply in debt louis xvi permitted the radical reforms of turgot and malesherbes but noble disaffection led to turgot s dismissal and malesherbes resignation in
they were replaced by jacques necker
necker had resigned in to be replaced by calonne and brienne before being restored in
a harsh winter that year led to widespread food shortages and by then france was a powder keg ready to explode
on the eve of the french revolution of july france was in a profound institutional and financial crisis but the ideas of the enlightenment had begun to permeate the educated classes of society
on september the absolute monarchy which had governed france for years was forced to limit its power and become a provisional constitutional monarchy
however this too would not last very long and on september the french monarchy was effectively abolished by the proclamation of the french first republic
the role of the king in france was finally ended with the execution of louis xvi by guillotine on monday january followed by the reign of terror mass executions and the provisional directory form of republican government and the eventual beginnings of twenty five years of reform upheaval dictatorship wars and renewal with the various napoleonic wars
following the french revolution and the first french empire under napoleon the monarchy was restored when a coalition of european powers restored by arms the monarchy to the house of bourbon in
however the deposed emperor napoleon i returned triumphantly to paris from his exile in elba and ruled france for a short period known as the hundred days
when a seventh european coalition again deposed napoleon after the battle of waterloo in the bourbon monarchy was once again restored
the count of provence brother of louis xvi who was guillotined in was crowned as louis xviii nicknamed the desired
louis xviii tried to conciliate the legacies of the revolution and the ancien r gime by permitting the formation of a parliament and a constitutional charter usually known as the charte octroy e granted charter
his reign was characterized by disagreements between the doctrinaires liberal thinkers who supported the charter and the rising bourgeoisie and the ultra royalists aristocrats and clergymen who totally refused the revolution s heritage
peace was maintained by statesmen like talleyrand and the duke of richelieu as well as the king s moderation and prudent intervention
in the liberal agitations in spain led to a french intervention on the royalists side which permitted king ferdinand vii of spain to abolish the constitution of
however the work of louis xviii was frustrated when after his death on september his brother the count of artois became king under the name of charles x
charles x was a strong reactionary who supported the ultra royalists and the catholic church
under his reign the censorship of newspapers was reinforced the anti sacrilege act passed and compensations to migr s were increased
however the reign also witnessed the french intervention in the greek revolution in favour of the greek rebels and the first phase of the conquest of algeria
the absolutist tendencies of the king were disliked by the doctrinaire majority in the chamber of deputies that on march sent an address to the king upholding the rights of the chamber and in effect supporting a transition to a full parliamentary system
charles x received this address as a veiled threat and in july of the same year he issued the st
cloud ordinances in an attempt to reduce parliament s powers and re establish absolute rule
the opposition reacted with riots in parliament and barricades in paris that resulted in the july revolution
the king abdicated as did his son the prince louis antoine in favour to his grandson count of chambord nominating his cousin the duke of orl ans as regent
however it was too late and the liberal opposition won out over the monarchy
on august the chamber of deputies elected louis philippe duke of orl ans as king of the french for the first time since french revolution the king was designated as the ruler of the french people and not the country
the bourbon white flag was substituted with the french tricolour and a new charter was introduced in august
the conquest of algeria continued and new settlements were established in the gulf of guinea gabon madagascar and mayotte while tahiti was placed under protectorate
however despite the initial reforms louis philippe was little different from his predecessors
the old nobility was replaced by urban bourgeoisie and the working class was excluded from voting
louis philippe appointed notable bourgeois as prime minister like banker casimir p rier academic fran ois guizot general jean de dieu soult and thus obtained the nickname of citizen king roi citoyen
the july monarchy was beset by corruption scandals and financial crisis
the opposition of the king was composed of legitimists supporting the count of chambord bourbon claimant to the throne and of bonapartists and republicans who fought against royalty and supported the principles of democracy
the king tried to suppress the opposition with censorship but when the campagne des banquets banquets campaign was repressed in february riots and seditions erupted in paris and later all france resulting in the february revolution
the national guard refused to repress the rebellion resulting in louis philippe abdicating and fleeing to england
on february the monarchy was abolished and the second republic was proclaimed
despite later attempts to re establish the kingdom in the s during the third republic the french monarchy has not returned
before the th century only a small part of what is now france was under control of the frankish king in the north there were viking incursions leading to the formation of the duchy of normandy in the west the counts of anjou established themselves as powerful rivals of the king by the late th century ruling over the angevin empire which included the kingdom of england
it was only with philip ii of france that the bulk of the territory of western francia came under the rule of the frankish kings and philip was consequently the first king to call himself king of france
the division of france between the angevin plantagenet kings of england and the capetian kings of france would lead to the hundred years war and france would regain control over these territories only by the mid th century

comtat venaissin prior to the french revolution the catholic church was the official state religion of the kingdom of france
france was traditionally considered the church s eldest daughter french fille a n e de l glise and the king of france always maintained close links to the pope
however the french monarchy maintained a significant degree of autonomy namely through its policy of gallicanism whereby the king selected bishops rather than the papacy
during the protestant reformation of the mid th century france developed a large and influential protestant population primarily of reformed confession after french theologian and pastor john calvin introduced the reformation in france the number of french protestants huguenots steadily swelled to percent of the population or roughly million people
the ensuring french wars of religion and particularly the st
bartholomew s day massacre decimated the huguenot community protestants declined to seven to eight percent of the kingdom s population by the end of the th century
the edict of nantes brought decades of respite until its revocation in the late th century by louis xiv
the resulting exodus of huguenots from the kingdom of france created a brain drain as many of them had occupied important places in society
jews have a documented presence in france since at least the early middle ages
the kingdom of france was a center of jewish learning in the middle ages producing influential jewish scholars such as rashi and even hosting theological debates between jews and christians
widespread persecution began in the th century and increased intermittently throughout the middle ages with multiple expulsions and returns
