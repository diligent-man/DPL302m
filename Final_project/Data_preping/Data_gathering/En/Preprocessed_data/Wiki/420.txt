factor xii deficiency is a deficiency in the production of factor xii fxii a plasma glycoprotein and clotting factor that participates in the coagulation cascade and activates factor xi
fxii appears to be not essential for blood clotting as individuals with this condition are usually asymptomatic and form blood clots in vivo
fxii deficiency tends to be identified during presurgical laboratory screening for bleeding disorders
the condition can be inherited or acquired
while it is indicated that people with fxii deficiency are generally asymptomatic studies in women with recurrent miscarriages suggest an association with fxii deficiency
the condition is of importance in the differential diagnosis to other bleeding disorders specifically the hemophilias hemophilia a with a deficiency in factor viii or antihemophilic globulin hemophilia b with a deficiency in factor ix christmas disease and hemophilia c with a deficiency in factor xi
other rare forms of bleeding disorders are also in the differential diagnosis
there is concern that individuals with fxii deficiency are more prone to thrombophilic disease however this is at variance with a long term study from switzerland
inherited or congenital fxii deficiency is usually passed on by autosomal recessive inheritance
a person needs to inherit a defective gene from both parents
people who have only one defective gene are asymptomatic but may have lower fxii levels and can pass the gene on to half their offspring
in persons with congenital fxii deficiency the condition is lifelong
people affected may want to alert other family members as they may also carry the gene
a study of healthy blood donors found that persons had fxii deficiencies with one subject having no detectable fxii
this study is at variance with estimates that only in people has the condition
the acquired form of fxii deficiency is seen in patients with the nephrotic syndrome liver disease sepsis and shock disseminated intravascular coagulation and other diseases
the condition is diagnosed by blood tests in the laboratory when it is noted that special blood clotting test are abnormal
specifically prothrombin time pt or activated partial thromboplastin time aptt are prolonged
the diagnosis is confirmed by an assay detecting very low or absent fxii levels
the fxii f gene is found on chromosome q qter
in hereditary angioedema type iii an increased activity of factor xii has been described
in congenital fxii deficiency treatment is not necessary
in acquired fxii deficiency the underlying problem needs to be addressed
the condition was first described in based by blood testing of a patient named john hageman
