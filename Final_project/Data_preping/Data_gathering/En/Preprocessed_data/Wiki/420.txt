fxii appears essential blood clotting individual condition usually asymptomatic form blood clot vivo
fxii deficiency tends identified presurgical laboratory screening bleeding disorders
indicated people fxii deficiency generally asymptomatic study woman recurrent miscarriage suggest association fxii deficiency
condition importance differential diagnosis bleeding disorder specifically hemophilia hemophilia deficiency factor viii antihemophilic globulin hemophilia b deficiency factor ix christmas disease hemophilia c deficiency factor xi
concern individual fxii deficiency prone thrombophilic disease however variance long-term study switzerland
inherited congenital fxii deficiency usually passed autosomal recessive inheritance
people one defective gene asymptomatic may lower fxii level pas gene half offspring
people affected may want alert family member may also carry gene
study healthy blood donor found person fxii deficiency one subject detectable fxii
acquired form fxii deficiency seen patient nephrotic syndrome liver disease sepsis shock disseminated intravascular coagulation diseases
condition diagnosed blood test laboratory noted special blood clotting test abnormal
specifically prothrombin time pt activated partial thromboplastin time aptt prolonged
diagnosis confirmed assay detecting low absent fxii levels
hereditary angioedema type iii increased activity factor xii ha described
