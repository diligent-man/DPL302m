the normans norman normaunds french normands latin nortmanni normanni were a population arising in the medieval duchy of normandy from the intermingling between norse viking settlers and indigenous west franks and gallo romans
the term is also used to denote emigrants from the duchy who conquered other territories such as england and sicily
the norse settlements in west francia followed a series of raids on the french northern coast mainly from denmark although some also sailed from norway and sweden
said settlements were finally legitimized when rollo a scandinavian viking leader agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia following the siege of chartres in ad
the intermingling in normandy produced an ethnic and cultural norman identity in the first half of the th century an identity which continued to evolve over the centuries
the norman dynasty had a major political cultural and military impact on medieval europe and the near east
the normans were historically famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their catholic piety becoming exponents of the catholic orthodoxy of the romance community
the original norse settlers adopted the gallo romance language of the frankish land they settled with their old norman dialect becoming known as norman normaund or norman french an important literary language which is still spoken today in parts of mainland normandy cotentinais and cauchois dialects and the nearby channel islands j rriais and guern siais
the duchy of normandy which arose from the treaty of saint clair sur epte was a great fief of medieval france
the norman dukes exercised independent control of their holdings in normandy while at the same time being vassals owing fealty to the king of france and under richard i of normandy byname richard sans peur meaning richard the fearless the duchy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure
by the end of his reign in the descendants of the norse settlers had become not only christians but in all essentials frenchmen
they had adopted the french language french legal ideas and french social customs and had practically merged with the frankish or gallic population among whom they lived
between and as a result of the norman conquest of england most of the kings of england were also dukes of normandy
in philip ii of france seized mainland normandy by force of arms having earlier declared the duchy of normandy to be forfeit to him
it remained disputed territory until the treaty of paris of when the english sovereign ceded his claim to the duchy except for the channel islands
in the present day the channel islands the bailiwick of guernsey and the bailiwick of jersey are considered to be officially the last remnants of the duchy of normandy and are not part of the united kingdom but are instead self governing crown dependencies
the normans are noted both for their culture such as their unique romanesque architecture and musical traditions and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations
norman adventurers played a role in founding the kingdom of sicily under roger ii after briefly conquering southern italy and malta from the saracens and byzantines and an expedition on behalf of their duke william the conqueror led to the norman conquest of england at the historic battle of hastings in
norman and anglo norman forces contributed to the iberian reconquista from the early eleventh to the mid thirteenth centuries
norman cultural and military influence spread from these new european centres to the crusader states of the near east where their prince bohemond i founded the principality of antioch in the levant to scotland and wales in great britain to ireland and to the coasts of north africa and the canary islands
the legacy of the normans persists today through the regional languages and dialects of france england spain quebec and sicily and also through the various cultural judicial and political arrangements they introduced in their conquered territories
the english name normans comes from the french words normans normanz plural of normant modern french normand which is itself borrowed from old low franconian nortmann northman or directly from old norse nor ma r latinized variously as nortmannus normannus or nordmannus recorded in medieval latin th century to mean norseman viking
the th century benedictine monk and historian goffredo malaterra characterised the normans thus
in the course of the th century the initially destructive incursions of norse war bands going upstream into the rivers of france penetrated further into interior europe and evolved into more permanent encampments that included local french women and personal property
from to odo of paris eudes de paris succeeded in defending paris against viking raiders one of the leaders was sigfred with his fighting skills fortification of paris and tactical shrewdness
in robert i of france brother of odo again defeated another band of viking warriors in chartres with his well trained horsemen
this victory paved the way for rollo s baptism and settlement in normandy
the duchy of normandy which began in as a fiefdom was established by the treaty of saint clair sur epte between king charles iii charles the simple ruled of west francia and the famed viking ruler rollo also known as gaange rolf c
from scandinavia and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of neustria
the treaty offered rollo and his men the french coastal lands along the english channel between the river epte and the atlantic ocean coast in exchange for their protection against further viking incursions
as well as promising to protect the area of rouen from viking invasion rollo swore not to invade further frankish lands himself accepted baptism and conversion to christianity and swore fealty to king charles iii
robert i of france stood as godfather during rollo s baptism
he became the first duke of normandy and count of rouen
the area corresponded to the northern part of present day upper normandy down to the river seine but the duchy would eventually extend west beyond the seine
the territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of rouen and reproduced the old roman empire s administrative structure of gallia lugdunensis ii part of the former gallia lugdunensis in gaul
before rollo s arrival normandy s populations did not differ from picardy or the le de france which were considered frankish
earlier viking settlers had begun arriving in the s but were divided between colonies in the east roumois and pays de caux around the low seine valley and in the west in the cotentin peninsula and were separated by traditional pagii where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers
rollo s contingents from scandinavia who raided and ultimately settled normandy and parts of the european atlantic coast included danes norwegians norse gaels orkney vikings possibly swedes and anglo danes from the english danelaw territory which earlier came under norse control in the late th century
the descendants of vikings replaced the norse religion and old norse language with catholicism christianity and the langue d oil of the local people descending from the latin of the romans
the norman language norman french was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d o l branch of romance by a norse speaking ruling class and it developed into the french regional languages that survive today
the normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of france and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both normandy and in norman dominated england
the new norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old french aristocracy most of whom traced their lineage to the franks of the carolingian dynasty from the days of charlemagne in the th century
most norman knights remained poor and land hungry and by the time of the expedition and invasion of england in normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation
many normans of italy france and england eventually served as avid crusaders soldiers under the italo norman prince bohemund i of antioch and the anglo norman king richard the lion heart one of the more famous and illustrious kings of england
opportunistic bands of normans successfully established a foothold in southern italy
probably as the result of returning pilgrims stories the normans entered southern italy as warriors in at the latest
in according to amatus of montecassino norman pilgrims returning from jerusalem called in at the port of salerno when a saracen attack occurred
the normans fought so valiantly that prince guaimar iii begged them to stay but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the prince s request
william of apulia tells that in norman pilgrims to the shrine of the archangel michael at monte gargano were met by melus of bari a lombard nobleman and rebel who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the byzantine rule which they did
the two most prominent norman families to arrive in the mediterranean were descendants of tancred of hauteville and the drengot family
a group of normans with at least five brothers from the drengot family fought the byzantines in apulia under the command of melo di bari
between and in a fragmented political context the county of ariano it was founded by another group of norman knights headed by gilbert buat re and hired by melo di bari
defeated at cannae melo di bari escaped to bamberg germany where he died in
the county which replaced the pre existing chamberlainship is considered to be the first political body established by the normans in the south of italy
then rainulf drengot from the same family received the county of aversa from duke sergius iv of naples in
the hauteville family achieved princely rank by proclaiming prince guaimar iv of salerno duke of apulia and calabria
he promptly awarded their elected leader william iron arm with the title of count in his capital of melfi
the drengot family thereafter attained the principality of capua and emperor henry iii legally ennobled the hauteville leader drogo as dux et magister italiae comesque normannorum totius apuliae et calabriae duke and master of italy and count of the normans of all apulia and calabria in
from these bases the normans eventually captured sicily and malta from the saracens under the leadership of the famous robert guiscard a hauteville and his younger brother roger the great count
roger s son roger ii of sicily was crowned king in exactly one century after rainulf was crowned count by antipope anacletus ii
the kingdom of sicily lasted until when it was transferred to the house of hohenstaufen through marriage
the normans left their legacy in many castles such as william iron arm s citadel at squillace and cathedrals such as roger ii s cappella palatina at palermo which dot the landscape and give a distinct architectural flavor to accompany its unique history
institutionally the normans combined the administrative machinery of the byzantines arabs and lombards with their own conceptions of feudal law and order to forge a unique government
under this state there was great religious freedom and alongside the norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of jews muslims and christians both catholic and eastern orthodox
the kingdom of sicily thus became characterized by norman byzantine greek arab lombard and native sicilian populations living in harmony and its norman rulers fostered plans of establishing an empire that would have encompassed fatimid egypt as well as the crusader states in the levant
one of the great geographical treatises of the middle ages the tabula rogeriana was written by the andalusian al idrisi for king roger ii of sicily and entitled kitab rudjdjar the book of roger
the normans began appearing in the military confrontations between christians and muslims in the iberian peninsula since the early eleventh century
the first norman who appears in the narrative sources was roger i of tosny who according to ademar of chabannes and the later chronicle of st pierre le vif went to aid the barcelonese in a series of raids against the andalusi muslims circa
later in the eleventh century other norman adventurers such as robert crispin and walter giffard participated in the probably papal organised siege of barbastro of
even after the norman conquest of england in the normans continued to participate in ventures in the peninsula
after the frankish conquest of the holy land during the first crusade the normans began to be encouraged to participate in ventures of conquest in the northeast of the peninsula
the most significant example of this was the incursion of rotrou ii of perche and robert burdet in the s in the ebro frontier
by robert burdet had been granted a semi independent principality in the city of tarragona by the then archbishop of this see oleguer bonestruga
several others of rotrou s norman followers were rewarded with lands in the ebro valley by king alfonso i of aragon for their services
with the rising popularity of the sea route to the holy land norman and anglo norman crusaders also started to be encouraged locally by iberian prelates to participate in the portuguese incursions into the western areas of the peninsula
the first of these incursions occurred when a fleet of these crusaders was invited by the portuguese king afonso i henriques to conquer the city of lisbon in
although this siege of lisbon was a failure it created a precedent for their involvement in portugal
so in when another group of norman and other groups of crusaders from northern europe arrived in porto on their way to join the crusading forces of the second crusade the bishop of porto and later afonso henriques according to de expugnatione lyxbonensi convinced them to help with the siege of lisbon
this time the city was captured and according to the arrangement agreed upon with the portuguese monarch many of them settled in the newly sacked city
the following year the remainder of the crusading fleet including a substantial number of anglo normans was invited by the count of barcelona ramon berenguer iv to participate in the siege of tortosa
again the normans were rewarded with lands in the newly conquered frontier city
between and the norman kingdom of sicily conquered and kept as vassals several cities on the ifriqiya coast corresponding to tunisia and parts of algeria and libya today
they were lost to the almohads
soon after the normans began to enter italy they entered the byzantine empire and then armenia fighting against the pechenegs the bulgarians and especially the seljuk turks
norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the lombards to act against the byzantines but they soon fought in byzantine service in sicily
they were prominent alongside varangian and lombard contingents in the sicilian campaign of george maniaces in
there is debate whether the normans in greek service actually were from norman italy and it now seems likely only a few came from there
it is also unknown how many of the franks as the byzantines called them were normans and not other frenchmen
one of the first norman mercenaries to serve as a byzantine general was herv in the s
by then however there were already norman mercenaries serving as far away as trebizond and georgia
they were based at malatya and edessa under the byzantine duke of antioch isaac komnenos
in the s robert crispin led the normans of edessa against the turks
roussel de bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in asia minor with support from the local population in but he was stopped in by the byzantine general and future emperor alexius komnenos
some normans joined turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the armenian vassal states of sassoun and taron in far eastern anatolia
later many took up service with the armenian state further south in cilicia and the taurus mountains
a norman named oursel led a force of franks into the upper euphrates valley in northern syria
from to of the troops of the armenian general philaretus brachamius were normans formerly of oursel led by raimbaud
they even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle afranji meaning franks
the known trade between amalfi and antioch and between bari and tarsus may be related to the presence of italo normans in those cities while amalfi and bari were under norman rule in italy
several families of byzantine greece were of norman mercenary origin during the period of the comnenian restoration when byzantine emperors were seeking out western european warriors
the raoulii were descended from an italo norman named raoul the petraliphae were descended from a pierre d aulps and that group of albanian clans known as the maniakates were descended from normans who served under george maniaces in the sicilian expedition of
robert guiscard another norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of apulia as the result of his military successes ultimately drove the byzantines out of southern italy
having obtained the consent of pope gregory vii and acting as his vassal robert continued his campaign conquering the balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the catholic church
after allying himself with croatia and the catholic cities of dalmatia in he led an army of men in ships landing on the southern shores of albania capturing valona kanina jericho orikumi and reaching butrint after numerous pillages
they joined the fleet that had previously conquered corfu and attacked dyrrachium from land and sea devastating everything along the way
under these harsh circumstances the locals accepted the call of emperor alexios i comnenos to join forces with the byzantines against the normans
the byzantine forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival
immediately before the battle the venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city
forced to retreat alexios ceded the city of dyrrachium to the count of the tent or byzantine provincial administrators mobilizing from arbanon i e the term is short for meaning count of the tent
the city s garrison resisted until february when dyrrachium was betrayed to the normans by the venetian and amalfitan merchants who had settled there
the normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland they took ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern macedonia and thessaly before appearing at the gates of thessalonica
dissension among the high ranks coerced the normans to retreat to italy
they lost dyrrachium valona and butrint in after the death of robert
a few years after the first crusade in the normans under the command of bohemond robert s son landed in valona and besieged dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time but to no avail
meanwhile they occupied petrela the citadel of mili at the banks of the river deabolis gllavenica ballsh kanina and jericho
this time the albanians sided with the normans dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the byzantines had imposed upon them
with their help the normans secured the arbanon passes and opened their way to dibra
the lack of supplies disease and byzantine resistance forced bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the byzantines in the city of deabolis
the further decline of byzantine state of affairs paved the road to a third attack in when a large norman army invaded dyrrachium owing to the betrayal of high byzantine officials
some time later dyrrachium one of the most important naval bases of the adriatic fell again to byzantine hands
the normans were in contact with england from an early date
not only were their original viking brethren still ravaging the english coasts they occupied most of the important ports opposite england across the english channel
this relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of emma sister of duke richard ii of normandy and king ethelred ii of england
because of this ethelred fled to normandy in when he was forced from his kingdom by sweyn forkbeard
his stay in normandy until influenced him and his sons by emma who stayed in normandy after cnut the great s conquest of the isle
when edward the confessor finally returned from his father s refuge in at the invitation of his half brother harthacnut he brought with him a norman educated mind
he also brought many norman counsellors and fighters some of whom established an english cavalry force
this concept never really took root but it is a typical example of edward s attitude
he appointed robert of jumi ges archbishop of canterbury and made ralph the timid earl of hereford
on october william the conqueror gained a decisive victory at the battle of hastings which led to the conquest of england three years later this can be seen on the bayeux tapestry
the invading normans and their descendants largely replaced the anglo saxons as the ruling class of england
the nobility of england were part of a single norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel
early norman kings of england as dukes of normandy owed homage to the king of france for their land on the continent
they considered england to be their most important holding it brought with it the title of king an important status symbol
eventually the normans merged with the natives combining languages and traditions so much so that marjorie chibnall says writers still referred to normans and english but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of in the course of the hundred years war the norman aristocracy often identified themselves as english
the anglo norman language became distinct from the french spoken in paris something that was the subject of some humour by geoffrey chaucer
the anglo norman language was eventually absorbed into the anglo saxon language of their subjects see old english and influenced it helping along with the norse language of the earlier anglo norse settlers and the latin used by the church in the development of middle english which in turn evolved into modern english
the normans had a profound effect on irish culture and history after their invasion at bannow bay in
initially the normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity
yet with time they came to be subsumed into irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became more irish than the irish themselves
the normans settled mostly in an area in the east of ireland later known as the pale and also built many fine castles and settlements including trim castle and dublin castle
the cultures intermixed borrowing from each other s language culture and outlook
norman surnames still exist today
names such as french de roche devereux d arcy treacy and lacy are particularly common in the southeast of ireland especially in the southern part of wexford county where the first norman settlements were established
other norman names such as furlong predominate there
another common norman irish name was morell murrell derived from the french norman name morel
names beginning with fitz from the norman for son usually indicate norman ancestry
hiberno norman surnames with the prefix fitz include fitzgerald fitzgibbons gibbons as well as fitzmaurice
families bearing such surnames as barry de barra and de b rca burke are also of norman extraction
one of the claimants of the english throne opposing william the conqueror edgar atheling eventually fled to scotland
king malcolm iii of scotland married edgar s sister margaret and came into opposition to william who had already disputed scotland s southern borders
william invaded scotland in riding as far as abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships
malcolm submitted paid homage to william and surrendered his son duncan as a hostage beginning a series of arguments as to whether the scottish crown owed allegiance to the king of england
normans went into scotland building castles and founding noble families that would provide some future kings such as robert the bruce as well as founding a considerable number of the scottish clans
king david i of scotland whose elder brother alexander i had married sybilla of normandy was instrumental in introducing normans and norman culture to scotland part of the process some scholars call the davidian revolution
having spent time at the court of henry i of england married to david s sister maud of scotland and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half brother m el coluim mac alaxandair david had to reward many with lands
the process was continued under david s successors most intensely of all under william the lion
the norman derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of scotland
scottish families of the names bruce gray ramsay fraser rose ogilvie montgomery sinclair pollock burnard douglas and gordon to name but a few and including the later royal house of stewart can all be traced back to norman ancestry
even before the norman conquest of england the normans had come into contact with wales
edward the confessor had set up the aforementioned ralph as earl of hereford and charged him with defending the marches and warring with the welsh
in these original ventures the normans failed to make any headway into wales
after the conquest however the marches came completely under the dominance of william s most trusted norman barons including bernard de neufmarch roger of montgomery in shropshire and hugh lupus in cheshire
these normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of wales was at some point subject to norman interference
norman words such as baron barwn first entered welsh at that time
the legendary religious zeal of the normans was exercised in religious wars long before the first crusade carved out a norman principality in antioch
they were major foreign combatants in the reconquista in iberia
in roger de tosny travelled to the iberian peninsula to carve out a state for himself from moorish lands but failed
in during the war of barbastro william of montreuil roger crispin and probably walter guiffard led an army under the papal hanner which took a huge booty as they captured the city from its andelusi rulers
later a group of normans led by certain william some have suggested this was william the carpenter participated in the failed siege of tudela of
in crusaders passing by the siege of amalfi were joined by bohemond of taranto and his nephew tancred with an army of italo normans
bohemond was the de facto leader of the crusade during its passage through asia minor
after the successful siege of antioch in bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city
tancred was instrumental in the conquest of jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the crusader kingdom in transjordan and the region of galilee
after the first crusade to the levant the normans continued with their involvement in iberia as well as other areas of the meditierranean
among them was rotrou of perche and his followers robert burdet and william giffard who joined multiple expeditions into the ebro valley to aid alfonso i of aragon in his campaigns of conquest
robert burdet managed to acquire the position of alcide of tudela by and later that of prince of the city tarragona in
the conquest of cyprus by the anglo norman forces of the third crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island which would be under western european domination for the following years
although not part of a planned operation the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected
in april richard the lion hearted left messina with a large fleet in order to reach acre
but a storm dispersed the fleet
after some searching it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fianc e berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus together with the wrecks of several other ships including the treasure ship
survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island s despot isaac komnenos
on may richard s fleet arrived in the port of limassol on cyprus
he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure
isaac refused so richard landed his troops and took limassol
various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time in particular guy de lusignan
all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat
the local barons abandoned isaac who considered making peace with richard joining him on the crusade and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by richard
but isaac changed his mind and tried to escape
richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island his troops being led by guy de lusignan
isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons
by june richard had conquered the whole island
his exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island
richard left for acre on june with his allies
before his departure he named two of his norman generals richard de camville and robert de thornham as governors of cyprus
while in limassol richard the lion heart married berengaria of navarre first born daughter of king sancho vi of navarre
the wedding was held on may at the chapel of st
george and it was attended by richard s sister joan whom he had brought from sicily
the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor
among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus and berengaria queen of england and queen of cyprus as well
the rapid anglo norman conquest proved more important than it seemed
the island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the holy land whose occupation by the christians could not continue without support from the sea
shortly after the conquest cyprus was sold to the knights templar and it was subsequently acquired in by guy de lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom
it was only in that the venetians acquired full control of the island which remained a christian stronghold until the fall of famagusta in
between and the expedition led by the norman noble jean de bethencourt and the poitevine gadifer de la salle conquered the canarian islands of lanzarote fuerteventura and el hierro off the atlantic coast of africa
their troops were gathered in normandy gascony and were later reinforced by castilian colonists
bethencourt took the title of king of the canary islands as vassal to henry iii of castile
in jean s nephew maciot de bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to enrique p rez de guzm n nd count de niebla
when norse vikings from scandinavia arrived in the then province of neustria and settled the land that became known as normandy they originally spoke old norse a north germanic language
over time they came to live among the local gallo romance speaking population with the two communities converging to the point that the original norsemen largely assimilated and adopted the local dialect of old french while contributing some elements from the old norse language
this norse influenced dialect which then arose was known as old norman and it is the ancestor of both the modern norman language still spoken today in the channel islands and parts of mainland normandy as well as the historical anglo norman language in england
old norman was also an important language of the principality of antioch during crusader rule in the levant
old norman and anglo norman literature was quite extensive during the middle ages with records existing from notable norman poets such as wace who was born on the island of jersey and raised in mainland normandy
the customary law of normandy was developed between the th and th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of jersey and guernsey in the channel islands
norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues these are the tr s ancien coutumier very ancient customary authored between and and the grand coutumier de normandie great customary of normandy originally summa de legibus normanniae in curia la cali authored between and
norman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued
they spread a unique romanesque idiom to england italy and ireland and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north french style fundamentally altered the military landscape
their style was characterised by rounded arches particularly over windows and doorways and massive proportions
in england the period of norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the anglo saxon and precedes the early gothic
in southern italy the normans incorporated elements of islamic lombard and byzantine building techniques into their own initiating a unique style known as norman arab architecture within the kingdom of sicily
in the visual arts the normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered
however in the early th century the dukes began a programme of church reform encouraging the cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts
the church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy
the chief monasteries taking part in this renaissance of norman art and scholarship were mont saint michel f camp jumi ges bec saint ouen saint evroul and saint wandrille
these centres were in contact with the so called winchester school which channeled a pure carolingian artistic tradition to normandy
in the final decade of the th and first of the th century normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts but it was brief and the major scriptoria of normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century
the french wars of religion in the th century and the french revolution in the th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this norman creativity
the former with their violence caused the wanton destruction of many norman edifices the latter with its assault on religion caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging
by far the most famous work of norman art is the bayeux tapestry which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery
it was commissioned by odo the bishop of bayeux and first earl of kent employing natives from kent who were learned in the nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the danish vikings
in britain norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork such as capitals and baptismal fonts
in southern italy however norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its greek lombard and arab forebears
of the royal regalia preserved in palermo the crown is byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of arab craftsmanship with arabic inscriptions
many churches preserve sculptured fonts capitals and more importantly mosaics which were common in norman italy and drew heavily on the greek heritage
lombard salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the th century and this continued under norman domination
french crusaders traveling to the holy land brought with them french artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern italy amongst their norman cousins
for this reason many south italian churches preserve works from france alongside their native pieces
normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the th century
f camp abbey and saint evroul abbey were centres of musical production and education
at f camp under two italian abbots william of volpiano and john of ravenna the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught
it is still the most common form of pitch representation in english and german speaking countries today
also at f camp the staff around which neumes were oriented was first developed and taught in the th century
under the german abbot isembard la trinit du mont became a centre of musical composition
at saint evroul a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in normandy
under the norman abbot robert de grantmesnil several monks of saint evroul fled to southern italy where they were patronised by robert guiscard and established a latin monastery at sant eufemia lamezia
there they continued the tradition of singing
