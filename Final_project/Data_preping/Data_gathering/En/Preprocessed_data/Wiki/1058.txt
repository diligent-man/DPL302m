the russian nobility russian dvoryanstvo originated in the th century
in it consisted of approximately members about of the population in the russian empire
up until the february revolution of the noble estates staffed most of the russian government and possessed a gentry assembly
the russian word for nobility dvoryanstvo derives from slavonic dvor meaning the court of a prince or duke kniaz and later of the tsar or emperor
here dvor originally referred to servants at the estate of an aristocrat
in the late th and early th centuries the system of hierarchy was a system of seniority known as mestnichestvo
the word dvoryane described the highest rank of gentry who performed duties at the royal court lived in it moskovskie zhiltsy or were candidates to it as for many boyar scions dvorovye deti boyarskie vybornye deti boyarskie
a nobleman is called a dvoryanin plural dvoryane
pre soviet russia shared with other countries the concept that nobility connotes a status or social category rather than a title
throughout the th and th centuries the title of the nobleman in russia gradually became a formal status rather than a reference to a member of the aristocracy due to a massive influx of commoners via the table of ranks
many descendants of the former ancient russian aristocracy including royalty saw their formal standing change to merchants burghers or even peasants while people descended from serfs like vladimir lenin s father or clergy like in the ancestry of actress lyubov orlova gained formal nobility
the nobility arose in the th and th centuries as the lowest part of the feudal military class which comprised the court of a prince or an important boyar
from the th century land ownership by nobles increased and by the th century the bulk of feudal lords and the majority of landowners were nobles
the nobles were granted estates out of state lands in return for their service to the tsar either for as long as they performed service or for their lifetime
by the th century these estates had become private property
they made up the landed army russian the basic military force of russia
peter the great finalized the status of the nobility while abolishing the boyar title
the adoption of the fashions mannerisms and ideals of western europe by the russian nobility was a gradual process rooted in the strict guidelines of peter the great and the educational reforms of catherine the great
while cultural westernization was mostly superficial and restricted to court it coincided with the efforts of russian autocrats to link russia to western europe in more fundamental ways socially economically and politically
however russia s existing economic system which lacked a sizable middle class and which relied heavily on forced labor proved an insurmountable obstacle to the development of a free market economy
furthermore the lower classes an overwhelming majority of the russian population lived virtually isolated from the upper classes and the imperial court
thus most of the nobility s western tendencies were largely aesthetic and confined to a tiny proportion of the populace
as different rulers ascended the throne in the th century each figure brought a different attitude and approach to ruling the nobility
yet the cultural impact of peter i and catherine ii was set in stone
ironically by introducing the nobility to political literature from western europe catherine exposed russia s autocracy to them as archaic and illiberal
while the nobility was conservative as a whole a liberal and radical minority remained constant throughout the th and early th centuries resorting to violence on multiple occasions in order to challenge russia s traditional political system see decembrist revolt narodnaya volya
although peter the great is considered to be the first westernized ruler of russia there were in fact contacts between the muscovite nobility and western europe before his reign
ivan iii starting in sent numerous agents to italy to study architecture
both michael romanov and his son alexis invited and sponsored european visitors mostly military medical and building specialists who came to moscow in foreign dress speaking foreign languages
when the boyars began to imitate the westerners in dress and hairstyle tsar alexis in and then tsar feodor in restricted foreign fashions to distinguish between russians and outsiders
but these were not effectively enforced until the s
peter the great was first and foremost eager to do away with russia s reputation as an asiatic land and to propel his new empire onto the political stage of western europe
one of the many ways he hoped to achieve this was by changing the upper class culture he believed that forcing selected features of western fashion education and language onto the nobility would hasten russia s rise to international prestige
in he began to send nobles on compulsory trips abroad to england holland and italy
while the tsar primarily designed these expeditions for naval training he also encouraged the noblemen to learn about the arts of the west
furthermore peter prioritized sending russian natives as opposed to foreign expatriates he was intent on breeding a new nobility that conformed to western customs but represented the slavic people as a whole
when the travelers returned to moscow peter tested them on their training insisting on further education for those whose accumulated knowledge was unsatisfactory
by he had established for the purpose of scientific study and discovery the academy of sciences which he modeled after the ones in paris london berlin and other places
peter s westernizing efforts became more radical after when he returned from his expedition through europe known as the grand embassy
upon arriving peter summoned the nobility to his court and personally shaved almost every beard in the room
in he decreed a beard tax on all men of rank in moscow and ordered certain officers to seek out noble beards and shave them on sight
he only allowed peasants priests and serfs to retain the ingrained and religious russian tradition of wearing beards which the orthodox populace considered an essential aspect of their duty to convey the image of god
he also reformed the clothing of the nobility replacing the long sleeved traditional muscovite robes with european clothing
beginning in the tsar decreed strict dress requirements borrowing from german hungarian french and british styles fining any noblemen who failed to obey
peter himself who usually wore german dress and had a trimmed mustache acted as a prime example
while the nobility universally followed peter s fashion preferences at court they greatly resented these styles which they saw as blasphemous
away from st
petersburg very few noblemen followed peter s guidelines and enforcement was lax
peter also demanded changes in mannerisms and language among nobles
to supply russians with a basic set of proper morals and habits he ordered publication of manuals on western etiquette
the most popular of these was the honourable mirror of youth or a guide to social conduct gathered from various authors a compilation of rules of conduct from numerous european sources initially published in st
petersburg in
he also encouraged the learning of foreign languages especially french which was the foremost political and intellectual language of europe at the time
for the nobility these changes felt even more forced than fashion regulations
as with clothing there was uniform acceptance of western mannerisms at court but general disregard for them outside of st
petersburg
furthermore when westerners visited peter s court they found the image and personality of the courtiers to appear forced and awkward
friedrich christian weber a representative of britain commented in that the nobles wear the german dress but it is easy to observe on many that they have not been long used to it
while none of the rulers in power from to focused as strongly on cultural westernization peter sparked a transformation that was now unstoppable
through their education and travels some members of the nobility began to understand the extent to which russia lagged behind western europe in the complexity of their political and educational systems their technology and economy
by the ideas of secularism skepticism and humanism had reached sects of the elite class providing some with a new worldview and giving russia a taste of the enlightenment of which they had experienced little
while even the most educated of the nobility still supported the autocracy that upheld the feudal system on which they depended some considered how to make it more representative and to improve the bureaucracy
the period between peter i and catherine ii represents gradual yet significant developments in western culture among the nobility
empress anna gave many privileges to the nobility
in she repealed the primogeniture law introduced by peter the great allowing the sub division of estates
in the age at which nobles had to start service was raised from to and length of service was changed to years instead of life and families with more than one son could keep one to manage the family estate
in catherine i and in empress elizabeth further regulated noble dress in a western direction
in also during elizabeth s reign advanced secondary schools and the university of moscow were founded with curricula that included foreign languages philosophy medicine and law the material was chiefly based on imported texts from the west
most significantly peter iii freed the nobility from obligatory civil and military service in allowing them to pursue personal interests
while some used this liberty as an excuse to lead lavish lives of leisure a select group became increasingly educated in western ideas through schooling reading and travel
as before these changes applied to few and represented a gradual shift in noble identity rather than a sudden or universal one
marc raeff in origins of the russian intelligentsia has suggested this was not a noble victory but a sign the state didn t need them as much now that they had plenty of trained officials
when catherine ii ascended the throne she quickly made her political and philosophical opinions clear in the instruction of a lengthy document which she prepared for the nobility drawing largely from and even plagiarizing ideas from the west especially those of jean jacques rousseau
the point she emphasized first and foremost was that russia was a truly european state and her reforms of the court and education reflect this belief
while catherine was primarily preoccupied with impressing westerners especially the philosophers with whom she corresponded in writing in doing so she also made significant efforts to educate the nobility and expose them to western philosophy and art
she designed an imperial court in the style of louis xiv entertaining the nobility with performances of western theatre and music
she encouraged the understanding of french german and english languages so that nobles could read classic historical and philosophical literature from the west
for the first time in the history of the russian court intellectual pursuits became fashionable
when foreigners visited the court catherine expected the noblemen and their ladies to flaunt not only their western appearance but also their ability to discuss current events in western languages
catherine also made specific reforms in institutional education that pushed the nobility s culture further westward
she based russian education on that of austria importing german textbooks and adopting in a standardized curriculum to be taught in her newly created public schools
while many members of the lower classes were allowed into these schools catherine hoped that they could become educated enough to rise through the meritocratic table of ranks and eventually become nobles themselves
catherine also established the society for the translation of foreign books to bring enlightenment to those russians who could not read either french or german it is clear that like peter i catherine the great desired to construct a new nobility a new race which would both resemble western noblemen and prove knowledgeable in discussions of modern issues
and according to accounts from foreign visitors the noblemen did in fact resemble those of western europe in their dress topics of discussion and taste in literature and performance
she also gave away serfs in in and in one day august
thus she was able to bind the nobility to herself
from a kind of uniform was introduced for civilian nobles called uniform of civilian service or simply civilian uniform
the uniform prescribed colors that depended on the territory
the uniform was required at the places of service at the court and at other important public places
the privileges of the nobility were fixed and were legally codified in in the charter to the gentry
the charter introduced an organization of the nobility every province guberniya and district uyezd had an assembly of nobility
the chair of an assembly was called province district marshal of nobility
in nicholas i restricted the assembly votes to those with over serfs leaving voters
by the various ranks of the nobility had become confused as reflected in war and peace
in the era of the napoleonic wars there were counts who were wealthier and more important than princes and noble families whose wealth had been dissipated partly through lack of primogeniture partly through extravagance and due to poor estate management
young noblemen served in the military but did not thereby acquire new landed estates
tolstoy reported later improvements some nobles paid more attention to estate management and some like andrey bolkonsky freed their serfs even before the tsar did so in
of russia s nobles were szlachta from the nine western gubernii in and still in
obrok or cash rent was most common in the north while barshchina or labor rent was found mainly in the southern black earth region
in the reign of nicholas i the latter brought three times the income of cash rent though this needed less administration
in ukrainian landlords were banned from selling serfs separately from land
in landless nobles were banned also
descended from the gentry the landholding but not serf owning odnodvortsy were between peasants and nobles
they emerged as frontier settlers recruited from the class of boyar scions
the status of the odnodvortsy changed gradually from singleholding farmers to taxed state peasants
the nobility was too weak to oppose the emancipation reform of
in three million serfs were held by landlords while million by
in a fifth of the serfs were mortgaged half by
by a third of nobles estates and two thirds of their serfs were mortgaged to noble banks or to the state
the nobility was also weakened by the scattering of their estates lack of primogeniture and the high turnover and mobility from estate to estate
after the peasant reform of the economic position of the nobility weakened
the influence of the nobility was further reduced by the new law statutes of which repealed their right of electing law officer
the reform of the police in limited the landowners authority locally and the establishment of all estate zemstvo local government did away with the exclusive influence of nobility in local self government
these changes occurred despite the nobles keeping nearly all the meadows and forests and having their debts paid by the state while the ex serfs paid over the market price for the shrunken plots they kept
this figure was in the northern regions in the black earth region but zero in the polish provinces
in of serfs were domestic landless servants who stayed landless after
only polish and romanian domestic serfs got land
ninety percent of the serfs who got larger plots lived in the eight ex polish provinces where the tsar wanted to weaken the szlachta
the other lived in astrakhan and in the barren north
in the whole empire peasant land declined outside the ex polish zone and in the black earth provinces
georgia s serfs suffered the loss of of their land in tiflis province in kutaisi province
these redemption payments were not abolished till january
the influx of new world grain caused a slump in grain prices forcing the peasants to farm more land
at the same time despite their efficiency large peasant households split up from to persons per household in central russia
the resulting land hunger increased prices fold and made it easier for nobles to sell or rent land rather than farm it themselves
from to of noble land was sold to peasants of this went to the commune and by two thirds of the nobles arable land was rented to the peasantry
between over of remaining noble land was sold but only of the estates over destiny
according to the census of the top ranks of the civil service were nobles
but in the civil service as a whole noble membership declined from in to in the s and to in
there were million nobles about of the population in poland compare with in hungary and to in france
their military influence waned in the crimean war of officers were noble by the proportion had sunk to
they lived increasingly away from their estates in only to of russian nobles lived in cities by it was
by of noble land was mortgaged to the noble bank
during the russian revolution manors were burnt of the total
the russian imperial nobility was multi ethnic
native non russians such as the poles georgians lithuanians tatars and germans formed an important segment of the noble estate
the baltic german nobility was particularly prominent
according to the census of russians were classified as hereditary nobles versus of georgians and of poles followed by lithuanians tatars azerbaijanis and germans
after the abolition of serfdom the non russian nobility with the exception of finland lost their special status
later many of the impoverished or d class polish and georgian nobles became leaders of nationalist and radical political movements including bolshevism
quoting historian john armstrong andrei znamenski describes the baltic germans as a mobilized diaspora who acted as the russian empire s cultural and diplomatic envoys
after the october revolution of the new soviet government legally abolished all classes of nobility
many members of the russian nobility who fled russia after the bolshevik revolution played a significant role in the white emigre communities which settled in europe in north america and in other parts of the world
in the s and s several russian nobility associations were established outside russia including groups in france belgium and the united states
in new york the russian nobility association in america was founded in
since the collapse of the soviet union in interest among russians in the role that the russian nobility played in the historical and cultural development of russia has grown

russian did not in general employ a nobiliary particle before a surname as von in german or de in french however the russian name suffix skij which means of and is equal to von and de was used in many noble surnames especially topographic surnames as nobiliary particle

after peter the great returned from his grand tour he implemented reforms aimed at westernization of his realm including officially adopting the title of emperor of all russia preceding the traditional slavic title of tsar
peter and his successors also streamlined the stratification of the russian nobility adopting european style titles such as count and baron and discontinuing the archaic titles of boyars
the russian system of noble titles evolved into its final form
