HBO is the oldest and longest continuously operating subscription television service in the United States HBO pioneered modern pay television upon its launch on November it was the first television service to be directly transmitted and distributed to individual cable television systems and was the conceptual blueprint for the premium channel pay television services sold to subscribers for an extra monthly fee that do not accept traditional advertising and present their programming without editing for objectionable material It eventually became the first television channel in the world to begin transmitting via satellite expanding the growing regional pay service originally available to cable and multipoint distribution service MDS providers in the northern Mid Atlantic and southern New England into a national television network in September and alongside sister channel Cinemax was among the first two American pay television services to offer complimentary multiplexed channels in August
The network operates seven hour linear multiplex channels as well as a traditional subscription video on demand platform HBO On Demand and its content is the centerpiece of HBO Max an expanded streaming platform operated separately from but sharing management with Home Box Office Inc which also includes original programming produced exclusively for the service and content from other WarnerMedia properties The HBO linear channels are not presently accessible on HBO Max but continue to be available to existing subscribers of traditional and virtual pay television providers including Hulu which also sells its HBO add on independently of the streaming service's live TV tier and as live streams to legacy Roku customers through existing streaming partnerships with those companies

HBO subscribers through wireline satellite and virtual pay television providers generally pay for the network as an a la carte service though its seven channel multiplex is usually priced as a single package atop a basic programming tier that includes other cable and satellite originated channels However the Federal Communications Commission FCC requires cable providers to allow subscribers to just purchase limited basic cable a base service tier including local and in some areas out of market broadcast stations and public educational and government access channels and premium services such as HBO without necessitating that customers subscribe to expanded service Comcast which offered HBO as part of a bundled package of limited basic cable and Internet service from October until depending on the market July or January is the only major provider to have actively sold the network's multiplex tier under the regulation's exact structure As a consequence of the primary HBO channel as well as HBO and or HBO Signature depending on their local availability as add ons to their basic service being migrated to digital packages on most systems during the early to mid s cable providers typically require the use of a digital set top converter box CableCARD or QAM tuner to receive HBO When offered on analog cable tiers HBO subscribers had the option of receiving it through cable ready tuners that were built into analog television sets

A TV Everywhere service HBO Go was launched in February for subscribers of the linear television service since HBO Go was relegated from wide distribution in July it has been available as a default service for providers that do not have agreements to offer HBO Max which replaced HBO Go as the network's companion streaming platform on most pay television providers Through Home Box Office Inc it previously maintained HBO Now a similarly structured SVOD streaming service renamed HBO in August that did not require a subscription to the linear HBO television service concluding with its replacement on Roku in December it was phased out and superseded by HBO Max on platforms that reached agreements to offer the latter service

Many HBO programs have been syndicated to broadcast and ad supported pay television services usually with edits for running time and or objectionable content that indecency regulations enforced by jurisdictional telecommunications agencies or self imposed by network Standards and Practices departments may prohibit from being broadcast terrestrially or through ad supported cable networks and have been released on DVD and predecessor home video formats Since HBO's more successful series including among others Game of Thrones Sex and the City The Sopranos The Wire Entourage Six Feet Under Oz Boardwalk Empire and True Blood have been shown on terrestrial broadcasters in other countries such as in Canada Australia and much of Europe including the United Kingdom HBO's programming has the potential of being exposed to a higher percentage of the population in foreign nations in comparison to the United States Because of the cost of HBO which is the most expensive of the U S premium services costing a monthly fee as of between and depending on the provider and packaging with sister network Cinemax many Americans only view HBO programs through DVDs or in basic cable or broadcast syndication months or even years after these programs have first aired on the network and with editing for both content and to allow advertising although several series have filmed alternate clean scenes intended for syndication runs
Cable television executive Charles Dolan through his company Sterling Information Services founded Manhattan Cable TV Services renamed Sterling Manhattan Cable Television in January a cable system franchise serving the Lower Manhattan section of New York City covering an area extending southward from th Street on the Upper East Side to th Street on the Upper West Side which began limited service in September Manhattan Cable was notable for being the first urban underground cable television system to operate in the United States because of a longstanding New York City Council ordinance that restricted electrical and telecommunication wiring from being run above ground to prevent widespread service disruptions as well as the multitude of tall buildings on Manhattan Island causing impairment of television signals the company had laid cable lines beneath the streets of and into buildings throughout Manhattan
With external expenses resulting in consistent financial losses in the summer of while on a family vacation to France aboard the Queen Elizabeth a desperate Dolan wanting to help Sterling Manhattan turn profitable and to prevent Time Life Inc then the book publishing unit of Time Inc from pulling its investment in the system developed a proposal for a cable originated television channel Codenamed The Green Channel the conceptual subscription service would offer unedited theatrical movies licensed from the major Hollywood film studios and live sporting events all presented without interruptions by advertising and sold for a flat monthly fee to prospective subscribers Dolan wanted to offset the service's start up costs by having Sterling enter into carriage agreements with other cable television providers to transmit and sell the service to their customers and draw revenue from fees charged to subscribers who added the channel onto their existing cable service which then consisted exclusively of local and imported broadcast stations Dolan later presented his idea to management at Time Life who despite the potential benefit to the company's cable assets were initially hesitant to consider the Green Channel proposal Attempts to launch pay television services dating back as far as had experienced minimal success because of campaigns backed by movie theater chains and commercial broadcasters to convince television viewers that pay television would threaten the viability of the movie industry and free to air television access limited user interest and FCC restrictions on the types of programming offered to subscription services However Dolan managed to persuade Time Life to assist him in backing the project On September the FCC gave preemptive authorization to Time Life and Sterling Manhattan Cable to begin a pay television operation On November Time Inc 's board of directors approved the Green Channel proposal agreeing to give Dolan a development grant for the project
Time Life and Sterling Communications soon proposed for the Sterling Cable Network to be the name of the new service Discussions to change the service's name took place during a later meeting of Dolan and the executive staff he hired to assist in developing the project who ultimately settled on calling it Home Box Office which was meant to convey to potential customers that the service would be their ticket to movies and events that they could see in their own home The moniker was intended as a placeholder name to meet deadlines to publish a memorandum and research brochures about the new service management intended to come up with a permanent name as development continued however the Home Box Office name stuck
Multiple obstacles had to be overcome to get the service on the air Because of a pay television franchise agreement provision by the New York City Council that prohibited Sterling Manhattan and other local cable franchises from telecasting theatrical feature films directly to their customers Dolan chose to scout another city with two competitive cable franchisees to serve as Home Box Office's inaugural distributor Originally he settled on the Teleservice Cable now Service Electric system in Allentown Pennsylvania However management found out that the city and its vicinity fell within the Philadelphia ers's mile km television blackout radius which the team enforced to protect revenues generated from ticket sales Since HBO was planning to carry National Basketball Association NBA regular season and playoff games any ers games that the service aired would have been prohibited from being shown within Allentown Time Life subsequently agreed to an offer by Teleservice president John Walson to launch HBO on the company's Wilkes Barre system located outside of the ers' blackout radius fed from an AT T microwave link at the Pan Am Building in New York HBO which elected to forego pursuing telecast rights to ers basketball games would sign on to Teleservice's Allentown system as its second cable affiliate in February
Home Box Office launched at p m Eastern Time on November The service's inaugural program and event telecast a National Hockey League NHL game between the New York Rangers and the Vancouver Canucks from Madison Square Garden part of a long term agreement to broadcast sports events based at the Manhattan arena was transmitted that evening over channel its original assigned channel on the Teleservice system to its initial base of subscribers in Wilkes Barre A plaque commemorating the launch event is located at Public Square in downtown Wilkes Barre established in honor of Service Electric's April addition of HBO sister channel Cinemax to its lineup The first movie presentation shown on the service aired immediately after the sports event the film Sometimes a Great Notion starring Paul Newman and Henry Fonda Initially airing nightly on an open ended schedule dependent on the length of the evening's programs usually from p m to a m ET Home Box Office's programming initially consisted solely of theatrical films including four or five recent titles per month and event programming Each evening's schedule was arranged to present either a double feature which under FCC anti siphoning rules then maintained to protect programming supply for broadcast stations until they were struck down by the U S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in March tended to be releases dating no more than two years from their initial theatrical exhibition or a combination of either a sports or special event and a theatrical movie often bridged by a short film or other interstitial content
HBO's launch came with very little fanfare in the press other than print advertisements promoting the launch in the Wilkes Barre Times Leader the service's debut lacked coverage from local or national media outlets The city administrator of Wilkes Barre declined an offer to attend the launch ceremony while Time Inc vice president J Richard Munro became stranded in traffic on the George Washington Bridge en route from Manhattan and was not able to arrive in Wilkes Barre for the ceremony Further complicating preparations for the inaugural telecast in Midtown Manhattan strong winds produced by a storm system that brought areas of freezing rain over portions of the New York City area that evening toppled the Pan Am Building reception dish being used to relay the Home Box Office signal to microwave towers linked to Teleservice's Wilkes Barre headend Time Life representatives sent a technician to repair the antenna in time for the service's launch completing maintenance about minutes before the initial telecast By the end of the service was received by subscribers all from Teleservice customers in Wilkes Barre this number increased to around subscribers by February across Teleservice's Wilkes Barre Allentown and Bethlehem Pennsylvania systems
On February Sterling Communications announced it would spin out HBO and associated assets into a new subsidiary Home Box Office Inc Time Inc 's controlling shares in HBO expanded to around equity and Time committed a million direct investment in the subsidiary Sterling also purchased additional stock and a converted million note obligation to raise Time's equity in the company to in exchange for the added HBO stake Dolan who reportedly had major disagreements with Time Life management on policy issues claims which the company denied subsequently resigned as chief executive officer of Sterling Communications and HBO accepting a buyout of a portion of his stock while remaining on the board of directors at both companies in the interim Dolan used portions of the sale's proceeds to repurchase Time's share of the Sterling Nassau systems and to start the Long Island Cable Community Development Co the forerunner to Cablevision Systems Corporation which would be combined with the Sterling Cablevision systems on Long Island as the system's parent company Gerald M Levin an entertainment industry attorney previously with New York City based law firm Simpson Thacher Bartlett who had been with Home Box Office since it began operations as its director of finance and later as its vice president and director of programming replaced Dolan as the company's president and CEO
Following an aborted attempt by Warner Communications to purchase Sterling on July Time Inc reached an agreement to purchase and assume debt of Sterling Communications for million Time completed its acquisition of Sterling on September formally dissolving the Sterling holding company and transferring Home Box Office and Sterling Manhattan Cable to its Time Life Broadcast division The Sterling name was subsequently removed from the Manhattan system which was renamed Manhattan Cable Television in August As the acquisition was being completed HBO was struggling to grow by October the service had around subscribers across cable systems in Pennsylvania and southern New York that cumulatively served subscribers and it was suffering from a significant churn rate as subscribers who found the channel's program scheduling repetitive because of the limited allotment of movies outside of special events decided to cancel their service In January HBO expanded its programming to an average of eight hours per day from p m to a m ET PT on weekdays and twelve hours from p m to a m ET on weekends depending on that day's programming lineup Along with movies and sports programming at this time had expanded to include concert specials and other music programs daytime children's programs and various instructional series Over the two years following its launch Home Box Office steadily expanded its regional reach by January HBO was available on cable systems in New York State and Pennsylvania and by June of that year its regional coverage expanded into New Jersey After receiving permission by the New York City Board of Estimate to offer HBO on a two year experimental basis on a leased channel in exchange for a fee paid to the city from the system's subscription revenue share Manhattan Cable began offering HBO to its subscribers in Midtown and Lower Manhattan on October giving the service much needed distribution in America's largest city Manhattan Cable turned its first quarterly profits in the first half of generated in part from among other factors revenue from HBO subscriptions
As Home Box Office's distribution expanded throughout the northern Mid Atlantic and southern New England regions Time Sterling established a network of microwave receivers and connecting cables on utility landlines to feed HBO's programming from the New York relay antenna to the service's participating cable systems Although HBO's base was steadily growing Sterling Manhattan Cable's deficits continued because its subscriber base totaling customers was still relatively small to generate revenue HBO also faced financial issues losing nearly per month in part due to microwave link maintenance fees it paid to AT T averaging that it could not make up for from the monthly fees amounting to a share of out of the monthly fee paid by subscribers equivalent to in adjusted for inflation collected from its subscribers In November HBO then available to cable television and multipoint distribution systems MDS in Pennsylvania New York State New Jersey Delaware and Maryland had reached around subscribers By April the service had around subscribers within its four state service area
On April Levin and Time Life unveiled plans to begin distributing the HBO signal via geostationary communications satellite and feed it directly to cable providers throughout the United States Although television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about venturing into satellite transmissions because of concerns that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or jettison out of their orbit as well as the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes which in were sold for as much as equivalent to in adjusted for inflation among the limited options available HBO found satellite technology to be the only efficient method to expand it into a national pay television service as developing a vast infrastructure of microwave and coaxial telephone relay towers in all states and U S territories including maintaining HBO's existing microwave network would have been cost prohibitive for Time HBO due to limitations by time expense and geography The company announced a million agreement with RCA Americom Communications to lease a transponder on the then under construction Satcom I which was expected to be launched at the end of for a five year term In addition cable television equipment manufacturer Scientific Atlanta per a proposal by company president Sid Topol agreed to build earth based satellite relay stations to beam the signal to and from HBO's Manhattan headquarters and client cable systems HBO also signed an agreement to distribute the satellite feed on eight UA Columbia Cablevision systems in California Texas Florida Arizona Arkansas and Washington State and have earth station receivers built at their headends to intercept and relay the signal Time HBO reached agreements with various cable system operators including MSOs like American Television and Communications Corporation Comcast Cox Cable Jones Intercable Heritage Communications and TelePrompTer Cable to redistribute the satellite feed

Home Box Office Inc began marketing the HBO channel suite and related coastal feeds under the umbrella brand MultiChannel HBO in September the package was rebranded as HBO The Works now exclusively classified to the four HBO multiplex channels and later applied to the three thematic channels that were launched afterward in April The Cinemax tier was accordingly marketed as MultiChannel Cinemax and then MultiMax at the respective times Concurrent with the adoption of The Works package brand two of the channels changed their names and formats HBO was rebranded as HBO Plus and HBO was relaunched as HBO Signature incorporating content catering toward a female audience alongside theatrical films aimed at broader audiences and content from HBO's original made for cable movie and documentary libraries HBO Plus would revert to the HBO moniker in September The HBO Plus brand modified in to HBO remains in use on a multiplex channel of HBO Latin America featuring mainly theatrical movies previously carried on its parent feed HBO Latin America also operates a separate channel sharing the HBO name with the shared U S namesake of both services
On May the HBO multiplex expanded to include two new thematic channels HBO Comedy featuring comedic feature films comedy series from HBO's original programming library and recent and archived HBO comedy specials and HBO Zone aimed at young adults between the ages of and offering theatrical movies comedy and alternative series and documentaries from HBO's original programming library and music videos Rounding out the HBO multiplex expansion was HBO Latino a Spanish language network launched on November featuring a mix of dubbed simulcasts of programming from the primary HBO channel as well as exclusive Spanish originated programs
The multiplex tier continued to be marketed as HBO The Works until December the HBO linear channel suite did not have an official marketed name for fifteen years afterward although HBO and Cinemax's respective multiplex packages were marketed collectively afterward and beforehand as the HBO MAX Pak Since the platform launched in May providers that include HBO Max with subscriptions to the linear HBO channels and HBO On Demand have typically marketed the package under the streaming service's branding Comcast Xfinity however markets it as HBO HBO Max to emphasize the inclusion of HBO Max and HBO's linear and SVOD services in the package HBO Family beginning in and HBO Latino beginning in were the only HBO multiplex channels that maintained dedicated websites independent of although managed in conjunction with the main HBO website to which the other five multiplex channels had their promotion limited both channels had their online content merged into HBO com in February
Depending on the service provider HBO provides up to seven hour multiplex channels all of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition and available as time zone based regional feeds as well as a subscription video on demand service HBO On Demand Off the air maintenance periods of anywhere from a half hour up to two hours occur at varied overnight early morning time slots usually preceding the a m ET PT start of the defined broadcast day once per month on each channel
HBO transmits feeds of its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most the opposite region feed i e the Pacific Time feeds in the Eastern and Central Time Zones and the Eastern Time feeds in the Pacific Mountain and Alaska Time Zones serves as a timeshift channel allowing viewers who may have missed a particular program at its original local airtime to watch it three hours after its initial airing or allowing them to watch a program up to four hours depending on the applicable time zone in advance of their local airtime on their corresponding primary coastal feed Most cable satellite and IPTV providers as well as its Amazon Prime Video and Roku OTT channels only offer the East and West Coast feeds of the main HBO channel some conventional television providers may include coastal feeds of HBO in certain areas while wider availability of coastal feeds for the other five multiplex channels is limited to subscribers of DirecTV YouTube TV and the Hulu live TV service
HBO maintains a separate feed for the Hawaii Aleutian Time Zone the only American cable originated television network to offer a timeshift feed for Hawaii viewers operating a three hour delayed version of the primary channel's Pacific Time feed for subscribers of Oceanic Spectrum which otherwise transmits Pacific Time feeds for the six other HBO multiplex channels The state's other major cable provider Hawaiian Telcom offers the Pacific Time Zone feed of all seven channels
Cinemax is an American pay television network owned by the Home Box Office Inc subsidiary of WarnerMedia Studios Networks Originally developed as a companion service to HBO the channel's programming consists of recent and some older theatrically released feature films original action drama series documentaries and special behind the scenes featurettes While Cinemax and HBO operate as separate premium services their respective channel tiers are very frequently sold as a combined package by many multichannel television providers however customers have the option of subscribing to HBO and Cinemax's corresponding channel packages individually
On August HBO launched Cinemax a companion movie based premium channel created as a direct competitor to two existing movie focused premium channels The Movie Channel then a smaller standalone pay movie service owned by Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment then part owned by WarnerMedia predecessor Warner Communications and Home Theater Network HTN a now defunct service owned by Group W Satellite Communications that focused on G and PG rated films Cinemax succeeded in its early years partly because of its reliance on classic movie releases from the s to the s with some more recent films mixed into its schedule that it presented uncut and without commercial interruption at a time when limited headend channel capacity resulted in cable subscribers only being able to receive as many as three dozen channels up to half of which were reserved for local and out of market broadcast stations and public access channels In most cases cable operators tended to sell Cinemax and HBO as a singular premium bundle usually offered at a discount for customers that decided to subscribe to both channels Cinemax unlike HBO also maintained a hour schedule from its launch one of the first pay cable services to transmit around the clock
Even early in its existence Cinemax tried to diversify its programming beyond movies Beginning in it incorporated music specials and some limited original programming among them SCTV Channel and Max Headroom into the channel's schedule Around this time Cinemax also began airing adult oriented softcore pornographic films and series containing strong sexual content and nudity in varying late night timeslots usually no earlier than p m Eastern and Pacific this programming block originally airing under the Friday After Dark banner renamed Max After Dark in to better reflect its prior expansion to a nightly block would become strongly associated with the channel among its subscribers and in pop culture The channel began gradually scaling back its adult programming offerings in in an effort to shift focus towards its mainstream films and original programs culminating in the removal of Max After Dark content from its linear and on demand platforms in as part of a broader exit from the genre across Home Box Office Inc 's platforms In terms of mainstream programming Cinemax began premiering original action series in the early s beginning with the August debut of Strike Back which has since become the channel's longest running original program As a consequence of WarnerMedia reallocating its programming resources toward the HBO Max streaming service Cinemax eliminated scripted programming altogether after the last of its remaining slate of action series ended in early shifting the channel back to its original structure as a movie exclusive premium service
The linear Cinemax multiplex service as of consists of the primary feed and seven thematic channels MoreMax launched in April as Cinemax in conjunction with HBO 's rollout ActionMax originally launched as Cinemax in ThrillerMax launched in MovieMax originally launched as the female targeted WMax in May Cinem x a Spanish language simulcast feed which originally launched as the young adult focused Max in StarMax launched in May and OuterMax launched in May

The network maintained distinct showcase blocks that aired at various times throughout its schedule Movie of the Week a weekly prime time presentation of network premiere theatrical films Center Stage featuring movies and specials with leading entertainers Family Theater a showcase of G rated films for family viewing Passport an anthology block featuring programs ranging from popular entertainment to cultural events and Merry Go Round a showcase of children's movies specials and short films G and PG rated movies shown on Take usually made their debut on the service no less than days after their initial telecast on HBO Slow subscriber growth and difficulties leveraging HBO's increasingly wide cable carriage to ensure supportable distribution forced the shutdown of Take on January At the time of its shutdown HBO was already placing resources to grow its secondary lower cost maxi pay service Cinemax which launched in August and in its first four years of operation experienced comparatively greater success than Take did in its briefer existence with its mix of recent and older movies including unedited commercial free broadcasts of movies released during the Golden Age of Hollywood film Cinemax replaced Take as an add on to HBO on many cable systems that carried the latter

Beginning with its programming expansion to afternoons in the primary HBO channel had imposed a longstanding watershed policy prohibiting films assigned an R rating from being broadcast before p m ET PT At various points HBO also prohibited showings of X NC rated and foreign art films The policy which extended to films shown between a m and p m ET PT when HBO began offering hour programming on weekends in September may have once stemmed from HBO's pre mid s availability on analog cable tiers whereas its multiplex channels generally require a digital cable subscription or at least scrambling and because of controversy surrounding daytime showings of R rated films that began being scheduled on competing premium services as early as remained in place well after the V chip became standard in newer television sets From April to April rating bumpers preceding HBO telecasts of R rated films included a special disclaimer indicating to viewers that the movie would air exclusively during the designated watershed period Home Box Office HBO will show this feature only at night The watershed policy was extended to cover TV MA rated programs when the TV Parental Guidelines were implemented industry wide on January although HBO had already been withholding airing original programs incorporating mature content that would now qualify for a TV MA rating outside the watershed period As of HBO employs a fairly fluid enforcement of the watershed policy varying based on the content scheduled to air on its main channel during each individual programming day The policy began to be weakened in January when the main HBO channel started allowing original series movies and documentaries given a TV MA rating for strong profanity and or non graphic violence to air during the daytime on Saturdays and Sundays in January HBO began offering occasional Sunday daytime airings of R rated films within its weekly encore showing of the Saturday movie premiere airing as early as p m ET PT depending on the previous night's scheduled premiere film that film's length and the Sunday night block of HBO original series that usually follows the rebroadcast by afternoon R rated movie airings which occasionally have been shown as early as p m ET PT since then were permitted in random afternoon timeslots any day of the week on the main channel at the network's discretion Most of the six HBO thematic multiplex channels except for HBO Family which prohibits programming containing either equivalent rating by effect of the channel's target audience and format air TV MA and R rated programming during morning and afternoon time periods HBO also does not typically allow most NC rated films to be aired on the primary channel or its multiplex channels
HBO pioneered the free preview concept now a standard promotional tool in the pay television industry in as a marketing strategy allowing participating television providers to offer a sampling of HBO's programming for potential subscribers of the service Cable providers were given permission to offer the unscrambled HBO content aired for a single evening or beginning in at the network level as early as on some providers over a two day weekend later extended to three days in then to a Friday to Monday four day weekend format by over a local origination channel though satellite and digital cable providers elected instead to unencrypt the channels corresponding to each HBO feed for the preview period Until interstitials hosted by on air presenters notably including among others Norm Crosby Greg Kinnear Sinbad and Ellen DeGeneres promoting the service and its upcoming programs to prospective subscribers aired alongside on air promotions between programs during the preview weekend although interstitials produced in house or by third party producers were inserted by some providers over the HBO feed during promo breaks for their local or regional audience from September to September the network also aired a minute long promotional free preview show each night of the preview event usually following the headlining prime time film that previewed upcoming HBO programming for prospective and existing subscribers HBO offers between three and five preview events each year normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series and in the past a high profile special or feature film to pay television providers for distribution on a voluntary participation basis The total of participating providers that elected to offer a free preview event varies depending on the given preview period and participating multiple system cable operators may elect to carry the event only in certain regions where they provide service
HBO also produces short segments promoting newer movies with the cooperation of the film studios that hold distribution rights to the projects almost universally by studios maintaining exclusive pay television contracts with HBO and Cinemax and which have been rebroadcast on the former during a film's pay cable distribution window and have usually consisted of either interstitial behind the scenes and interview segments on an upcoming recent theatrical release or red carpet coverage Currently these segments air under the HBO First Look series of to minute long documentary style interstitial specials which debuted in and has no set airing schedule Since the making of specials for which HBO officially no longer uses the First Look name are only identified under the banner for program listing identification The network previously produced three to five minute long feature segments that aired during longer duration between program promotional breaks HBO News formerly titled HBO Entertainment News from to and HBO Behind the Scenes The interstitials particularly those aired as episodes of First Look have also frequently been included as bonus features on DVD and Blu ray releases of the profiled films Since HBO no longer airs behind the scenes interstitials during promotional breaks and has reduced airings of First Look to a few episodes per year as the network has honed its focus on higher profile original programs and studios have increasingly limited their self produced making of featurettes for exclusive physical and digital media release
During the network's early years HBO aired other interstitials in between programs Originally billed as Something Short and Special around InterMissions as the interstitials were begun to be called in September were bannered in two groupings Video Jukebox a showcase of music videos from various artists eventually separated from the other intermission shorts and given various longform spinoffs also titled as Video Jukebox or variants thereof and Special showcasing short films By the short segments had mainly been limited to comedic film shorts originally branded as HBO Comedy Shorts and then as HBO Short Takes which used a set of differing animated intros and youth targeted live action and animated short films seen largely before and during family oriented programming branded as HBO Shorts for Kids Intermission shorts had largely vanished from the channel by Since HBO has occasionally aired short films ranging between and minutes in length at varying times each week during the overnight early morning hours on its primary and select multiplex channels in addition to being available on demand via HBO's various streaming and television VOD platforms including its dedicated portal on HBO Max
HBO innovated original entertainment programming for cable television networks in which a television series both dramatic and comedic made for television movie or entertainment special is developed for and production is primarily if not exclusively handled by the channel of its originating broadcast Since the network has produced a variety of original programs alongside its slate of theatrical motion pictures Most of these programs cater to adult viewers and with limited exceptions are typically assigned TV MA ratings often featuring with such content varying by program high amounts of profanity violence sexual themes and or nudity that basic cable or over the air broadcast channels would be reticent to air because of objections from sponsors and the risk of them pulling or refusing to sell their advertising depending on the objectionable material that a sponsor is comfortable placing their advertising Incidentally since the early s some ad supported basic cable channels like FX and Comedy Central have incorporated stronger profanity somewhat more pervasive violence and sexual themes and or occasional nudity in their original programs similar to content featured in original programs shown on HBO and other premium services with relatively limited advertiser issues
Mainly because it is not beholden to the preferences of advertisers HBO has long been regarded in the entertainment industry for letting program creators maintain full creative autonomy over their projects allowing them to depict gritty subject matter that prior to basic cable channels and streaming services deciding to follow the model set by HBO and other pay cable services had not usually been shown on other television platforms During the Executive Actions symposium held by The Washington Post and George Washington University in April shortly after the launch of the HBO Now streaming service then HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he does not want the network to be akin to Netflix in which users binge watch its television shows and film content saying I don't think it would have been a great thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week I think it was very exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out for an extended period of time Pleper cited that he felt that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers
Some of its original programs however have been aimed at families or children primarily those produced before through its original programming division and third party producers and from to under its agreement with Sesame Workshop children's programs that have aired on HBO have included Sesame Street Fraggle Rock Happily Ever After Fairy Tales for Every Child A Little Curious Crashbox Babar HBO Storybook Musicals Lifestories Families in Crisis Dear America and The Little Lulu Show as well as acquisitions including The Wonderful Wizard of Oz The Legend of White Fang Shakespeare The Animated Tales Animated Hero Classics and The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures Beginning in most of the family or kid oriented programs had migrated to HBO Family with only a limited amount of newer family oriented series being produced for either the primary channel or HBO Family since HBO Family continued to maintain a limited slate of original children's programming until
HBO ventured back into children's programming with its acquisition of first run broadcast and streaming rights to Sesame Street a long running children's television series that had previously aired on the program's longtime broadcaster PBS for the vast majority of its run in a five year programming and development deal with Sesame Workshop that was announced in August Although struck with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion the nonprofit production company reached the deal due to cutbacks resulting from declines in public and private donations distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales Through the agreement HBO obtained first run television rights to Sesame Street beginning with the January debut of its th season with episodes being distributed to PBS following a nine month exclusivity window at no charge to its member stations Sesame Workshop also produced original children's programming content for the channel which also gained exclusive streaming rights to the company's programming library for HBO Go and HBO Now assuming those rights from Amazon Video Netflix and Sesame Workshop's in house subscription streaming service Sesame Go the latter of which will cease to operate as a standalone offering With the debut of HBO Max in May under contract renewal terms agreed upon between the studio and WarnerMedia in October Sesame Street and other Sesame Workshop content will shift from the linear television service to the streaming based HBO Max later in the year
On average movies occupy between and hours of the daily schedule on HBO and HBO or as little as hours on the latter depending upon if HBO is scheduled to carry an extended catch up marathon of an HBO original series and up to hours per day depending on channel format on its five thematic multiplex channels
Since June HBO has offered weekly pay television premieres of recent theatrical and original made for cable movies on Saturdays at p m ET PT Event presentations that have followed the movie such as boxing coverage or concerts have caused rare variances in the preceding film's start time if a live event was scheduled prior to the December discontinuation of HBO's boxing telecasts the premiered film would air after the event in reverse order from the Eastern feed scheduling on the Pacific Time Zone feed From June until May the presentations were marketed as the Saturday Night Guarantee to denote a promise of a new movie premiering every Saturday night all weeks of the year HBO had highlighted said guarantee in promotions for the Saturday premiere night dating to January Before settling on having Saturday serve as its anchor premiere night the scheduling of HBO's prime time film premieres varied between Saturday Sunday and Wednesday depending on competition from broadcast fare during the traditional network television season First run theatrical films debut on average from ten months to one year after a film's initial theatrical run has concluded and no more than six months after their DVD or digital VOD download release COVID related postponements of newer theatrical releases by its distribution partners caused HBO to reduce the frequency of scheduled theatrical premieres in September since then the Saturday slot has been occupied by premieres of original specials and documentaries scheduled at least once per month and since late December airings of older hit movies mainly films released between and distributed under library content deals during gap weeks in the monthly premiere schedule

In HBO and NFL Films began to jointly produce the documentary series Hard Knocks which follows an individual NFL team each season during training camp and their preparations for the upcoming football season
The original HBO logo used from the channel's November launch until April consisted of a minimalist marquee light array surrounding a left adjusted Home Box Office nameplate rendered in mixed caps accompanied by a ticket stub image the former and latter signifying the channel's initial film and event programming focus
The first iteration of the current HBO lettermark designed by then Time Life art director Betty E Brugger was introduced on March it consisted of bold uppercase HBO text incorporating a bullseye mark derived from the tuning knobs found on then current television set and cable converter box models inside the cylindrical O Because of inadvertent consumer impressions of the name appearing as HEO as the design had the O obscure the B 's double curve marketing firm Bemis Balkind modified it into the current trimmer form introduced in April it shifted the O now attached to the B 's full double curve an eighth of an inch rightward and slightly widened the spacing of the lettering and bullseye mark The and versions were used concurrently in on air identifications and certain network promos until the former was fully discontinued in June The simplicity of the logo makes it fairly easy to duplicate of which HBO has taken advantage over the years within its own imaging a proprietary typeface adapted from ITC Avant Garde which like the similar Kabel had previously been used in some on air and print marketing dating to that featured bullseye like glyphs within the 'D' and 'O' capitals was developed internally in as a logotype for HBO Sports including the unit's boxing productions and by Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the linear HBO high definition and VOD services and was later used for the logotype for HBO Go
The logo would become widely recognized through a program opening sequence often nicknamed HBO in Space produced in late by New York City based production firm Liberty Studios and used in some capacity from September to October It replaced a series of six film based animated HBO Feature Movie intros used since April which Canadian pay service First Choice Superchannel later reused for its movie intros The original second version begins inside an apartment where a man tunes a television set's converter box and sits down with his wife to watch HBO A variant that begins with a dark cloudscape fading into the city sequence replaced the early version in November As the camera pans out of the apartment window a continuous stop motion flight filmed on a computer controlled camera occurs over a custom built model cityscape and countryside set against a painted twilight cyclorama After the camera pans skyward at flight's end a bursting stargate effect made using two die cut film slides occurs unveiling a chrome plated brass HBO logo that flies through a starfield As the HBO space station rotates toward the O rainbow hued light rays created using a fiber optic lighting rig encircle that letter's top side sparkling to reveal its interior wall and a center axis in the bullseye mark area and streak counter clockwise inside the O 's inner wall fading in a slide displaying the program presentation type in three dimensional partially underlined block text usually the HBO Feature Presentation card for theatrical movies though varied title cards set mainly to custom end signatures of the accompanying theme music including among others Standing Room Only HBO Premiere Presentation HBO Special On Location and HBO Family Showcase were used for original programs and weekend prime time films before more light streaks sweep and shine across the text and create a sparkling fadeout An abbreviated version shown during most non prime time programming until October and thereafter for early prime time movie telecasts aside from premieres and most weekend presentations commenced from the starburst and the flight of the HBO space station
Most variants of this sequence except for the feature presentation Saturday Night Movie and Sunday Night Movie versions were discontinued on November In September the latter two versions were discontinued and the Feature Presentation variant was extended to all films aired in early prime time with the full length version being used for Saturday premieres and Tuesday re broadcasts Variants of the intro are available on YouTube including one a previously unaired version including two children sitting with the aforementioned couple uploaded to HBO's official YouTube channel the sequence is also used as a movie introduction at the annual HBO Bryant Park Summer Film Festival held since near HBO's now former New York City headquarters and a seldom used World Premiere Presentation variant was featured in the intro of the HBO stand up comedy special Dan Soder Son of a Gary The twelve note musical signature of the sequence's orchestral fanfare originally composed for Score Productions by Ferdinand Jay Smith III of Jay Advertising who adapted the theme from the Scherzo movement of Anton n Dvo k's Ninth Symphony eventually became the network's audio logo in November being styled in various arrangements including horns guitar and piano and sometimes arranged as an abridged nine note variant within HBO's programming bumpers and network IDs since then An extended pop rock version of the theme alternately titled Fantasy was released as both instrumental and lyrical tracks on Smith's album Music Made for Television
Another well known HBO program opener designed by Pacific Data Images in conjunction with the network and commonly nicknamed Neon Lights began non prime time movie presentations from November to October The sequence set to a synth and electric guitar theme begins with a rotation shot of a heliotrope HBO logo on a film strip as blue green and pink light rays penetrate it and four radiating CGI slots one ray then reaches a field of varied color spheres that zoom outward to reveal a light purple HBO logo which is overlaid by a cursive magenta Movie script against a black and purple sphere dotted background
A CGI feature presentation bumper designed by Pittard Sullivan harkening the sequence was used from November to April The sequence replaced a series of six second feature presentation bumpers designed by Telezign also used in some capacity as ID bumpers until November for an accompanying imaging package introduced on November which showed the HBO logo in different situations settings such as appearing as a fish in water as a celebrity arriving at a film premiere in a limousine and as a large neon sign outlining the roof of a skyscraper It commenced outside a movie theater facade displaying the HBO logo and the words Feature Presentation on the marquee leading into a trek across countryside road snowy mountain cliffside and desert settings respectively passing under an electrical transmission tower and an above ground tunnel and through a tank trailer cylinder shaped in each letter of the HBO lettermark a metropolitan neighborhood follows culminating in a flying leap above a bridge between two skyscrapers and a slower speed panning shot above an HBO lettermark shaped lake outlined by spotlights before a D animation of the Feature Presentation text forms An abbreviated variant that preceded movies aired outside of weekend prime time excerpts the footage following the skyscraper leap
