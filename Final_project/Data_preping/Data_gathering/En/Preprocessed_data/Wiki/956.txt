home box office hbo is an american pay television network which is the flagship property of namesake parent subsidiary home box office inc itself a unit owned by warner bros
discovery
programming featured on the network consists primarily of theatrically released motion pictures and original television programs as well as made for cable movies documentaries occasional comedy and concert specials and periodic interstitial programs consisting of short films and making of documentaries
hbo is the oldest and longest continuously operating subscription television service in the united states
hbo pioneered modern pay television upon its launch on november it was the first television service to be directly transmitted and distributed to individual cable television systems and was the conceptual blueprint for the premium channel pay television services sold to subscribers for an extra monthly fee that do not accept traditional advertising and present their programming without editing for objectionable material
it eventually became the first television channel in the world to begin transmitting via satellite expanding the growing regional pay service originally available to cable and multipoint distribution service mds providers in the northern mid atlantic and southern new england into a national television network in september and alongside sister channel cinemax was among the first two american pay television services to offer complimentary multiplexed channels in august
the network operates seven hour linear multiplex channels as well as a traditional subscription video on demand platform hbo on demand and its content is the centerpiece of hbo max an expanded streaming platform operated separately from but sharing management with home box office inc which also includes original programming produced exclusively for the service and content from other warnermedia properties
the hbo linear channels are not presently accessible on hbo max but continue to be available to existing subscribers of traditional and virtual pay television providers including hulu which also sells its hbo add on independently of the streaming service s live tv tier and as live streams to legacy roku customers through existing streaming partnerships with those companies
the overall home box office business unit based at warnermedia s corporate headquarters inside hudson yards in manhattan s west side district is one of warner bros
discovery s most profitable assets generating operating income of nearly billion each year as of
as of september hbo s programming was available to approximately million u s
households that had a subscription to a multichannel television provider million of which receive hbo s primary channel at minimum giving it the largest subscriber total of any american premium channel
from to this distinction was held by starz encore currently owned by lionsgate subsidiary starz inc which according to february nielsen estimates had million pay subscribers vs
the million subscribers that hbo had at the time in addition to its u s
subscriber base hbo distributes its programming content in at least countries worldwide to as of an estimated million cumulative subscribers
hbo subscribers through wireline satellite and virtual pay television providers generally pay for the network as an a la carte service though its seven channel multiplex is usually priced as a single package atop a basic programming tier that includes other cable and satellite originated channels
however the federal communications commission fcc requires cable providers to allow subscribers to just purchase limited basic cable a base service tier including local and in some areas out of market broadcast stations and public educational and government access channels and premium services such as hbo without necessitating that customers subscribe to expanded service
comcast which offered hbo as part of a bundled package of limited basic cable and internet service from october until depending on the market july or january is the only major provider to have actively sold the network s multiplex tier under the regulation s exact structure as a consequence of the primary hbo channel as well as hbo and or hbo signature depending on their local availability as add ons to their basic service being migrated to digital packages on most systems during the early to mid s cable providers typically require the use of a digital set top converter box cablecard or qam tuner to receive hbo
when offered on analog cable tiers hbo subscribers had the option of receiving it through cable ready tuners that were built into analog television sets
hbo also provides its content via direct to consumer web and mobile platforms sold independently of an existing subscription to the linear hbo channel tier through an eponymous unit of its sister subsidiary warnermedia direct operates a co branded subscription video on demand svod streaming service hbo max which launched on may
available on most digital platforms and to linear hbo subscribers of participating television providers it provides an extensive library of hbo original programs including current and past series made for tv films documentaries and specials and theatrical movies from sister studio warner bros
pictures and other studios that distribute film content to the linear hbo television service including titles not licensed for broadcast on hbo and or its multiplex channels hbo max however augments hbo linear content with a proprietary slate of original programming distributed by warnermedia direct and library content sourced from other warnermedia units including its broadcast and basic cable networks primarily the cw cnn tbs tnt and cartoon network adult swim and warner bros
television group as well as from additional third party distributors
hbo also maintains a la carte premium add ons offering its live linear television feeds which are not currently available on the proprietary hbo max service and its vod content library that are available through hulu which includes east and west coast feeds of all seven linear hbo channels and to legacy subscribers of digital channel marketplace the roku channel offering the primary channel s east west feeds
due to user data terms included in distribution agreements for hbo max warnermedia grandfathered the hubbed channels sold through streaming platforms without an existing vmvpd offering to customers who subscribed prior to hbo max s launch on the respective platforms requiring the marketplaces to end grandfathered support for the dedicated hbo channels following an extended contractual sunset window
apple tv channels discontinued support for its hbo channel which was available for sale from the march launch of the marketplace until the may launch of hbo max on july while amazon video channels discontinued its hbo channel which remained available for sale for ten months after hbo max was added to amazon fire platforms in november on september
a tv everywhere service hbo go was launched in february for subscribers of the linear television service since hbo go was relegated from wide distribution in july it has been available as a default service for providers that do not have agreements to offer hbo max which replaced hbo go as the network s companion streaming platform on most pay television providers
through home box office inc it previously maintained hbo now a similarly structured svod streaming service renamed hbo in august that did not require a subscription to the linear hbo television service concluding with its replacement on roku in december it was phased out and superseded by hbo max on platforms that reached agreements to offer the latter service
home box office inc
maintains a marketing unit hbo bulk originally hbo direct from to which handles sales of hbo and cinemax s respective linear channel packages and streaming platforms as well as associated consumer marketing materials to lodging properties apartment buildings co op condominiums college and university dormitories residential assisted living and nursing facilities trucking fleets and hospitals
hbo has maintained near ubiquitous distribution in hotels and motels across the united states through agreements with directv echostar sonifi solutions satellite management services inc telerent leasing corporation total media concepts and world cinema as well as cable providers that maintain hospitality service arrangements with individual hotels and local franchisees of national hotel motel chains
hbo bulk licenses the network s logo to hotel coupon guide publishers which in most instances use the lettermark instead of text only references in amenities summaries although home box office inc
does not keep counts of its national hotel distribution content and connectivity solutions company lodgenet now sonifi solutions estimated in that hbo was available to of all hotels for which the company distributes cable or satellite service
since june through a content partnership with enseo hbo go is distributed to some marriott international hotels around the u s guests staying in marriott hotels that have access to hbo go on connected in room tv sets are not required to sign into the system to access content
hbo began service tests at around one dozen hotels beginning in it began authorizing cable affiliates to provide the service to local hotels and motels in april and signed its first wide hospitality distribution deal with holiday inn in july
many hbo programs have been syndicated to broadcast and ad supported pay television services usually with edits for running time and or objectionable content that indecency regulations enforced by jurisdictional telecommunications agencies or self imposed by network standards and practices departments may prohibit from being broadcast terrestrially or through ad supported cable networks and have been released on dvd and predecessor home video formats
since hbo s more successful series including among others game of thrones sex and the city the sopranos the wire entourage six feet under oz boardwalk empire and true blood have been shown on terrestrial broadcasters in other countries such as in canada australia and much of europe including the united kingdom hbo s programming has the potential of being exposed to a higher percentage of the population in foreign nations in comparison to the united states
because of the cost of hbo which is the most expensive of the u s
premium services costing a monthly fee as of between and depending on the provider and packaging with sister network cinemax many americans only view hbo programs through dvds or in basic cable or broadcast syndication months or even years after these programs have first aired on the network and with editing for both content and to allow advertising although several series have filmed alternate clean scenes intended for syndication runs
cable television executive charles dolan through his company sterling information services founded manhattan cable tv services renamed sterling manhattan cable television in january a cable system franchise serving the lower manhattan section of new york city covering an area extending southward from th street on the upper east side to th street on the upper west side which began limited service in september
manhattan cable was notable for being the first urban underground cable television system to operate in the united states because of a longstanding new york city council ordinance that restricted electrical and telecommunication wiring from being run above ground to prevent widespread service disruptions as well as the multitude of tall buildings on manhattan island causing impairment of television signals the company had laid cable lines beneath the streets of and into buildings throughout manhattan
with external expenses resulting in consistent financial losses in the summer of while on a family vacation to france aboard the queen elizabeth a desperate dolan wanting to help sterling manhattan turn profitable and to prevent time life inc
then the book publishing unit of time inc from pulling its investment in the system developed a proposal for a cable originated television channel
codenamed the green channel the conceptual subscription service would offer unedited theatrical movies licensed from the major hollywood film studios and live sporting events all presented without interruptions by advertising and sold for a flat monthly fee to prospective subscribers
dolan wanted to offset the service s start up costs by having sterling enter into carriage agreements with other cable television providers to transmit and sell the service to their customers and draw revenue from fees charged to subscribers who added the channel onto their existing cable service which then consisted exclusively of local and imported broadcast stations
dolan later presented his idea to management at time life who despite the potential benefit to the company s cable assets were initially hesitant to consider the green channel proposal
attempts to launch pay television services dating back as far as had experienced minimal success because of campaigns backed by movie theater chains and commercial broadcasters to convince television viewers that pay television would threaten the viability of the movie industry and free to air television access limited user interest and fcc restrictions on the types of programming offered to subscription services
however dolan managed to persuade time life to assist him in backing the project
on september the fcc gave preemptive authorization to time life and sterling manhattan cable to begin a pay television operation
on november time inc s board of directors approved the green channel proposal agreeing to give dolan a development grant for the project
time life and sterling communications soon proposed for the sterling cable network to be the name of the new service
discussions to change the service s name took place during a later meeting of dolan and the executive staff he hired to assist in developing the project who ultimately settled on calling it home box office which was meant to convey to potential customers that the service would be their ticket to movies and events that they could see in their own home
the moniker was intended as a placeholder name to meet deadlines to publish a memorandum and research brochures about the new service management intended to come up with a permanent name as development continued however the home box office name stuck
multiple obstacles had to be overcome to get the service on the air
because of a pay television franchise agreement provision by the new york city council that prohibited sterling manhattan and other local cable franchises from telecasting theatrical feature films directly to their customers dolan chose to scout another city with two competitive cable franchisees to serve as home box office s inaugural distributor
originally he settled on the teleservice cable now service electric system in allentown pennsylvania
however management found out that the city and its vicinity fell within the philadelphia ers s mile km television blackout radius which the team enforced to protect revenues generated from ticket sales
since hbo was planning to carry national basketball association nba regular season and playoff games any ers games that the service aired would have been prohibited from being shown within allentown
time life subsequently agreed to an offer by teleservice president john walson to launch hbo on the company s wilkes barre system located outside of the ers blackout radius fed from an at t microwave link at the pan am building in new york
hbo which elected to forego pursuing telecast rights to ers basketball games would sign on to teleservice s allentown system as its second cable affiliate in february
home box office launched at p m
eastern time on november
the service s inaugural program and event telecast a national hockey league nhl game between the new york rangers and the vancouver canucks from madison square garden part of a long term agreement to broadcast sports events based at the manhattan arena was transmitted that evening over channel its original assigned channel on the teleservice system to its initial base of subscribers in wilkes barre
a plaque commemorating the launch event is located at public square in downtown wilkes barre established in honor of service electric s april addition of hbo sister channel cinemax to its lineup the first movie presentation shown on the service aired immediately after the sports event the film sometimes a great notion starring paul newman and henry fonda
initially airing nightly on an open ended schedule dependent on the length of the evening s programs usually from p m
to a m
et home box office s programming initially consisted solely of theatrical films including four or five recent titles per month and event programming
each evening s schedule was arranged to present either a double feature which under fcc anti siphoning rules then maintained to protect programming supply for broadcast stations until they were struck down by the u s
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in march tended to be releases dating no more than two years from their initial theatrical exhibition or a combination of either a sports or special event and a theatrical movie often bridged by a short film or other interstitial content
hbo s launch came with very little fanfare in the press other than print advertisements promoting the launch in the wilkes barre times leader the service s debut lacked coverage from local or national media outlets
the city administrator of wilkes barre declined an offer to attend the launch ceremony while time inc
vice president j
richard munro became stranded in traffic on the george washington bridge en route from manhattan and was not able to arrive in wilkes barre for the ceremony
further complicating preparations for the inaugural telecast in midtown manhattan strong winds produced by a storm system that brought areas of freezing rain over portions of the new york city area that evening toppled the pan am building reception dish being used to relay the home box office signal to microwave towers linked to teleservice s wilkes barre headend
time life representatives sent a technician to repair the antenna in time for the service s launch completing maintenance about minutes before the initial telecast
by the end of the service was received by subscribers all from teleservice customers in wilkes barre this number increased to around subscribers by february across teleservice s wilkes barre allentown and bethlehem pennsylvania systems
on february sterling communications announced it would spin out hbo and associated assets into a new subsidiary home box office inc
time inc s controlling shares in hbo expanded to around equity and time committed a million direct investment in the subsidiary
sterling also purchased additional stock and a converted million note obligation to raise time s equity in the company to in exchange for the added hbo stake
dolan who reportedly had major disagreements with time life management on policy issues claims which the company denied subsequently resigned as chief executive officer of sterling communications and hbo accepting a buyout of a portion of his stock while remaining on the board of directors at both companies in the interim dolan used portions of the sale s proceeds to repurchase time s share of the sterling nassau systems and to start the long island cable community development co
the forerunner to cablevision systems corporation which would be combined with the sterling cablevision systems on long island as the system s parent company
gerald m
levin an entertainment industry attorney previously with new york city based law firm simpson thacher bartlett who had been with home box office since it began operations as its director of finance and later as its vice president and director of programming replaced dolan as the company s president and ceo
following an aborted attempt by warner communications to purchase sterling on july time inc
reached an agreement to purchase and assume debt of sterling communications for million
time completed its acquisition of sterling on september formally dissolving the sterling holding company and transferring home box office and sterling manhattan cable to its time life broadcast division
the sterling name was subsequently removed from the manhattan system which was renamed manhattan cable television in august as the acquisition was being completed hbo was struggling to grow by october the service had around subscribers across cable systems in pennsylvania and southern new york that cumulatively served subscribers and it was suffering from a significant churn rate as subscribers who found the channel s program scheduling repetitive because of the limited allotment of movies outside of special events decided to cancel their service
in january hbo expanded its programming to an average of eight hours per day from p m
to a m
et pt on weekdays and twelve hours from p m
to a m
et on weekends depending on that day s programming lineup
along with movies and sports programming at this time had expanded to include concert specials and other music programs daytime children s programs and various instructional series
over the two years following its launch home box office steadily expanded its regional reach by january hbo was available on cable systems in new york state and pennsylvania and by june of that year its regional coverage expanded into new jersey
after receiving permission by the new york city board of estimate to offer hbo on a two year experimental basis on a leased channel in exchange for a fee paid to the city from the system s subscription revenue share manhattan cable began offering hbo to its subscribers in midtown and lower manhattan on october giving the service much needed distribution in america s largest city
manhattan cable turned its first quarterly profits in the first half of generated in part from among other factors revenue from hbo subscriptions
as home box office s distribution expanded throughout the northern mid atlantic and southern new england regions time sterling established a network of microwave receivers and connecting cables on utility landlines to feed hbo s programming from the new york relay antenna to the service s participating cable systems
although hbo s base was steadily growing sterling manhattan cable s deficits continued because its subscriber base totaling customers was still relatively small to generate revenue hbo also faced financial issues losing nearly per month in part due to microwave link maintenance fees it paid to at t averaging that it could not make up for from the monthly fees amounting to a share of out of the monthly fee paid by subscribers equivalent to in adjusted for inflation collected from its subscribers
in november hbo then available to cable television and multipoint distribution systems mds in pennsylvania new york state new jersey delaware and maryland had reached around subscribers
by april the service had around subscribers within its four state service area
on april levin and time life unveiled plans to begin distributing the hbo signal via geostationary communications satellite and feed it directly to cable providers throughout the united states
although television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about venturing into satellite transmissions because of concerns that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or jettison out of their orbit as well as the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes which in were sold for as much as equivalent to in adjusted for inflation among the limited options available hbo found satellite technology to be the only efficient method to expand it into a national pay television service as developing a vast infrastructure of microwave and coaxial telephone relay towers in all states and u s
territories including maintaining hbo s existing microwave network would have been cost prohibitive for time hbo due to limitations by time expense and geography
the company announced a million agreement with rca americom communications to lease a transponder on the then under construction satcom i which was expected to be launched at the end of for a five year term
in addition cable television equipment manufacturer scientific atlanta per a proposal by company president sid topol agreed to build earth based satellite relay stations to beam the signal to and from hbo s manhattan headquarters and client cable systems
hbo also signed an agreement to distribute the satellite feed on eight ua columbia cablevision systems in california texas florida arizona arkansas and washington state and have earth station receivers built at their headends to intercept and relay the signal

announced plans to scramble the hbo and cinemax satellite feeds using the videocipher ii encryption system becoming the first satellite delivered television networks to encrypt their signals from unauthorized reception by approximately million c band dish owners as well as by various businesses including hotels motels and bars that used rooftop satellite antennas to freely receive hbo rather than paying for the network through its affiliated cable systems
periodic testing of videocipher ii signal scrambling began to be carried out during promotional breaks between programs on hbo s pacific time zone feed on april and on its eastern time zone feed on april
hbo and cinemax began scrambling their signals full time on january requiring customers to pay an extra fee to receive one or both networks as their subscribers through cable systems had long done
the switchover elicited widespread complaints fielded to home box office inc
and satellite dish retailers from television receive only tvro dish users who previously could view hbo and cinemax at no extra cost particularly because of the cost of videocipher ii set top descramblers needed to unencrypt the signal retailing up to plus each for a monthly subscription or for a bundling of both hbo and cinemax equal to or slightly higher than the networks cable subscription rates and rental fees for the videocipher receivers and spurred congressional lobbying efforts to protect access to satellite transmissions by the satellite television industry association space and independent satellite dealers who were worried about the negative impact that the full time signal scrambling of hbo and cinemax and its expansion to other basic and premium cable networks had on the satellite business
soon after the move satellite dish sales began to plummet sharply and the lost revenue forced several satellite retailers across the u s
to close
in protest of the adoption of full time scrambling on april john r
macdougall an ocala florida satellite dish retailer calling himself captain midnight committed an act of broadcast signal intrusion by redirecting a receiver dish towards hbo s galaxy transponder and intercept the network s signal

announced plans to launch two additional channels of hbo and cinemax becoming the first subscription television services to launch multiplexed companion channels a term coined by then ceo michael fuchs to equate the programming choices that would be provided to subscribers of the channel tier to that offered by multi screen movie theaters each available at no extra charge to subscribers of one or both networks
the three prior premium services that hbo launched between and cinemax and the now defunct take and festival were developed as standalone services that could be purchased separately from and optionally packaged with hbo on august through a test launch of the three channels over those systems telecable customers in overland park kansas racine wisconsin and suburban dallas richardson and plano texas that subscribed to either service began receiving two additional hbo channels and or a secondary channel of cinemax
hbo hbo and cinemax now moremax each offered distinct schedules of programs culled from hbo and cinemax s movie and original programming libraries separate from offerings shown concurrently on their respective parent primary channels
cinemax was originally scheduled to launch a tertiary channel cinemax on november but these plans were shelved until while most cable providers collectively offered the hbo and cinemax multiplex channels in individual tiers some providers had sold their secondary and or tertiary channels as optional add ons to expanded basic subscribers this practice was discontinued when hbo and cinemax began migrating to digital cable in the early s as the respective multiplex channels were being packaged in each tier mandatorily
at the time the multiplex test was announced hbo s then executive vice president of marketing john k
billock now president of u s
operations for the network cited internal research that indicated hbo and cinemax subscribers were prone to cancelling their subscriptions because they either believed that neither tended to have anything on worth watching or when presented with a full monthly schedule felt that programs they wanted to watch did not air at preferable times
a november acnielsen survey of telecable subscribers in the three launch markets determined that hbo and cinemax s multiplex offerings created positive impacts on subscriber usage and attitudes that factored into whether a subscriber elected to cancel their hbo and or cinemax service with declines in negative opinions on pricing from to and the perception of too many repeat program showings each month from to and increases in overall usage rising by and favorability ratings among home media from to
in february in anticipation of the adoption of mpeg digital compression codecs that would allow cable providers to offer digital cable service home box office inc
announced plans to expand its multiplex services across hbo and cinemax to twelve channels counting time zone based feeds encompassing a fourth hbo channel and two additional cinemax channels originally projected for a spring launch
the hbo multiplex expanded to include a fourth channel on december with the launch of hbo family focusing on family oriented feature films and television series aimed at younger children
hbo family s launch coincided with the launch of mountain time zone feeds of hbo hbo cinemax and cinemax which were the first subfeeds ever offered by a subscription television service to specifically serve that time zone
home box office inc
began marketing the hbo channel suite and related coastal feeds under the umbrella brand multichannel hbo in september the package was rebranded as hbo the works now exclusively classified to the four hbo multiplex channels and later applied to the three thematic channels that were launched afterward in april
the cinemax tier was accordingly marketed as multichannel cinemax and then multimax at the respective times concurrent with the adoption of the works package brand two of the channels changed their names and formats hbo was rebranded as hbo plus and hbo was relaunched as hbo signature incorporating content catering toward a female audience alongside theatrical films aimed at broader audiences and content from hbo s original made for cable movie and documentary libraries
hbo plus would revert to the hbo moniker in september
the hbo plus brand modified in to hbo remains in use on a multiplex channel of hbo latin america featuring mainly theatrical movies previously carried on its parent feed hbo latin america also operates a separate channel sharing the hbo name with the shared u s
namesake of both services
on may the hbo multiplex expanded to include two new thematic channels hbo comedy featuring comedic feature films comedy series from hbo s original programming library and recent and archived hbo comedy specials and hbo zone aimed at young adults between the ages of and offering theatrical movies comedy and alternative series and documentaries from hbo s original programming library and music videos
rounding out the hbo multiplex expansion was hbo latino a spanish language network launched on november featuring a mix of dubbed simulcasts of programming from the primary hbo channel as well as exclusive spanish originated programs
the multiplex tier continued to be marketed as hbo the works until december the hbo linear channel suite did not have an official marketed name for fifteen years afterward although hbo and cinemax s respective multiplex packages were marketed collectively afterward and beforehand as the hbo max pak
since the platform launched in may providers that include hbo max with subscriptions to the linear hbo channels and hbo on demand have typically marketed the package under the streaming service s branding comcast xfinity however markets it as hbo hbo max to emphasize the inclusion of hbo max and hbo s linear and svod services in the package
hbo family beginning in and hbo latino beginning in were the only hbo multiplex channels that maintained dedicated websites independent of although managed in conjunction with the main hbo website to which the other five multiplex channels had their promotion limited both channels had their online content merged into hbo com in february
depending on the service provider hbo provides up to seven hour multiplex channels all of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition and available as time zone based regional feeds as well as a subscription video on demand service hbo on demand
off the air maintenance periods of anywhere from a half hour up to two hours occur at varied overnight early morning time slots usually preceding the a m
et pt start of the defined broadcast day once per month on each channel
hbo transmits feeds of its primary and multiplex channels on both eastern and pacific time zone schedules
the respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most the opposite region feed i e the pacific time feeds in the eastern and central time zones and the eastern time feeds in the pacific mountain and alaska time zones serves as a timeshift channel allowing viewers who may have missed a particular program at its original local airtime to watch it three hours after its initial airing or allowing them to watch a program up to four hours depending on the applicable time zone in advance of their local airtime on their corresponding primary coastal feed
most cable satellite and iptv providers as well as its amazon prime video and roku ott channels only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main hbo channel some conventional television providers may include coastal feeds of hbo in certain areas while wider availability of coastal feeds for the other five multiplex channels is limited to subscribers of directv youtube tv and the hulu live tv service
hbo maintains a separate feed for the hawaii aleutian time zone the only american cable originated television network to offer a timeshift feed for hawaii viewers operating a three hour delayed version of the primary channel s pacific time feed for subscribers of oceanic spectrum which otherwise transmits pacific time feeds for the six other hbo multiplex channels
the state s other major cable provider hawaiian telcom offers the pacific time zone feed of all seven channels
cinemax is an american pay television network owned by the home box office inc
subsidiary of warnermedia studios networks
originally developed as a companion service to hbo the channel s programming consists of recent and some older theatrically released feature films original action drama series documentaries and special behind the scenes featurettes
while cinemax and hbo operate as separate premium services their respective channel tiers are very frequently sold as a combined package by many multichannel television providers however customers have the option of subscribing to hbo and cinemax s corresponding channel packages individually
on august hbo launched cinemax a companion movie based premium channel created as a direct competitor to two existing movie focused premium channels the movie channel then a smaller standalone pay movie service owned by warner amex satellite entertainment then part owned by warnermedia predecessor warner communications and home theater network htn a now defunct service owned by group w satellite communications that focused on g and pg rated films
cinemax succeeded in its early years partly because of its reliance on classic movie releases from the s to the s with some more recent films mixed into its schedule that it presented uncut and without commercial interruption at a time when limited headend channel capacity resulted in cable subscribers only being able to receive as many as three dozen channels up to half of which were reserved for local and out of market broadcast stations and public access channels
in most cases cable operators tended to sell cinemax and hbo as a singular premium bundle usually offered at a discount for customers that decided to subscribe to both channels
cinemax unlike hbo also maintained a hour schedule from its launch one of the first pay cable services to transmit around the clock
even early in its existence cinemax tried to diversify its programming beyond movies
beginning in it incorporated music specials and some limited original programming among them sctv channel and max headroom into the channel s schedule
around this time cinemax also began airing adult oriented softcore pornographic films and series containing strong sexual content and nudity in varying late night timeslots usually no earlier than p m
eastern and pacific this programming block originally airing under the friday after dark banner renamed max after dark in to better reflect its prior expansion to a nightly block would become strongly associated with the channel among its subscribers and in pop culture
the channel began gradually scaling back its adult programming offerings in in an effort to shift focus towards its mainstream films and original programs culminating in the removal of max after dark content from its linear and on demand platforms in as part of a broader exit from the genre across home box office inc s platforms
in terms of mainstream programming cinemax began premiering original action series in the early s beginning with the august debut of strike back which has since become the channel s longest running original program
as a consequence of warnermedia reallocating its programming resources toward the hbo max streaming service cinemax eliminated scripted programming altogether after the last of its remaining slate of action series ended in early shifting the channel back to its original structure as a movie exclusive premium service
the linear cinemax multiplex service as of consists of the primary feed and seven thematic channels moremax launched in april as cinemax in conjunction with hbo s rollout actionmax originally launched as cinemax in thrillermax launched in moviemax originally launched as the female targeted wmax in may cinem x a spanish language simulcast feed which originally launched as the young adult focused max in starmax launched in may and outermax launched in may
magnolia network is an american multinational basic cable network owned by warner bros
discovery and chip and joanna gaines formerly known as diy network
in april discovery officially announced their new venture and that its linear television component would launch some time in replacing diy network though it was delayed until due to the covid pandemic impacting the ability to produce the network s launch programming and ending up launching several months before the closing of the warner bros
and discovery inc
merger
due to the delay in production some magnolia network programming debuted as part of the january launch of the discovery streaming service
the transition of the linear diy network to magnolia network occurred on january
in april discovery inc
merged with warnermedia to form warner bros
discovery
on april it was reported that after the completion of the merger magnolia network leadership would report to hbo and hbo max s chief content officer casey bloys rather than directly to zaslav nor kathleen finch who previously oversaw discovery s lifestyle brands and now oversees most of warner bros
discovery s u s
cable networks deadline suggested the possibility that magnolia network could contribute content such as library programs or original series to hbo max noting that some of the service s scripted series have appealed to a similar adult female demographic to magnolia network hbo max s own forays into unscripted content and reports that the gaines had shown interest in working on scripted projects
take informally referred to as hbo take is a defunct american premium cable television network that was owned by home box office inc then a subsidiary of the time life division of time inc and which operated from april to january
marketed at a family audience and the first attempt at a companion pay service by the corporate hbo entity the channel s programming consisted of recent and older theatrically released motion pictures
take was the first of three efforts by hbo to maintain a family oriented pay service predating the similarly formatted and short lived mini pay service festival launched in and the present day multiplex channel hbo family launched in
on september home box office inc
announced it would launch a family oriented companion mini pay premium service a channel marketed as a lower priced pay add on to cable operators often sold in a tier with co owned or competing premium services which would be transmitted via a fourth satcom i transponder leased to hbo
originally planned to launch around january take launched on april developed at the request of hbo s affiliate cable providers to meet consumer demand for an additional pay television offering take was designed to cater to family audiences and like hbo s later family programming services festival and hbo family structured its theatrical inventory to exclude r rated films
the service s format was intended to cater to prospective customers who were reluctant to pay for an hbo subscription because of its cost and the potentially objectionable content in some of its programming
the network maintained distinct showcase blocks that aired at various times throughout its schedule movie of the week a weekly prime time presentation of network premiere theatrical films center stage featuring movies and specials with leading entertainers family theater a showcase of g rated films for family viewing passport an anthology block featuring programs ranging from popular entertainment to cultural events and merry go round a showcase of children s movies specials and short films
g and pg rated movies shown on take usually made their debut on the service no less than days after their initial telecast on hbo
slow subscriber growth and difficulties leveraging hbo s increasingly wide cable carriage to ensure supportable distribution forced the shutdown of take on january
at the time of its shutdown hbo was already placing resources to grow its secondary lower cost maxi pay service cinemax which launched in august and in its first four years of operation experienced comparatively greater success than take did in its briefer existence with its mix of recent and older movies including unedited commercial free broadcasts of movies released during the golden age of hollywood film
cinemax replaced take as an add on to hbo on many cable systems that carried the latter
festival is a defunct american premium cable television network that was owned by home box office inc then a subsidiary of time inc which operated from to
the channel s programming consisted of uncut and re edited versions of recent and older theatrically released motion pictures along with original music comedy and nature specials sourced from the parent hbo channel aimed at a family audience
on april hbo began test marketing festival on six cable systems owned by then sister company american television and communications corporation
it was aimed at older audiences who objected to programming containing violence and sexual situations on other premium services television viewers that did not already have cable service and basic cable subscribers with no existing subscription to a premium service focusing classic and recent hit movies documentaries and hbo s original stand up comedy concert nature and ice skating specials
notably for a premium service festival aired re edited r rated movies intended to fit a pg rating
festival ceased operations on december home box office inc
cited the inability to expand distribution because of channel capacity limitations at most cable company headends for the closure of the channel
at the time of its shutdown festival had an estimated subscribers far below hbo s reach of million subscribers and a distant last place in subscriber count among the eight american premium cable services in operation at the time
selecciones en espa ol de hbo y cinemax later renamed hbo en espa ol in september is a defunct american spanish language premium cable television service that was owned by home box office inc then a subsidiary of time warner which operated from to
the service s programming consisted of spanish dubbed versions of recent and older theatrically released motion pictures and select hbo original and event programming aimed at a hispanic and latino audience

from the rollout of hd simulcasts for the hbo multiplex feeds until the mid s the majority of pay television providers that carried hbo hd generally offered only the main channel in high definition with hd carriage of the multiplex channels varying by market
as of most providers transmit all seven hbo multiplex channels in hd either on a dedicated hd channel tier separate from their sd assignments or as hybrid sd hd feeds
home box office inc
announced plans to launch a high definition simulcast feed on june with initial plans for a rollout to television providers as early as the summer of when electronics manufacturers planned to begin retailing their initial line of hd capable television sets
hbo began transmitting a high definition simulcast feed on march becoming the first american cable television network to begin simulcast their programming in the format
for the first months of its existence the hd feed only transmitted theatrical films from the network s programming suppliers initially accounting for about of its available feature film output expanding to around by early and hbo s in house original movies in the format as existing widescreen prints of those films were already scalable in the widescreen aspect ratio and could readily be upconverted to hd resolution
original programming began to be made available in hd on january when the network commenced a week sunday encore presentation of the second season of the sopranos in remastered i hd
hbo had been requiring the producers of its original series to film their episodes in widescreen subsequently downconverted for the standard definition feed to fit television screens since to future proof them for remastering in hd the third season premiere of the mob drama mr
ruggerio s neighborhood on march was the first first run episode of an hbo series to be transmitted in high definition from its initial telecast with all subsequent episodes being delivered to hbo exclusively on hd videotape and downcoverted for the main standard definition feed
bob zitter then the network s senior vice president of technology operations disclosed to multichannel news in january that hbo elected to delay offering its original series in high definition until there was both sustainable consumer penetration of high definition television sets and wide accessibility of hdtv equipment on the retail market
sports telecasts were upgraded to hd on september with an hbo world championship boxing fight card headlined by roy jones jr
and glen johnson
hd programming can also be broadcast in dolby digital
the network began transmitting its six multiplex channels in high definition on september when directv began offering hd simulcast feeds of hbo hbo family hbo signature and hbo latino

hbo on demand the first svod service to be offered by an american premium service launched on july over then sister company time warner cable s columbia south carolina system

hbo go along with companion service hbo now and hbo max did not provide live simulcasts of the seven linear hbo channels
hbo and cinemax are the only american premium television services not to include live network feeds in their proprietary streaming vod platforms
based on the prototype hbo on broadband service that was originally launched in january to linear hbo subscribers of time warner cable s green bay and milwaukee wisconsin systems hbo go launched nationwide on february initially available to existing hbo subscribers signed with verizon fios
initially carrying hours of program content available for streaming in standard or high definition the on demand streaming service was conceived as a tv everywhere platform marketed exclusively to existing subscribers of the linear hbo television service
the hbo go website and mobile apps including its apps for streaming devices such as roku and apple tv and some video game consoles required a password accompanying a linear hbo subscription by a participating television provider to access content on the service on june warnermedia announced that hbo go s mobile and digital media player apps would be discontinued in the u s
on july as most traditional and virtual mvpds have secured distribution deals for hbo max
those providers that have not yet made an hbo max deal continue to allow customer access to hbo go mainly altice usa s brands mediacom smaller cable providers and closed circuit university television systems which had not had personnel available during the covid pandemic to contractually transfer their credentials to hbo max though only through the hbo go desktop website

on october hbo announced plans to launch an ott subscription streaming service in which would be distributed as a standalone offering that does not require an existing television subscription to access content
the service hbo now was unveiled on march and officially launched one month later on april
the service was initially available via apple inc
to apple tv and ios devices for a three month exclusivity period following its formal launch before becoming available for subscription through other participating internet service providers
available for per month hbo now was identical to the former hbo go in terms of content and features
new episodes of hbo series were made available for streaming on the initial airdate and usually uploaded at their normal airtime of their original broadcast on the main linear hbo channel
by february subscribership of hbo now subscribers had reached over million customers
on june warnermedia announced that hbo now would be rebranded solely as hbo on august
following hbo max s launch the hbo streaming service had served as the network s default ott platform for roku customers as warnermedia has not yet signed deals to distribute hbo max on that platform until its replacement by hbo max on those platforms in november it also served as a default hbo ott service for amazon fire and fire tv customers
as a consequence of an agreement with warnermedia announced the day prior to offer hbo max on roku devices starting the following day the hbo streaming service was discontinued on december
hbo max is an over the top subscription streaming service operated by warnermedia direct built mainly around hbo s programming and other warner bros
discovery assets
hbo s programming schedule currently consists largely of theatrically released feature films and adult oriented original series including as of april dramas such as westworld succession euphoria perry mason my brilliant friend and the gilded age comedies such as curb your enthusiasm barry los espookys and the righteous gemstones and topical satires last week tonight with john oliver and real time with bill maher
in addition hbo also carries documentary films mainly produced through in house production unit hbo documentary films sports focused documentary and magazine series produced through its hbo sports production unit occasional original made for tv movies occasional original concert and stand up comedy specials and short form behind the scenes specials centered mainly on theatrical films either running in their initial theatrical or hbo cinemax broadcast window
newer episodes of most hbo original programs usually air over its main channel after p m
eastern and pacific time depending partly on the day s programming schedule repeats of original series made for cable movies and documentaries typically excluding programs with graphic violent or sexual content are shown during the daytime hours on the main channel and at various times on hbo s themed channels
four of the themed multiplex channels hbo signature hbo family hbo comedy and hbo zone also each carry archived hbo original series and specials dating to the s
outside of hbo family which regularly airs archived family oriented series and specials airings of older original programs may vary based on the channel s daily schedule
beginning with its programming expansion to afternoons in the primary hbo channel had imposed a longstanding watershed policy prohibiting films assigned an r rating from being broadcast before p m
et pt
at various points hbo also prohibited showings of x nc rated and foreign art films the policy which extended to films shown between a m
and p m
et pt when hbo began offering hour programming on weekends in september may have once stemmed from hbo s pre mid s availability on analog cable tiers whereas its multiplex channels generally require a digital cable subscription or at least scrambling and because of controversy surrounding daytime showings of r rated films that began being scheduled on competing premium services as early as remained in place well after the v chip became standard in newer television sets
from april to april rating bumpers preceding hbo telecasts of r rated films included a special disclaimer indicating to viewers that the movie would air exclusively during the designated watershed period home box office hbo will show this feature only at night
the watershed policy was extended to cover tv ma rated programs when the tv parental guidelines were implemented industry wide on january although hbo had already been withholding airing original programs incorporating mature content that would now qualify for a tv ma rating outside the watershed period
as of hbo employs a fairly fluid enforcement of the watershed policy varying based on the content scheduled to air on its main channel during each individual programming day
the policy began to be weakened in january when the main hbo channel started allowing original series movies and documentaries given a tv ma rating for strong profanity and or non graphic violence to air during the daytime on saturdays and sundays in january hbo began offering occasional sunday daytime airings of r rated films within its weekly encore showing of the saturday movie premiere airing as early as p m
et pt depending on the previous night s scheduled premiere film that film s length and the sunday night block of hbo original series that usually follows the rebroadcast by afternoon r rated movie airings which occasionally have been shown as early as p m
et pt since then were permitted in random afternoon timeslots any day of the week on the main channel at the network s discretion
most of the six hbo thematic multiplex channels except for hbo family which prohibits programming containing either equivalent rating by effect of the channel s target audience and format air tv ma and r rated programming during morning and afternoon time periods
hbo also does not typically allow most nc rated films to be aired on the primary channel or its multiplex channels
hbo pioneered the free preview concept now a standard promotional tool in the pay television industry in as a marketing strategy allowing participating television providers to offer a sampling of hbo s programming for potential subscribers of the service
cable providers were given permission to offer the unscrambled hbo content aired for a single evening or beginning in at the network level as early as on some providers over a two day weekend later extended to three days in then to a friday to monday four day weekend format by over a local origination channel though satellite and digital cable providers elected instead to unencrypt the channels corresponding to each hbo feed for the preview period
until interstitials hosted by on air presenters notably including among others norm crosby greg kinnear sinbad and ellen degeneres promoting the service and its upcoming programs to prospective subscribers aired alongside on air promotions between programs during the preview weekend although interstitials produced in house or by third party producers were inserted by some providers over the hbo feed during promo breaks for their local or regional audience from september to september the network also aired a minute long promotional free preview show each night of the preview event usually following the headlining prime time film that previewed upcoming hbo programming for prospective and existing subscribers
hbo offers between three and five preview events each year normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series and in the past a high profile special or feature film to pay television providers for distribution on a voluntary participation basis
the total of participating providers that elected to offer a free preview event varies depending on the given preview period and participating multiple system cable operators may elect to carry the event only in certain regions where they provide service
hbo also produces short segments promoting newer movies with the cooperation of the film studios that hold distribution rights to the projects almost universally by studios maintaining exclusive pay television contracts with hbo and cinemax and which have been rebroadcast on the former during a film s pay cable distribution window and have usually consisted of either interstitial behind the scenes and interview segments on an upcoming recent theatrical release or red carpet coverage
currently these segments air under the hbo first look series of to minute long documentary style interstitial specials which debuted in and has no set airing schedule
since the making of specials for which hbo officially no longer uses the first look name are only identified under the banner for program listing identification the network previously produced three to five minute long feature segments that aired during longer duration between program promotional breaks hbo news formerly titled hbo entertainment news from to and hbo behind the scenes
the interstitials particularly those aired as episodes of first look have also frequently been included as bonus features on dvd and blu ray releases of the profiled films
since hbo no longer airs behind the scenes interstitials during promotional breaks and has reduced airings of first look to a few episodes per year as the network has honed its focus on higher profile original programs and studios have increasingly limited their self produced making of featurettes for exclusive physical and digital media release
during the network s early years hbo aired other interstitials in between programs
originally billed as something short and special around intermissions as the interstitials were begun to be called in september were bannered in two groupings video jukebox a showcase of music videos from various artists eventually separated from the other intermission shorts and given various longform spinoffs also titled as video jukebox or variants thereof and special showcasing short films
by the short segments had mainly been limited to comedic film shorts originally branded as hbo comedy shorts and then as hbo short takes which used a set of differing animated intros and youth targeted live action and animated short films seen largely before and during family oriented programming branded as hbo shorts for kids
intermission shorts had largely vanished from the channel by
since hbo has occasionally aired short films ranging between and minutes in length at varying times each week during the overnight early morning hours on its primary and select multiplex channels in addition to being available on demand via hbo s various streaming and television vod platforms including its dedicated portal on hbo max
hbo innovated original entertainment programming for cable television networks in which a television series both dramatic and comedic made for television movie or entertainment special is developed for and production is primarily if not exclusively handled by the channel of its originating broadcast
since the network has produced a variety of original programs alongside its slate of theatrical motion pictures
most of these programs cater to adult viewers and with limited exceptions are typically assigned tv ma ratings often featuring with such content varying by program high amounts of profanity violence sexual themes and or nudity that basic cable or over the air broadcast channels would be reticent to air because of objections from sponsors and the risk of them pulling or refusing to sell their advertising depending on the objectionable material that a sponsor is comfortable placing their advertising
incidentally since the early s some ad supported basic cable channels like fx and comedy central have incorporated stronger profanity somewhat more pervasive violence and sexual themes and or occasional nudity in their original programs similar to content featured in original programs shown on hbo and other premium services with relatively limited advertiser issues
mainly because it is not beholden to the preferences of advertisers hbo has long been regarded in the entertainment industry for letting program creators maintain full creative autonomy over their projects allowing them to depict gritty subject matter that prior to basic cable channels and streaming services deciding to follow the model set by hbo and other pay cable services had not usually been shown on other television platforms
during the executive actions symposium held by the washington post and george washington university in april shortly after the launch of the hbo now streaming service then hbo ceo richard plepler said that he does not want the network to be akin to netflix in which users binge watch its television shows and film content saying i don t think it would have been a great thing for hbo or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week i think it was very exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out for an extended period of time pleper cited that he felt that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of hbo and hbo watchers
some of its original programs however have been aimed at families or children primarily those produced before through its original programming division and third party producers and from to under its agreement with sesame workshop children s programs that have aired on hbo have included sesame street fraggle rock happily ever after fairy tales for every child a little curious crashbox babar hbo storybook musicals lifestories families in crisis dear america and the little lulu show as well as acquisitions including the wonderful wizard of oz the legend of white fang shakespeare the animated tales animated hero classics and the country mouse and the city mouse adventures
beginning in most of the family or kid oriented programs had migrated to hbo family with only a limited amount of newer family oriented series being produced for either the primary channel or hbo family since
hbo family continued to maintain a limited slate of original children s programming until
hbo ventured back into children s programming with its acquisition of first run broadcast and streaming rights to sesame street a long running children s television series that had previously aired on the program s longtime broadcaster pbs for the vast majority of its run in a five year programming and development deal with sesame workshop that was announced in august
although struck with the intent to having the show remain on pbs in some fashion the nonprofit production company reached the deal due to cutbacks resulting from declines in public and private donations distribution fees paid by pbs member stations and licensing for merchandise sales
through the agreement hbo obtained first run television rights to sesame street beginning with the january debut of its th season with episodes being distributed to pbs following a nine month exclusivity window at no charge to its member stations sesame workshop also produced original children s programming content for the channel which also gained exclusive streaming rights to the company s programming library for hbo go and hbo now assuming those rights from amazon video netflix and sesame workshop s in house subscription streaming service sesame go the latter of which will cease to operate as a standalone offering

hbo also produces made for cable television movies through sister production unit hbo films which traces its origins to the founding of hbo premiere films
originally developed to produce original television movies and miniseries with higher budgets and production values than other telefilms the film unit s first original movie project was the biopic the terry fox story
differing from other direct to cable television films most of hbo s original movies have been helmed by major film actors such as james stewart michael douglas drew barrymore stanley tucci halle berry and elizabeth taylor
the unit which would be rechristened hbo pictures in expanded beyond its telefilm slate which was scaled back to focus on independent film production in
the current hbo films unit was formed in october through the consolidation of hbo pictures and hbo nyc productions originally created as hbo showcase in and following its june restructuring had also occasionally produced drama series for the network
since hbo films has also maintained an exclusive licensing agreement with hbo later expanded to include cinemax for theatrical productions produced by the unit and since hbo became co owned with the film division through the time warner merger distributed through warner bros
entertainment
films to which hbo maintains traditional telecast and streaming rights will usually also be shown on the cinemax television and streaming platforms during their licensing agreement period either after a film title completes its hbo window or transfers between services over certain months during the contractual period
feature films from the aforementioned studios that maintain joint licensing contracts encompassing both services will typically make their premium television debut on hbo approximately two to three months before their premiere on cinemax and vice versa
hbo s relationship with warner bros
began with a five year distribution agreement signed in june encompassing films released between january and december the estimated cost of the initial pay cable rights were between million and million depending on the overall performance of warner s films and hbo cinemax s respective subscriber counts
although the warner deal was initially non exclusive a preemptive strategy in the event that its co owned rivals showtime and the movie channel which elected not to pick up any spare warner titles sought full exclusivity over movie rights the terms gave warner an option to require hbo to acquire exclusive rights to titles covered under the remainder of the deal for million per year in addition to a guaranteed million fee for each year of the contract
as a result of the time warner merger hbo and cinemax hold pay cable exclusivity over all newer warner bros
films for the duration of their joint ownership
th century fox first signed a non exclusive deal with hbo in january covering fox films released between and along with a production co financing agreement involving hbo original programs the pact transitioned to an exclusivity arrangement with the renewal
the first run film output agreement with fox was renewed by hbo for ten years on august with a provision allowing the studio to release its films through digital platforms such as itunes and amazon video during the channel s term of license of an acquired film for the first time
while the walt disney company completed its acquisition of th century fox in march disney maintains an output deal with its in house streaming services disney and hulu for films produced and or distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures and its subsidiaries which have not distributed their films over a traditional pay cable service since the studio s agreement with hbo rival starz ended in
disney continued to honor the output deal with hbo until november when warnermedia and disney announced that the deal would be expanded to the end of with an amendment that will allow half of th century studios slate to be shared between hbo hbo max and disney or hulu during the pay one window beginning with ron s gone wrong
hbo s relationship with universal first began in march when it signed a six year non exclusivity deal with the studio in april universal elected to sign a deal with cbs for the licensing rights to a package of the studio s ten releases bypassing the traditional pay cable window
the current universal output deal which began as an eight year agreement that originally lasted through december assuming the studio s pay cable rights from starz was renewed for ten years on january the current deal gives hbo right of first refusal over select universal titles allowing the studio to exercise an option to license co distributed live action films to showtime and animated films to netflix if hbo elects not to obtain pay television rights to a particular film
universal put a cap on title acquisitions for the first year of the initial contract intending to split the rights between hbo and starz as consolation for the latter outbidding hbo for the sony pictures output deal on july universal filmed entertainment group announced it would begin releasing its theatrical films on peacock after its exclusivity agreement with hbo concludes at the end of under a fragmented window starting within days of a film s theatrical release through which peacock will hold exclusive rights to universal titles in bookending four month windows at the beginning and end of the month pay one distribution period
subsequently amazon on july and starz on july signed separate multi year sub licensing agreements in which universal films would stream on prime video and imdb tv in a month non exclusivity window during the middle of the period and air on starz s linear and streaming platforms following the peacock amazon windows hbo will continue to release universal s film slate under their existing contracts through while netflix will continue to offer the studio s animated films thereafter
the first run output deal with summit entertainment which initially ran through december and replaced showtime which had exclusive rights to its films from january until december as the studio s pay cable output partner when it initially went into effect in was renewed by hbo for an additional four years on march
summit is currently the only mini major movie studio and the only studio not among the five core majors that maintains an exclusive output deal with hbo on march it was announced that the deal with hbo through to the end of expires
being the first pay cable service to go national for many years hbo was advantageous in acquiring film licensing rights from major and independent studios until showtime the movie channel and other premium channels started beefing up their movie product to compete with hbo in the early s hbo s dominance in the pay cable led to complaints from many motion picture companies of the network holding monopoly power in the pay cable industry and a disproportionate advantage in film acquisition negotiations
during the early years of premium cable the major american movie studios often sold the pay television rights to an individual theatrical film title to multiple maxi pay and mini pay services often including hbo and later cinemax resulting in frequent same month scheduling duplication amongst the competing services
from its launch as a regional service hbo purchased broadcast rights to theatrical movies on a per title basis
the network pioneered the pay television industry practice known as a pre buy of buying the pay cable rights to a movie from its releasing studio before it started filming in exchange for agreeing to pay a specified share of a film s production costs this allowed hbo to maintain exclusivity over film output arrangements and to save money allocated for film acquisitions
in june it signed a four year exclusive deal with columbia pictures for a package of films released between january and january in exchange for then parent company time inc
committing a million production financing investment with columbia over a period of between and months
although hbo executives were reluctant at first to strike such arrangements by the mid s the channel had transitioned to exclusive film output deals now the standard among north american premium channels in which a film studio licenses all or a proportion of their upcoming productions to a partner service over a multi year contract
in hbo entered into three exclusive licensing agreements tied to production financing arrangements involving tri star pictures formed as a co production venture between time inc hbo columbia and cbs inc columbia pictures an exclusivity based contract extension initially covering of the studio s pre june releases with a non compete option to purchase additional columbia titles and orion pictures encompassing a package of films in return for financial participation and a million securities investment the deal was indirectly associated with orion s buyout of filmways the year prior in which hbo bought pay television rights to the studio s films
all three deals were approved under a u s
department of justice review greenlighting the tri star venture in june of that year
the tri star deal became non exclusive in january although showtime elected not to acquire titles from hbo s film rights lessees after the exclusive contract transferred to showtime in january in july hbo preemptively signed a five year deal with the studio that took effect in january in conjunction with a five year extension of its existing deal with columbia pictures
columbia and tristar s respective output deals with hbo ended on december when sony pictures transferred exclusive pay cable rights for their films to starz which as of may holds rights to televise all recent releases from either studio through december after which in january under a five year agreement signed in april netflix will assume pay television rights to its newer sony films after hbo declined a request by columbia during contract negotiations to allow the studio to experimentally distribute its theatrical films via streaming video during its contract window
in february hbo signed an agreement with silver screen partners a now defunct joint venture between hbo silver screen management thorn emi and the cannon group in which hbo had right of first refusal in the film selection and received of all profits derived from non pay cable distribution of the studio s films the silver screen agreement concluded upon the studio s cessation in
in early hbo abandoned the exclusivity practice citing internal research that concluded that subscribers showed indifference to efforts by premium channels to secure rights to studios full slate of recently released films from to distinguish their programming due to vhs availability preceding pay cable distribution in the release window
this change came after the firing of then hbo chairman frank biondi reportedly for having overextended the network in pre buy and exclusive movie deals as subscribership of pay cable services declined
biondi s replacement michael j
fuchs structured some of the subsequent deals as non exclusive to allow hbo to divert more funding toward co producing made for cable movies other original programming and theatrical joint ventures via tri star and silver screen partners

in july hbo signed a five year million deal for exclusive rights to paramount pictures films to have been tentatively released between may and may
this solidified an existing alliance with paramount dating to for the non exclusive rights to the studio s films though this contract would herald the end of its embargo on new film exclusivity deals hbo s then ceo michael fuchs cited showtime the movie channel parent viacom which at the time had debt in excess of billion for it having to obtain exclusivity for the paramount package which the studio approached hbo directly to bid
the paramount package remained with hbo cinemax until december showtime assumed the pay cable rights to the studio s films in january under a seven year deal reached as a byproduct of viacom s purchase of paramount from paramount communications and held them until december
shared rival epix created as a consortium between paramount viacom lionsgate and now sole owner mgm took over pay television rights upon that network s october launch
in march hbo signed a ten year deal with the then upstart dreamworks skg valued at between million and billion depending on the total output of films and generated revenue during the contract covering the studio s tentative releases between january and december

then in september after hbo agreed to waive the last two years of its contract netflix acquired the dreamworks animation contract effective upon the december expiration of the hbo deal
prior to the launch of hbo now hbo required its studio output partners to suspend digital sales of their movies during their exclusive contractual window with the network the netflix deal was not subject to any distribution restrictions allowing dreamworks animation to continue the re sale of its films through digital download via third party providers

service area
hbo founder charles dolan through cablevision would purchase the arena and its headlining sports teams in a billion joint bid with the itt corporation in august his son james l
dolan has owned the knicks and rangers through the madison square garden company since and madison square garden through madison square garden entertainment by way of the former company s spin off of its non sports entertainment assets the contracts related to this arrangement dated to may when manhattan cable television first signed a one year contract with madison square garden to broadcast sports events held at the arena and was extended for five additional years in november
on november one week before hbo formally launched madison square garden granted sterling the rights to televise its sporting events to cable television systems outside new york city
the first game under this arrangement was the new york rangers vancouver canucks nhl game that launched home box office on november and served as its inaugural sports broadcast
for the rangers and islanders seasons hbo contracted msg announcers for play by play and color commentating duties this created a burden on announcers to fill what otherwise would be dead air over the hbo feed of the games since the service does not accept advertising during the msg network s commercial airtime
national basketball association nba and national hockey league nhl coverage expanded with hbo s transition into a national satellite service covering non new york based teams in both leagues including the nba s milwaukee bucks boston celtics portland trail blazers golden state warriors and los angeles lakers and the nhl s los angeles kings under individual agreements as well as select playoff games

hbo also provided regional coverage of new york yankees major league baseball games for the season
new york independent station wpix now a cw affiliate provided microwave signal pickup assistance to hbo for the telecasts through its right of first refusal on game selection in its local television contract with the team covering the team s away games wpix preempted planned coverage of four yankees games that hbo was scheduled to carry that season
the philadelphia phillies reportedly rejected an offer for hbo to televise regular season games not shown locally on independent wphl tv now a mynetworktv affiliate hbo s yankees telecasts spurred a complaint filed in june by national association of broadcasters special committee on pay tv chairman willard walbridge who alleged they violated antisiphoning rules barring pay television services from carrying live sports televised regularly on broadcast stations within a two year period
hbo representatives contended that regulatory interference over the game broadcasts was prohibited under the first amendment and that it offered only weekday games as wpix held rights to selected yankees weekend games it also contended the anti siphoning rules did not apply as there was not a per program charge for the broadcasts
in september citing the games were unavailable on broadcast television the fcc gave temporary authorization for hbo to carry no more than three of the team s remaining regular season games

on june hbo sports announced it would not renew its share of the wimbledon television contract after the conclusion of that year s tournament ending its year broadcast relationship with the grand slam event
seth abraham then president of hbo sports parent unit time warner sports said at the time that the decision was guided by a need to refresh its programming slate rather than because of issues with financial terms or stagnant viewership
at the time of the announcement hbo paid million annually under a million deal over five years to air the tournament although espn fox sports net and usa network each expressed interested in obtaining the cable package relinquished by hbo time warner kept that portion of the wimbledon contract within its corporate umbrella on january co owned subsidiary turner broadcasting system and nbc reached a joint three year million contract with the all england lawn tennis and croquet club for the tournament rights
tnt which would be folded into warnermedia entertainment alongside hbo as part of the realignment resulting from at t s acquisition of time warner and cnn si later moved to the also now defunct cnnfn in after cnn si s shutdown which would have their broadcasts produced through the tnt sports unit assumed cable rights to the event beginning with the tournament
since the wimbledon cable rights have been held by espn which assumed full u s
television exclusivity over the championship in professional tennis briefly returned to hbo on march when it broadcast the inaugural edition of the now defunct bnp paribas showdown as a one off special presentation

hbo also provided the first interconnected satellite demonstration broadcast on june in which a heavyweight championship match between jimmy ellis and earnie shavers was relayed via anik a to a closed circuit system at the anaheim convention center in anaheim california and to a teleprompter cable system in san bernardino boxing telecasts aired on various scheduled nights through and mainly aired thereafter on fridays boxing telecasts moved to saturdays full time in
all boxing events shown on hbo aired on average in two to three week intervals through hbo also carried various national golden gloves competitions and from to carried the national collegiate boxing association championships
hbo expanded its boxing content to pay per view in december when it created a production arm to distribute and organize marquee boxing matches in conjunction with participating promoters tvko rebranded hbo ppv in and hbo boxing pay per view in the first tvko produced boxing event was the april battle of the ages bout between evander holyfield and george foreman
tvko signed holyfield away from showtime which had been carrying his matches since its showtime championship boxing telecasts premiered in under an agreement with promoter dan duva during holyfield s reign as cruiserweight champion
hbo expanded its boxing slate on february when hbo boxing after dark titled hbo late night fights for its inaugural edition premiered with title fights involving contenders in the junior featherweight marco antonio barrera vs
kennedy mckinney and junior bantamweight johnny tapia vs
giovanni andrade classes
the program typically featured fight cards involving well known contenders generally those not designated as championship or title bouts and up and coming boxing talents that had previously been featured mainly on basic cable boxing showcases such as espn s friday night fights
a second franchise extension ko nation which ran from may to august attempted to incorporate hip hop music performances between matches involving up and coming boxers to attract the show s target audience of males to later broadened to ages to to the sport former yo mtv raps vj ed lover was the face of the show and acted as its ring announcer
internal research stated that males aged accounted for of boxing viewership while men and older made up of the sport s audience ko nation drew low ratings throughout its run even after it was moved from saturday afternoons to saturday late nights in january
hbo sports then refocused its efforts at attracting younger viewers through boxing after dark
to court the sport s hispanic and latino fans the network s boxing franchises expanded to hbo latino with the january premiere of oscar de la hoya presenta boxeo de oro a showcase of up and coming boxers represented by the de la hoya founded golden boy promotions
a second boxing series for hbo latino generaci n boxeo premiered on the multiplex channel in april
on september hbo announced it would discontinue its boxing telecasts after years following its last televised match on october marking the end of live sports on the network
two additional world championship boxing boxing after dark cards would follow that originally scheduled final broadcast airing respectively on november and december hbo s decision to bow out of boxing telecasts was due to factors that included the influx of sports based streaming services such as dazn and espn and issues with promoters that hampered its ability to acquire high profile fight cards and resulting declining ratings and loss of interest in the sport among hbo s subscribers
also factoring into the move was hbo parent warnermedia s then recent ownership transfer to at t and the network s efforts to focus around its scripted programming network executives were of the opinion that hbo was not a sports network since then although it no longer produces sporting event telecasts hbo sports has continued to exist as a production unit for the network s sports magazine shows and documentaries
since hbo has offered documentary and interview based weekly series focusing on athletes and the world of athletics
on september hbo premiered the channel s first original weekly series and its first sports related documentary and analysis series inside the nfl a program that featured post game highlights and analysis of the previous week s marquee national football league games using footage provided by nfl films as well as interviews with players coaches and team management
the program was one of the first studio shows on cable television to offer weekly nfl game reviews predating the launches of similar football review shows on espn and other sports centered cable networks
inside the nfl would go on to become the network s longest running program airing for seasons until it ended its hbo run in february
after hbo canceled the program inside the nfl was subsequently acquired by showtime under arrangement with cbs sports formally moving to the rival premium channel in september the network would build upon the concept behind inside the nfl through the debuts of additional sports talk and documentary programs the major league baseball focused race for the pennant hbo sports magazine on the record with bob costas and its revamped iteration costas now and joe buck live
another program built on similar groundwork real sports with bryant gumbel which eventually became the network s flagship sports newsmagazine premiered on april
the hour long monthly series originally airing quarterly until hosted by veteran television journalist and sportscaster bryant gumbel has regularly received positive reviews for its groundbreaking journalism and typically features four stories centering on societal and athletic issues associated with the sports world investigative reports and interviews with famous athletes and other sports figures
as of real sports has received sports emmy awards including for outstanding sports journalism throughout its run as well as two peabody awards in and and three alfred i
dupont columbia university awards
of note the show s sports emmy win for outstanding sports journalism and dupont columbia university award win for outstanding broadcast journalism was for a half hour hidden camera investigative report guided by human rights activist ansar burney into slavery and torture in secret desert camps in the united arab emirates uae where boys younger than age were trained in camel racing
the segment uncovered a carefully hidden child slavery ring that bought or kidnapped hundreds of young boys in pakistan and bangladesh who were then forced to become camel jockeys in the uae and questioned the sincerity of u s
diplomatic pressure on the uae an ally to the united states to comply with the country s ban on children under age from participating in camel racing
the documentary brought worldwide attention to the plight of child camel jockeys in the middle east and helped the ansar burney trust convince the governments of qatar and the uae to end the use of children in the sport
