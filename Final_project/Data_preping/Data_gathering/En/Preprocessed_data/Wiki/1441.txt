vote model explicitly link ecological structure function cultural value benefits
likewise ha fundamental critique concept cultural ecosystem service build three arguments
pivotal cultural value attaching naturalcultivated environment rely area's unique character cannot addressed method use universal scientific parameter determine ecological structure functions
naturalcultivated environment ha symbolic meaning cultural value object value ecosystem shaped phenomenon like mountain lake forest mainly symbolic landscapes
cultural value result property produced ecosystem product specific way seeing within given cultural framework symbolic experiencethe common international classification ecosystem service cices classification scheme developed accounting system like national count etc order avoid double-counting supporting service others provisioning regulating services
may redundant regulating service categorisation include service limited nutrient cycling primary production soil formation habitat provision
service make possible ecosystem continue providing service food supply flood regulation water purification
outline situation greater number specie would maximize ecosystem services
understanding ecosystem service requires strong foundation ecology describes underlying principle interaction organism environment
since scale entity interact vary microbe landscape millisecond million year one greatest remaining challenge descriptive characterization energy material flow them
