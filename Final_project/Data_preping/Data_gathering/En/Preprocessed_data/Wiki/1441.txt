ecosystem services are the many and varied benefits to humans provided by the natural environment and from healthy ecosystems
such ecosystems include for example agroecosystems forest ecosystem grassland ecosystems and aquatic ecosystems
these ecosystems functioning in healthy relationships offer such things as natural pollination of crops clean air extreme weather mitigation and human mental and physical well being
collectively these benefits are becoming known as ecosystem services and are often integral to the provision of food provisioning of clean drinking water the decomposition of wastes and resilience and productivity of food ecosystems
while scientists and environmentalists have discussed ecosystem services implicitly for decades the millennium ecosystem assessment ma in the early s popularized this concept
there ecosystem services are grouped into four broad categories provisioning such as the production of food and water regulating such as the control of climate and disease supporting such as nutrient cycles and oxygen production and cultural such as spiritual and recreational benefits
to help inform decision makers many ecosystem services are being evaluated to draw equivalent comparisons to human engineered infrastructure and services
estuarine and coastal ecosystems are both marine ecosystems
together these ecosystems perform the four categories of ecosystem services in a variety of ways regulating services include climate regulation as well as waste treatment and disease regulation and buffer zones
the provisioning services include forest products such as timbers marine products fresh water raw materials and biochemical and genetic resources
cultural services of coastal ecosystems include inspirational aspects recreation and tourism science and education
supporting services of coastal ecosystems include nutrient cycling biologically mediated habitats and primary production
ecosystem services or eco services are defined as the goods and services provided by ecosystems to humans
per the millennium ecosystem assessment ma ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems
the ma also delineated the four categories of ecosystem services supporting provisioning regulating and cultural discussed below
in simple terms provisions food materials water timber fibers and the provision of medications
by there had evolved various working definitions and descriptions of ecosystem services in the literature
to prevent double counting in ecosystem services audits for instance the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity teeb replaced supporting services in the ma with habitat services and ecosystem functions defined as a subset of the interactions between ecosystem structure and processes that underpin the capacity of an ecosystem to provide goods and services
four different types of ecosystem services have been distinguished by the scientific body regulating services provisioning services cultural services and supporting services
an ecosystem does not necessarily offer all four types of services simultaneously but given the intricate nature of any ecosystem it is usually assumed that humans benefit from a combination of these services
the services offered by diverse types of ecosystems forests seas coral reefs mangroves etc differ in nature and in consequence
in fact some services directly affect the livelihood of neighboring human populations such as fresh water food or aesthetic value etc while other services affect general environmental conditions by which humans are indirectly impacted such as climate change erosion regulation or natural hazard regulation etc
the millennium ecosystem assessment report defined ecosystem services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems and distinguishes four categories of ecosystem services where the so called supporting services are regarded as the basis for the services of the other three categories
purification of water and air
carbon sequestration and climate regulation
waste decomposition and detoxification
predation regulates prey populations
biological control pest and disease control
pollination
disturbance regulation i e
flood protectionthe following services are also known as ecosystem goods
food including seafood and game crops wild foods and spices
raw materials including lumber skins fuelwood organic matter fodder and fertilizer
genetic resources including crop improvement genes and health care
biogenic minerals
medicinal resources including pharmaceuticals chemical models and test and assay organisms
energy hydropower biomass fuels
ornamental resources including fashion handicrafts jewelry pets worship decoration and souvenirs like furs feathers ivory orchids butterflies aquarium fish shells etc cultural including use of nature as motif in books film painting folklore national symbols advertising etc
spiritual and historical including use of nature for religious or heritage value or natural
recreational experiences including ecotourism outdoor sports and recreation
science and education including use of natural systems for school excursions and scientific discovery
therapeutic including ecotherapy social forestry and animal assisted therapy as of there was a discussion as to how the concept of cultural ecosystem services could be operationalized how landscape aesthetics cultural heritage outdoor recreation and spiritual significance to define can fit into the ecosystem services approach
who vote for models that explicitly link ecological structures and functions with cultural values and benefits
likewise there has been a fundamental critique of the concept of cultural ecosystem services that builds on three arguments
pivotal cultural values attaching to the natural cultivated environment rely on an area s unique character that cannot be addressed by methods that use universal scientific parameters to determine ecological structures and functions
if a natural cultivated environment has symbolic meanings and cultural values the object of these values are not ecosystems but shaped phenomena like mountains lakes forests and mainly symbolic landscapes
cultural values do result not from properties produced by ecosystems but are the product of a specific way of seeing within the given cultural framework of symbolic experience the common international classification of ecosystem services cices is a classification scheme developed to accounting systems like national counts etc in order to avoid double counting of supporting services with others provisioning and regulating services
these may be redundant with regulating services in some categorisations but include services such as but not limited to nutrient cycling primary production soil formation habitat provision
these services make it possible for the ecosystems to continue providing services such as food supply flood regulation and water purification
slade et al
outline the situation where a greater number of species would maximize more ecosystem services
understanding of ecosystem services requires a strong foundation in ecology which describes the underlying principles and interactions of organisms and the environment
since the scales at which these entities interact can vary from microbes to landscapes milliseconds to millions of years one of the greatest remaining challenges is the descriptive characterization of energy and material flow between them
for example the area of a forest floor the detritus upon it the micro organisms in the soil and characteristics of the soil itself will all contribute to the abilities of that forest for providing ecosystem services like carbon sequestration water purification and erosion prevention to other areas within the watershed
note that it is often possible for multiple services to be bundled together and when benefits of targeted objectives are secured there may also be ancillary benefits the same forest may provide habitat for other organisms as well as human recreation which are also ecosystem services
the complexity of earth s ecosystems poses a challenge for scientists as they try to understand how relationships are interwoven among organisms processes and their surroundings
as it relates to human ecology a suggested research agenda for the study of ecosystem services includes the following steps
identification of ecosystem service providers esps species or populations that provide specific ecosystem services and characterization of their functional roles and relationships
determination of community structure aspects that influence how esps function in their natural landscape such as compensatory responses that stabilize function and non random extinction sequences which can erode it
assessment of key environmental abiotic factors influencing the provision of services
measurement of the spatial and temporal scales esps and their services operate on recently a technique has been developed to improve and standardize the evaluation of esp functionality by quantifying the relative importance of different species in terms of their efficiency and abundance
such parameters provide indications of how species respond to changes in the environment i e
predators resource availability climate and are useful for identifying species that are disproportionately important at providing ecosystem services
however a critical drawback is that the technique does not account for the effects of interactions which are often both complex and fundamental in maintaining an ecosystem and can involve species that are not readily detected as a priority
even so estimating the functional structure of an ecosystem and combining it with information about individual species traits can help us understand the resilience of an ecosystem amidst environmental change
many ecologists also believe that the provision of ecosystem services can be stabilized with biodiversity
increasing biodiversity also benefits the variety of ecosystem services available to society
understanding the relationship between biodiversity and an ecosystem s stability is essential to the management of natural resources and their services
the concept of ecological redundancy is sometimes referred to as functional compensation and assumes that more than one species performs a given role within an ecosystem
more specifically it is characterized by a particular species increasing its efficiency at providing a service when conditions are stressed in order to maintain aggregate stability in the ecosystem
however such increased dependence on a compensating species places additional stress on the ecosystem and often enhances its susceptibility to subsequent disturbance
the redundancy hypothesis can be summarized as species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience
another idea uses the analogy of rivets in an airplane wing to compare the exponential effect the loss of each species will have on the function of an ecosystem this is sometimes referred to as rivet popping
if only one species disappears the loss of the ecosystem s efficiency as a whole is relatively small however if several species are lost the system essentially collapses similar to an airplane that lost too many rivets
the hypothesis assumes that species are relatively specialized in their roles and that their ability to compensate for one another is less than in the redundancy hypothesis
as a result the loss of any species is critical to the performance of the ecosystem
the key difference is the rate at which the loss of species affects total ecosystem functioning
a third explanation known as the portfolio effect compares biodiversity to stock holdings where diversification minimizes the volatility of the investment or in this case the risk of instability of ecosystem services
this is related to the idea of response diversity where a suite of species will exhibit differential responses to a given environmental perturbation
when considered together they create a stabilizing function that preserves the integrity of a service
several experiments have tested these hypotheses in both the field and the lab
in ecotron a laboratory in the uk where many of the biotic and abiotic factors of nature can be simulated studies have focused on the effects of earthworms and symbiotic bacteria on plant roots
these laboratory experiments seem to favor the rivet hypothesis
however a study on grasslands at cedar creek reserve in minnesota supports the redundancy hypothesis as have many other field studies
see also biodiversity ecosystem services
estuarine and marine coastal ecosystems are both marine ecosystems
together these ecosystems perform the four categories of ecosystem services in a variety of ways regulating services include climate regulation as well as waste treatment and disease regulation and buffer zones
the provisioning services include forest products marine products fresh water raw materials biochemical and genetic resources
cultural services of coastal ecosystems include inspirational aspects recreation and tourism science and education
supporting services of coastal ecosystems include nutrient cycling biologically mediated habitats and primary production
coasts and their adjacent areas on and offshore are an important part of a local ecosystem
the mixture of fresh water and salt water brackish water in estuaries provides many nutrients for marine life
salt marshes mangroves and beaches also support a diversity of plants animals and insects crucial to the food chain
the high level of biodiversity creates a high level of biological activity which has attracted human activity for thousands of years
coasts also create essential material for organisms to live by including estuaries wetland seagrass coral reefs and mangroves
coasts provide habitats for migratory birds sea turtles marine mammals and coral reefs
regulating services are the benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes
in the case of coastal and estuarine ecosystems these services include climate regulation waste treatment and disease control and natural hazard regulation
both the biotic and abiotic ensembles of marine ecosystems play a role in climate regulation
they act as sponges when it comes to gases in the atmosphere retaining large levels of co and other greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide
marine plants also use co for photosynthesis purposes and help in reducing the atmospheric co
the oceans and seas absorb the heat from the atmosphere and redistribute it through the means of water currents and atmospheric processes such as evaporation and the reflection of light allow for the cooling and warming of the overlying atmosphere
the ocean temperatures are thus imperative to the regulation of the atmospheric temperatures in any part of the world without the ocean the earth would be unbearably hot during the daylight hours and frigidly cold if not frozen at night
another service offered by marine ecosystem is the treatment of wastes thus helping in the regulation of diseases
wastes can be diluted and detoxified through transport across marine ecosystems pollutants are removed from the environment and stored buried or recycled in marine ecosystems marine ecosystems break down organic waste through microbial communities that filter water reduce limit the effects of eutrophication and break down toxic hydrocarbons into their basic components such as carbon dioxide nitrogen phosphorus and water
the fact that waste is diluted with large volumes of water and moves with water currents leads to the regulation of diseases and the reduction of toxics in seafood
coastal and estuarine ecosystems act as buffer zones against natural hazards and environmental disturbances such as floods cyclones tidal surges and storms
the role they play is to absorb a portion of the impact and thus lessen its effect on the land
wetlands which include saltwater swamps salt marshes and the vegetation it supports trees root mats etc
retain large amounts of water surface water snowmelt rain groundwater and then slowly releases them back decreasing the likeliness of floods
mangrove forests protect coastal shorelines from tidal erosion or erosion by currents a process that was studied after the cyclone that hit india
villages that were surrounded with mangrove forests encountered less damages than other villages that weren t protected by mangroves
provisioning services consist of all the products obtained from ecosystems
forests produce a large type and variety of timber products including roundwood sawnwood panels and engineered wood e g cross laminated timber as well as pulp and paper
besides the production of timber forestry activities may also result in products that undergo little processing such as fire wood charcoal wood chips and roundwood used in an unprocessed form
global production and trade of all major wood based products recorded their highest ever values in
production imports and exports of roundwood sawnwood wood based panels wood pulp wood charcoal and pellets reached their maximum quantities since when fao started reporting global forest product statistics
in growth in production of the main wood based product groups ranged from percent woodbased panels to percent industrial roundwood
the fastest growth occurred in the asia pacific northern american and european regions likely due to positive economic growth in these areas
forests also provide non wood forest products including fodder aromatic and medicinal plants and wild foods worldwide around billion people depend to some extent on wild foods such as wild meat edible insects edible plant products mushrooms and fish which often contain high levels of key micronutrients
the value of forest foods as a nutritional resource is not limited to low and middle income countries more than million people in the european union eu regularly consume wild food
some billion people in both urban and rural settings use wood based energy for cooking
marine ecosystems provide people with wild cultured seafood fresh water fiber fuel and biochemical genetic resources
humans consume a large number of products originating from the seas whether as a nutritious product or for use in other sectors more than one billion people worldwide or one sixth of the global population rely on fish as their main source of animal protein
in marine and coastal fisheries accounted for per cent of world food production
fish and other edible marine products primarily fish shellfish roe and seaweeds constitute for populations living along the coast the main elements of the local cultural diets norms and traditions
a very pertinent example would be sushi the national food of japan which consists mostly of different types of fish and seaweed
water bodies that are not highly concentrated in salts are referred to as fresh water bodies
fresh water may run through lakes rivers and streams to name a few but it is most prominently found in the frozen state or as soil moisture or buried deep underground
fresh water is not only important for the survival of humans but also for the survival of all the existing species of animals plants
marine creatures provide us with the raw materials needed for the manufacturing of clothing building materials lime extracted from coral reefs ornamental items and personal use items luffas art and jewelry the skin of marine mammals for clothing gas deposits for energy production lime extracted from coral reefs for building construction and the timber of mangroves and coastal forests for shelter are some of the more familiar uses of marine organisms
raw marine materials are utilized for non essential goods as well such as shells and corals in ornamental items
humans have also referred to processes within marine environments for the production of renewable energy using the power of waves or tidal power as a source of energy for the powering of a turbine for example
oceans and seas are used as sites for offshore oil and gas installations offshore wind farms
biochemical resources are compounds extracted from marine organisms for use in medicines pharmaceuticals cosmetics and other biochemical products
genetic resources are the genetic information found in marine organisms that would later on be used for animal and plant breeding and for technological advances in the biological field
these resources are either directly taken out from an organism such as fish oil as a source of omega or used as a model for innovative man made products such as the construction of fiber optics technology based on the properties of sponges
compared to terrestrial products marine sourced products tend to be more highly bioactive likely due to the fact that marine organisms have to retain their potency despite being diluted in the surrounding sea water
cultural services relate to the non material world as they benefit the benefit recreational aesthetic cognitive and spiritual activities which are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms
marine environments have been used by many as an inspiration for their works of art music architecture traditions
water environments are spiritually important as a lot of people view them as a means for rejuvenation and change of perspective
many also consider the water as being a part of their personality especially if they have lived near it since they were kids they associate it to fond memories and past experiences
living near water bodies for a long time results in a certain set of water activities that become a ritual in the lives of people and of the culture in the region
sea sports are very popular among coastal populations surfing snorkeling whale watching kayaking recreational fishing a lot of tourists also travel to resorts close to the sea or rivers or lakes to be able to experience these activities and relax near the water
the united nations sustainable development goal also has targets aimed at enhancing the use of ecosystem services for sustainable tourism especially in small island developing states
a lot can be learned from marine processes environments and organisms that could be implemented into our daily actions and into the scientific domain
although much is still yet to still be known about the ocean world by the extraordinary intricacy and complexity of the marine environment and how it is influenced by large spatial scales time lags and cumulative effects
supporting services are the services that allow for the other ecosystem services to be present
they have indirect impacts on humans that last over a long period of time
several services can be considered as being both supporting services and regulating cultural provisioning services
nutrient cycling is the movement of nutrients through an ecosystem by biotic and abiotic processes
the ocean is a vast storage pool for these nutrients such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus
the nutrients are absorbed by the basic organisms of the marine food web and are thus transferred from one organism to the other and from one ecosystem to the other
nutrients are recycled through the life cycle of organisms as they die and decompose releasing the nutrients into the neighboring environment
the service of nutrient cycling eventually impacts all other ecosystem services as all living things require a constant supply of nutrients to survive
biologically mediated habitats are defined as being the habitats that living marine structures offer to other organisms
these need not to have evolved for the sole purpose of serving as a habitat but happen to become living quarters whilst growing naturally
for example coral reefs and mangrove forests are home to numerous species of fish seaweed and shellfish
the importance of these habitats is that they allow for interactions between different species aiding the provisioning of marine goods and services
they are also very important for the growth at the early life stages of marine species breeding and bursary spaces as they serve as a food source and as a shelter from predators
primary production refers to the production of organic matter i e chemically bound energy through processes such as photosynthesis and chemosynthesis
the organic matter produced by primary producers forms the basis of all food webs
further it generates oxygen o a molecule necessary to sustain animals and humans
on average a human consumes about liter of oxygen per day whereas plants produce liter of oxygen per grams of growth
there are questions regarding the environmental and economic values of ecosystem services
some people may be unaware of the environment in general and humanity s interrelatedness with the natural environment which may cause misconceptions
although environmental awareness is rapidly improving in our contemporary world ecosystem capital and its flow are still poorly understood threats continue to impose and we suffer from the so called tragedy of the commons
many efforts to inform decision makers of current versus future costs and benefits now involve organizing and translating scientific knowledge to economics which articulate the consequences of our choices in comparable units of impact on human well being
an especially challenging aspect of this process is that interpreting ecological information collected from one spatial temporal scale does not necessarily mean it can be applied at another understanding the dynamics of ecological processes relative to ecosystem services is essential in aiding economic decisions
weighting factors such as a service s irreplaceability or bundled services can also allocate economic value such that goal attainment becomes more efficient
the economic valuation of ecosystem services also involves social communication and information areas that remain particularly challenging and are the focus of many researchers
in general the idea is that although individuals make decisions for any variety of reasons trends reveal the aggregated preferences of a society from which the economic value of services can be inferred and assigned
the six major methods for valuing ecosystem services in monetary terms are
avoided cost services allow society to avoid costs that would have been incurred in the absence of those services e g
waste treatment by wetland habitats avoids health costs
replacement cost services could be replaced with man made systems e g
restoration of the catskill watershed cost less than the construction of a water purification plant
factor income services provide for the enhancement of incomes e g
improved water quality increases the commercial take of a fishery and improves the income of fishers
travel cost service demand may require travel whose costs can reflect the implied value of the service e g
value of ecotourism experience is at least what a visitor is willing to pay to get there
hedonic pricing service demand may be reflected in the prices people will pay for associated goods e g
coastal housing prices exceed that of inland homes
contingent valuation service demand may be elicited by posing hypothetical scenarios that involve some valuation of alternatives e g
visitors willing to pay for increased access to national parks a peer reviewed study published in estimated the value of the world s ecosystem services and natural capital to be between us trillion per year with an average of us trillion per year
however salles indicated the total value of biodiversity is infinite so having debate about what is the total value of nature is actually pointless because we can t live without it
as of many companies were not fully aware of the extent of their dependence and impact on ecosystems and the possible ramifications
likewise environmental management systems and environmental due diligence tools are more suited to handle traditional issues of pollution and natural resource consumption
most focus on environmental impacts not dependence
several tools and methodologies can help the private sector value and assess ecosystem services including our ecosystem the corporate ecosystem services review the artificial intelligence for environment sustainability aries project from the natural value initiative and invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services tradeoffs
although monetary pricing continues with respect to the valuation of ecosystem services the challenges in policy implementation and management are significant and considerable
the administration of common pool resources has been a subject of extensive academic pursuit
from defining the problems to finding solutions that can be applied in practical and sustainable ways there is much to overcome
considering options must balance present and future human needs and decision makers must frequently work from valid but incomplete information
existing legal policies are often considered insufficient since they typically pertain to human health based standards that are mismatched with necessary means to protect ecosystem health and services
in to improve the information available the implementation of an ecosystem services framework has been suggested esf which integrates the biophysical and socio economic dimensions of protecting the environment and is designed to guide institutions through multidisciplinary information and jargon helping to direct strategic choices
as of local to regional collective management efforts were considered appropriate for services like crop pollination or resources like water
another approach that has become increasingly popular during the s is the marketing of ecosystem services protection
payment and trading of services is an emerging worldwide small scale solution where one can acquire credits for activities such as sponsoring the protection of carbon sequestration sources or the restoration of ecosystem service providers
in some cases banks for handling such credits have been established and conservation companies have even gone public on stock exchanges defining an evermore parallel link with economic endeavors and opportunities for tying into social perceptions
however crucial for implementation are clearly defined land rights which are often lacking in many developing countries
in particular many forest rich developing countries suffering deforestation experience conflict between different forest stakeholders
in addition concerns for such global transactions include inconsistent compensation for services or resources sacrificed elsewhere and misconceived warrants for irresponsible use
as of another approach focused on protecting ecosystem service biodiversity hotspots
recognition that the conservation of many ecosystem services aligns with more traditional conservation goals i e
biodiversity has led to the suggested merging of objectives for maximizing their mutual success
this may be particularly strategic when employing networks that permit the flow of services across landscapes and might also facilitate securing the financial means to protect services through a diversification of investors
for example as of there had been interest in the valuation of ecosystem services provided by shellfish production and restoration
a keystone species low in the food chain bivalve shellfish such as oysters support a complex community of species by performing a number of functions essential to the diverse array of species that surround them
there is also increasing recognition that some shellfish species may impact or control many ecological processes so much so that they are included on the list of ecosystem engineers organisms that physically biologically or chemically modify the environment around them in ways that influence the health of other organisms
many of the ecological functions and processes performed or affected by shellfish contribute to human well being by providing a stream of valuable ecosystem services over time by filtering out particulate materials and potentially mitigating water quality issues by controlling excess nutrients in the water
as of the concept of ecosystem services had not been properly implemented into international and regional legislation yet
notwithstanding the united nations sustainable development goal has a target to ensure the conservation restoration and sustainable use of ecosystem services
ecosystem based adaptation or eba is a strategy for community development and environmental management that seeks to use an ecosystem services framework to help communities adapt to the effects of climate change
the convention on biological diversity defines it as the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change which includes the use of sustainable management conservation and restoration of ecosystems as part of an overall adaptation strategy that takes into account the multiple social economic and cultural co benefits for local communities
in the millennium ecosystem assessment announced that humanity s impact on the natural world was increasing to levels never before seen and that the degradation of the planet s ecosystems would become a major barrier to achieving the millennium development goals
in recognition of this fact ecosystem based adaptation sought to use the restoration of ecosystems as a stepping stone to improve the quality of life in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change
specifically it involved the restoration of such ecosystems that provide food and water and protection from storm surges and flooding
eba interventions combine elements of both climate change mitigation and adaptation to global warming to help address the community s current and future needs
collaborative planning between scientists policy makers and community members is an essential element of ecosystem based adaptation
by drawing on the expertise of outside experts and local residents alike eba seeks to develop unique solutions to unique problems rather than simply replicating past projects
ecosystem services decisions require making complex choices at the intersection of ecology technology society and the economy
the process of making ecosystem services decisions must consider the interaction of many types of information honor all stakeholder viewpoints including regulatory agencies proposal proponents decision makers residents ngos and measure the impacts on all four parts of the intersection
these decisions are usually spatial always multi objective and based on uncertain data models and estimates
often it is the combination of the best science combined with the stakeholder values estimates and opinions that drive the process
one analytical study modeled the stakeholders as agents to support water resource management decisions in the middle rio grande basin of new mexico
this study focused on modeling the stakeholder inputs across a spatial decision but ignored uncertainty
another study used monte carlo methods to exercise econometric models of landowner decisions in a study of the effects of land use change
here the stakeholder inputs were modeled as random effects to reflect the uncertainty
a third study used a bayesian decision support system to both model the uncertainty in the scientific information bayes nets and to assist collecting and fusing the input from stakeholders
this study was about siting wave energy devices off the oregon coast but presents a general method for managing uncertain spatial science and stakeholder information in a decision making environment
remote sensing data and analyses can be used to assess the health and extent of land cover classes that provide ecosystem services which aids in planning management monitoring of stakeholders actions and communication between stakeholders
in baltic countries scientists nature conservationists and local authorities are implementing integrated planning approach for grassland ecosystems
they are developing an integrated planning tool based on gis geographic information system technology and put online that will help for planners to choose the best grassland management solution for concrete grassland
it will look holistically at the processes in the countryside and help to find best grassland management solutions by taking into account both natural and socioeconomic factors of the particular site
while the notion of human dependence on earth s ecosystems reaches to the start of homo sapiens existence the term natural capital was first coined by e f
schumacher in in his book small is beautiful
recognition of how ecosystems could provide complex services to humankind date back to at least plato c
bc who understood that deforestation could lead to soil erosion and the drying of springs
modern ideas of ecosystem services probably began when marsh challenged in the idea that earth s natural resources are unbounded by pointing out changes in soil fertility in the mediterranean
it was not until the late s that three key authors henry fairfield osborn jr william vogt and aldo leopold promoted recognition of human dependence on the environment
in paul sears drew attention to the critical role of the ecosystem in processing wastes and recycling nutrients
in paul ehrlich and rosa weigert called attention to ecological systems in their environmental science textbook and the most subtle and dangerous threat to man s existence
the potential destruction by man s own activities of those ecological systems upon which the very existence of the human species depends
the term environmental services was introduced in a report of the study of critical environmental problems which listed services including insect pollination fisheries climate regulation and flood control
in following years variations of the term were used but eventually ecosystem services became the standard in scientific literature
the ecosystem services concept has continued to expand and includes socio economic and conservation objectives which are discussed below
a history of the concepts and terminology of ecosystem services as of can be found in daily s book nature s services societal dependence on natural ecosystems
while gretchen daily s original definition distinguished between ecosystem goods and ecosystem services robert costanza and colleagues later work and that of the millennium ecosystem assessment lumped all of these together as ecosystem services
the following examples illustrate the relationships between humans and natural ecosystems through the services derived from them
the us military has funded research through the pacific northwest national laboratory which claims that department of defense lands and military installations provide substantial ecosystem services to local communities including benefits to carbon storage resiliency to climate and endangered species habitat
as of research from duke university claims for example eglin air force base provides about million in ecosystem services per year million more than if no base was present
in new york city where the quality of drinking water had fallen below standards required by the u s
environmental protection agency epa authorities opted to restore the polluted catskill watershed that had previously provided the city with the ecosystem service of water purification
once the input of sewage and pesticides to the watershed area was reduced natural abiotic processes such as soil absorption and filtration of chemicals together with biotic recycling via root systems and soil microorganisms water quality improved to levels that met government standards
the cost of this investment in natural capital was estimated between billion which contrasted dramatically with the estimated billion cost of constructing a water filtration plant plus the million annual running costs
pollination of crops by bees is required for of u s
food production most large scale farmers import non native honey bees to provide this service
a study reported that in california s agricultural region it was found that wild bees alone could provide partial or complete pollination services or enhance the services provided by honey bees through behavioral interactions
however intensified agricultural practices can quickly erode pollination services through the loss of species
the remaining species are unable to compensate this
the results of this study also indicate that the proportion of chaparral and oak woodland habitat available for wild bees within km of a farm can stabilize and enhance the provision of pollination services
the presence of such ecosystem elements functions almost like an insurance policy for farmers
in watersheds of the yangtze river china spatial models for water flow through different forest habitats were created to determine potential contributions for hydroelectric power in the region
by quantifying the relative value of ecological parameters vegetation soil slope complexes researchers were able to estimate the annual economic benefit of maintaining forests in the watershed for power services to be times that if it were harvested once for timber
in the s mineral water company vittel now a brand of nestl waters faced the problem that nitrate and pesticides were entering the company s springs in northeastern france
local farmers had intensified agricultural practices and cleared native vegetation that previously had filtered water before it seeped into the aquifer used by vittel
this contamination threatened the company s right to use the natural mineral water label under french law
in response to this business risk vittel developed an incentive package for farmers to improve their agricultural practices and consequently reduce water pollution that had affected vittel s product
for example vittel provided subsidies and free technical assistance to farmers in exchange for farmers agreement to enhance pasture management reforest catchments and reduce the use of agrochemicals an example of a payment for ecosystem services program
in it was counted that to plant ha new woodland in the uk considering only the value of timber it would cost which is more than the benefit of
if however all other benefits the trees in lowland could provide like soil stabilization wind deflection recreation food production air purification carbon storage wildlife habitat fuel production cooling flood prevention were included the costs will increase due to displacing the profitable farmland would be around but would be overweight by benefits of
in europe various projects are implemented in order to define the values of concrete ecosystems and to implement this concept into decision making process
