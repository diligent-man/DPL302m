yastrzemski began his major league career in and hit his first home run off of former red sox pitcher jerry casale
from the beginning there was tremendous pressure on him to perform as he succeeded to the position of the great red sox legend ted williams
he proved to be a worthy successor at the plate and a far superior defensive player with a strong arm expert in playing off the green monster fenway park s left field wall
in years as a left fielder yastrzemski won seven gold gloves and led in assists seven times
while his first two years were viewed as solid but unspectacular he emerged as a rising star in winning the american league batting championship with a batting average of and also leading the league in doubles and walks finishing sixth in the most valuable player voting
yastrzemski enjoyed his best season in when he won the american league triple crown with a batting average home runs tied with harmon killebrew and rbis

with the red sox battling as part of a four team pennant race yastrzemski hit hits in at bats with five home runs and runs batted in over the last two weeks of the season and finished a mere one game ahead of the detroit tigers and minnesota twins
the red sox went into the final two games of the season trailing the twins by game and leading the tigers by game
their final two games were against minnesota with the pennant and home run title and hence the triple crown on the line
in the saturday game yaz went for with a home run and rbi
killebrew also homered but the red sox won
thus the teams went into the final game tied for st place and yaz and killebrew were tied with home runs apiece

of williams yastrzemski wrote he got rid of all the individuality made us into a team gave us an incentive and made us want to win
in yastrzemski again won the batting championship
because of the competitive advantages pitchers enjoyed between and before the lowering of the pitcher s mound yastrzemski s mark in the year of the pitcher is the lowest average of any batting champion in major league history he was the only hitter in the american league to hit that season against such formidable pitching and led the league in on base percentage and walks

in yaz led the league in slugging and on base percentage finishing third in home runs
in the early s yaz suffered hand injuries that drastically reduced his power and productivity until healed
he also suffered a permanent shoulder injury that reduced his power causing him to change his distinctive batting stance
although he hit but home runs over the next four years as the red sox finished second twice and third twice he finished in the top in batting and top three in on base percentage and walks in and and led the league in runs scored in
in the all star game yastrzemski was called to pinch hit in the sixth inning with two men on base and the american league down
without wearing a batting helmet he hit tom seaver s first pitch for a home run to tie the score
the three run homer was the only scoring the american league did that night as they lost
yastrzemski and the red sox suffered another world series loss in losing four games to three to the cincinnati reds
he made the final out in game on a fly out to center trailing by one run
coincidentally he also made the final out of the american league east tie breaker game with a foul pop to third base
this game featured bucky dent s famous homer although reggie jackson s was the eventual winning run
earlier in the game yastrzemski began the scoring with a home run off left handed pitcher ron guidry who was having a career year wins losses and a era
it was the only homer the cy young award winner allowed to a left hander all season
on may yastrzemski hit three home runs against the detroit tigers at tiger stadium
he then went to yankee stadium and hit two more tying the major league record of five home runs in two consecutive games
in yastrzemski then was one of the five oldest players in the league
on september yastrzemski achieved another milestone becoming the first american league player with career hits and home runs
in playing primarily as a designated hitter an early season hitting streak placed him among the league s leading hitters and saw him featured on the cover of sports illustrated and played in that year s all star game
yastrzemski retired at the end of the season at age though he wrote in his autobiography yaz that he was planning on playing the season until he was tired from a long midseason slump
he also said that had he known how good roger clemens would be he would have played in to have had a chance to play with him
no player has had a longer career with only one team seasons a record he shares with brooks robinson of the baltimore orioles
his final career statistics include games played second all time and the most with a single team hits doubles home runs rbis and a batting average of
he had walks in his career and extra base hits
yastrzemski was the first player to collect over hits and home runs solely in the american league the feat has since been accomplished by cal ripken jr
he was named to the all star game times
yastrzemski won three american league batting championships in his career
in addition he trails only ty cobb and derek jeter in hits collected with a single team and trails only cobb jeter and tris speaker in hits collected playing in the american league
yastrzemski is also fenway park s all time leader in hits doubles and rbis
by the time of his retirement he was the all time leader in plate appearances since surpassed by pete rose
as one of the top players of his era he was elected to the baseball hall of fame in his first year of eligibility with the support of of voters
he is one of the few hall of famers to directly succeed another hall of famer at the same position
for his entire career with the red sox he wore uniform number
the red sox retired this number on august after yastrzemski was elected to the hall of fame
in yastrzemski ranked nd on the sporting news list of the greatest baseball players
that same season he was named a finalist to the major league baseball all century team
prior to his induction in the baseball hall of fame in yastrzemski was inducted into the national polish american sports hall of fame
he was inducted into the suffolk sports hall of fame on long island in the baseball category with the class of
yastrzemski was well known for his batting stance holding his bat exceptionally high giving his swing a large dramatic arc unexpectedly so for a well known fastball hitter and more power at the plate
in his later years he adjusted his stance and held the bat lower
in his autobiography he revealed that he played his last years with a damaged left shoulder he kept secret and said this injury reduced his home run power
before that he could hit home runs to all fields but afterward his home run power was mainly in pulling the ball
this is why he no longer held the bat high and used several batting stances to adjust to the injured shoulder
he explained that with each new stance he had to change the way he swung
this is why he never came close to hitting home runs again
he was also known for modifying his batting helmets by enlarging the right earhole for comfort and removing part of the right earflap for better vision of the ball as it was being pitched
yaz stood out for his cagey approach to the game
he decoyed opposing baserunners with his left field play
on fly balls headed for fenway s wall he lined up as if about to make the catch just in front of the wall waiting until the last possible moment before wheeling around to play the carom
this would fool baserunners into tagging up for precious extra seconds preventing them from taking an extra base and if they tried anyway his deft handling of the bounce and accurate throwing arm were liable to make them pay the price
once while running the basepaths himself yastrzemski found a unique way to induce a throwing error
thrown out at second base he failed to head immediately for the dugout as is customary
opponents made a protracted attempt at tagging out another runner in a rundown or pickle but soon were flabbergasted to see a red sox player rounding third and heading for home
a panicked throw to the catcher far missed the mark allowing yastrzemski to appear to score but more importantly allowing the runner behind him to advance
a record album of the red sox s season aptly titled the impossible dream featured a song by dj jess cain of praise for the man they call yaz which included the line although yastrzemski is a lengthy name it fits quite nicely in our hall of fame the song can be heard and the album cover seen in the apartment of ben wrightman played by jimmy fallon in the film fever pitch
earlier in the film ben s girlfriend lindsay meeks drew barrymore not yet familiar with the triumphs and tribulations of the red sox is unable to properly pronounce yastrzemski s name and has to be corrected by the surrounding fans ya strem ski the final scene of the movie indicates that if the couple s unborn child is a girl she will be named carla yastrzemski wrightman
yastrzemski thought that tommy john was one of the hardest pitchers for him to hit against
this surprised john who remembered yastrzemski hitting him well while he was with the white sox
john concluded that yastrzemski must be remembering his years with the yankees beginning in when john fared better in their matchups
along with johnny pesky yastrzemski raised the world series championship banner over fenway park
he is currently a roving instructor with the red sox and was honored by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch for game of the and world series
in august yastrzemski underwent successful triple bypass heart surgery at massachusetts general hospital
the red sox honored him with a statue outside fenway park on september
