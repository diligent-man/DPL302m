the website s critical consensus reads rogue one draws deep on star wars mythology while breaking new narrative and aesthetic ground and suggesting a bright blockbuster future for the franchise on metacritic the film has a weighted average score out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews
audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of a on an a to f scale while posttrak reported filmgoers gave the film a overall positive score
ign reviewer eric goldman gave the film saying rogue one is a movie crammed with fan service but when fan service is done this well there s little to complain about and much to adore peter travers of rolling stone gave the film out of stars writing this spin off prequel has the same primitive lived in emotional loopy let s put on a show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy film gave rogue one writing that the film is enjoyable but does not have the emotional weight of the force awakens because no character in rogue one was strongly compelling
popmatters wrote rogue one seems to enjoy spending time on a whole new batch of moons and planets we haven t seen before reveling in the clutter and clamor of far flung settlements where anti imperial sentiments fester
but the film is bogged down in engineering the complex maneuverings of spy games dogfights and the most sprawling rebel versus empire land battle scene since the opening of the empire strikes back justin chang writing for the los angeles times called rogue one a swiftly paced rough and ready entertainment
the new york times wrote all the pieces are there in other words like lego figures in a box
the problem is that the filmmakers haven t really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them
a couple of year olds on a screen free rainy afternoon would come up with better adventures and probably also better dialogue richard brody of the new yorker called the film lobotomized and depersonalized and wrote it isn t so much a movie as a feature length promotional film for itself it s a movie that is still waiting to be made the washington post wrote rogue one represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension
it s fine
it ll do
for now
indiewire s david ehrlich gave the film a c rating calling it a spirited but agonizingly safe attempt to expand cinema s most holy blockbuster franchise and keep the wheels greased between proper installments
just a glorified excuse to retcon some sense into one of the silliest things about the original
while he praised the set design and visuals calling them gorgeous he criticized a lack of interesting character development and a script that felt completely constricted by its purpose
peter bradshaw film critic of the guardian said rogue one doesn t really go rogue at any stage and it isn t a pop culture event like the force awakens in whose slipstream this appears part of its charm resides in the eerie almost dreamlike effect of continually producing familiar elements reshuffled and reconfigured a reaching back to the past and hinting at a preordained future
there are some truly spectacular cameos from much loved personae involving next level digital effects almost creepily exact so that watching feels at various stages like going into a time machine back to the s and s
george lucas was reported to have enjoyed the film more than the force awakens upon hearing this gareth edwards said i can die happy now
the film was praised for its exploration of ethics in engineering in a reviewer s words the core ethical arc of the film is one man s decision to engineer the death star in such a way as to prevent its use for galactic domination
one could fairly retitle the movie to rogue one an engineering ethics story
while much of the computer generated imagery cgi received praise some news organizations published criticism about certain aspects including the visual effects vfx that were used to revive peter cushing who had died in as grand moff tarkin
the guardian s catherine shoard described the resurrection as a digital indignity
joseph walsh of the guardian raised legal and ethical issues about bringing a long dead actor to life
however lucasfilm had obtained permission from cushing s estate before deciding to use his likeness
the washington times eric althoff rejected the entire concept of using cgi to recreate a deceased actor alas what we get is basically not a simulation but an approximation of a simulation a dead character portrayed by a living actor inhabiting not the character but imitating the dead actor
some journalists also criticized the quality of the cgi that was used to represent a younger carrie fisher in order to portray princess leia at an earlier time as well as its suitability in movie making
eliana dockterman of time wrote that there was something particularly plastic about this version of the young carrie fisher so smooth and so perfect it couldn t be real that pulled me out of the moment kelly lawler of usa today said
while tarkin is merely unnerving the leia cameo is so jarring as to take the audience completely out of the film at its most emotional moment
leia s appearance was meant to help the film end on a hopeful note quite literally as hope is her line but instead it ends on a weird and unsettling one michael cavna of the washington post described the facial effect as feeling distractingly artificial and nearly alien like a plastered death mask robbed of authentic actorly effect well beyond the usual artifice of botox nonetheless fisher was shown the cgi rendition of her younger self for the film by kathleen kennedy and loved it
on november it was announced that a live action prequel series was officially in development and set to air on disney s streaming service disney
the series will take place five years before the events in rogue one and will focus on cassian andor with diego luna reprising the role
although initially announced to be reprising his role as k so alan tudyk has since stated that he will no longer be in the first season of the series
it is set to be released on disney in
