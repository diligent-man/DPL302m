Rogue One is the first film in the Star Wars anthology series a series of standalone spin off films in the Star Wars franchise John Knoll visual effects supervisor for the Star Wars prequel trilogy pitched the idea as an episode of the unproduced series Star Wars Underworld years before the film's development in during the production of Episode III after the Disney acquisition he felt as if he had to pitch it again or forever wonder what might've happened if I had In May Disney announced Gareth Edwards would direct the film and Gary Whitta would write the script That October cinematographer Greig Fraser revealed that he would work on the film In January it was revealed Whitta had completed his work on the script and would no longer be with the project Simon Kinberg was considered as a replacement Later that month it was announced Chris Weitz had signed to write the script for the film In March the title was announced
Edwards stated the style of the film would be similar to that of a war film stating It's the reality of war Good guys are bad Bad guys are good It's complicated layered a very rich scenario in which to set a movie Assuming Disney would not allow a dark ending Edwards had the main characters surviving in the original version of the script but the producers opted for a more tragic ending and never filmed the original version
In May reports emerged the film would undergo five weeks of reshoots with Tony Gilroy writing additional scenes as well as acting as a second unit director under Edwards With input from Edwards Gilroy oversaw the edit and additional photography of the film which tackled several issues including the ending In August Gilroy was given screenplay credit alongside Weitz and was paid million for his work on the film Additionally Christopher McQuarrie Scott Z Burns and Michael Arndt all contributed to the script at various stages in development
In July discussing whether the film would feature an opening crawl Kathleen Kennedy said we're in the midst of talking about it but I don't think these anthology films will have an opening crawl Edwards explained The idea is this film is supposed to be different than the saga films and that This film is born out of a crawl There's this feeling that if we did a crawl then it'll create another movie In November Kennedy confirmed the film would not feature an opening crawl instead beginning in a way that is traditional with just the title
At the Star Wars Celebration Edwards said the title had three meanings a military sign referring to the Red Squadron from A New Hope the 'rogue' one of the franchise given it is the first film to not be part of the main saga and a description of Jyn Erso's personality
In January The Hollywood Reporter stated numerous actresses including Tatiana Maslany Rooney Mara and Felicity Jones were being tested for the film's lead In February it was announced Jones was in final talks to star in the film while Aaron Paul and dgar Ram rez were being eyed for the male lead role In March Jones was officially cast In March Deadline Hollywood reported a rumor that Ben Mendelsohn was being considered for a lead role The next month TheWrap reported that Sam Claflin was being eyed for a role while Riz Ahmed was in negotiations to join the film In May Mendelsohn Ahmed and Diego Luna were added to the cast of the film in the lead roles Forest Whitaker was added to the cast in June In July Jonathan Aris was cast to play Senator Jebel Genevieve O'Reilly was cast as Mon Mothma reprising her role from Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith James Earl Jones was confirmed to return as the voice of Darth Vader in June
Principal photography on the film began at Pinewood Studios Buckinghamshire on August Much of the other photography was completed near Pinewood Studios at Buckinghamshire UK where huge sets were built to complement scenes filmed elsewhere in the world The film was shot using Ultra Panavision lenses with Arri Alexa large format digital K cameras
Filming locations were used around the world In Iceland the crew shot in Reynisfjara and around the mountains of Hj rleifsh f i and Hafursey at M rdalssandur which were used to represent Lah'mu and Eadu Also used were the Krafla area with its volcanic crater and around Lake M vatn's rock formations The islands of Gan and Baresdhoo of the Laamu Atoll in the Maldives as well as the former RAF Bovingdon airfield were used to represent Scarif Wadi Rum in Jordan was used to represent Jedha Pymmes Park in Edmonton London was also used for location filming and scenes set on Yavin were filmed at Cardington Airfield Gareth Edwards selected the London Underground's Canary Wharf station as a location for a chase scene in an Imperial base the location shoot took place between midnight and am when the station was closed to the public
The film spent an estimated total of million and received a million subsidy from the United Kingdom's film incentive program
On February Disney executives stated the film was virtually completed Several weeks of pre scheduled reshoots began in June Tony Gilroy who was an uncredited writer on the film at the time was hired to direct the reshoots and rework aspects of the film earning him a screenwriting credit It was created solely using digital tools
Industrial Light Magic ILM produced the film's visual effects ILM used CGI and digitally altered archive footage to insert Peter Cushing's likeness over the body of actor Guy Henry Lucasfilm secured permission from the late actor's estate to include him in the film The team reportedly searched through countless hours of Cushing footage in order to find suitable reference material and Henry provided the motion capture and voice work A digital model of Cushing was mapped over Henry's performance like a digital body mask Cushing's mannerisms including his manner of speaking were studied by the creative team and applied to the digital Tarkin model Cushing's estate was heavily involved with the creation and had input right down to small subtle adjustments A similar process was used in the portrayal of Princess Leia Carrie Fisher's appearance as Leia in the first film was superimposed over Norwegian actress Ingvild Deila's face and archival audio of Fisher saying Hope was used to voice the character
Post production wrapped on November
In March it was reported that Alexandre Desplat who had worked with Edwards on Godzilla would compose the score for Rogue One and had confirmed it in an April interview As the film's reshooting affected the post production process Desplat opted out from the project due to his commitments for scoring Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets and was replaced by Michael Giacchino in September Giacchino only had four and a half weeks to compose the music for the film beginning almost immediately after finishing production on Doctor Strange In addition to composing the original themes Giacchino had incorporated John Williams' themes from previous films into the score The official soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December An extended version of the soundtrack was released on February which includes additional demos composed for the film score and cues that were not included in the album or being un edited A vinyl edition was further released by Mondo in March
Promotion of Rogue One was initially delayed by the release of the film Mission Impossible Rogue Nation in July because the titles are similar Paramount Pictures registered and cleared the title with the Motion Picture Association of America in January well before Disney announced the title of its forthcoming Star Wars spinoff Disney and Lucasfilm had to reach an agreement with Paramount over promotion in order to avoid any confusion in the public mind Disney agreed to embargo promotion on Rogue One until after mid with the exception of a very short teaser which was screened at Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim that year
A teaser trailer for Rogue One released by Lucasfilm on April was praised by reviewers for its portrayal of strong female characters The Daily Telegraph described Jyn Erso's character as a roguish Han Solo style heroine calling the film progressive while noting its painstaking faithfulness to the production design style of the original Star Wars trilogy The Hollywood Reporter also noted the visual nods to the original trilogy and examined the film's possible narrative direction considering that the outcome is to some extent already revealed in the opening crawl of A New Hope The Atlantic writer David Sims stated that the trailer brought back some memorable pieces of architecture from the lumbering AT AT walkers to the Death Star itself not to mention the glorious s costuming of Star Wars He added that the trailer has the look blending the old with the new The trailer was viewed close to million times in its first hours at a rate of views per hour from Facebook and YouTube which is views shy of what the first teaser trailer for Star Wars The Force Awakens was receiving in November
In June Rogue One was promoted at the Star Wars Celebration Europe III event in London During the event a new official poster was unveiled which depicts a battle taking place on the tropical planet Scarif with the Death Star looming large in a blue sky above which is printed the tagline A Rebellion Built on Hope A second teaser trailer was also unveiled screened exclusively for the Celebration audience and not streamed online This new trailer was reviewed favorably by critics The Daily Telegraph noted that the trailer revealed new locations such as the planets Jedha and Scarif and that its most significant revelation came in the final seconds of the teaser with the appearance of Darth Vader reflected in a computer screen and accompanied by his classic breathing sound effect Variety also hailed the Vader reveal and noted that the emphasis of the production was much more on the kinetic depiction of large battle sequences and full on warfare comparing it to Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now A showreel was also shown during the event which featured footage from the film cut with behind the scenes shots and interviews with the director and cast members The second trailer was shown publicly during a broadcast of the Summer Olympics and received positive responses Wired stated that the trailer was littered with nostalgic throwbacks to the original trilogy while Rolling Stone described the CGI landscape shots seen in the footage as eye poppingly gorgeous
A further trailer released in October prompted The Hollywood Reporter to comment that the newly revealed footage looked like a trailer to a different movie than the one advertised earlier remarking that Jyn Erso appeared to be portrayed as a more vulnerable character and highlighting the appearance of Galen Erso as a protective father figure Vanity Fair also commented on the emphasis given to Jyn's relationship with her father suggesting that Rogue One was drawing on the Star Wars franchise's greatest natural resource daddy issues
The film's publicity tour began in Mexico on November

IGN reviewer Eric Goldman gave the film saying Rogue One is a movie crammed with fan service but when fan service is done this well there's little to complain about and much to adore Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film out of stars writing this spin off prequel has the same primitive lived in emotional loopy let's put on a show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy Film gave Rogue One writing that the film is enjoyable but does not have the emotional weight of The Force Awakens because no character in Rogue One was strongly compelling PopMatters wrote Rogue One seems to enjoy spending time on a whole new batch of moons and planets we haven't seen before reveling in the clutter and clamor of far flung settlements where anti Imperial sentiments fester But the film is bogged down in engineering the complex maneuverings of spy games dogfights and the most sprawling Rebel versus Empire land battle scene since the opening of The Empire Strikes Back Justin Chang writing for the Los Angeles Times called Rogue One a swiftly paced rough and ready entertainment
The New York Times wrote All the pieces are there in other words like Lego figures in a box The problem is that the filmmakers haven't really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them A couple of year olds on a screen free rainy afternoon would come up with better adventures and probably also better dialogue Richard Brody of The New Yorker called the film lobotomized and depersonalized and wrote it isn't so much a movie as a feature length promotional film for itself it's a movie that is still waiting to be made The Washington Post wrote Rogue One represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension It's fine It'll do For now
IndieWire's David Ehrlich gave the film a C rating calling it a spirited but agonizingly safe attempt to expand cinema's most holy blockbuster franchise and keep the wheels greased between proper installments just a glorified excuse to retcon some sense into one of the silliest things about the original While he praised the set design and visuals calling them gorgeous he criticized a lack of interesting character development and a script that felt completely constricted by its purpose
Peter Bradshaw film critic of The Guardian said Rogue One doesn't really go rogue at any stage and it isn't a pop culture event like The Force Awakens in whose slipstream this appears part of its charm resides in the eerie almost dreamlike effect of continually producing familiar elements reshuffled and reconfigured a reaching back to the past and hinting at a preordained future There are some truly spectacular cameos from much loved personae involving next level digital effects almost creepily exact so that watching feels at various stages like going into a time machine back to the s and s
George Lucas was reported to have enjoyed the film more than The Force Awakens upon hearing this Gareth Edwards said I can die happy now
The film was praised for its exploration of ethics in engineering in a reviewer's words the core ethical arc of the film is one man's decision to engineer the Death Star in such a way as to prevent its use for galactic domination One could fairly retitle the movie to 'Rogue One an Engineering Ethics Story '
While much of the computer generated imagery CGI received praise some news organizations published criticism about certain aspects including the visual effects VFX that were used to revive Peter Cushing who had died in as Grand Moff Tarkin The Guardian's Catherine Shoard described the resurrection as a digital indignity Joseph Walsh of The Guardian raised legal and ethical issues about bringing a long dead actor to life However Lucasfilm had obtained permission from Cushing's estate before deciding to use his likeness The Washington Times' Eric Althoff rejected the entire concept of using CGI to recreate a deceased actor Alas what we get is basically not a simulation but an approximation of a simulation a dead character portrayed by a living actor inhabiting not the character but imitating the dead actor
Some journalists also criticized the quality of the CGI that was used to represent a younger Carrie Fisher in order to portray Princess Leia at an earlier time as well as its suitability in movie making Eliana Dockterman of Time wrote that there was something particularly plastic about this version of the young Carrie Fisher so smooth and so perfect it couldn't be real that pulled me out of the moment Kelly Lawler of USA Today said while Tarkin is merely unnerving the Leia cameo is so jarring as to take the audience completely out of the film at its most emotional moment Leia's appearance was meant to help the film end on a hopeful note quite literally as 'hope' is her line but instead it ends on a weird and unsettling one Michael Cavna of The Washington Post described the facial effect as feeling distractingly artificial and nearly alien like a plastered death mask robbed of authentic actorly effect well beyond the usual artifice of Botox Nonetheless Fisher was shown the CGI rendition of her younger self for the film by Kathleen Kennedy and loved it
On November it was announced that a live action prequel series was officially in development and set to air on Disney's streaming service Disney The series will take place five years before the events in Rogue One and will focus on Cassian Andor with Diego Luna reprising the role Although initially announced to be reprising his role as K SO Alan Tudyk has since stated that he will no longer be in the first season of the series It is set to be released on Disney in
