at a seminar on business prospects held on monday in hanoi frederic neumann chief economist of hsbc s asian economics research said the bank forecast vietnam s economy to grow this year and next year
neumann said exports will increase in when demand returns helping vietnam grow stronger
the country s export turnovers were down over year on year to nearly u billion in the first nine months according to the general statistics office
but the situation will turn around next year when the structure of global economic growth changes
consumers could return to shopping because they have not bought much in the past years he said
this means demand in vietnam s main export markets will increase helping boost export turnovers
the second driving force for vietnam s economy next year is domestic spending including consumption and government purchases which is forecast to increase
the total retail sales of goods and consumer service revenue rose by in the first nine months only half of the same period last year
in addition to exports and domestic spending brook taylor ceo of vinacapital predicted financial service and real estate sectors would recover after the current difficult period
infrastructure was also predicted by experts to accelerate next year
the outlook for is brighter but neumann said exports still posed risks because vietnam has a high economic openness so it also depended heavily on exports
if its main export markets such as the u s europe and china recovered less than forecast imports would be reduced
accordingly if world demand is weaker it will affect vietnam s export growth pillars experts said
