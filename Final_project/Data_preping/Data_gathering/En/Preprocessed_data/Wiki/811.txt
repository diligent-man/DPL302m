d l naraidi old irish da l nara araide s part or d l araide sometimes latinised as dalaradia or anglicised as dalaray was a cruthin kingdom or possibly a confederation of cruthin tribes in north eastern ireland during the middle ages
it was part of the over kingdom of ulaid and its kings often contended with the d l fiatach for the over kingship of the province
at its greatest extent the borders of d l naraidi roughly matched those of county antrim and they seemed to occupy the same area as the earlier robogdii of ptolemy s geography a region shared with d l riata
their capital was r th m r outside antrim and their eponymous ancestor is claimed as being fiachu araide
the mythological d l naraidi was centered on the northern shores of lough neagh in southern county antrim
d l naraidi was one of the more prominent sub kingdoms of ulaid with its kings contending with the d l fiatach for the over kingship of the province for some centuries
to the north of d l naraidi in county antrim lay the d l riata the boundary between which was marked out by the river bush to d l riata s west and the southern boundary running from ravel water to just north of glynn on the east antrim coast
in the mid th century the d l naraidi of magh line ruled by the u ch elbad dynasty conquered eilne alias mag eilne to their north west and a branch of their dynasty seems to have settled there
this branch of the u ch elbad descended from fiachra c ech d
brother of fiachnae lurgan king of d l naraidi and over king of ulaid
dungal eilni great grandson of fiachra c ech and king of d l naraidi was possibly the first of this branch to be based in eilne however in was killed at d n ceithern modern day giant s sconce in parish of dunboe west of river bann
this branch of the magh line d l naraidi eventually became known as the d l naraidi in tuaiscirt d l naraidi of the north and d l naraidi mag neilne
the first reference to d l naraidi in tuaiscirt can be found in the annals of ulster under the year
between and the d l naraidi in tuaiscirt held the overkingship of d l naraidi seven times with two of that number becoming overkings of ulaid
cathussach mac ailello king of eilne and d l naraidi and claimed as having ruled the over kingdom of ulaid for sixteen years was killed at r ith beithech rathveagh county antrim in
eochaid mac bressal who died in was the last known king of the d l naraidi in tuaiscirt to hold the over kingship of the d l naraidi
the last known king of d l naraidi in tuaiscirt is recorded in
the church or monastery of cuil raithin on the shore of the river bann lay in eilne and was said to have been founded by cairbre who subsequently became its bishop
according to the tripartite life of st
patrick written in the th century the d l naraidi had granted this church to saint patrick
the airg allan dynasty of u tuirtr that lay west of the river bann had been active east of it from as early as and by the th century had taken control of eilne
d l naraidi in tuaiscirt is said to have corresponded to the later baronies of dunluce lower and north east liberties of coleraine and appears to correspond to the tr cha c t of an tuaiscert
it also became an anglo norman cantred called twescard which later would absorb the cantred of dalrede based on d l riata with these two combined cantreds forming the basis for the rural deanery of twescard
a sub division of in tuaiscirt called cuil an tuaiscirt meaning the nook corner of d l naraidi in tuaiscirt was located in the north west of the petty kingdom near coleraine
its territory would form the basis of the later barony of north east liberties of coleraine
the d l naraidi magh line or the d l naraidi of moylinny modern irish maigh line meaning plain of line was the predominant dynasty of the d l naraidi
it was centered in southern county antrim with r ith m r its royal seat
in the th century they are counted as one of twelve tuatha of ulaid
line may represent the name of an original population grouping
it was also known as mocu aridi
their territory at its height spanned southern county antrim and northern county down containing the tuatha of magh line d l mbuinne and d l sailni
it was later known as trian congaill meaning the third of congal claen caech and became an alias for the territory of clandeboye named as such after the clandeboye o neill s who conquered the area in the late th century
by the th century d l mbuinne was counted amongst the twelve tuatha of ulaid
after the viking era d l sailni and its church at connor the principal church of d l naraidi was lost to the encroaching u tuirtri
the royal seat of the d l naraidi magh line was r ith m r meaning great fort anglicised as rathmore located near lough neagh in the civil parish of donegore
it is first recorded in the annals of the four masters under the date as ratha moir maighe line
neighbouring r ith m r was r ith beag meaning little fort anglicised as rathbeg and is attested location where ed dub mac suibni king of d l naraidi and ulaid killed high king diarmait mac cerbaill in
by the th century r ith m r became known as r th m r mag ullin meaning great fort of the macquillans and was burnt to the ground by art mac hugh o neill in after which it was never restored
cr eb telcha usually linked to modern day crew hill near glenavy was the inauguration site of the d l fiatach kings of ulaid however it appears to have also been the same for the d l naraidi prior to the th century contraction of their territory
by the late th century d l fiatach expansion had cut off the county antrim and down branches of the cruthin from each other
as a result the county down branch consolidated into the kingdom of the u echach cobo based at magh cobo the plain of cobo
they were styled as kings of cuib
according to the medieval genealogies they are descended from the d l naraidi though this link is tenuous
by the th century u echach cobo was counted amongst the twelve tuatha of ulaid
u echach cobo s territory formed the basis of the medieval deanery and norman cantred of oveh as well as the diocese of dromore
their territory was later anglicised as iveagh
their th century expansion formed the basis for the later barony of iveagh
also spelt as u dercco c in and u dearca chein the u erca c in where a branch of the d l naraidi and according to the th century lebor na cert one of the twelve minor principalities under the king of ulaid
they appear to have been based near semne in latharna with their base possibly being carrickfergus and a list of u erca c in kings are given as having ruled latharna until the mid th century though there are records of kings down to around ad
a branch of the u erca c in line of kings the s l fing n also twice held the overkingship of d l naraidi
after the u erca c in became associated with the church of bangor
at some point they disappear from latharna and by the th century are found in the territory of leath cathail in central county down
the u erca c in had five vassal tribes all of different origins the cen l talain and d l fhocha nuchtar both of whom appear to also have been of the cruthin and possibly refugees driven from their home that went to dercco chen
a tradition of the cen l talain mentions that they had an ancestor who fought alongside fiacha araide the eponymous ancestor of the d l naraidi the crothraidi who according to tradition descended from connacht however migrated to ulaid and after ad had joined the u erca c in crothraidi buaingine who are said to descend from munster and the d l coirb fobair a portion of whom where located in the south antrim territory of d l mbuinne and are claimed to have descended from a leinster prince called c corb
by the start of the historic period in ireland in the th century the over kingdom of ulaid was largely confined to east of the river bann in north eastern ireland
the cruthin however still held territory west of the bann in county londonderry and their emergence may have concealed the dominance of earlier tribal groupings
in according to the annals of ulster an apparent internal struggle amongst the cruthin resulted in b et n mac cinn making a deal with the northern u n ill promising them the territories of ard e lairg magilligan peninsula and the lee both west of the river bann
as a result the battle of m in daire lothair modern day moneymore took place between them and an alliance of cruthin kings in which the cruthin suffered a devastating defeat
afterwards the northern u n ill settled their airg alla allies in the cruthin territory of eilne which lay between the river bann and the river bush
the defeated cruthin alliance meanwhile consolidated itself within the d l naraidi dynasty
in ed dub mac suibni king of d l naraidi and ulaid killed high king diarmait mac cerbaill at raith bec rathbeg county antrim
the d l naraidi king congal c ech took possession of the over kingship of ulaid in and in killed the high king of ireland suibne menn of the northern u n ill in battle
in congal led the d l naraidi to defeat against the same foes
in an attempt to have himself installed as high king of ireland congal made alliances with d l riata and strathclyde which resulted in the disastrous battle of moira in in modern day county antrim which saw congal slain by high king domnall mac edo of the northern u n ill and severely weakened both d l naraidi and d l riata
the annals of ulster record that in the battle of bellum fertsi modern day belfast took place between the ulaid and cruthin both terms which then referred to the d l fiatach and d l naraide respectively
meanwhile the d l naraidi where still resisting the encroaching northern u n ill
in the d l naraidi led by d ngal eilni of the in tuasicirt branch along with their allies the cianachta glenn geimin of northern county londonderry led by cenn f elad were killed at d n cethirinn by m el d in mac m ele fithrich of the cen l meic ercae of cen l ne gain
some form of combination of the d l naraidi the cianachta glenn geimin and the cen l feradaig was suspected of involvement in the death of eochaid mac domangairt king of the cen l ngabr in of scottish d l riata in
throughout the th century the cruthin had gradually lost their lands west of the river bann allowing d l naraidi to become the sole cruthin dynastic grouping in county antrim
after the annals no longer refer to the d l naraidi as being of cruthin stock but to be of the ulaid population grouping instead being called the fir ulaid the men of ulster
in the th century the kingdom of d l riata was overrun by the d l naraidi
concurrently the d l fiatach extended their territory cutting off the d l naraidi from the u echach cobo
by the end of the th century the d l naraidi had taken control of ulaid from the d l fiatach
this however only lasted until when eochaid mac ardgail restored d l fiatach s dominance
in brian boru marched north to accept submissions from the ulaid which including marching upon the d l naraidi capital r ith m r where he received only the submissions of their king
by the beginning of the th century the d l naraidi ruled by the loingsigh o lynch had lost control of most of antrim to the u fhloinn o lynn and became restricted to the territory of magh line
the u fhloinn were the ruling sept of the airg allan u tuirtri as well as rulers of fir l and in a process of gradual infiltration by marital and military alliances as well as growing pressure from the encroaching cen l ne gain they moved their power east of the bann
once they had come to prominence in antrim the ua flainn styled themselves as king of d l naraidi in tuaiscirt d l riata and fir l alongside their own u tuirtri
