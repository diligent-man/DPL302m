Dl nAraidi Old Irish daːl ˈnaraðʲə Araide's part or Dl Araide sometimes Latinised as Dalaradia or Anglicised as Dalaray was a Cruthin kingdom or possibly a confederation of Cruthin tribes in north-eastern Ireland during the Middle Ages
It was part of the over-kingdom of Ulaid and its kings often contended with the Dl Fiatach for the over-kingship of the province
At its greatest extent the borders of Dl nAraidi roughly matched those of County Antrim and they seemed to occupy the same area as the earlier Robogdii of Ptolemy's Geography a region shared with Dl Riata
Their capital was Rth Mr outside Antrim and their eponymous ancestor is claimed as being Fiachu Araide
The Mythological Dl nAraidi was centered on the northern shores of Lough Neagh in southern County Antrim
Dl nAraidi was one of the more prominent sub-kingdoms of Ulaid with its kings contending with the Dl Fiatach for the over-kingship of the province for some centuries
To the north of Dl nAraidi in County Antrim lay the Dl Riata the boundary between which was marked out by the River Bush to Dl Riata's west and the southern boundary running from Ravel Water to just north of Glynn on the east Antrim coast
In the mid-th century the Dl nAraidi of Magh Line ruled by the U Chelbad dynasty conquered Eilne alias Mag Eilne to their north-west and a branch of their dynasty seems to have settled there
This branch of the U Chelbad descended from Fiachra Cech d
brother of Fiachnae Lurgan king of Dl nAraidi and over-king of Ulaid
Dungal Eilni great-grandson of Fiachra Cech and king of Dl nAraidi was possibly the first of this branch to be based in Eilne however in was killed at Dn Ceithern modern-day Giant's Sconce in parish of Dunboe west of River Bann
This branch of the Magh Line Dl nAraidi eventually became known as the Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt Dl nAraidi of the North and Dl nAraidi Mag nEilne
The first reference to Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt can be found in the Annals of Ulster under the year
Between and the Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt held the overkingship of Dl nAraidi seven times with two of that number becoming overkings of Ulaid
Cathussach mac Ailello king of Eilne and Dl nAraidi and claimed as having ruled the over-kingdom of Ulaid for sixteen years was killed at Rith Beithech Rathveagh County Antrim in
Eochaid mac Bressal who died in was the last known king of the Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt to hold the over-kingship of the Dl nAraidi
The last known king of Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is recorded in
The church or monastery of Cuil Raithin on the shore of the River Bann lay in Eilne and was said to have been founded by Cairbre who subsequently became its bishop
According to the Tripartite Life of St
Patrick written in the th century the Dl nAraidi had granted this church to Saint Patrick
The Airgallan dynasty of U Tuirtr that lay west of the River Bann had been active east of it from as early as and by the th century had taken control of Eilne
Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is said to have corresponded to the later baronies of Dunluce Lower and North East Liberties of Coleraine and appears to correspond to the trcha ct of An Tuaiscert
It also became an Anglo-Norman cantred called Twescard which later would absorb the cantred of Dalrede based on Dl Riata with these two combined cantreds forming the basis for the rural deanery of Twescard
A sub-division of in Tuaiscirt called Cuil an Tuaiscirt meaning the nookcorner of Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt was located in the north-west of the petty-kingdom near Coleraine
Its territory would form the basis of the later barony of North East Liberties of Coleraine
The Dl nAraidi Magh Line or the Dl nAraidi of Moylinny modern-Irish Maigh Line meaning plain of Line was the predominant dynasty of the Dl nAraidi
It was centered in southern County Antrim with Rith Mr its royal seat
In the th century they are counted as one of twelve tuatha of Ulaid
Line may represent the name of an original population grouping
It was also known as Mocu Aridi
Their territory at its height spanned southern County Antrim and northern County Down containing the tuatha of Magh Line Dl mBuinne and Dl Sailni
It was later known as Trian Congaill meaning the third of Congal Claen Caech and became an alias for the territory of Clandeboye named as such after the Clandeboye O'Neill's who conquered the area in the late th century
By the th century Dl mBuinne was counted amongst the twelve tuatha of Ulaid
After the Viking era Dl Sailni and its church at Connor the principal church of Dl nAraidi was lost to the encroaching U Tuirtri
The royal seat of the Dl nAraidi Magh Line was Rith Mr meaning great fort Anglicised as Rathmore located near Lough Neagh in the civil parish of Donegore
It is first recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters under the date as Ratha moir Maighe Line
Neighbouring Rith Mr was Rith Beag meaning little fort Anglicised as Rathbeg and is attested location where ed Dub mac Suibni king of Dl nAraidi and Ulaid killed High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill in
By the th century Rith Mr became known as Rth Mr Mag Ullin meaning great fort of the MacQuillans and was burnt to the ground by Art mac Hugh O'Neill in after which it was never restored
Creb Telcha usually linked to modern-day Crew Hill near Glenavy was the inauguration site of the Dl Fiatach kings of Ulaid however it appears to have also been the same for the Dl nAraidi prior to the th-century contraction of their territory
By the late th century Dl Fiatach expansion had cut off the County Antrim and Down branches of the Cruthin from each other
As a result the County Down branch consolidated into the kingdom of the U Echach Cobo based at Magh Cobo the plain of Cobo
They were styled as kings of Cuib
According to the medieval genealogies they are descended from the Dl nAraidi though this link is tenuous
By the th century U Echach Cobo was counted amongst the twelve tuatha of Ulaid
U Echach Cobo's territory formed the basis of the medieval deanery and Norman cantred of Oveh as well as the diocese of Dromore
Their territory was later Anglicised as Iveagh
Their th-century expansion formed the basis for the later barony of Iveagh
Also spelt as U Dercco Cin and U Dearca Chein the U Erca Cin where a branch of the Dl nAraidi and according to the th-century Lebor na Cert one of the twelve minor principalities under the king of Ulaid
They appear to have been based near Semne in Latharna with their base possibly being Carrickfergus and a list of U Erca Cin kings are given as having ruled Latharna until the mid-th century though there are records of kings down to around AD
A branch of the U Erca Cin line of kings the Sl Fingn also twice held the overkingship of Dl nAraidi
After the U Erca Cin became associated with the church of Bangor
At some point they disappear from Latharna and by the th century are found in the territory of Leath Cathail in central County Down
The U Erca Cin had five vassal tribes all of different origins the Cenl Talain and Dl Fhocha nUchtar both of whom appear to also have been of the Cruthin and possibly refugees driven from their home that went to Dercco Chen
A tradition of the Cenl Talain mentions that they had an ancestor who fought alongside Fiacha Araide the eponymous ancestor of the Dl nAraidi the Crothraidi who according to tradition descended from Connacht however migrated to Ulaid and after AD had joined the U Erca Cin Crothraidi Buaingine who are said to descend from Munster and the Dl Coirb Fobair a portion of whom where located in the south Antrim territory of Dl mBuinne and are claimed to have descended from a Leinster prince called C Corb
By the start of the historic period in Ireland in the th century the over-kingdom of Ulaid was largely confined to east of the River Bann in north-eastern Ireland
The Cruthin however still held territory west of the Bann in County Londonderry and their emergence may have concealed the dominance of earlier tribal groupings
In according to the Annals of Ulster an apparent internal struggle amongst the Cruthin resulted in Betn mac Cinn making a deal with the Northern U Nill promising them the territories of Ard Elairg Magilligan peninsula and the Lee both west of the River Bann
As a result the battle of Min Daire Lothair modern-day Moneymore took place between them and an alliance of Cruthin kings in which the Cruthin suffered a devastating defeat
Afterwards the Northern U Nill settled their Airgalla allies in the Cruthin territory of Eilne which lay between the River Bann and the River Bush
The defeated Cruthin alliance meanwhile consolidated itself within the Dl nAraidi dynasty
In ed Dub mac Suibni king of Dl nAraidi and Ulaid killed High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill at Raith Bec Rathbeg County Antrim
The Dl nAraidi king Congal Cech took possession of the over-kingship of Ulaid in and in killed the High King of Ireland Suibne Menn of the Northern U Nill in battle
In Congal led the Dl nAraidi to defeat against the same foes
In an attempt to have himself installed as High King of Ireland Congal made alliances with Dl Riata and Strathclyde which resulted in the disastrous Battle of Moira in in modern-day County Antrim which saw Congal slain by High King Domnall mac edo of the Northern U Nill and severely weakened both Dl nAraidi and Dl Riata
The Annals of Ulster record that in the battle of Bellum Fertsi modern-day Belfast took place between the Ulaid and Cruthin both terms which then referred to the Dl Fiatach and Dl nAraide respectively
Meanwhile the Dl nAraidi where still resisting the encroaching Northern U Nill
In the Dl nAraidi led by Dngal Eilni of the In Tuasicirt branch along with their allies the Cianachta Glenn Geimin of northern County Londonderry led by Cenn Felad were killed at Dn Cethirinn by Mel Din mac Mele Fithrich of the Cenl Meic Ercae of Cenl nEgain
Some form of combination of the Dl nAraidi the Cianachta Glenn Geimin and the Cenl Feradaig was suspected of involvement in the death of Eochaid mac Domangairt king of the Cenl nGabrin of Scottish Dl Riata in
Throughout the th century the Cruthin had gradually lost their lands west of the River Bann allowing Dl nAraidi to become the sole Cruthin dynastic grouping in County Antrim
After the annals no longer refer to the Dl nAraidi as being of Cruthin stock but to be of the Ulaid population-grouping instead being called the fir-Ulaid the men of Ulster
In the th century the kingdom of Dl Riata was overrun by the Dl nAraidi
Concurrently the Dl Fiatach extended their territory cutting off the Dl nAraidi from the U Echach Cobo
By the end of the th century the Dl nAraidi had taken control of Ulaid from the Dl Fiatach
This however only lasted until when Eochaid mac Ardgail restored Dl Fiatach's dominance
In Brian Boru marched north to accept submissions from the Ulaid which including marching upon the Dl nAraidi capital Rith Mr where he received only the submissions of their king
By the beginning of the th century the Dl nAraidi ruled by the Ó Loingsigh O'Lynch had lost control of most of Antrim to the U Fhloinn O'Lynn and became restricted to the territory of Magh Line
The U Fhloinn were the ruling sept of the Airgallan U Tuirtri as well as rulers of Fir L and in a process of gradual infiltration by marital and military alliances as well as growing pressure from the encroaching Cenl nEgain they moved their power east of the Bann
Once they had come to prominence in Antrim the Ua Flainn styled themselves as king of Dl nAraidi in Tuaiscirt Dl Riata and Fir L alongside their own U Tuirtri
