information ashoka come inscription inscription mention possibly reign ancient literature especially buddhist texts
source often contradict although various historian attempted correlate testimony
example ashoka often attributed building many hospital time clear evidence hospital existed ancient india rd century bc ashoka wa responsible commissioning construction any
ashoka's inscription earliest self-representations imperial power indian subcontinent
however inscription focused mainly topic dhamma provide little information regarding aspect maurya state society
even topic dhamma content inscription cannot taken face value
strong sometimes helpful think ashoka's message propaganda politician whose aim present favorable image administration rather record historical facts
example find mention nd century junagadh rock inscription rudradaman
inscription discovered sirkap mention lost word beginning priy theorised ashoka's title priyadarshi although certain
inscription sohgaura copper plate inscription tentatively dated ashoka's period section scholar although others contest this
much information ashoka come buddhist legend present great ideal king
legend appear text contemporary ashoka composed buddhist author used various story illustrate impact faith ashoka
among modern scholar opinion range downright dismissal legend mythological acceptance historical portion seem plausible
buddhist legend ashoka exist several language including sanskrit pali tibetan chinese burmese sinhala thai lao khotanese
north indian tradition preserved sanskrit-language text divyavadana including constituent ashokavadana chinese source a-y wang chuan a-y wang ching
sri lankan tradition preserved pali-lanuage text dipavamsa mahavamsa vamsatthapakasini commentary mahavamsa buddhaghosha's commentary vinaya samanta-pasadikathere several significant difference two traditions
example sri lankan tradition emphasizes ashoka's role convening third buddhist council dispatch several missionary distant region including son mahinda sri lanka
describes event found sri lankan tradition story another son named kunala
even narrating common story two tradition diverge several ways
example ashokavadana mahavamsa mention ashoka's queen tishyarakshita bodhi tree destroyed
mahavamsa permanently destroys tree branch tree ha transplanted sri lanka
another story text describe ashoka's unsuccessful attempt collect relic gautama buddha ramagrama
ashokavadana fails cannot match devotion naga hold relic however mahavamsa fails buddha destined relic enshrined king dutthagamani sri lanka
using story mahavamsa glorifies sri lanka new preserve buddhism
ashoka's name appears list mauryan king various puranas
however text provide detail brahmanical author patronized mauryans
text arthashastra indica megasthenes provide general information maurya period also used make inference ashoka's reign
however arthashastra normative text focus ideal rather historical state dating mauryan period subject debate

beckwith ashoka whose name appears minor rock edict king piyadasi devanampiya piyadasi ie
beloved god piyadasi beloved god fairly widespread title king named author major pillar edict major rock edicts
beckwith suggests piyadasi wa living rd century bce wa probably son chandragupta maurya known greek amitrochates advocated piety dharma major pillar edict major rock edict without ever mentioning buddhism buddha samgha single notable exception edict major pillar edict doe mention
also geographical spread inscription show piyadasi ruled vast empire contiguous seleucid empire west
contrary beckwith ashoka wa later king st-nd century ce whose name appears explicitly minor rock edict allusively minor pillar edict doe mention buddha samgha explicitly promoting buddhism
name priyadarsi doe occur two minor edict gujarra bairat beckwith considers later fabrications
minor inscription cover different much smaller geographical area clustering central india
according beckwith inscription later ashoka typical later form normative buddhism well attested inscription gandhari manuscript dated turn millennium around time kushan empire
quality inscription ashoka significantly lower quality inscription earlier piyadasi
according ashokavadana legend mother gave name birth removed sorrows
name priyadasi associated ashoka rd- century ce dipavamsa
term literally mean regard amiably gracious mien sanskrit priya-darshi
ashoka's inscription mention title devanampiya sanskrit devanampriya beloved gods
identification devanampiya ashoka person established maski gujarra inscription use term king
title wa adopted king including contemporary king devanampiya tissa anuradhapura ashoka's descendant dasharatha maurya
ashoka's inscription describe early life much information topic come apocryphal legend written hundred year him
legend include obviously fictitious detail narrative ashoka's past life plausible historical information ashoka's period
exact date ashoka's birth certain extant contemporary indian text record details
known lived rd century bce inscription mention several contemporary ruler whose date known certainty antiochus ii theos ptolemy ii philadelphus antigonus ii gonatas magas cyrene alexander epirus corinth
thus ashoka must born sometime late century bce early rd century bce c bce
source purana mahavamsa state father wa mauryan emperor bindusara grandfather wa chandragupta founder empire
ashokavadana also name father bindusara trace ancestry buddha's contemporary king bimbisara ajatashatru udayin munda kakavarnin sahalin tulakuchi mahamandala prasenajit nanda
century tibetan monk taranatha whose account distorted version earlier tradition describes ashoka illegitimate son king nemita champarana daughter merchant
ashokavadana state ashoka's mother wa daughter brahmin champa wa prophesized marry king
accordingly father took pataliputra wa inducted bindusara's harem ultimately became chief queen
ashokavadana doe mention name although legend provide different name her
vamsatthapakasini mahavamsa-tika commentary mahavamsa call dharma dhamma pali state belonged moriya kshatriya clan
divyavadana legend call janapada-kalyani according scholar ananda w
according nd-century historian appian chandragupta entered marital alliance greek ruler seleucus nicator ha led speculation either chandragupta son bindusara married greek princess
however evidence ashoka's mother grandmother wa greek historian dismissed idea
one day bindusara asked ascetic pingala-vatsajiva determine son wa worthy successor
asked prince assemble garden golden pavilion ascetic's advice
ashoka wa reluctant go father disliked mother convinced so
minister radhagupta saw ashoka leaving capital garden offered provide prince royal elephant travel
garden pingala-vatsajiva examined prince realised ashoka would next king
instead said one best mount seat drink vessel food would next king time ashoka declared met criterion
later told ashoka's mother son would next king advice left kingdom avoid bindusara's wrath
legend suggest bindusara disliked ashoka's ugly appearance also state bindusara gave important responsibility suppressing revolt takshashila according north indian tradition governing ujjain according sri lankan tradition
another possibility sent ashoka distant region keep away imperial capital
according ashokavadana bindusara dispatched prince ashoka suppress rebellion city takshashila present-day bhir mound pakistan
episode mentioned sri lankan tradition instead state bindusara sent ashoka govern ujjain
two buddhist text ashoka-sutra kunala-sutra state bindusara appointed ashoka viceroy gandhara takshashila wa located ujjain
ashokavadana state bindusara provided ashoka fourfold-army comprising cavalry elephant chariot infantry refused provide weapon army
ashoka declared weapon would appear wa worthy king deity emerged earth provided weapon army
ashoka reached takshashila citizen welcomed told rebellion wa evil minister king
sometime later ashoka ha similarly welcomed khasa territory god declared would go conquer whole earth
takshashila wa prosperous geopolitically influential city historical evidence prof ashoka's time wa well-connected mauryan capital pataliputra uttarapatha trade route
however extant contemporary source mention takshashila rebellion none ashoka's record state ever visited city
said historicity legend ashoka's involvement takshashila rebellion may corroborated aramaic-language inscription discovered sirkap near taxila
inscription includes name begin letter prydr scholar restore priyadarshi wa title ashoka
another evidence ashoka's connection city may name dharmarajika stupa near taxila name suggests wa built ashoka dharma-raja
story deity miraculously bringing weapon ashoka may text's way deifying ashoka indicating bindusara disliked ashoka wanted fail takshashila
according mahavamsa bindusara appointed ashoka viceroy present-day ujjain ujjeni wa important administrative commercial centre avanti province central india
tradition corroborated saru maru inscription discovered central india inscription state visited place prince
ashoka's rock edict mention presence prince viceroy ujjain reign support tradition served viceroy ujjain
pataliputra wa connected ujjain multiple route ashoka's time way ashoka entourage may encamped rupnath inscription ha found
according sri lankan tradition ashoka visited vidisha fell love beautiful woman way ujjain
according dipamvamsa mahamvamsa woman wa devi daughter merchant
according mahabodhi-vamsa wa vidisha-mahadevi belonged shakya clan gautama buddha
buddhist chronicler may fabricated shakya connection connect ashoka's family buddha
buddhist text allude buddhist later year describe conversion buddhism
mahavamsa state devi gave birth ashoka's son mahinda ujjain two year later daughter named sanghamitta
according mahavamsa ashoka's son mahinda wa ordained age year sixth year ashoka's reign
mean mahinda must year old ashoka ascended throne
even mahinda wa born ashoka wa young year old ashoka must ascended throne year mean must served viceroy several years
legend suggest ashoka wa crown prince ascension throne wa disputed
ashokavadana state bindusara's eldest son susima slapped bald minister head jest
minister worried ascending throne susima may jokingly hurt sword
therefore instigated five hundred minister support ashoka's claim throne time came noting ashoka wa predicted become chakravartin universal ruler
sometime later takshashila rebelled bindusara dispatched susima curb rebellion
shortly bindusara fell ill wa expected die soon
however minister told ashoka wa ill suggested temporarily install ashoka throne susmia's return takshashila
bindusara refused ashoka declared throne rightfully god would crown next king
instance god bindusara died ashoka's authority extended entire world including yaksha territory located earth naga territory located earth
susima returned capital ashoka's newly appointed prime minister radhagupta tricked pit charcoal
susima died painful death general bhadrayudha became buddhist monk
mahavamsa state bindusara fell sick ashoka returned pataliputra ujjain gained control capital
father's death ashoka eldest brother killed ascended throne
text also state ashoka killed ninety-nine half-brother including sumana
dipavamsa state killed hundred brother wa crowned four year later
vamsatthapakasini add ajivika ascetic predicted massacre based interpretation dream ashoka's mother
according account ashoka's uterine brother tissa wa spared
source name surviving brother vitashoka vigatashoka sudatta so-ta-to a-yi-uang-chuan sugatra siu-ka-tu-lu fen-pie-kung-te-hun
figure exaggerated seem way stating ashoka killed several brothers
taranatha state ashoka wa illegitimate son predecessor killed six legitimate prince ascend throne
possible ashoka wa rightful heir throne killed brother brother acquire throne
however buddhist source exaggerated story attempt portray evil conversion buddhism
mention officer whose duty include supervising welfare family brother sister relatives
however scholar oppose suggestion arguing inscription talk family brother brother themselves
according sri lankan text mahavamsa dipavamsa ashoka ascended throne year death gautama buddha ruled years
date buddha's death matter debate north indian tradition state ashoka ruled hundred year buddha's death ha led debate date
assuming sri lankan tradition correct assuming buddha died bce date proposed several scholar ashoka must ascended throne bce
purana state ashoka's father bindusara reigned year year specified sri lankan tradition
true ashoka's ascension dated three year earlier bce
alternatively sri lankan tradition correct assume buddha died bce date supported cantonese dotted record ashoka's ascension dated bce
mahavamsa state ashoka consecrated king four year becoming sovereign
interregnum explained assuming fought war succession son bindusara four years
ashokavadana contains story ashoka's minister yashas hiding sun hand
eggermont theorised story wa reference partial solar eclipse wa seen northern india may bce
according ashokavadana ashoka went pilgrimage various buddhist site sometime eclipse
ashoka's rummindei pillar inscription state visited lumbini st regnal year
assuming visit wa part pilgrimage described text assuming ashoka visited lumbini around year solar eclipse ascension date bce seems likely
strong event described ashokavadana ha nothing chronology eggermont's interpretation grossly ignores literary religious context legend
sri lankan north indian tradition assert ashoka wa violent person buddhism
taranatha also state ashoka wa initially called kamashoka spent many year pleasurable pursuit kama wa called chandashoka ashoka fierce spent year performing evil deed finally came known dhammashoka ashoka righteous conversion buddhism
ashokavadana also call chandashoka describes several cruel acts
minister helped ascend throne started treating contempt ascension
test loyalty ashoka gave absurd order cutting every flower-and fruit-bearing tree
failed carry order ashoka personally cut head ministers
one day stroll park ashoka concubine came across beautiful ashoka tree
sight put sensual mood woman enjoy caressing rough skin
sometime later ashoka fell asleep resentful woman chopped flower branch namesake tree
alarmed king's involvement massacre prime minister radha-gupta proposed hiring executioner carry future mass killing leave king unsullied
girika magadha village boy boasted could execute whole jambudvipa wa hired purpose
came known chandagirika girika fierce request ashoka built jail pataliputra
called ashoka's hell jail looked lovely outside inside girika brutally tortured prisonersthe -century chinese traveller faxian state ashoka personally visited underworld study torture method invented methods
-century traveller xuanzang claim seen pillar marking site ashoka's hell
mahavamsa also briefly alludes ashoka's cruelty stating ashoka wa earlier called chandashoka evil deed came called dharmashoka pious act conversion buddhism
however unlike north indian tradition sri lankan text mention specific evil deed performed ashoka except killing brothers
description ashoka evil person conversion buddhism appear fabrication buddhist author attempted present change buddhism brought miracle
attempt dramatise change legend exaggerate ashoka's past wickedness piousness conversion
ashoka's inscription mention conquered kalinga region regnal year destruction caused war made repent violence subsequent year wa drawn towards buddhism
edict edict ashoka rock inscription express great remorse king felt observing destruction kalinga
hand sri lankan tradition suggests ashoka wa already devoted buddhist regnal year converted buddhism regnal year constructed viharas - regnal years
based sri lankan tradition scholar eggermont believe ashoka converted buddhism kalinga war
critic theory argue ashoka already buddhist would waged violent kalinga war
eggermont explains anomaly theorising ashoka interpretation middle way
earlier writer believed ashoka dramatically converted buddhism seeing suffering caused war since major rock edict state became closer dhamma annexation kalinga
however even ashoka converted buddhism war epigraphic evidence suggests conversion wa gradual process rather dramatic event
example minor rock edict issued regnal year five year kalinga campaign state upasaka lay buddhist two half year make much progress past year wa drawn closer sangha became ardent follower
according ashoka's major rock edict conquered kalinga year ascending throne
edict state conquest kalinga men animal killed action many time number perished men animal carried away kalinga captives
ashoka state repentance suffering caused devote practice propagation dharma
proclaims considered slaughter death deportation caused conquest country painful deplorable considered suffering caused religious people householder even deplorable
edict ha inscribed several place including erragudi girnar kalsi maneshra shahbazgarhi kandahar
however omitted ashoka's inscription found kalinga region rock edict replaced two separate edict make mention ashoka's remorse
possible ashoka consider politically appropriate make confession people kalinga
another possibility kalinga war consequence described ashoka's rock edict imaginary real
description meant impress far removed scene thus unable verify accuracy
ancient source mention military activity ashoka although -century writer taranatha claim ashoka conquered entire jambudvipa
different source give different account ashoka's conversion buddhism
according sri lankan tradition ashoka's father bindusara wa devotee brahmanism mother dharma wa devotee ajivikas
samantapasadika state ashoka followed non-buddhist sect first three year reign
sri lankan text add ashoka wa happy behaviour brahmin received alms daily
courtier produced ajivika nigantha teacher also failed impress him
dipavamsa state ashoka invited several non-buddhist religious leader palace bestowed great gift upon hope would answer question posed king
text doe state question wa mention none invitee able answer it
one day ashoka saw young buddhist monk called nigrodha nyagrodha wa looking alms road pataliputra
wa king's nephew although king wa aware wa posthumous son ashoka's eldest brother sumana ashoka killed conflict throne
ashoka wa impressed nigrodha's tranquil fearless appearance asked teach faith
impressed sermon ashoka offered nigrodha silver coin daily portion rice
king became buddhist upasaka started visiting kukkutarama shrine pataliputra
temple met buddhist monk moggaliputta tissa became devoted buddhist faith
legend ashoka's search worthy teacher may aimed explaining ashoka adopt jainism another major contemporary faith advocate non-violence compassion
legend suggests ashoka wa attracted buddhism wa looking faith rather competent spiritual teacher
sri lankan tradition add sixth regnal year ashoka's son mahinda became buddhist monk daughter became buddhist nun
story divyavadana attribute ashoka's conversion buddhist monk samudra wa ex-merchant shravasti
according account samudra wa imprisoned ashoka's hell saved using miraculous powers
ashoka heard visited monk wa impressed series miracle performed monk
story ashokavadana state samudra wa merchant's son wa year-old boy met ashoka account seems influenced nigrodha story
another story claim young boy ate brahmana harassing ashoka interested buddhism brahmana later miraculously turned buddhist bhikkus kukkutarama monastery ashoka paid visit
several buddhist establishment existed various part india time ashoka's ascension
clear branch buddhist sangha influenced one capital pataliputra good candidate
another good candidate one mahabodhi major rock edict record visit bodhi tree place buddha's enlightenment mahabodhi tenth regnal year minor rock edict issued regnal year suggests become buddhist around time
according mahavamsa activity took place fifth-seventh regnal years
ashokavadana state ashoka collected seven eight relic gautama buddha portion kept box made gold silver cat's eye crystal
ordered construction stupa throughout earth town population more
told elder yashas monk kukkutarama monastery wanted stupa completed day
yashas stated would signal completion time eclipsing sun hand
mahavamsa state ashoka ordered construction viharas monastery rather stupa house relics
like ashokavadana mahavamsa describes ashoka's collection relic doe mention episode context construction activities
state ashoka decided construct viharas moggaliputta tissa told section buddha's dhamma
ashoka began construction ashokarama vihara ordered subordinate king build viharas
ashokarama wa completed miraculous power thera indagutta news completion viharas arrived various city day
nalanda mahavihara portion like sariputta stupa bihar india
taxila university portion like dharmarajika stupa kunala stupa taxila pakistan
mir rukun stupa nawabshah pakistanashoka's rock edict suggest eighth-ninth regnal year made pilgrimage bodhi tree started propagating dhamma performed social welfare activities
welfare activity included establishment medical treatment facility human animal plantation medicinal herb digging well plantation tree along roads
activity conducted neighbouring kingdom including cholas pandyas satiyaputras tamraparni greek kingdom antiyoka
edict also state tenth-eleventh regnal year ashoka became closer buddhist sangha went tour empire lasted least days
regnal year ashoka started inscribing edict propagate dhamma ordered officer rajjukas pradesikas tour jurisdiction every five year inspection preaching dhamma
sri lankan tradition present greater role ashoka buddhist community
lavish patronage state patronage lead many fake monk joining sangha
true buddhist monk refuse co-operate fake monk therefore uposatha ceremony held seven years
king attempt eradicate fake monk attempt over-zealous minister end killing real monks
king invite elder monk moggaliputta-tissa help expel non-buddhists monastery founded pataliputra
uposatha ceremony held tissa subsequently organises third buddhist council regnal year ashoka
tissa compiles kathavatthu text reaffirms theravadin orthodoxy several points
north indian tradition make mention event ha led doubt historicity third buddihst council
richard gombrich argues non-corroboration story inscriptional evidence cannot used dismiss completely unhistorical several ashoka's inscription may lost
gombrich also argues asohka's inscription prove wa interested maintaining unanimity purity sangha
example minor rock edict ashoka recommends member sangha study certain text remain unidentified
similarly inscription found sanchi sarnath kosam ashoka mandate dissident member sangha expelled express desire sangha remain united flourish
century buddhist pilgrim yijing record another story ashoka's involvement buddhist sangha
according story earlier king bimbisara wa contemporary gautama buddha saw fragment cloth stick dream
buddha interpreted dream mean philosophy would divided school death predicted king called ashoka would unite school hundred year later
sri lankan tradition moggaliputta-tissa patronised ashoka sends nine buddhist mission spread buddhism border area c bce
sri lanka sent son mahinda accompanied four theras itthiya uttiya sambala bhaddasala
next moggaliputta-tissa's help ashoka sent buddhist missionary distant region kashmir gandhara himalaya land yonas greek maharashtra suvannabhumi sri lanka
sri lankan tradition date mission ashoka's regnal year naming following missionaries
soa uttara suvaabhmi possibly lower burma thailandthe tradition add regnal year ashoka's daughter sanghamitta went sri lanka establish order nun taking sapling sacred bodhi tree her
ashoka's inscription also appear omit mention event recording one activity period regnal year donated khalatika cave ascetic provide shelter rainy season
ashoka's pillar edict suggest next year made pilgrimage lumbini place buddha's birth stupa buddha kanakamuni
rock edict xiii state ashoka's dhamma victory sending messenger five king several kingdoms
whether mission correspond buddhist mission recorded buddhist chronicle debated
indologist etienne lamotte argues dhamma missionary mentioned ashoka's inscription probably buddhist monk dhamma wa buddhism
moreover list destination mission date mission mentioned inscription tally one mentioned buddhist legends
scholar erich frauwallner richard gombrich believe mission mentioned sri lankan tradition historical
according scholar part story corroborated archaeological evidence vinaya nidana mention name five monk said gone himalayan region three name found inscribed relic casket found bhilsa near vidisha
casket dated early nd century bce inscription state monk himalayan school
mission may set vidisha central india casket discovered mahinda said stayed month setting sri lanka
according gombrich mission may included representative religion thus lamotte's objection dhamma valid
buddhist chronicler may decided mention non-buddhists sideline buddhism
frauwallner gombrich also believe ashoka wa directly responsible mission since resourceful ruler could sponsored activities
sri lankan chronicle belong theravada school exaggerate role theravadin monk moggaliputta-tissa order glorify sect
historian argue buddhism became major religion ashoka's royal patronage
however epigraphic evidence suggests spread buddhism north-western india deccan region wa le ashoka's mission merchant trader landowner artisan guild supported buddhist establishments
according ashokavadana ashoka resorted violence even converting buddhism
launched pogrom jains announcing bounty head heretic result beheading brother vitashokaaccording ashokavadana non-buddhist pundravardhana drew picture showing buddha bowing foot nirgrantha leader jnatiputra
term nirgrantha free bond wa originally used pre-jaina ascetic order later came used jaina monks
legend state complaint buddhist devotee ashoka issued order arrest non-buddhist artist subsequently another order kill ajivikas pundravardhana
sometime later another nirgrantha follower pataliputra drew similar picture
also announced award one dinara gold coin anyone brought head nirgrantha heretic
according ashokavadana result order brother wa mistaken heretic killed cowherd
several reason scholar say story persecution rival sect ashoka appear clear fabrication arising sectarian propaganda
ashoka's last dated inscription pillar edict regnal year
sri lankan tradition state ashoka's queen asandhamitta died regnal year nd regnal year wife tissarakkha wa given title queen
mahavamsa ashokavadana state ashoka extended favour attention bodhi tree jealous tissarakkha mistook bodhi mistress ashoka
according ashokavadana hired sorceress job ashoka explained bodhi wa name tree sorceress heal tree
according mahavamsa completely destroyed tree ashoka's regnal year
ashokavadana state tissarakkha called tishyarakshita made sexual advance towards ashoka's son kunala kunala rejected her
subsequently ashoka granted tissarakkha kingship seven day period tortured blinded kunala
ashoka threatened tear eye rip open body sharp rake impale alive spit cut nose saw cut tongue razor kunala regained eyesight miraculously pleaded mercy queen ashoka executed anyway
kshemendra's avadana-kalpa-lata also narrates legend seek improve ashoka's image stating forgave queen kunala regained eyesight
according sri lankan tradition ashoka died regnal year suggests died around bce
according ashokavadana emperor fell severely ill last days
started using state fund make donation buddhist sangha prompting minister deny access state treasury
ashoka started donating personal possession wa similarly restricted so
deathbed possession wa half myrobalan fruit offered sangha final donation
legend encourage generous donation sangha highlight role kingship supporting buddhist faith
legend state cremation body burned seven day nights
various source mention five consort ashoka devi vedisa-mahadevi-shakyakumari karuvaki asandhimitra pali asandhimitta padmavati tishyarakshita pali tissarakkha
kaurvaki queen ashoka known inscription mentioned edict inscribed pillar allahabad
inscription name mother prince tivara order royal officer mahamattas record religious charitable donations
according one theory tishyarakshita wa regnal name kaurvaki
according mahavamsa ashoka's chief queen wa asandhimitta died four year him
state wa born ashoka's queen previous life directed pratyekabuddha honey merchant wa later reborn ashoka
later text also state additionally gave pratyekabuddha piece cloth made her
text include dasavatthuppakarana so-called cambodian extended mahavamsa possibly - century trai bhumi katha century
text narrate another story one day ashoka mocked asandhamitta wa enjoying tasty piece sugarcane without earned karma
night guardian god informed past gift pratyekabuddha next day wa able miraculously procure robes
impressed ashoka make favourite queen even offer make sovereign ruler
asandhamitta refuse offer still invokes jealousy ashoka's women
ashoka prof superiority identical cake baked royal seal hidden one them
wife asked choose cake asandhamitta get one royal seal
trai bhumi katha claim wa asandhamitta encouraged husband become buddhist construct stupa viharas
according mahavamsa asandhamitta's death tissarakkha became chief queen
ashokavadana doe mention asandhamitta doe mention tissarakkha tishyarakshita
divyavadana mention another queen called padmavati wa mother crown-prince kunala
mentioned according sri lankan tradition ashoka fell love devi vidisha-mahadevi prince central india
ashoka's ascention throne devi chose remain vidisha move royal capital pataliputra
according mahavmsa ashoka's chief queen wa asandhamitta devi text doe talk connection two woman unlikely asandhamitta wa another name devi
sri lankan tradition us word samvasa describe relationship ashoka devi modern scholar variously interpret sexual relation outside marriage co-residence married couple
argue ashoka marry devi argue theory corroborated fact devi become ashoka's chief queen pataliputra ascension

divyavadana mention crown-prince kunala alias dharmavivardhana wa son queen padmavati
according sri lankan tradition ashoka daughter named sanghamitta became buddhist nun
section historian romila thapar doubt historicity sanghamitta based following points
name sanghamitta literally mean friend buddhist order sangha unusual story going ceylon ceylonese queen could ordained appears exaggeration
mahavamsa state married ashoka's nephew agnibrahma couple son named sumana
contemporary law regarding exogamy would forbidden marriage first cousins
according mahavamsa wa year old wa ordained nun
narrative suggests wa married two year earlier husband well child ordained
unlikely would allowed become nun young childanother source mention ashoka daughter named charumati married kshatriya named devapala
various source mention one ashoka's brother survived ascension narrate story role buddhist community

ashoka's various inscription suggest devoted propagation dharma pali dhamma term refers teaching gautama buddha buddhist circles
however ashoka's inscription mention buddhist doctrine four noble truth nirvana
