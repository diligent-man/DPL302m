ashoka o k brahmi asoka iast a oka also known as ashoka the great was an indian emperor of the maurya empire son of bindusara who ruled almost all of the indian subcontinent from c to bce
ashoka promoted the spread of buddhism across ancient asia
considered by many to be one of india s greatest emperors ashoka expanded chandragupta s empire to reign over territory stretching from present day afghanistan in the west to present day bangladesh in the east
it covered the entire indian subcontinent except for parts of present day tamil nadu
the empire s capital was pataliputra in magadha present day patna with provincial capitals at takshashila later taxila and ujjain
ashoka after the war of kalinga was upset with the bloodshed and vowed to never again wage a war of conquest
he patronized buddhism during his reign
ashoka waged a particularly destructive war against the state of kalinga which he conquered in about bce
according to an interpretation of his edicts he converted to buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the kalinga war which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than deaths and deportations
he is remembered for erecting the ashoka pillars and spreading his edicts for sending buddhist monks to sri lanka and central asia and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of gautama buddha
beyond the edicts of ashoka biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later such as the nd century ce ashokavadana narrative of ashoka a part of the divyavadana and in the sri lankan text mahavamsa great chronicle
the emblem of the modern republic of india is an adaptation of the lion capital of ashoka
his sanskrit name a oka means painless without sorrow the a privativum and oka pain distress
in his edicts he is referred to as dev n mpriya pali dev na piya or the beloved of the gods and priyadar in or priyadarshi pali piyadas or he who regards everyone with affection
his fondness for a tree is the reason for his name being connected to the ashoka tree or saraca asoca and this is referenced in the ashokavadana
in the outline of history h
wells wrote amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like the name of ashoka shines and shines almost alone a star
information about ashoka comes from his inscriptions other inscriptions that mention him or are possibly from his reign and ancient literature especially buddhist texts
these sources often contradict each other although various historians have attempted to correlate their testimony
plenty is known or not known
so for example while ashoka is often attributed with building many hospitals during his time there is no clear evidence that any hospitals existed in ancient india during the rd century bc or that ashoka was responsible for commissioning the construction of any
inscriptions
ashoka s inscriptions are the earliest self representations of imperial power in the indian subcontinent
however these inscriptions are focused mainly on the topic of dhamma and provide little information regarding other aspects of the maurya state and society
even on the topic of dhamma the content of these inscriptions cannot be taken at face value
in the words of american academic john s
strong it is sometimes helpful to think of ashoka s messages as propaganda by a politician whose aim is to present a favorable image of himself and his administration rather than record historical facts
a small number of other inscriptions also provide some information about ashoka
for example he finds a mention in the nd century junagadh rock inscription of rudradaman
an inscription discovered at sirkap mentions a lost word beginning with priy which is theorised to be ashoka s title priyadarshi although this is not certain
some other inscriptions such as the sohgaura copper plate inscription have been tentatively dated to ashoka s period by a section of scholars although others contest this
buddhist legends
much of the information about ashoka comes from buddhist legends which present him as a great ideal king
these legends appear in texts that are not contemporary to ashoka and were composed by buddhist authors who used various stories to illustrate the impact of their faith on ashoka
this makes it necessary to exercise caution while relying on them for historical information
among modern scholars opinions range from downright dismissal of these legends as mythological to acceptance of all historical portions that seem plausible
the buddhist legends about ashoka exist in several languages including sanskrit pali tibetan chinese burmese sinhala thai lao and khotanese
all these legends can be traced to two primary traditions
the north indian tradition preserved in the sanskrit language texts such as divyavadana including its constituent ashokavadana and chinese sources such as a y wang chuan and a y wang ching
the sri lankan tradition preserved in pali lanuage texts such as dipavamsa mahavamsa vamsatthapakasini a commentary on mahavamsa buddhaghosha s commentary on the vinaya and samanta pasadika there are several significant differences between the two traditions
for example the sri lankan tradition emphasizes ashoka s role in convening the third buddhist council and his dispatch of several missionaries to distant regions including his son mahinda to sri lanka
however the north indian tradition makes no mention of these events
it describes other events not found in the sri lankan tradition such as a story about another son named kunala
even while narrating the common stories the two traditions diverge in several ways
for example both ashokavadana and mahavamsa mention that ashoka s queen tishyarakshita had the bodhi tree destroyed
in ashokavadana the queen manages to have the tree healed after she realizes her mistake
in the mahavamsa she permanently destroys the tree but only after a branch of the tree has been transplanted in sri lanka
in another story both the texts describe ashoka s unsuccessful attempts to collect a relic of gautama buddha from ramagrama
in ashokavadana he fails to do so because he cannot match the devotion of the nagas who hold the relic however in the mahavamsa he fails to do so because the buddha had destined the relic to be enshrined by king dutthagamani of sri lanka
using such stories the mahavamsa glorifies sri lanka as the new preserve of buddhism
other sources
numismatic sculptural and archaeological evidence supplements research on ashoka
ashoka s name appears in the lists of mauryan kings in the various puranas
however these texts do not provide further details about him as their brahmanical authors were not patronized by the mauryans
other texts such as the arthashastra and indica of megasthenes which provide general information about the maurya period can also be used to make inferences about ashoka s reign
however the arthashastra is a normative text that focuses on an ideal rather than a historical state and its dating to the mauryan period is a subject of debate
the indica is a lost work and only parts of it survive in the form of paraphrases in later writings
the th century text rajatarangini mentions a kashmiri king ashoka of gonandiya dynasty who built several stupas some scholars such as aurel stein have identified this king with the maurya king ashoka others such as ananda w
guruge dismiss this identification as inaccurate
alternative interpretation of the epigraphic evidence
for some scholars such as christopher i
beckwith ashoka whose name only appears in the minor rock edicts is not the same as king piyadasi or devanampiya piyadasi i e
beloved of the gods piyadasi beloved of the gods being a fairly widespread title for king who is named as the author of the major pillar edicts and the major rock edicts
beckwith suggests that piyadasi was living in the rd century bce was probably the son of chandragupta maurya known to the greeks as amitrochates and only advocated for piety dharma in his major pillar edicts and major rock edicts without ever mentioning buddhism the buddha or the samgha the single notable exception is the th edict of the major pillar edicts which does mention the samgha but is a considered a later fake by beckwith
also the geographical spread of his inscription shows that piyadasi ruled a vast empire contiguous with the seleucid empire in the west
on the contrary for beckwith ashoka was a later king of the st nd century ce whose name only appears explicitly in the minor rock edicts and allusively in the minor pillar edicts and who does mention the buddha and the samgha explicitly promoting buddhism
the name priyadarsi does occur in two of the minor edicts gujarra and bairat but beckwith again considers them as later fabrications
the minor inscriptions cover a very different and much smaller geographical area clustering in central india
according to beckwith the inscriptions of this later ashoka were typical of the later forms of normative buddhism which are well attested from inscriptions and gandhari manuscripts dated to the turn of the millennium and around the time of the kushan empire
the quality of the inscriptions of this ashoka is significantly lower than the quality of the inscriptions of the earlier piyadasi
the name a shoka literally means without sorrow
according to an ashokavadana legend his mother gave him this name because his birth removed her sorrows
the name priyadasi is associated with ashoka in the rd th century ce dipavamsa
the term literally means he who regards amiably or of gracious mien sanskrit priya darshi
it may have been a regnal name adopted by ashoka
ashoka s inscriptions mention his title devanampiya sanskrit devanampriya beloved of the gods
the identification of devanampiya and ashoka as the same person is established by the maski and gujarra inscriptions which use both these terms for the king
the title was adopted by other kings including the contemporary king devanampiya tissa of anuradhapura and ashoka s descendant dasharatha maurya
ashoka s own inscriptions do not describe his early life and much of the information on this topic comes from apocryphal legends written hundreds of years after him
while these legends include obviously fictitious details such as narratives of ashoka s past lives they have some plausible historical information about ashoka s period
the exact date of ashoka s birth is not certain as the extant contemporary indian texts did not record such details
it is known that he lived in the rd century bce as his inscriptions mention several contemporary rulers whose dates are known with more certainty such as antiochus ii theos ptolemy ii philadelphus antigonus ii gonatas magas of cyrene and alexander of epirus or corinth
thus ashoka must have been born sometime in the late th century bce or early rd century bce c bce
ashoka s own inscriptions are fairly detailed but make no mention of his ancestors
other sources such as the puranas and the mahavamsa state that his father was the mauryan emperor bindusara and his grandfather was chandragupta the founder of the empire
the ashokavadana also names his father as bindusara but traces his ancestry to buddha s contemporary king bimbisara through ajatashatru udayin munda kakavarnin sahalin tulakuchi mahamandala prasenajit and nanda
the th century tibetan monk taranatha whose account is a distorted version of the earlier traditions describes ashoka as the illegitimate son of king nemita of champarana from the daughter of a merchant
ashokavadana states that ashoka s mother was the daughter of a brahmin from champa and was prophesized to marry a king
accordingly her father took her to pataliputra where she was inducted into bindusara s harem and ultimately became his chief queen
the ashokavadana does not mention her by name although other legends provide different names for her
for example the asokavadanamala calls her subhadrangi
the vamsatthapakasini or mahavamsa tika a commentary on mahavamsa calls her dharma dhamma in pali and states that she belonged to the moriya kshatriya clan
a divyavadana legend calls her janapada kalyani according to scholar ananda w
guruge this is not a name but an epithet
according to the nd century historian appian chandragupta entered into a marital alliance with the greek ruler seleucus i nicator which has led to speculation that either chandragupta or his son bindusara married a greek princess
however there is no evidence that ashoka s mother or grandmother was greek and most historians have dismissed the idea
according to the ashokavadana bindusara disliked ashoka because of his rough skin
one day bindusara asked the ascetic pingala vatsajiva to determine which of his sons was worthy of being his successor
he asked all the princes to assemble at the garden of the golden pavilion on the ascetic s advice
ashoka was reluctant to go because his father disliked him but his mother convinced him to do so
when minister radhagupta saw ashoka leaving the capital for the garden he offered to provide the prince with a royal elephant for the travel
at the garden pingala vatsajiva examined the princes and realised that ashoka would be the next king
to avoid annoying bindusara the ascetic refused to name the successor
instead he said that one who had the best mount seat drink vessel and food would be the next king each time ashoka declared that he met the criterion
later he told ashoka s mother that her son would be the next king and on her advice left the kingdom to avoid bindusara s wrath
while legends suggest that bindusara disliked ashoka s ugly appearance they also state that bindusara gave him important responsibilities such as suppressing a revolt in takshashila according to north indian tradition and governing ujjain according to sri lankan tradition
this suggests that bindusara was impressed by the other qualities of the prince
another possibility is that he sent ashoka to distant regions to keep him away from the imperial capital
according to the ashokavadana bindusara dispatched prince ashoka to suppress a rebellion in the city of takshashila present day bhir mound in pakistan
this episode is not mentioned in the sri lankan tradition which instead states that bindusara sent ashoka to govern ujjain
two other buddhist texts ashoka sutra and kunala sutra state that bindusara appointed ashoka as a viceroy in gandhara where takshashila was located not ujjain
the ashokavadana states that bindusara provided ashoka with a fourfold army comprising cavalry elephants chariots and infantry but refused to provide any weapons for this army
ashoka declared that weapons would appear before him if he was worthy of being a king and then the deities emerged from the earth and provided weapons to the army
when ashoka reached takshashila the citizens welcomed him and told him that their rebellion was only against the evil ministers not the king
sometime later ashoka has similarly welcomed in the khasa territory and the gods declared that he would go on to conquer the whole earth
takshashila was a prosperous and geopolitically influential city and historical evidence proves that by ashoka s time it was well connected to the mauryan capital pataliputra by the uttarapatha trade route
however no extant contemporary source mentions the takshashila rebellion and none of ashoka s records states that he ever visited the city
that said the historicity of the legend about ashoka s involvement in the takshashila rebellion may be corroborated by an aramaic language inscription discovered at sirkap near taxila
the inscription includes a name that begins with the letters prydr and most scholars restore it as priyadarshi which was the title of ashoka
another evidence of ashoka s connection to the city may be the name of the dharmarajika stupa near taxila the name suggests that it was built by ashoka dharma raja
the story about the deities miraculously bringing weapons to ashoka may be the text s way of deifying ashoka or indicating that bindusara who disliked ashoka wanted him to fail in takshashila
according to the mahavamsa bindusara appointed ashoka as the viceroy of present day ujjain ujjeni which was an important administrative and commercial centre in the avanti province of central india
this tradition is corroborated by the saru maru inscription discovered in central india this inscription states that he visited the place as a prince
ashoka s own rock edict mentions the presence of a prince viceroy at ujjain during his reign which further supports the tradition that he himself served as a viceroy at ujjain
pataliputra was connected to ujjain by multiple routes in ashoka s time and on the way ashoka entourage may have encamped at rupnath where his inscription has been found
according to the sri lankan tradition ashoka visited vidisha where he fell in love with a beautiful woman on his way to ujjain
according to the dipamvamsa and mahamvamsa the woman was devi the daughter of a merchant
according to the mahabodhi vamsa she was vidisha mahadevi and belonged to the shakya clan of gautama buddha
the buddhist chroniclers may have fabricated the shakya connection to connect ashoka s family to buddha
the buddhist texts allude to her being a buddhist in her later years but do not describe her conversion to buddhism
therefore it is likely that she was already a buddhist when she met ashoka
the mahavamsa states that devi gave birth to ashoka s son mahinda in ujjain and two years later to a daughter named sanghamitta
according to the mahavamsa ashoka s son mahinda was ordained at the age of years during the sixth year of ashoka s reign
that means mahinda must have been years old when ashoka ascended the throne
even if mahinda was born when ashoka was as young as years old ashoka must have ascended the throne at years which means he must have served as a viceroy for several years
legends suggest that ashoka was not the crown prince and his ascension on the throne was disputed
ashokavadana states that bindusara s eldest son susima once slapped a bald minister on his head in jest
the minister worried that after ascending the throne susima may jokingly hurt him with a sword
therefore he instigated five hundred ministers to support ashoka s claim to the throne when the time came noting that ashoka was predicted to become a chakravartin universal ruler
sometime later takshashila rebelled again and bindusara dispatched susima to curb the rebellion
shortly after bindusara fell ill and was expected to die soon
susima was still in takshashila having been unsuccessful in suppressing the rebellion
bindusara recalled him to the capital and asked ashoka to march to takshashila
however the ministers told him that ashoka was ill and suggested that he temporarily install ashoka on the throne until susmia s return from takshashila
when bindusara refused to do so ashoka declared that if the throne were rightfully his the gods would crown him as the next king
at that instance the gods did so bindusara died and ashoka s authority extended to the entire world including the yaksha territory located above the earth and the naga territory located below the earth
when susima returned to the capital ashoka s newly appointed prime minister radhagupta tricked him into a pit of charcoal
susima died a painful death and his general bhadrayudha became a buddhist monk
the mahavamsa states that when bindusara fell sick ashoka returned to pataliputra from ujjain and gained control of the capital
after his father s death ashoka had his eldest brother killed and ascended the throne
the text also states that ashoka killed ninety nine of his half brothers including sumana
the dipavamsa states that he killed a hundred of his brothers and was crowned four years later
the vamsatthapakasini adds that an ajivika ascetic had predicted this massacre based on the interpretation of a dream of ashoka s mother
according to these accounts only ashoka s uterine brother tissa was spared
other sources name the surviving brother vitashoka vigatashoka sudatta so ta to in a yi uang chuan or sugatra siu ka tu lu in fen pie kung te hun
the figures such as and are exaggerated and seem to be a way of stating that ashoka killed several of his brothers
taranatha states that ashoka who was an illegitimate son of his predecessor killed six legitimate princes to ascend the throne
it is possible that ashoka was not the rightful heir to the throne and killed a brother or brothers to acquire the throne
however the buddhist sources have exaggerated the story which attempts to portray him as evil before his conversion to buddhism
ashoka s rock edict no
mentions officers whose duties include supervising the welfare of the families of his brothers sisters and other relatives
this suggests that more than one of his brothers survived his ascension
however some scholars oppose this suggestion arguing that the inscription talks only about the families of his brothers not the brothers themselves
according to the sri lankan texts mahavamsa and the dipavamsa ashoka ascended the throne years after the death of gautama buddha and ruled for years
the date of the buddha s death is itself a matter of debate and the north indian tradition states that ashoka ruled a hundred years after the buddha s death which has led to further debates about the date
assuming that the sri lankan tradition is correct and assuming that the buddha died in bce a date proposed by several scholars ashoka must have ascended the throne in bce
the puranas state that ashoka s father bindusara reigned for years not years as specified in the sri lankan tradition
if this is true ashoka s ascension can be dated three years earlier to bce
alternatively if the sri lankan tradition is correct but if we assume that the buddha died in bce a date supported by the cantonese dotted record ashoka s ascension can be dated to bce
the mahavamsa states that ashoka consecrated himself as the king four years after becoming a sovereign
this interregnum can be explained assuming that he fought a war of succession with other sons of bindusara during these four years
the ashokavadana contains a story about ashoka s minister yashas hiding the sun with his hand
professor p
eggermont theorised that this story was a reference to a partial solar eclipse that was seen in northern india on may bce
according to the ashokavadana ashoka went on a pilgrimage to various buddhist sites sometime after this eclipse
ashoka s rummindei pillar inscription states that he visited lumbini during his st regnal year
assuming this visit was a part of the pilgrimage described in the text and assuming that ashoka visited lumbini around years after the solar eclipse the ascension date of bce seems more likely
however this theory is not universally accepted
for example according to john s
strong the event described in the ashokavadana has nothing to do with chronology and eggermont s interpretation grossly ignores the literary and religious context of the legend
both sri lankan and north indian traditions assert that ashoka was a violent person before buddhism
taranatha also states that ashoka was initially called kamashoka because he spent many years in pleasurable pursuits kama he was then called chandashoka ashoka the fierce because he spent some years performing evil deeds and finally he came to be known as dhammashoka ashoka the righteous after his conversion to buddhism
the ashokavadana also calls him chandashoka and describes several of his cruel acts
the ministers who had helped him ascend the throne started treating him with contempt after his ascension
to test their loyalty ashoka gave them the absurd order of cutting down every flower and fruit bearing tree
when they failed to carry out this order ashoka personally cut off the heads of ministers
one day during a stroll at a park ashoka and his concubines came across a beautiful ashoka tree
the sight put him in a sensual mood but the women did not enjoy caressing his rough skin
sometime later when ashoka fell asleep the resentful women chopped the flowers and the branches of his namesake tree
after ashoka woke up he burnt of his concubines to death as a punishment
alarmed by the king s involvement in such massacres prime minister radha gupta proposed hiring an executioner to carry out future mass killings to leave the king unsullied
girika a magadha village boy who boasted that he could execute the whole of jambudvipa was hired for the purpose
he came to be known as chandagirika girika the fierce and on his request ashoka built a jail in pataliputra
called ashoka s hell the jail looked lovely from outside but inside it girika brutally tortured the prisoners the th century chinese traveller faxian states that ashoka personally visited the underworld to study torture methods there and then invented his methods
the th century traveller xuanzang claims to have seen a pillar marking the site of ashoka s hell
the mahavamsa also briefly alludes to ashoka s cruelty stating that ashoka was earlier called chandashoka because of his evil deeds but came to be called dharmashoka because of his pious acts after his conversion to buddhism
however unlike the north indian tradition the sri lankan texts do not mention any specific evil deeds performed by ashoka except his killing of of his brothers
such descriptions of ashoka as an evil person before his conversion to buddhism appear to be a fabrication of the buddhist authors who attempted to present the change that buddhism brought to him as a miracle
in an attempt to dramatise this change such legends exaggerate ashoka s past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion
ashoka s inscriptions mention that he conquered the kalinga region during his th regnal year the destruction caused during the war made him repent violence and in the subsequent years he was drawn towards buddhism
edict of the edicts of ashoka rock inscriptions expresses the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of kalinga
on the other hand the sri lankan tradition suggests that ashoka was already a devoted buddhist by his th regnal year converted to buddhism during his th regnal year and constructed viharas during his th th regnal years
the buddhist legends make no mention of the kalinga campaign
based on sri lankan tradition some scholars such as eggermont believe ashoka converted to buddhism before the kalinga war
critics of this theory argue that if ashoka were already a buddhist he would not have waged the violent kalinga war
eggermont explains this anomaly by theorising that ashoka had his interpretation of the middle way
some earlier writers believed that ashoka dramatically converted to buddhism after seeing the suffering caused by the war since his major rock edict states that he became closer to the dhamma after the annexation of kalinga
however even if ashoka converted to buddhism after the war epigraphic evidence suggests that his conversion was a gradual process rather than a dramatic event
for example in a minor rock edict issued during his th regnal year five years after the kalinga campaign he states that he had been an upasaka lay buddhist for more than two and a half years but did not make much progress in the past year he was drawn closer to the sangha and became a more ardent follower
according to ashoka s major rock edict he conquered kalinga years after ascending to the throne
the edict states that during his conquest of kalinga men and animals were killed in action many times that number perished and men and animals were carried away from kalinga as captives
ashoka states that the repentance of these sufferings caused him to devote himself to the practice and propagation of dharma
he proclaims that he now considered the slaughter death and deportation caused during the conquest of a country painful and deplorable and that he considered the suffering caused to the religious people and householders even more deplorable
this edict has been inscribed at several places including erragudi girnar kalsi maneshra shahbazgarhi and kandahar
however it is omitted in ashoka s inscriptions found in the kalinga region where the rock edicts and have been replaced by two separate edicts that make no mention of ashoka s remorse
it is possible that ashoka did not consider it politically appropriate to make such a confession to the people of kalinga
another possibility is the kalinga war and its consequences as described in ashoka s rock edicts are more imaginary than real
this description is meant to impress those far removed from the scene thus unable to verify its accuracy
ancient sources do not mention any other military activity of ashoka although the th century writer taranatha claims that ashoka conquered the entire jambudvipa
different sources give different accounts of ashoka s conversion to buddhism
according to sri lankan tradition ashoka s father bindusara was a devotee of brahmanism and his mother dharma was a devotee of ajivikas
the samantapasadika states that ashoka followed non buddhist sects during the first three years of his reign
the sri lankan texts add that ashoka was not happy with the behaviour of the brahmins who received his alms daily
his courtiers produced some ajivika and nigantha teachers before him but these also failed to impress him
the dipavamsa states that ashoka invited several non buddhist religious leaders to his palace and bestowed great gifts upon them in the hope that they would answer a question posed by the king
the text does not state what the question was but mentions that none of the invitees were able to answer it
one day ashoka saw a young buddhist monk called nigrodha or nyagrodha who was looking for alms on a road in pataliputra
he was the king s nephew although the king was not aware of this he was a posthumous son of ashoka s eldest brother sumana whom ashoka had killed during the conflict for the throne
ashoka was impressed by nigrodha s tranquil and fearless appearance and asked him to teach him his faith
in response nigrodha offered him a sermon on appamada earnestness
impressed by the sermon ashoka offered nigrodha silver coins and daily portions of rice
the king became a buddhist upasaka and started visiting the kukkutarama shrine at pataliputra
at the temple he met the buddhist monk moggaliputta tissa and became more devoted to the buddhist faith
the veracity of this story is not certain
this legend about ashoka s search for a worthy teacher may be aimed at explaining why ashoka did not adopt jainism another major contemporary faith that advocates non violence and compassion
the legend suggests that ashoka was not attracted to buddhism because he was looking for such a faith rather for a competent spiritual teacher
the sri lankan tradition adds that during his sixth regnal year ashoka s son mahinda became a buddhist monk and his daughter became a buddhist nun
a story in divyavadana attributes ashoka s conversion to the buddhist monk samudra who was an ex merchant from shravasti
according to this account samudra was imprisoned in ashoka s hell but saved himself using his miraculous powers
when ashoka heard about this he visited the monk and was further impressed by a series of miracles performed by the monk
he then became a buddhist
a story in the ashokavadana states that samudra was a merchant s son and was a year old boy when he met ashoka this account seems to be influenced by the nigrodha story
the a yu wang chuan states that a year old buddhist converted ashoka
another story claims that the young boy ate brahmanas who were harassing ashoka for being interested in buddhism these brahmanas later miraculously turned into buddhist bhikkus at the kukkutarama monastery where ashoka paid a visit
several buddhist establishments existed in various parts of india by the time of ashoka s ascension
it is not clear which branch of the buddhist sangha influenced him but the one at his capital pataliputra is a good candidate
another good candidate is the one at mahabodhi the major rock edict records his visit to the bodhi tree the place of buddha s enlightenment at mahabodhi after his tenth regnal year and the minor rock edict issued during his th regnal year suggests that he had become a buddhist around the same time
both mahavamsa and ashokavadana state that ashoka constructed stupas or viharas
according to the mahavamsa this activity took place during his fifth seventh regnal years
the ashokavadana states that ashoka collected seven out of the eight relics of gautama buddha and had their portions kept in boxes made of gold silver cat s eye and crystal
he ordered the construction of stupas throughout the earth in towns that had a population of or more
he told elder yashas a monk at the kukkutarama monastery that he wanted these stupas to be completed on the same day
yashas stated that he would signal the completion time by eclipsing the sun with his hand
when he did so the stupas were completed at once
the mahavamsa states that ashoka ordered construction of viharas monasteries rather than the stupas to house the relics
like ashokavadana the mahavamsa describes ashoka s collection of the relics but does not mention this episode in the context of the construction activities
it states that ashoka decided to construct the viharas when moggaliputta tissa told him that there were sections of the buddha s dhamma
ashoka himself began the construction of the ashokarama vihara and ordered subordinate kings to build the other viharas
ashokarama was completed by the miraculous power of thera indagutta and the news about the completion of the viharas arrived from various cities on the same day
the construction of following stupas and viharas is credited to ashoka

sannati stupa karnataka india
mir rukun stupa nawabshah pakistanashoka s rock edicts suggest that during his eighth ninth regnal years he made a pilgrimage to the bodhi tree started propagating dhamma and performed social welfare activities
the welfare activities included establishment of medical treatment facilities for humans and animals plantation of medicinal herbs and digging of wells and plantation of trees along the roads
these activities were conducted in the neighbouring kingdoms including those of the cholas the pandyas the satiyaputras tamraparni the greek kingdom of antiyoka
the edicts also state that during his tenth eleventh regnal years ashoka became closer to the buddhist sangha and went on a tour of the empire that lasted for at least days
by his th regnal year ashoka had started inscribing edicts to propagate dhamma having ordered his officers rajjukas and pradesikas to tour their jurisdictions every five years for inspection and for preaching dhamma
by the next year he had set up the post of the dharma mahamatra
during his th regnal year he commissioned the enlargement of the stupa of buddha kanakamuni
the sri lankan tradition presents a greater role for ashoka in the buddhist community
in this tradition ashoka starts feeding monks on a large scale
his lavish patronage to the state patronage leads to many fake monks joining the sangha
the true buddhist monks refuse to co operate with these fake monks and therefore no uposatha ceremony is held for seven years
the king attempts to eradicate the fake monks but during this attempt an over zealous minister ends up killing some real monks
the king then invites the elder monk moggaliputta tissa to help him expel non buddhists from the monastery founded by him at pataliputra
monks bhikkhus convicted of being heretical are de frocked in the ensuing process
the uposatha ceremony is then held and tissa subsequently organises the third buddhist council during the th regnal year of ashoka
tissa compiles kathavatthu a text that reaffirms theravadin orthodoxy on several points
the north indian tradition makes no mention of these events which has led to doubts about the historicity of the third buddihst council
richard gombrich argues that the non corroboration of this story by inscriptional evidence cannot be used to dismiss it as completely unhistorical as several of ashoka s inscriptions may have been lost
gombrich also argues that asohka s inscriptions prove that he was interested in maintaining the unanimity and purity of the sangha
for example in his minor rock edict ashoka recommends the members of the sangha to study certain texts most of which remain unidentified
similarly in an inscription found at sanchi sarnath and kosam ashoka mandates that the dissident members of the sangha should be expelled and expresses his desire to the sangha remain united and flourish
the th century buddhist pilgrim yijing records another story about ashoka s involvement in the buddhist sangha
according to this story the earlier king bimbisara who was a contemporary of the gautama buddha once saw fragments of a cloth and a stick in a dream
the buddha interpreted the dream to mean that his philosophy would be divided into schools after his death and predicted that a king called ashoka would unite these schools over a hundred years later
in the sri lankan tradition moggaliputta tissa who is patronised by ashoka sends out nine buddhist missions to spread buddhism in the border areas in c bce
this tradition does not credit ashoka directly with sending these missions
each mission comprises five monks and is headed by an elder
to sri lanka he sent his own son mahinda accompanied by four other theras itthiya uttiya sambala and bhaddasala
next with moggaliputta tissa s help ashoka sent buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as kashmir gandhara himalayas the land of the yonas greeks maharashtra suvannabhumi and sri lanka
the sri lankan tradition dates these missions to ashoka s th regnal year naming the following missionaries
mahinda to sri lanka
majjhantika to kashmir and gandhara
mahadeva to mahisa mandala possibly modern mysore region
rakkhita to vanavasa
dhammarakkhita the greek to aparantaka western india
maha dhamma rakkhita to maharashtra
maharakkhita to the greek country
majjhima to the himalayas
so a and uttara to suva abh mi possibly lower burma and thailand the tradition adds that during his th regnal year ashoka s daughter sanghamitta went to sri lanka to establish an order of nuns taking a sapling of the sacred bodhi tree with her
the north indian tradition makes no mention of these events
ashoka s own inscriptions also appear to omit any mention of these events recording only one of his activities during this period in his th regnal year he donated the khalatika cave to ascetics to provide them a shelter during the rainy season
ashoka s pillar edicts suggest that during the next year he made pilgrimage to lumbini the place of buddha s birth and to the stupa of the buddha kanakamuni
the rock edict xiii states that ashoka s won a dhamma victory by sending messengers to five kings and several other kingdoms
whether these missions correspond to the buddhist missions recorded in the buddhist chronicles is debated
indologist etienne lamotte argues that the dhamma missionaries mentioned in ashoka s inscriptions were probably not buddhist monks as this dhamma was not same as buddhism
moreover the lists of destinations of the missions and the dates of the missions mentioned in the inscriptions do not tally the ones mentioned in the buddhist legends
other scholars such as erich frauwallner and richard gombrich believe that the missions mentioned in the sri lankan tradition are historical
according to these scholars a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence the vinaya nidana mentions names of five monks who are said to have gone to the himalayan region three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at bhilsa near vidisha
these caskets have been dated to the early nd century bce and the inscription states that the monks are of the himalayan school
the missions may have set out from vidisha in central india as the caskets were discovered there and as mahinda is said to have stayed there for a month before setting out for sri lanka
according to gombrich the mission may have included representatives of other religions and thus lamotte s objection about dhamma is not valid
the buddhist chroniclers may have decided not to mention these non buddhists so as not to sideline buddhism
frauwallner and gombrich also believe that ashoka was directly responsible for the missions since only a resourceful ruler could have sponsored such activities
the sri lankan chronicles which belong to the theravada school exaggerate the role of the theravadin monk moggaliputta tissa in order to glorify their sect
some historians argue that buddhism became a major religion because of ashoka s royal patronage
however epigraphic evidence suggests that the spread of buddhism in north western india and deccan region was less because of ashoka s missions and more because of merchants traders landowners and the artisan guilds who supported buddhist establishments
according to the ashokavadana ashoka resorted to violence even after converting to buddhism
for example
he slowly tortured chandagirika to death in the hell prison
he ordered a massacre of heretics for a misdeed of one
he launched a pogrom against the jains announcing a bounty on the head of any heretic this results in the beheading of his own brother vitashoka according to the ashokavadana a non buddhist in pundravardhana drew a picture showing the buddha bowing at the feet of the nirgrantha leader jnatiputra
the term nirgrantha free from bonds was originally used for a pre jaina ascetic order but later came to be used for jaina monks
jnatiputra is identified with mahavira th tirthankara of jainism
the legend states that on complaint from a buddhist devotee ashoka issued an order to arrest the non buddhist artist and subsequently another order to kill all the ajivikas in pundravardhana
around followers of the ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order
sometime later another nirgrantha follower in pataliputra drew a similar picture
ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house
he also announced an award of one dinara gold coin to anyone who brought him the head of a nirgrantha heretic
according to ashokavadana as a result of this order his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd
ashoka realised his mistake and withdrew the order
for several reasons scholars say these stories of persecutions of rival sects by ashoka appear to be clear fabrications arising out of sectarian propaganda
ashoka s last dated inscription the pillar edict is from his th regnal year
the only source of information about ashoka s later years are the buddhist legends
the sri lankan tradition states that ashoka s queen asandhamitta died during his th regnal year and in his nd regnal year his wife tissarakkha was given the title of queen
both mahavamsa and ashokavadana state that ashoka extended favours and attention to the bodhi tree and a jealous tissarakkha mistook bodhi to be a mistress of ashoka
she then used black magic to make the tree wither
according to the ashokavadana she hired a sorceress to do the job and when ashoka explained that bodhi was the name of a tree she had the sorceress heal the tree
according to the mahavamsa she completely destroyed the tree during ashoka s th regnal year
the ashokavadana states that tissarakkha called tishyarakshita here made sexual advances towards ashoka s son kunala but kunala rejected her
subsequently ashoka granted tissarakkha kingship for seven days and during this period she tortured and blinded kunala
ashoka then threatened to tear out her eyes rip open her body with sharp rakes impale her alive on a spit cut off her nose with a saw cut out her tongue with a razor kunala regained his eyesight miraculously and pleaded for mercy from the queen but ashoka had her executed anyway
kshemendra s avadana kalpa lata also narrates this legend but seeks to improve ashoka s image by stating that he forgave the queen after kunala regained his eyesight
according to the sri lankan tradition ashoka died during his th regnal year which suggests that he died around bce
according to the ashokavadana the emperor fell severely ill during his last days
he started using state funds to make donations to the buddhist sangha prompting his ministers to deny him access to the state treasury
ashoka then started donating his personal possessions but was similarly restricted from doing so
on his deathbed his only possession was the half of a myrobalan fruit which he offered to the sangha as his final donation
such legends encourage generous donations to the sangha and highlight the role of the kingship in supporting the buddhist faith
legend states that during his cremation his body burned for seven days and nights
various sources mention five consorts of ashoka devi or vedisa mahadevi shakyakumari karuvaki asandhimitra pali asandhimitta padmavati and tishyarakshita pali tissarakkha
kaurvaki is the only queen of ashoka known from his own inscriptions she is mentioned in an edict inscribed on a pillar at allahabad
the inscription names her as the mother of prince tivara and orders the royal officers mahamattas to record her religious and charitable donations
according to one theory tishyarakshita was the regnal name of kaurvaki
according to the mahavamsa ashoka s chief queen was asandhimitta who died four years before him
it states that she was born as ashoka s queen because in a previous life she directed a pratyekabuddha to a honey merchant who was later reborn as ashoka
some later texts also state that she additionally gave the pratyekabuddha a piece of cloth made by her
these texts include the dasavatthuppakarana the so called cambodian or extended mahavamsa possibly from th th centuries and the trai bhumi katha th century
these texts narrate another story one day ashoka mocked asandhamitta was enjoying a tasty piece of sugarcane without having earned it through her karma
asandhamitta replied that all her enjoyments resulted from merit resulting from her own karma
ashoka then challenged her to prove this by procuring robes as an offering for monks
at night the guardian gods informed her about her past gift to the pratyekabuddha and next day she was able to miraculously procure the robes
an impressed ashoka makes her his favourite queen and even offers to make her a sovereign ruler
asandhamitta refuses the offer but still invokes the jealousy of ashoka s other women
ashoka proves her superiority by having identical cakes baked with his royal seal hidden in only one of them
each wife is asked to choose a cake and only asandhamitta gets the one with the royal seal
the trai bhumi katha claims that it was asandhamitta who encouraged her husband to become a buddhist and to construct stupas and viharas
according to mahavamsa after asandhamitta s death tissarakkha became the chief queen
the ashokavadana does not mention asandhamitta at all but does mention tissarakkha as tishyarakshita
the divyavadana mentions another queen called padmavati who was the mother of the crown prince kunala
as mentioned above according to the sri lankan tradition ashoka fell in love with devi or vidisha mahadevi as a prince in central india
after ashoka s ascention to the throne devi chose to remain at vidisha than move to the royal capital pataliputra
according to the mahavmsa ashoka s chief queen was asandhamitta not devi the text does not talk of any connection between the two women so it is unlikely that asandhamitta was another name for devi
the sri lankan tradition uses the word samvasa to describe the relationship between ashoka and devi which modern scholars variously interpret as sexual relations outside marriage or co residence as a married couple
those who argue that ashoka did not marry devi argue that their theory is corroborated by the fact that devi did not become ashoka s chief queen in pataliputra after his ascension
the dipavamsa refers to two children of ashoka and devi mahinda and sanghamitta
tivara the son of ashoka and karuvaki is the only of ashoka s sons to be mentioned by name in the inscriptions
according to north indian tradition ashoka had a son named kunala
kunala had a son named samprati
the sri lankan tradition mentions a son called mahinda who was sent to sri lanka as a buddhist missionary this son is not mentioned at all in the north indian tradition
the chinese pilgrim xuanzang states that mahinda was ashoka s younger brother vitashoka or vigatashoka rather than his illgetimate son
the divyavadana mentions the crown prince kunala alias dharmavivardhana who was a son of queen padmavati
according to faxian dharmavivardhana was appointed as the governor of gandhara
the rajatarangini mentions jalauka as a son of ashoka
according to sri lankan tradition ashoka had a daughter named sanghamitta who became a buddhist nun
a section of historians such as romila thapar doubt the historicity of sanghamitta based on the following points
the name sanghamitta which literally means the friend of the buddhist order sangha is unusual and the story of her going to ceylon so that the ceylonese queen could be ordained appears to be an exaggeration
the mahavamsa states that she married ashoka s nephew agnibrahma and the couple had a son named sumana
the contemporary laws regarding exogamy would have forbidden such a marriage between first cousins
according to the mahavamsa she was years old when she was ordained as a nun
the narrative suggests that she was married two years earlier and that her husband as well as her child were ordained
it is unlikely that she would have been allowed to become a nun with such a young child another source mentions that ashoka had a daughter named charumati who married a kshatriya named devapala
according to the ashokavadana ashoka had an elder half brother named susima
according to the sri lankan tradition ashoka killed his half brothers
various sources mention that one of ashoka s brothers survived his ascension and narrate stories about his role in the buddhist community
according to sri lankan tradition this brother was tissa who initially lived a luxurious life without worrying about the world
to teach him a lesson ashoka put him on the throne for a few days then accused him of being an usurper and sentenced him to die after seven days
during these seven days tissa realised that the buddhist monks gave up pleasure because they were aware of the eventual death
he then left the palace and became an arhat
the theragatha commentary calls this brother vitashoka
according to this legend one day vitashoka saw a grey hair on his head and realised that he had become old
he then retired to a monastery and became an arhat
faxian calls the younger brother mahendra and states that ashoka shamed him for his immoral behaviour
the brother than retired to a dark cave where he meditated and became an arhat
ashoka invited him to return to the family but he preferred to live alone on a hill
so ashoka had a hill built for him within pataliputra
the ashoka vadana states that ashoka s brother was mistaken for a nirgrantha and killed during a massacre of the nirgranthas ordered by ashoka the extent of the territory controlled by ashoka s predecessors is not certain but it is possible that the empire of his grandfather chandragupta extended across northern india from the western coast arabian sea to the eastern coast bay of bengal covering nearly two thirds of the indian subcontinent
bindusara and ashoka seem to have extended the empire southwards
the distribution of ashoka s inscriptions suggests that his empire included almost the entire indian subcontinent except its southernmost parts
the rock edicts and suggest that these southernmost parts were controlled by the cholas the pandyas the keralaputras and the satiyaputras
in the north west ashoka s kingdom extended up to kandahar to the east of the seleucid empire ruled by antiochus ii
the capital of ashoka s empire was pataliputra in the magadha region
the buddhist legends state that ashoka converted to buddhism although this has been debated by a section of scholars
the minor rock edict leaves no doubt that ashoka was a follower of buddhism
in this edict he calls himself an upasaka a lay follower of buddhism and a sakya i e
buddhist after gautama buddha s title shakya muni
this and several other edicts are evidence of his buddhist affiliation
in his minor rock edict ashoka adds that he did not make much progress for a year after becoming an upasaka but then he went to the sangha and made more progress
it is not certain what going to the sangha means the buddhist tradition that he lived with monks may be an exaggeration but it clearly means that ashoka was drawn closer to buddhism
in his minor rock edict he calls himself an upasaka and records his faith in the buddha and the sangha
in the major rock edict he records his visit to sambodhi the sacred bodhi tree at bodh gaya ten years after his coronation
in the lumbini rumminidei inscription he records his visit to the buddha s birthplace and declares his reverence for the buddha and the sangha
in the nigalisagar inscription he records his doubling in size of a stupa dedicated to a former buddha and his visit to the site for worship
some of his inscriptions reflect his interest in maintaining the buddhist sangha see purification of sangha below
the saru maru inscription states that ashoka dispatched the message while travelling to upunita vihara in manema desha
although the identity of the destination is not certain it was obviously a buddhist monastery vihara a legend in the buddhist text vamsatthapakasini states that an ajivika ascetic invited to interpret a dream of ashoka s mother had predicted that he would patronise buddhism and destroy heretical sects
however such assertions are directly contradicted by ashoka s own inscriptions
ashoka s edicts such as the rock edicts and emphasise tolerance of all sects
similarly in his rock edict ashoka honours people of all faiths
in his inscriptions ashoka dedicates caves to non buddhist ascetics and repeatedly states that both brahmins and shramanas deserved respect
he also tells people not to denigrate other sects but to inform themselves about them
in fact there is no evidence that buddhism was a state religion under ashoka
none of ashoka s extant edicts record his direct donations to the buddhists
one inscription records donations by his queen karuvaki while the emperor is known to have donated the barabar caves to the ajivikas
there are some indirect references to his donations to buddhists
for example the nigalisagar pillar inscription records his enlargement of the konakamana stupa
similarly the lumbini rumminidei inscription states that he exempted the village of buddha s birth from the land tax and reduced the revenue tax to one eighth
ashoka appointed the dhamma mahamatta officers whose duties included the welfare of various religious sects including the buddhist sangha brahmins ajivikas and nirgranthas
the rock edicts and and the pillar edict mandate donations to all religious sects
ashoka s minor rock edict contains the phrase amiss dev
according to one interpretation the term amiss derives from the word am a false and thus the phrase is a reference to ashoak s belief in true and false gods
however it is more likely that the term derives from the word ami ra not mingled and the phrase refers to celestial beings who did not mingle with humans
the inscription claims that the righteousness generated by adoption of dhamma by the humans attracted even the celestial gods who did not mingle with humans
ashoka s various inscriptions suggest that he devoted himself to the propagation of dharma pali dhamma a term that refers to the teachings of gautama buddha in the buddhist circles
however ashoka s own inscriptions do not mention buddhist doctrines such as the four noble truths or nirvana
the word dharma has various connotations in the indian religions and can be generally translated as law duty or righteousness
in the kandahar inscriptions of ashoka the word dharma has been translated as eusebeia greek and qsyt aramaic which further suggests that his dharma meant something more generic than buddhism
the inscriptions suggest that for ashoka dharma meant a moral polity of active social concern religious tolerance ecological awareness the observance of common ethical precepts and the renunciation of war for example
abolition of the death penalty pillar edict iv
plantation of banyan trees and mango groves and construction of resthouses and wells every metres mile along the roads
pillar edict
restriction on killing of animals in the royal kitchen rock edict the number of animals killed was limited to two peacocks and a deer daily and in future even these animals were not to be killed
provision of medical facilities for humans and animals rock edict
encouragement of obedience to parents generosity toward priests and ascetics and frugality in spending rock edict
he commissions officers to work for the welfare and happiness of the poor and aged rock edict
promotion of the welfare of all beings so as to pay off his debt to living creatures and to work for their happiness in this world and the next rock edict modern scholars have variously understood this dhamma as a buddhist lay ethic a set of politico moral ideas a sort of universal religion or as an ashokan innovation
on the other hand it has also been interpreted as an essentially political ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire
ashoka instituted a new category of officers called the dhamma mahamattas who were tasked with the welfare of the aged the infrm the women and children and various religious sects
they were also sent on diplomatic missions to the hellenistic kingdoms of west asia in order to propagate the dhamma
historically the image of ashoka in the global buddhist circles was based on legends such as those mentioned in the ashokavadana rather than his rock edicts
this was because the brahmi script in which these edicts were written was forgotten soon and remained undeciphered until its study by james prinsep in the th century
the writings of the chinese buddhist pilgrims such as faxian and xuanzang suggest that ashoka s inscriptions mark the important sites associated with gautama buddha
these writers attribute buddhism related content to ashoka s edicts but this content does not match with the actual text of the inscriptions as determined by modern scholars after the decipherment of the brahmi script
it is likely that the script was forgotten by the time of faxian who probably relied on local guides these guides may have made up some buddhism related interpretations to gratify him or may have themselves relied on faulty translations based on oral traditions
xuanzang may have encountered a similar situation or may have taken the supposed content of the inscriptions from faxian s writings
this theory is corroborated by the fact that some brahmin scholars are known to have similarly come up with a fanciful interpretation of ashoka pillar inscriptions when requested to decipher them by the th century muslim king firuz shah tughlaq
according to shams i siraj s tarikh i firoz shahi after the king had these pillar transported from topra and mirat to delhi as war trophies these brahmins told him that the inscriptions prophesized that nobody would be able to remove the pillars except a king named firuz
moreover by this time there were local traditions that attributed the erection of these pillars to the legendary hero bhima
according to scholars such as richard gombrich ashoka s dharma shows buddhist influence
for example the kalinga separate edict i seems to be inspired by buddha s advice to sigala and his other sermons
ashoka s rock edicts declare that injuring living things is not good and no animal should be slaughtered for sacrifice
however he did not prohibit common cattle slaughter or beef eating
he imposed a ban on killing of all four footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible and of specific animal species including several birds certain types of fish and bulls among others
he also banned killing of female goats sheep and pigs that were nursing their young as well as their young up to the age of six months
he also banned killing of all fish and castration of animals during certain periods such as chaturmasa and uposatha
ashoka also abolished the royal hunting of animals and restricted the slaying of animals for food in the royal residence
because he banned hunting created many veterinary clinics and eliminated meat eating on many holidays the mauryan empire under ashoka has been described as one of the very few instances in world history of a government treating its animals as citizens who are as deserving of its protection as the human residents
it is well known that ashoka sent d tas or emissaries to convey messages or letters written or oral rather both to various people
the vith rock edict about oral orders reveals this
it was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones and the content of ashoka s messages can be inferred likewise from the xiiith rock edict they were meant to spread his dhammavijaya which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere including far beyond india
there is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the kharosthi script and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script as achaemenid influence is seen in some of the formulations used by ashoka in his inscriptions
this indicates to us that ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls
in his rock edicts ashoka states that he had encouraged the transmission of buddhism to the hellenistic kingdoms to the west and that the greeks in his dominion were converts to buddhism and recipients of his envoys
it is possible but not certain that ashoka received letters from greek rulers and was acquainted with the hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the achaemenid kings given the presence of ambassadors of hellenistic kings in india as well as the d tas sent by ashoka himself
dionysius is reported to have been such a greek ambassador at the court of ashoka sent by ptolemy ii philadelphus who himself is mentioned in the edicts of ashoka as a recipient of the buddhist proselytism of ashoka
some hellenistic philosophers such as hegesias of cyrene who probably lived under the rule of king magas one of the supposed recipients of buddhist emissaries from asoka are sometimes thought to have been influenced by buddhist teachings
the greeks in india even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of buddhism as some of the emissaries of ashoka such as dharmaraksita are described in pali sources as leading greek yona buddhist monks active in spreading buddhism the mahavamsa xii
some greeks yavana may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by ashoka
the girnar inscription of rudradaman records that during the rule of ashoka a yavana governor was in charge in the area of girnar gujarat mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir
it is thought that ashoka s palace at patna was modelled after the achaemenid palace of persepolis
buddhist legends mention stories about ashoka s past lives
according to a mahavamsa story ashoka nigrodha and devnampiya tissa were brothers in a previous life
in that life a pratyekabuddha was looking for honey to cure another sick pratyekabuddha
a woman directed him to a honey shop owned by the three brothers
ashoka generously donated honey to the pratyekabuddha and wished to become the sovereign ruler of jambudvipa for this act of merit
the woman wished to become his queen and was reborn as ashoka s wife asandhamitta
later pali texts credit her with an additional act of merit she gifted the pratyekabuddha a piece of cloth made by her
these texts include the dasavatthuppakarana the so called cambodian or extended mahavamsa possibly from th th centuries and the trai bhumi katha th century
according to an ashokavadana story ashoka was born as jaya in a prominent family of rajagriha
when he was a little boy he gave the gautama buddha dirt imagining it to be food
the buddha approved of the donation and jaya declared that he would become a king by this act of merit
the text also state that jaya s companion vijaya was reborn as ashoka s prime minister radhagupta
in the later life the buddhist monk upagupta tells ashoka that his rough skin was caused by the impure gift of dirt in the previous life
some later texts repeat this story without mentioning the negative implications of gifting dirt these texts include kumaralata s kalpana manditika aryashura s jataka mala and the maha karma vibhaga
the chinese writer pao ch eng s shih chia ju lai ying hua lu asserts that an insignificant act like gifting dirt could not have been meritorious enough to cause ashoka s future greatness
instead the text claims that in another past life ashoka commissioned a large number of buddha statues as a king and this act of merit caused him to become a great emperor in the next life
the th century pali language fairy tale dasavatthuppakarana possibly from c
th century combines the stories about the merchant s gift of honey and the boy s gift of dirt
it narrates a slightly different version of the mahavamsa story stating that it took place before the birth of the gautama buddha
it then states that the merchant was reborn as the boy who gifted dirt to the buddha however in this case the buddha his attendant to nanda to create plaster from the dirt which is used repair cracks in the monastery walls
besides the various stupas attributed to ashoka the pillars erected by him survive at various places in the indian subcontinent
ashoka is often credited with the beginning of stone architecture in india possibly following the introduction of stone building techniques by the greeks after alexander the great
before ashoka s time buildings were probably built in non permanent material such as wood bamboo or thatch
ashoka may have rebuilt his palace in pataliputra by replacing wooden material by stone and may also have used the help of foreign craftmen
ashoka also innovated by using the permanent qualities of stone for his written edicts as well as his pillars with buddhist symbolism
ashokan capitals were highly realistic and used a characteristic polished finish mauryan polish giving a shiny appearance to the stone surface
lion capital of ashoka the capital of one of the pillars erected by ashoka features a carving of a spoked wheel known as the ashoka chakra
this wheel represents the wheel of dhamma set in motion by the gautama buddha and appears on the flag of modern india
this capital also features sculptures of lions which appear on the seal of india
the edicts of ashoka are a collection of inscriptions on the pillars of ashoka as well as boulders and cave walls issued during his reign
these inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern day pakistan and india and represent the first tangible evidence of buddhism
the edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of indian history offering more information about ashoka s proselytism moral precepts religious precepts and his notions of social and animal welfare
before ashoka the royal communications appear to have been written on perishable materials such as palm leaves birch barks cotton cloth and possibly wooden boards
while ashoka s administration would have continued to use these materials ashoka also had his messages inscribed on rock edicts
ashoka probably got the idea of putting up these inscriptions from the neighbouring achaemenid empire
it is likely that ashoka s messages were also inscribed on more perishable materials such as wood and sent to various parts of the empire
none of these records survive now
scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the edicts particularly in regard to imperial vision and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a virtually subcontinental and culturally and economically highly variegated rd century bce indian empire
nonetheless it remains clear that ashoka s inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the indian subcontinent and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices
most of ashoka s inscriptions are written in a mixture of various prakrit dialects in the brahmi script
several of ashoka s inscriptions appear to have been set up near towns on important routes and at places of religious significance
many of the inscriptions have been discovered in hills rock shelters and places of local significance
various theories have been put forward about why ashoka or his officials chose such places including that they were centres of megalithic cultures were regarded as sacred spots in ashoka s time or that their physical grandeur may be symbolic of spiritual dominance
ashoka s inscriptions have not been found at major cities of the maurya empire such as pataliputra vidisha ujjayini and taxila
it is possible that many of these inscriptions are lost the th century chinese pilgrim xuanzang refers to some of ashoka s pillar edicts which have not been discovered by modern researchers
it appears that ashoka dispatched every message to his provincial governors who in turn relayed it to various officials in their territory
for example the minor rock edict appears in several versions at multiple places all the versions state that ashoka issued the proclamation while on a tour having spent days on tour
the number indicates that the message was dispatched simultaneously to various places
three versions of a message found at edicts in the neighbouring places in karnataka brahmagiri siddapura and jatinga rameshwara were sent from the southern province s capital suvarnagiri to various places
all three versions contain the same message preceded by an initial greeting from the arya putra presumably ashoka s son and the provincial governor and the mahamatras officials in suvarnagiri
the caduceus appears as a symbol of the punch marked coins of the maurya empire in india in the rd nd century bce
numismatic research suggests that this symbol was the symbol of king ashoka his personal mudra
this symbol was not used on the pre mauryan punch marked coins but only on coins of the maurya period together with the three arched hill symbol the peacock on the hill the triskelis and the taxila mark
ashoka had almost been forgotten but in the th century james prinsep contributed in the revelation of historical sources
after deciphering the brahmi script prinsep had originally identified the priyadasi of the inscriptions he found with the king of ceylon devanampiya tissa
however in george turnour discovered an important sri lankan manuscript dipavamsa or island chronicle associating piyadasi with ashoka
since then the association of devanampriya priyadarsin with ashoka was confirmed through various inscriptions and especially confirmed in the minor rock edict inscription discovered in maski directly associating ashoka with his regnal title devanampriya beloved of the gods
another important historian was british archaeologist john hubert marshall who was director general of the archaeological survey of india
his main interests were sanchi and sarnath in addition to harappa and mohenjodaro
sir alexander cunningham a british archaeologist and army engineer and often known as the father of the archaeological survey of india unveiled heritage sites like the bharhut stupa sarnath sanchi and the mahabodhi temple
mortimer wheeler a british archaeologist also exposed ashokan historical sources especially the taxila
the use of buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of ashoka as well as the interpretations of his edicts
building on traditional accounts early scholars regarded ashoka as a primarily buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion from the vedic religion to buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the buddhist monastic institution
some scholars have tended to question this assessment
romila thappar writes about ashoka that we need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics the only source of information not attributable to buddhist sources are the ashokan edicts and these do not explicitly state that ashoka was a buddhist
in his edicts ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time buddhism brahmanism jainism and ajivikaism and his edicts addressed to the population at large there are some addressed specifically to buddhists this is not the case for the other religions generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept
for example amartya sen writes the indian emperor ashoka in the third century bce presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other
however the edicts alone strongly indicate that he was a buddhist
in one edict he belittles rituals and he banned vedic animal sacrifices these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the vedic tradition for guidance
furthermore many edicts are expressed to buddhists alone in one ashoka declares himself to be an upasaka and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with buddhist texts
he erected rock pillars at buddhist holy sites but did not do so for the sites of other religions
he also used the word dhamma to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action this was an exclusively buddhist use of the word
however he used the word more in the spirit than as a strict code of conduct
romila thappar writes his dhamma did not derive from divine inspiration even if its observance promised heaven
