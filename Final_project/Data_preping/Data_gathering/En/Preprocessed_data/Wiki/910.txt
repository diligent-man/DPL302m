Sky Atlantic is a British pay television channel owned by Sky Group Limited broadcast in the United Kingdom and Ireland
The channel is primarily dedicated to imported programmes from the United States, and holds the domestic rights to HBO and until the end of 2021 Showtime dramas, but also broadcasts many original British produced Sky dramas
It is exclusively available on the Sky satellite TV platform (including Sky Go) and Sky's Now TV platform.
Sky Deutschland broadcasts a German-language version of the channel in Germany and Austria, while Sky Italia broadcasts an Italian-language version of the channel in Italy
Their programming is also dominated by HBO and Showtime series, usually dubbed in the domestic language
The Italian channel also premieres Sky Originals produced in the country, like The Young Pope and Gomorrah.
Sky Atlantic launched on 1 February 2011 on Sky in the United Kingdom and Ireland
Separated channels with the same name operate in Germany, Austria and Italy.
Sky Atlantic is available in both standard definition and high definition, the latter on Sky Atlantic HD
Stuart Murphy extended his responsibilities to become director of programmes for Sky One, Sky Two, Pick and Sky Atlantic
On 5 May 2011, Elaine Pyke, the head of drama at Sky, was promoted to director of Sky Atlantic, reporting to Murphy.
Programmes on the channel are also offered to Sky customers via on-demand channels including the On Demand and Sky Go services and Now TV
Both BT TV and Virgin Media had held talks with Sky over the new channel but have been unable to agree a carriage deal, in Virgin's case due to pricing.
It was announced on 25 October 2010 that Sky Atlantic would launch on Sky channel 108, which was previously occupied by Sky 3
Sky Atlantic also utilises the HD swap bouquet system developed by Sky, which switches SD channels with HD channels for HD Pack subscribers, meaning Sky Atlantic HD is on channel 108 and the standard definition version appears on channel 808.
A one-hour timeshift of Sky Atlantic started broadcasting on 20 September 2012 on channel 173
It moved to channel 170 on 9 June 2015 as part of a reshuffle which also included the closure of Sky 3D, Sky Livingit becoming Real Lives and Sky Arts 1 and Sky Arts 2 merging to become simply Sky Arts
It moved to channel 217 on 18 July 2017 as part of the Sky Sports reshuffle which included Sky Sports Mix moving to entertainment, and again to 208 on 1 May 2018 as part of Sky's major EPG reshuffle due to Sky Atlantic being channel 108.
Sky Atlantic VIP was a rewards channel for subscribers of Sky TV who had been with Sky for 2 or more years and for subscribers who had the Sky Original Bundle (later Sky Entertainment pack, then Sky Signature pack)
The HD version also required the HD pack in the UK and the Sky Box Sets pack in Ireland.
The channel only broadcast brand new episodes of a popular show a week or so before being shown on the main Sky Atlantic channel
An example of this is when episodes of Riviera were shown first on Sky Atlantic VIP, then a week or so later on Sky Atlantic
Sky Atlantic VIP was under Sky VIP's "See-It-First" offer
Sky VIP is a rewards programme for long-term Sky subscribers.
When the channel was not broadcasting a brand new episode of a programme, the channel was off-air resulting in the channel being on-air only for a few hours per week
The channel only broadcast adverts for programmes on Sky channels
The SD version was on Sky channel 994 with the HD version on channel 995
The channel closed on 12 June 2019.
Sky Atlantic relies heavily on screenings of US television programmes, with 50% of all programming coming from HBO
Although the channel mainly screens dramas, blocks in the channel's schedule are dedicated to comedies and movies
The launch of Sky Atlantic followed the broadcaster's Â£150m, five-year deal to buy exclusive UK and Irish TV rights to HBO's entire archive, new HBO programming and a first-look deal on all co-productions.
In January 2016, Sky expanded the portfolio shown on Atlantic, after purchasing exclusive rights to Showtime programming; however, Sky does not have rights to all Showtime programmes, as some of the shows are aired on Channel 4.This ended at the end of 2021.
