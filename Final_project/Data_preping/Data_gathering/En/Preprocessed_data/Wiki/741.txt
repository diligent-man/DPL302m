competition law is the field of law that promotes or seeks to maintain market competition by regulating anti competitive conduct by companies
competition law is implemented through public and private enforcement
competition law is known as antitrust law in the united states
it is also known as anti monopoly law in china and russia and in previous years was known as trade practices law in the united kingdom and australia
in the european union it is referred to as both antitrust and competition law
the history of competition law reaches back to the roman empire
the business practices of market traders guilds and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions
since the th century competition law has become global
the two largest and most influential systems of competition regulation are united states antitrust law and european union competition law
national and regional competition authorities across the world have formed international support and enforcement networks
modern competition law has historically evolved on a national level to promote and maintain fair competition in markets principally within the territorial boundaries of nation states
national competition law usually does not cover activity beyond territorial borders unless it has significant effects at nation state level
countries may allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction in competition cases based on so called effects doctrine
the protection of international competition is governed by international competition agreements
in during the negotiations preceding the adoption of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in limited international competition obligations were proposed within the charter for an international trade organisation
these obligations were not included in gatt but in with the conclusion of the uruguay round of gatt multilateral negotiations the world trade organization wto was created
the agreement establishing the wto included a range of limited provisions on various cross border competition issues on a sector specific basis
competition law or antitrust law has three main elements
prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business
this includes in particular the repression of free trade caused by cartels
banning abusive behavior by a firm dominating a market or anti competitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position
practices controlled in this way may include predatory pricing tying price gouging and refusal to deal
supervising the mergers and acquisitions of large corporations including some joint ventures
transactions that are considered to threaten the competitive process can be prohibited altogether or approved subject to remedies such as an obligation to divest part of the merged business or to offer licenses or access to facilities to enable other businesses to continue competing substance and practice of competition law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction
protecting the interests of consumers consumer welfare and ensuring that entrepreneurs have an opportunity to compete in the market economy are often treated as important objectives
competition law is closely connected with law on deregulation of access to markets state aids and subsidies the privatization of state owned assets and the establishment of independent sector regulators among other market oriented supply side policies
in recent decades competition law has been viewed as a way to provide better public services
robert bork argued that competition laws can produce adverse effects when they reduce competition by protecting inefficient competitors and when costs of legal intervention are greater than benefits for the consumers
an early example was enacted during the roman republic around bc
to protect the grain trade heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly deliberately and insidiously stopping supply ships
under diocletian in a d an edict imposed the death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system for example by buying up concealing or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods
more legislation came under the constitution of zeno of a d which can be traced into florentine municipal laws of and
this provided for confiscation of property and banishment for any trade combination or joint action of monopolies private or granted by the emperor
zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights
justinian i subsequently introduced legislation to pay officials to manage state monopolies
legislation in england to control monopolies and restrictive practices was in force well before the norman conquest
the domesday book recorded that foresteel i e
forestalling the practice of buying up goods before they reach market and then inflating the prices was one of three forfeitures that king edward the confessor could carry out through england
but concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market
under henry iii an act was passed in to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with grain prices laid down by the assizes
penalties for breach included amercements pillory and tumbrel
a th century statute labelled forestallers as oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country
under king edward iii the statute of labourers of fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices
on top of existing penalties the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum he received an idea that has been replicated in punitive treble damages under us antitrust law
also under edward iii the following statutory provision outlawed trade combination
we have ordained and established that no merchant or other shall make confederacy conspiracy coin imagination or murmur or evil device in any point that may turn to the impeachment disturbance defeating or decay of the said staples or of anything that to them pertaineth or may pertain in continental europe competition principles developed in lex mercatoria
examples of legislation enshrining competition principles include the constitutiones juris metallici by wenceslaus ii of bohemia between and condemning combination of ore traders increasing prices the municipal statutes of florence in and followed zeno s legislation against state monopolies and under emperor charles v in the holy roman empire a law was passed to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the netherlands
in henry viii of england reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs designed to stabilize prices in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas
so the legislation read here that whereas
it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things
it is necessary because prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the greedy covetousness and appetites of the owners of such victuals by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause to the great damage and impoverishing of the king s subjects around this time organizations representing various tradesmen and handicrafts people known as guilds had been developing and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies
the privileges conferred were not abolished until the municipal corporations act
the english common law of restraint of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law later developed in the us
it is based on the prohibition of agreements that ran counter to public policy unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown
it effectively prohibited agreements designed to restrain another s trade
the dyer s is the first known restrictive trade agreement to be examined under english common law
a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return
on hearing the plaintiff s attempt to enforce this restraint hull j exclaimed per dieu if the plaintiff were here he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the king
the court denied the collection of a bond for the dyer s breach of agreement because the agreement was held to be a restriction on trade
english courts subsequently decided a range of cases which gradually developed competition related case law which eventually were transformed into statute law
europe around the th century was changing quickly
the new world had just been opened up overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting
in a system of industrial monopoly licenses similar to modern patents had been introduced into england
but by the reign of queen elizabeth i the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture
in response english courts developed case law on restrictive business practices
the statute followed the unanimous decision in darcy v
allein also known as the case of monopolies of the king s bench to declare void the sole right that queen elizabeth i had granted to darcy to import playing cards into england
darcy an officer of the queen s household claimed damages for the defendant s infringement of this right
the court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were price increases quality decrease the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary
this put an end to granted monopolies until king james i began to grant them again
in parliament passed the statute of monopolies which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions as well as guilds
from king charles i through the civil war and to king charles ii monopolies continued especially useful for raising revenue
then in in east india company v
sandys it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas
the development of early competition law in england and europe progressed with the diffusion of writings such as the wealth of nations by adam smith who first established the concept of the market economy
at the same time industrialisation replaced the individual artisan or group of artisans with paid labourers and machine based production
commercial success increasingly dependent on maximizing production while minimizing cost
therefore the size of a company became increasingly important and a number of european countries responded by enacting laws to regulate large companies that restricted trade
following the french revolution in the law of june declared agreements by members of the same trade that fixed the price of an industry or labour as void unconstitutional and hostile to liberty
similarly the austrian penal code of established that agreements
to raise the price of a commodity
to the disadvantage of the public should be punished as misdemeanours
austria passed a law in abolishing the penalties though such agreements remained void
however in germany laws clearly validated agreements between firms to raise prices
throughout the th and th centuries ideas that dominant private companies or legal monopolies could excessively restrict trade were further developed in europe
however as in the late th century a depression spread through europe known as the panic of ideas of competition lost favour and it was felt that companies had to co operate by forming cartels to withstand huge pressures on prices and profits
while the development of competition law stalled in europe during the late th century in canada enacted what is considered the first competition statute of modern times
the act for the prevention and suppression of combinations formed in restraint of trade was passed one year before the united states enacted the most famous legal statute on competition law the sherman act of
it was named after senator john sherman who argued that the act does not announce a new principle of law but applies old and well recognised principles of common law
the sherman act of attempted to outlaw the restriction of competition by large companies who co operated with rivals to fix outputs prices and market shares initially through pools and later through trusts
trusts first appeared in the us railroads where the capital requirement of railroad construction precluded competitive services in then scarcely settled territories
this trust allowed railroads to discriminate on rates imposed and services provided to consumers and businesses and to destroy potential competitors
different trusts could be dominant in different industries
the standard oil company trust in the s controlled several markets including the market in fuel oil lead and whiskey
vast numbers of citizens became sufficiently aware and publicly concerned about how the trusts negatively impacted them that the act became a priority for both major parties
a primary concern of this act is that competitive markets themselves should provide the primary regulation of prices outputs interests and profits
instead the act outlawed anticompetitive practices codifying the common law restraint of trade doctrine
prof rudolph peritz has argued that competition law in the united states has evolved around two sometimes conflicting concepts of competition first that of individual liberty free of government intervention and second a fair competitive environment free of excessive economic power
since the enactment of the sherman act enforcement of competition law has been based on various economic theories adopted by government
section of the sherman act declared illegal every contract in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations section prohibits monopolies or attempts and conspiracies to monopolize
following the enactment in us court applies these principles to business and markets
courts applied the act without consistent economic analysis until when it was complemented by the clayton act which specifically prohibited exclusive dealing agreements particularly tying agreements and interlocking directorates and mergers achieved by purchasing stock
from onwards the rule of reason analysis was frequently applied by courts to competition cases
however the period was characterized by the lack of competition law enforcement
from to courts application of antitrust law was dominated by the structure conduct performance paradigm of the harvard school
from to the enforcement of antitrust law was based on efficiency explanations as the chicago school became dominant and through legal writings such as judge robert bork s book the antitrust paradox
since game theory has frequently been used in antitrust cases
with the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of mergers and acquisitions came into additional scrutiny from u s
regulators
under the act parties must make a pre merger notification to the u s
department of justice and federal trade commission prior to the completion of a transaction
as of february nd the ftc reduced the hart scott rodino reporting threshold to million in combined assets for the transaction
competition law gained new recognition in europe in the inter war years with germany enacting its first anti cartel law in and sweden and norway adopting similar laws in and respectively
however with the great depression of competition law disappeared from europe and was revived following the second world war when the united kingdom and germany following pressure from the united states became the first european countries to adopt fully fledged competition laws
at a regional level eu competition law has its origins in the european coal and steel community ecsc agreement between france italy belgium the netherlands luxembourg and germany in following the second world war
the agreement aimed to prevent germany from re establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as it was felt that this dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war
article of the agreement banned cartels and article made provisions for concentrations or mergers and the abuse of a dominant position by companies
this was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans european model of competition law
in competition rules were included in the treaty of rome also known as the ec treaty which established the european economic community eec
the treaty of rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the eec through the institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted
the two central provisions on eu competition law on companies were established in article which prohibited anti competitive agreements subject to some exemptions and article prohibiting the abuse of dominant position
the treaty also established principles on competition law for member states with article covering public undertakings and article making provisions on state aid
regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time
today the treaty of lisbon prohibits anti competitive agreements in article including price fixing
according to article any such agreements are automatically void
article establishes exemptions if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation gives consumers a fair share of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere or compliant with the general principle of european union law of proportionality
article prohibits the abuse of dominant position such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing
regulation ec governs mergers between firms
the general test is whether a concentration i e
merger or acquisition with a community dimension i e
affects a number of eu member states might significantly impede effective competition
articles and provide that member state s right to deliver public services may not be obstructed but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies
article lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidize private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster
leading ecj cases on competition law include consten grundig v commission and united brands v commission
india responded positively by opening up its economy by removing controls during the economic liberalisation
in quest of increasing the efficiency of the nation s economy the government of india acknowledged the liberalization privatization globalization era
as a result indian market faces competition from within and outside the country
this led to the need of a strong legislation to dispense justice in commercial matters and the competition act was passed
the history of competition law in india dates back to the s when the first competition law namely the monopolies and restrictive trade practices act mrtp was enacted in
but after the economic reforms in this legislation was found to be obsolete in many aspects and as a result a new competition law in the form of the competition act was enacted in
the competition commission of india is the quasi judicial body established for enforcing provisions of the competition act
by countries had enacted competition laws which is more than percent of countries with a population exceeding people
of the countries had adopted their competition laws in the past years signaling the spread of competition law following the collapse of the soviet union and the expansion of the european union
currently competition authorities of many states closely co operate on everyday basis with foreign counterparts in their enforcement efforts also in such key area as information evidence sharing
in many of asia s developing countries including india competition law is considered a tool to stimulate economic growth
in korea and japan the competition law prevents certain forms of conglomerates
in addition competition law has promoted fairness in china and indonesia as well as international integration in vietnam
hong kong s competition ordinance came into force in the year
as part of the creation of the asean economic community the member states of the association of south east asian nations asean pledged to enact competition laws and policies by the end of
today all ten member states have general competition legislation in place
while there remains differences between regimes for example over merger control notification rules or leniency policies for whistle blowers and it is unlikely that there will be a supranational competition authority for asean akin to the european union there is a clear trend towards increase in infringement investigations or decisions on cartel enforcement
at a national level competition law is enforced through competition authorities as well as private enforcement
the united states supreme court explained
every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free enterprise system envisaged by congress
this system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor and strong competition depends in turn on compliance with antitrust legislation
in enacting these laws congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators
it could have for example required violators to compensate federal state and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations
but this remedy was not selected
instead congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation in the european union the modernisation regulation means that the european commission is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of european union competition law
this was done to facilitate quicker resolution of competition related inquiries
in the commission issued a green paper on damages actions for the breach of the ec antitrust rules which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier
some eu member states enforce their competition laws with criminal sanctions
as analysed by professor whelan these types of sanctions engender a number of significant theoretical legal and practical challenges
antitrust administration and legislation can be seen as a balance between
guidelines which are clear and specific to the courts regulators and business but leave little room for discretion that prevents the application of laws from resulting in unintended consequences
guidelines which are broad hence allowing administrators to sway between improving economic outcomes versus succumbing to political policies to redistribute wealth chapter of the post war havana charter contained an antitrust code but this was never incorporated into the wto s forerunner the general agreement on tariffs and trade
office of fair trading director and professor richard whish wrote sceptically that it seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the wto will metamorphose into a global competition authority
despite that at the ongoing doha round of trade talks for the world trade organization discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level
while it is incapable of enforcement itself the newly established international competition network icn is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities
under the doctrine of laissez faire antitrust is seen as unnecessary as competition is viewed as a long term dynamic process where firms compete against each other for market dominance
in some markets a firm may successfully dominate but it is because of superior skill or innovativeness
however according to laissez faire theorists when it tries to raise prices to take advantage of its monopoly position it creates profitable opportunities for others to compete
a process of creative destruction begins which erodes the monopoly
therefore government should not try to break up monopoly but should allow the market to work
the classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the individual liberty of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods
restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances
hence the courts found specific categories of agreement specific clauses to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power
earlier theorists like adam smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis
a monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures
the monopolists by keeping the market constantly under stocked by never fully supplying the effectual demand sell their commodities much above the natural price and raise their emoluments whether they consist in wages or profit greatly above their natural rate in the wealth of nations adam smith also pointed out the cartel problem but did not advocate specific legal measures to combat them
people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices
it is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings by any law which either could be executed or would be consistent with liberty and justice
but though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies much less to render them necessary by the latter half of the th century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy
john stuart mill s approach was laid down in his treatise on liberty
again trade is a social act
whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public does what affects the interest of other persons and of society in general and thus his conduct in principle comes within the jurisdiction of society
both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere
this is the so called doctrine of free trade which rests on grounds different from though equally solid with the principle of individual liberty asserted in this essay
restrictions on trade or on production for purposes of trade are indeed restraints and all restraint qua restraint is an evil after mill there was a shift in economic theory which emphasized a more precise and theoretical model of competition
a simple neo classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes social welfare
this model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms or to use legal language there are no barriers to entry
by this term economists mean something very specific that competitive free markets deliver allocative productive and dynamic efficiency
allocative efficiency is also known as pareto efficiency after the italian economist vilfredo pareto and means that resources in an economy over the long run will go precisely to those who are willing and able to pay for them
because rational producers will keep producing and selling and buyers will keep buying up to the last marginal unit of possible output or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced there is no waste the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and utility is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off society has achieved allocative efficiency
productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can
free markets are meant to reward those who work hard and therefore those who will put society s resources towards the frontier of its possible production
dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research create and innovate to keep its share of consumers
this traces to austrian american political scientist joseph schumpeter s notion that a perennial gale of creative destruction is ever sweeping through capitalist economies driving enterprise at the market s mercy
this led schumpeter to argue that monopolies did not need to be broken up as with standard oil because the next gale of economic innovation would do the same
contrasting with the allocatively productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies oligopolies and cartels
when only one or a few firms exist in the market and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms prices rise above the competitive level to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price
production is also decreased further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss
sources of this market power are said to include the existence of externalities barriers to entry of the market and the free rider problem
markets may fail to be efficient for a variety of reasons so the exception of competition law s intervention to the rule of laissez faire is justified if government failure can be avoided
orthodox economists fully acknowledge that perfect competition is seldom observed in the real world and so aim for what is called workable competition
this follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal then go for the second best option by using the law to tame market operation where it can
a group of economists and lawyers who are largely associated with the university of chicago advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition
the u s
supreme court has used the chicago school approach in several recent cases
one view of the chicago school approach to antitrust is found in united states circuit court of appeals judge richard posner s books antitrust law and economic analysis of law
robert bork was highly critical of court decisions on united states antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book the antitrust paradox
bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was the pursuit only of consumer welfare the protection of competition rather than competitors
furthermore only a few acts should be prohibited namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets mergers that create monopolies and dominant firms pricing predatorily while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers
running through the different critiques of us antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good
the only cure for bad theory writes bork is better theory harvard law school professor philip areeda who favours more aggressive antitrust policy in at least one supreme court case challenged robert bork s preference for non intervention
when firms hold large market shares consumers risk paying higher prices and getting lower quality products than compared to competitive markets
however the existence of a very high market share does not always mean consumers are paying excessive prices since the threat of new entrants to the market can restrain a high market share firm s price increases
competition law does not make merely having a monopoly illegal but rather abusing the power that a monopoly may confer for instance through exclusionary practices
first it is necessary to determine whether a firm is dominant or whether it behaves to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors customers and ultimately of its consumer
under eu law very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant which may be rebuttable
if a firm has a dominant position then there is a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market
similarly as with collusive conduct market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold
then although the lists are seldom closed certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited under the country s legislation
for instance limiting production at a shipping port by refusing to raise expenditure and update technology could be abusive
tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets
this was the alleged case in microsoft v
commission leading to an eventual fine of million for including its windows media player with the microsoft windows platform
a refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse
one example was in a case involving a medical company named commercial solvents
when it set up its own rival in the tuberculosis drugs market commercial solvents were forced to continue supplying a company named zoja with the raw materials for the drug
zoja was the only market competitor so without the court forcing supply all competition would have been eliminated
forms of abuse relating directly to pricing include price exploitation
it is difficult to prove at what point a dominant firm s prices become exploitative and this category of abuse is rarely found
in one case however a french funeral service was found to have demanded exploitative prices and this was justified on the basis that prices of funeral services outside the region could be compared
a more tricky issue is predatory pricing
this is the practice of dropping prices of a product so much that one s smaller competitors cannot cover their costs and fall out of business
the chicago school considers predatory pricing to be unlikely
however in france telecom sa v
commission a broadband internet company was forced to pay million for dropping its prices below its own production costs
it had no interest in applying such prices except that of eliminating competitors and was being cross subsidized to capture the lion s share of a booming market
one last category of pricing abuse is price discrimination
an example of this could be a company offering rebates to industrial customers who export their sugar but not to customers who are selling their goods in the same market
according to the world bank s republic of armenia accumulation competition and connectivity global competition report which was published in the global competitiveness index suggests that armenia ranks lowest among eca europe and central asia countries in the effectiveness of anti monopoly policy and the intensity of competition
this low ranking somehow explains the low employment and low incomes in armenia
a merger or acquisition involves from a competition law perspective the concentration of economic power in the hands of fewer than before
this usually means that one firm buys out the shares of another
the reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises ex ante prevention of market dominance
in the united states merger regulation began under the clayton act and in the european union under the merger regulation known as the ecmr
competition law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorization from the relevant government authority
the theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts
concentrations can increase economies of scale and scope
however often firms take advantage of their increase in market power their increased market share and decreased number of competitors which can adversely affect the deal that consumers get
merger control is about predicting what the market might be like not knowing and making a judgment
hence the central provision under eu law asks whether a concentration would if it went ahead significantly impede effective competition
in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening off a dominant position and the corresponding provision under us antitrust states similarly
no person shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital
of the assets of one or more persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce where
the effect of such acquisition of such stocks or assets or of the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies or otherwise may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly what amounts to a substantial lessening of or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study
the market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions not conclusions
the herfindahl hirschman index is used to calculate the density of the market or what concentration exists
aside from the maths it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market
a further problem of collective dominance or oligopoly through economic links can arise whereby the new market becomes more conducive to collusion
it is relevant how transparent a market is because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can coordinate their behavior more easily whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers
the entry of new firms to the market and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered
if firms are shown to be creating an uncompetitive concentration in the us they can still argue that they create efficiencies enough to outweigh any detriment and similar reference to technical and economic progress is mentioned in art
of the ecmr
another defense might be that a firm which is being taken over is about to fail or go insolvent and taking it over leaves a no less competitive state than what would happen anyway
mergers vertically in the market are rarely of concern although in aol time warner the european commission required that a joint venture with a competitor bertelsmann be ceased beforehand
the eu authorities have also focused lately on the effect of conglomerate mergers where companies acquire a large portfolio of related products though without necessarily dominant shares in any individual market
competition law has become increasingly intertwined with intellectual property such as copyright trademarks patents industrial design rights and in some jurisdictions trade secrets
it is believed that promotion of innovation through enforcement of intellectual property rights may promote as well as limit competitiveness
the question rests on whether it is legal to acquire monopoly through accumulation of intellectual property rights
in which case the judgment needs to decide between giving preference to intellectual property rights or to competitiveness
should antitrust laws accord special treatment to intellectual property
should intellectual rights be revoked or not granted when antitrust laws are violated concerns also arise over anti competitive effects and consequences due to
intellectual properties that are collaboratively designed with consequence of violating antitrust laws intentionally or otherwise
the further effects on competition when such properties are accepted into industry standards
cross licensing of intellectual property
bundling of intellectual property rights to long term business transactions or agreements to extend the market exclusiveness of intellectual property rights beyond their statutory duration
trade secrets if they remain a secret having an eternal length of life some scholars suggest that a prize instead of patent would solve the problem of deadweight loss when innovators got their reward from the prize provided by the government or non profit organization rather than directly selling to the market see millennium prize problems
however innovators may accept the prize only when it is at least as much as how much they earn from patent which is a question difficult to determine
