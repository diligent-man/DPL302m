doctrine laissez-faire antitrust seen unnecessary competition viewed long-term dynamic process firm compete market dominance
market firm may successfully dominate superior skill innovativeness
however according laissez-faire theorist try raise price take advantage monopoly position creates profitable opportunity others compete
therefore government try break monopoly allow market work
classical perspective competition wa certain agreement business practice could unreasonable restraint individual liberty tradespeople carry livelihoods
restraint judged permissible court new case appeared light changing business circumstances
hence court found specific category agreement specific clause fall foul doctrine economic fairness contrive overarching conception market power
earlier theorist like adam smith rejected monopoly power basis
monopoly granted either individual trading company ha effect secret trade manufactures
monopolist keeping market constantly under-stocked never fully supplying effectual demand sell commodity much natural price raise emolument whether consist wage profit greatly natural ratein wealth nation adam smith also pointed cartel problem advocate specific legal measure combat them
people trade seldom meet together even merriment diversion conversation end conspiracy public contrivance raise prices
impossible indeed prevent meeting law either could executed would consistent liberty justice
though law cannot hinder people trade sometimes assembling together ought nothing facilitate assembly much le render necessaryby latter half century become clear large firm become fact market economy
john stuart mill's approach wa laid treatise liberty
whoever undertakes sell description good public doe affect interest person society general thus conduct principle come within jurisdiction society
cheapness good quality commodity effectually provided leaving producer seller perfectly free sole check equal freedom buyer supplying elsewhere
so-called doctrine free trade rest ground different though equally solid principle individual liberty asserted essay
restriction trade production purpose trade indeed restraint restraint qua restraint evilafter mill wa shift economic theory emphasized precise theoretical model competition
simple neo-classical model free market hold production distribution good service competitive free market maximizes social welfare
model assumes new firm freely enter market compete existing firm use legal language barrier entry
term economist mean something specific competitive free market deliver allocative productive dynamic efficiency
allocative efficiency also known pareto efficiency italian economist vilfredo pareto mean resource economy long run go precisely willing able pay them
rational producer keep producing selling buyer keep buying last marginal unit possible output alternatively rational producer reduce output margin buyer buy amount produced waste greatest number want greatest number people become satisfied utility perfected resource longer reallocated make anyone better
productive efficiency simply mean society making much can
free market meant reward work hard therefore put society's resource towards frontier possible production
dynamic efficiency refers idea business constantly competes must research create innovate keep share consumers
trace austrian-american political scientist joseph schumpeter's notion perennial gale creative destruction ever sweeping capitalist economy driving enterprise market's mercy
led schumpeter argue monopoly need broken standard oil next gale economic innovation would same
contrasting allocatively productively dynamically efficient market model monopoly oligopoly cartels
one firm exist market credible threat entry competing firm price rise competitive level either monopolistic oligopolistic equilibrium price
production also decreased decreasing social welfare creating deadweight loss
source market power said include existence externality barrier entry market free rider problem
market may fail efficient variety reason exception competition law's intervention rule laissez faire justified government failure avoided
orthodox economist fully acknowledge perfect competition seldom observed real world aim called workable competition
follows theory one cannot achieve ideal go second best option using law tame market operation can
group economist lawyer largely associated university chicago advocate approach competition law guided proposition action originally considered anticompetitive could actually promote competition
supreme court ha used chicago school approach several recent cases
one view chicago school approach antitrust found united state circuit court appeal judge richard posner's book antitrust law economic analysis law
robert bork wa highly critical court decision united state antitrust law series law review article book antitrust paradox
bork argued original intention antitrust law economic efficiency wa pursuit consumer welfare protection competition rather competitors
furthermore act prohibited namely cartel fix price divide market merger create monopoly dominant firm pricing predatorily allowing practice vertical agreement price discrimination ground harm consumers
running different critique u antitrust policy common theme government interference operation free market doe harm good
cure bad theory writes bork better theory harvard law school professor philip areeda favour aggressive antitrust policy least one supreme court case challenged robert bork's preference non-intervention
firm hold large market share consumer risk paying higher price getting lower quality product compared competitive markets
however existence high market share doe always mean consumer paying excessive price since threat new entrant market restrain high-market-share firm's price increases
competition law doe make merely monopoly illegal rather abusing power monopoly may confer instance exclusionary practices
first necessary determine whether firm dominant whether behaves appreciable extent independently competitor customer ultimately consumer
eu law large market share raise presumption firm dominant may rebuttable
firm ha dominant position special responsibility allow conduct impair competition common market
similarly collusive conduct market share determined reference particular market firm product question sold
although list seldom closed certain category abusive conduct usually prohibited country's legislation
instance limiting production shipping port refusing raise expenditure update technology could abusive
tying one product sale another considered abuse restrictive consumer choice depriving competitor outlets
commission leading eventual fine million including window medium player microsoft window platform
refusal supply facility essential business attempting compete use constitute abuse
one example wa case involving medical company named commercial solvents
set rival tuberculosis drug market commercial solvent forced continue supplying company named zoja raw material drug
zoja wa market competitor without court forcing supply competition would eliminated
form abuse relating directly pricing include price exploitation
difficult prove point dominant firm's price become exploitative category abuse rarely found
one case however french funeral service wa found demanded exploitative price wa justified basis price funeral service outside region could compared
practice dropping price product much one's smaller competitor cannot cover cost fall business
commission broadband internet company wa forced pay million dropping price production costs
interest applying price except eliminating competitor wa cross-subsidized capture lion's share booming market
example could company offering rebate industrial customer export sugar customer selling good market
according world bank's republic armenia accumulation competition connectivity global competition report wa published global competitiveness index suggests armenia rank lowest among eca europe central asia country effectiveness anti-monopoly policy intensity competition
low ranking somehow explains low employment low income armenia
merger acquisition involves competition law perspective concentration economic power hand fewer before
reason oversight economic concentration state reason restrict firm abuse position dominance regulation merger acquisition attempt deal problem arises ex ante prevention market dominance
united state merger regulation began clayton act european union merger regulation known ecmr
competition law requires firm proposing merge gain authorization relevant government authority
theory behind merger transaction cost reduced compared operating open market bilateral contracts
however often firm take advantage increase market power increased market share decreased number competitor adversely affect deal consumer get
merger control predicting market might like knowing making judgment
hence central provision eu law asks whether concentration would went ahead significantly impede effective competition
particular result creation strengthening dominant position corresponding provision u antitrust state similarly
person shall acquire directly indirectly whole part stock share capital
asset one person engaged commerce activity affecting commerce where
effect acquisition stock asset use stock voting granting proxy otherwise may substantially lessen competition tend create monopolywhat amount substantial lessening significant impediment competition usually answered empirical study
market share merging company assessed added although kind analysis give rise presumption conclusions
herfindahl-hirschman index used calculate density market concentration exists
aside math important consider product question rate technical innovation market
problem collective dominance oligopoly economic link arise whereby new market becomes conducive collusion
relevant transparent market concentrated structure could mean firm coordinate behavior easily whether firm deploy deterrent whether firm safe reaction competitor consumers
entry new firm market barrier might encounter considered
firm shown creating uncompetitive concentration u still argue create efficiency enough outweigh detriment similar reference technical economic progress mentioned art
another defense might firm taken fail go insolvent taking leaf le competitive state would happen anyway
merger vertically market rarely concern although aoltime warner european commission required joint venture competitor bertelsmann ceased beforehand
eu authority also focused lately effect conglomerate merger company acquire large portfolio related product though without necessarily dominant share individual market
competition law ha become increasingly intertwined intellectual property copyright trademark patent industrial design right jurisdiction trade secrets
believed promotion innovation enforcement intellectual property right may promote well limit competitiveness
question rest whether legal acquire monopoly accumulation intellectual property rights
case judgment need decide giving preference intellectual property right competitiveness
intellectual right revoked granted antitrust law violatedconcerns also arise anti-competitive effect consequence due to
intellectual property collaboratively designed consequence violating antitrust law intentionally otherwise
bundling intellectual property right long-term business transaction agreement extend market exclusiveness intellectual property right beyond statutory duration
trade secret remain secret eternal length lifesome scholar suggest prize instead patent would solve problem deadweight loss innovator got reward prize provided government non-profit organization rather directly selling market see millennium prize problems
however innovator may accept prize least much much earn patent question difficult determine
