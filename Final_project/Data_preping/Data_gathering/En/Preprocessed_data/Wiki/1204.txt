The Lockheed P Orion is a four engined turboprop anti submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft developed for the United States Navy and introduced in the s Lockheed based it on the L Electra commercial airliner The aircraft is easily distinguished from the Electra by its distinctive tail stinger or MAD boom used for the magnetic anomaly detection MAD of submarines
Over the years the aircraft has seen numerous design developments most notably in its electronics packages Numerous navies and air forces around the world continue to use the P Orion primarily for maritime patrol reconnaissance anti surface warfare and anti submarine warfare
A total of P s have been built In it joined the handful of military aircraft including the Boeing B Stratofortress Boeing KC Stratotanker Lockheed C Hercules and the Lockheed U that the United States military has been using for more than years The Boeing P Poseidon will eventually replace the US Navy's remaining P C aircraft
In August the US Navy called for proposals for replacement of the piston engined Lockheed PV Neptune later redesignated P and Martin PM Marlin later redesignated P with a more advanced aircraft to conduct maritime patrol and antisubmarine warfare Modifying an existing aircraft should save on cost and to allow rapid introduction into the fleet Lockheed suggested a military version of its L Electra then still in development and yet to fly In April Lockheed won the competition and was awarded an initial research and development contract in May
Lockheed modified the prototype YPV YP A Bureau Number BuNo from the third Electra airframe cn The first flight of the aircraft's aerodynamic prototype originally designated YPV took place on August While based on the same design philosophy as the Electra the aircraft differed structurally it had feet m less fuselage forward of the wings with an opening bomb bay and a more pointed nose radome a distinctive tail stinger for detection of submarines by MAD wing hardpoints and other internal external and airframe production technique enhancements
The Orion has four Allison T turboprops which give it a top speed of knots kmh mph comparable to the fastest propeller fighters or even to slow high bypass turbofan jets such as the Fairchild Republic A Thunderbolt II or the Lockheed S Viking Similar patrol aircraft include the Soviet Ilyushin Il the French Breguet Atlantique and the British jet powered Hawker Siddeley Nimrod based on the de Havilland Comet
The first production version designated PV was launched on April Initial squadron deliveries to Patrol Squadron Eight VP and Patrol Squadron Forty Four VP at Naval Air Station Patuxent River Maryland began in August On September the US military transitioned to a unified designation system for all services with the aircraft being renamed the P Orion Paint schemes have changed from early s gloss seaplane gray and white to mid sssearly s gloss white and gray to mid s flat finish low visibility gray with fewer and smaller markings In the early s the paint scheme changed to its current overall gloss gray finish with the original full sized color markings However large sized BuNos on the vertical stabilizer and squadron designations on the fuselage remained largely omitted
In the US Navy's Bureau of Naval Weapons contracted Univac Defense Systems Division of Sperry Rand to engineer build and test a digital computer a device then in its infancy to interface with the many sensors and newly developing display units of the P Orion Project A NEW was the engineering system which after several early trials produced the engineering prototype the CP U Univac Serial A A NEW MOD Computing System Univac delivered the CP U to the Naval Air Development Center at Johnsville Pennsylvania in this directly led to the production computers later equipped on the P C Orion
Three civilian Electras were lost in fatal accidents between February and March Following the third crash the FAA restricted the maximum speed of Electras pending determination of the causes After an extensive investigation two of the crashes those of September and March were identified as due to insufficiently strong engine mounts unable to damp a whirling motion that could affect the outboard engines When the oscillation was transmitted to the wings a severe vertical vibration escalated tearing the wings from the aircraft
The company implemented an expensive modification program labelled the Lockheed Electra Achievement Program which strengthened the engine mounts and the wing structures supporting the mounts and replaced some wing skins with thicker material Lockheed at its own expense modified all the surviving Electras of the built at that time at the factory with the modifications taking days for each aircraft The changes were incorporated into subsequent aircraft as they were built
Sales of Electra airliners were limited as Lockheed's technical fix did not serve to completely erase the aircraft's jinxed reputation in an era in which turboprop powered aircraft were being replaced by faster jets In military roles that value fuel efficiency more than speed the Orion remained in service for over years after its introduction Although surpassed in production longevity by the Lockheed C Hercules P s were produced through Lockheed Martin opened a new P wing production line in as part of its Service Life Extension Program ASLEP for delivery in A complete ASLEP replaces the outer wings center wing lower section and horizontal stabilizers with newly built parts
In the s the US Navy attempted to procure a successor aircraft to the P and selected the improved P over a naval specific variant of the twin turbofan powered Boeing but this program was subsequently cancelled In a second program to select a replacement the advanced Lockheed Martin Orion another P derived aircraft lost out to the Boeing P Poseidon a Boeing variant which entered service in
The P has an internal bomb bay under the front fuselage which can house conventional Mark torpedoes or Mark torpedoes andor special nuclear weapons Additional underwing stations or pylons can carry other armament configurations including the AGM Harpoon AGM E SLAM AGM HK SLAM ER AGM Maverick millimetres in Zuni rockets and various other sea mines missiles and gravity bombs The aircraft also had the capability to carry the AGM Bullpup guided missile until that weapon was withdrawn from USNATOAllied service
The P is equipped with a MAD in the extended tail This instrument is able to detect the magnetic anomaly of a submarine in the Earth's magnetic field The limited range of this instrument requires the aircraft to be near the submarine at low altitude Because of this it is primarily used for pinpointing the location of a submarine immediately prior to a torpedo or depth bomb attack Due to the sensitivity of the detector electromagnetic noise can interfere with it so the detector is placed in P 's fiberglass tail stinger MAD boom far from other electronics and ferrous metals on the aircraft
The crew complement varies depending on the role being flown the variant being operated and the country that is operating the type In US Navy service the normal crew complement was until it was reduced to its current complement of in the early s when the in flight ordnanceman position was eliminated as a cost savings measure and the ORD duties assumed by the in flight technician Data for US Navy P C only

Once on station one engine is often shut down usually the No engine the left outer engine to conserve fuel and extend the time aloft andor range when at low level It is the primary candidate for loiter shutdown because it has no generator Eliminating the exhaust from engine also improves visibility from the aft observer station on the left side of the aircraft
On occasion both outboard engines can be shut down weight weather and fuel permitting Long deep water coastal or border patrol missions can last over hours and may include extra crew The record time aloft for a P is hours undertaken by the Royal New Zealand Air Force's No Squadron in
Developed during the Cold War the P 's primary mission was to localize Soviet Navy ballistic missile and fast attack submarines detected by undersea surveillance systems and eliminate them in the event of full scale war At its height the US Navy's P community consisted of twenty four active duty Fleet patrol squadrons home based at air stations in the states of Florida and Hawaii as well as bases which formerly had P operations in Maryland Maine and California
There were also thirteen Naval Reserve patrol squadrons identical to their active duty Fleet counterparts said Reserve Fleet squadrons being based in Florida Pennsylvania Maryland Michigan Massachusetts later relocated to Maine Illinois Tennessee Louisiana California and Washington Two Fleet Replacement Squadrons FRS also called RAG squadrons from the historic Replacement Air Group nomenclature were located in California and Florida
The since deactivated VP in California provided P training for the Pacific Fleet while VP in Florida performed the task for the Atlantic Fleet These squadrons were also augmented by a test and evaluation squadron in Maryland two additional test and evaluation units that were part of an air development center in Pennsylvania and a test center in California an oceanographic development squadron in Maryland and two active duty special projects units in Maine and Hawaii the latter being slightly smaller than a typical squadron
In fiscal year the US Navy planned to reduce active duty patrol squadrons from to seven on the East Coast six on the West The patrol squadrons planned to survive were VP and at NAS Brunswick Maine and VP and at NAS Jacksonville Florida The Pacific squadrons that were to be retained were VP and at Barbers' Point Hawaii and and VP at NAS Whidbey Island Washington Thus Patrol Squadrons and were to be disestablished and the remaining units were to operate nine aircraft instead of eight augmented by VP and the nine at the time USNR P squadrons
Reconnaissance missions in international waters led to occasions where Soviet fighters would bump a P either operated by the US Navy or other operators such as the Royal Norwegian Air Force On April a midair collision between a United States Navy EP E ARIES II signals surveillance aircraft and a People's Liberation Army Navy J II jet fighter interceptor resulted in an international dispute between the US and the People's Republic of China PRC
More than combatant and noncombatant P variants have demonstrated the rugged reliability displayed by the platform flying hour plus missions ft m over salt water while maintaining an excellent safety record Versions have been developed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA for research and hurricane huntinghurricane wall busting for the US Customs Service now US Customs and Border Protection for drug interdiction and aerial surveillance mission with a rotodome adapted from the Grumman E Hawkeye or an ANAPG radar adapted from the General Dynamics F Fighting Falcon and for NASA for research and development
The US Navy remains the largest P operator currently distributed between a single fleet replacement ie training patrol squadron in Florida VP active duty patrol squadrons distributed between bases in Florida Washington and Hawaii two Navy Reserve patrol squadrons in Florida and Washington one active duty special projects patrol squadron VPU in Hawaii and two active duty test and evaluation squadrons One additional active duty fleet reconnaissance squadron VQ operates the EP Aries signals intelligence SIGINT variant at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island Washington
In January the US Navy revealed that P s have been used to hunt down third generation narco submarines This is significant because as recently as July fully submersible submarines have been used in smuggling operations As of November the US Navy began phasing out the P in favor of the newer and more advanced Boeing P Poseidon
In May Patrol Squadron completed the transition to the P marking the retirement of the P C from US Navy active duty service The last of the active duty P Cs aircraft was also delivered to the Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola Florida Two Navy Reserve squadrons and Air Test and Evaluation Squadron continue to fly the P C with final phaseout of the aircraft expected in
In October P A aircraft flew several blockade patrols in the vicinity of Cuba Having just recently joined the operational Fleet earlier that year this was the first employment of the P in a real world heightened threat situation
Beginning in forward deployed P aircraft began flying a variety of missions under Operation Market Time from bases in the Philippines and Vietnam The primary focus of these coastal patrols was to stem the supply of materials to the Viet Cong by sea although several of these missions also became overland feet dry sorties During one such mission a small caliber artillery shell passed through a P without rendering it mission incapable The only confirmed combat loss of a P also occurred during Operation Market Time
In April a US Navy P B of VP was downed by anti aircraft fire in the Gulf of Thailand with the loss of the entire crew Two months earlier in February another one of VP 's P B aircraft was operating in the same vicinity when it crashed with the loss of the entire crew Originally attributed to an aircraft mishap at low altitude later conjecture is that this aircraft may have also fallen victim to anti aircraft artillery AAA fire from the same source as the April incident
On August Iraq invaded Kuwait and was poised to strike Saudi Arabia Within hours of the initial invasion US Navy P C aircraft were among the first American forces to arrive in the area One was a modified platform with a prototype system known as Outlaw Hunter Undergoing trials in the Pacific after being developed by Tiburon Systems Inc for NAVAIR's PMA Program Office Outlaw Hunter was testing a specialized over the horizon targeting OTH T system package when it responded
Within hours of the start of the coalition air campaign Outlaw Hunter detected a large number of Iraqi patrol boats and naval vessels attempting to move from Basra and Umm Qasr to Iranian waters Outlaw Hunter vectored in strike elements which attacked the flotilla near Bubiyan Island destroying vessels and damaging scores more During Desert Shield a P using infrared imaging detected a ship with Iraqi markings beneath freshly painted bogus Egyptian markings trying to avoid detection
Several days before the January commencement of Operation Desert Storm a P C equipped with an APS Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar ISAR conducted coastal surveillance along Iraq and Kuwait to provide pre strike reconnaissance on enemy military installations A total of of the Iraqi vessels destroyed during the conflict were targeted by P C aircraft
The P Orion's mission expanded in the late s and early s to include battlespace surveillance both at sea and over land The long range and long loiter time of the P Orion have proved to be an invaluable asset during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom It can instantaneously provide information about the battlespace it can see to ground troops particularly the US Marines
Although the P is a Maritime Patrol Aircraft armament and sensor upgrades in the Anti surface Warfare Improvement Program AIP have made it suitable for sustained combat air support over land In what became known as the Decade in the Desert Navy P C crews patrolled combat zones in the Middle East and Southwest Asia From the start of the war in Afghanistan US Navy P aircraft operated from Kandahar in that role Royal Australian Air Force AP C Orions operated out of Minhad Air Base in the UAE from until their withdrawal in November During the period the AP C Orions conducted overland intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance tasks in support of coalition troops throughout Afghanistan
The United States Geological Survey used the Orion to survey parts of southern and eastern Afghanistan for lithium copper and other mineral deposits
Several US Navy P C Orions and two Canadian CP Auroras a variant of the Orion have participated in maritime surveillance missions over Libyan waters in the framework of enforcement of the no fly zone over Libya
A US Navy P C Orion supporting Operation Odyssey Dawn engaged the Libyan coast guard vessel Vittoria on March after the vessel and eight smaller craft fired on merchant ships in the port of Misrata Libya The Orion fired AGM Maverick missiles on Vittoria which was subsequently beached
Lockheed produced the P F variant of the P Orion for Iran Six examples were delivered to the former Imperial Iranian Air Force IIAF in and
Following the Iranian Revolution in the Orions continued in service after the IIAF was renamed the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force IRIAF They were used in the Tanker War phase of the Iran Iraq War A total of four P Fs remain in service
Three P C Orions delivered to the Pakistan Navy in and were operated extensively during the Kargil conflict After the crash of one the type was grounded due to the loss of an entire crew nonetheless the aircraft were maintained in an armed state and airworthy condition throughout the escalation period of and In they were used by the navy to conduct signals intelligence airborne and bombing operations in a Swat offensive and Operation Rah e Nijat Precision and strategic bombing missions were carried out by the Orions and in intelligence management operations were conducted against Taliban and al Qaeda operatives
On May two out of the four Pakistani P Cs were destroyed in an attack on PNS Mehran a Pakistani Naval station in Karachi The Pakistani fleet had been readily used in overland counter insurgency operations In June the US agreed to replace the destroyed aircraft with two new ones with delivery to follow later In February the US delivered two additional P C Orion aircraft to the Pakistan Navy
The Spanish Air Force deployed P s to assist the international effort against piracy in Somalia On October a Spanish P aircraft patrolling the coast of Somalia reacted to a distress call from an oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden To deter the pirates the aircraft flew over the pirates three times as they attempted to board the tanker dropping a smoke bomb on each pass After the third pass the attacking pirate boats broke off their attack Later on March the same P pursued the assailants of the German navy tanker Spessart A resulting in the capture of the pirates
In April the Portuguese Air Force also contributed to Operation Ocean Shield by sending a P C which had early success when on its fifth mission detected a pirate whaler with two attack skiffs
Since the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force has deployed P s to Djibouti for anti piracy patrols from from its own base As well the German Navy is contributing assets against piracy with one P from time to time
Several P aircraft have been N registered and are operated by civilian agencies The US Customs and Border Protection has a number of P A and P B aircraft that are used for aircraft intercept and maritime patrol NOAA operates two WP D variants specially modified for hurricane research One P NNA is used by National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA as an Earth science research platform primarily for the NASA Science Mission Directorate's Airborne Science Program It is based at Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility Virginia
Aero Union Inc operated eight secondhand P A aircraft configured as air tankers which were leased to the US Forest Service the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and other agencies for firefighting use Several of these aircraft were involved in the US Forest Service airtanker scandal but have not been involved in any catastrophic aircraft mishaps Aero Union has since gone bankrupt and their P s have been put up for auction
Over the years numerous variants of the P have been created A few notable examples are
WP D Two P C aircraft as modified on the production line for NOAA weather research including hurricane hunting
EP E Aries P A and EP B aircraft converted into ELINT aircraft
EP E Aries II P C aircraft converted into ELINT aircraft
