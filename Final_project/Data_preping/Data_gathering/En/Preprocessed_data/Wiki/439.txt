tnt originally an abbreviation for turner network television is an american basic cable television channel owned by the warner bros
discovery networks unit of warner bros
discovery that launched on october
tnt s original purpose was to air classic films and television series to which turner broadcasting maintained spillover rights through its sister station tbs
since june the network has shifted its focus to dramatic television series and feature films along with some sporting events including nba nhl the ncaa division i men s basketball tournament and professional wrestling from aew rampage as tbs shifted its focus to comedic programming
as of september tnt was received by approximately million households that subscribe to a subscription television service throughout the united states
prior to the launch of the channel in the turner network television name had been utilized by the turner broadcasting system for an ad hoc syndication service which produced and distributed various sporting events for carriage on turner s atlanta georgia superstation wtbs channel now wpch tv which was separated from its national cable feed tbs in october as well as broadcast television stations throughout the united states
the turner network television syndication service launched in to produce two exhibition games organized by the nfl players association nflpa during the nfl strike which were broadcast on wtbs and its national superstation feed
the agreement with the nflpa originally called for games to be broadcast by wtbs on sunday afternoons and monday nights during the originally proposed strike season but was reduced to the exhibition games amid lawsuits filed by the national football league against turner broadcasting and the nflpa union the tnt syndication service also produced and distributed the first goodwill games organized by ted turner himself in response to the olympic boycotts involving the united states and the soviet union of the and summer olympics in
on october ted turner announced the launch of turner network television tnt his fifth basic cable network venture following superstation tbs cnn headline news now hln and the short lived cable music channel in a keynote address at the opening day of the atlantic cable show in atlantic city new jersey stating that the channel would center around major television events
turner originally estimated that tnt would be offered to cable systems at a monthly rate of per subscriber at launch increasing to per subscriber per month by march with minutes of advertising being carried each hour three to four minutes of which would be given to prospective cable systems for local advertising
turner broadcasting struggled to obtain carriage commitments from various cable providers to commence with the proposed service s launch plans putting uncertain tnt s fate
turner also entered into preliminary discussions with nbc to purchase a stake in the company with the prospect of using nbc s financial and programming expertise to get tnt off the ground however such discussions terminated by january without a resolution
by february turner had disclosed that tnt s programming would focus around movies from the metro goldwyn mayer mgm film library which turner acquired as a result of his sale of the mgm film studio to kirk kerkorian and major television events including made for cable movies high profile specials sports events documentaries and miniseries
cable systems were given the option of substituting a superstation other than superstation tbs or other out of market television station for tnt upon launch without incurring any copyright liabilities for carriage of the distant signal for the second half of
however the proposed launch date originally slated for july of that year was delayed because it would have presented several issues including obtaining channel clearances and assembling a programming schedule in such a contracted timespan and the unfavorability of promoting a service during the summer when television networks typically programmed reruns
on march turner broadcasting system s board of directors unanimously approved ted turner s plan for turner network television with october as the channel s proposed launch date
plans called for tnt to offer nights of original and live sports programming per year within five years of its debut
the channel launched at p m
eastern time on october with tnt founder ted turner delivering a message about the channel s launch and programming followed by a pre recorded performance of the star spangled banner which traditionally played during the launch of a new turner owned network
its inaugural telecast which followed at p m
eastern was the first half of the classic film gone with the wind a film to which ted turner had acquired the rights the second half aired the following night at the same time both halves were repeated at p m
eastern on their respective nights with the film then being shown in its entirety that sunday
it was said that gone with the wind was chosen as the channel s inaugural program because it was turner s favorite movie
gone with the wind would also serve as the first program aired on sister channel turner classic movies when it debuted in april incidentally the film was set and had its premiere held in atlanta turner s hometown and the headquarters of the channel s corporate parent turner broadcasting system
tnt was initially a vehicle for older movies and television shows to which turner either already held rights or acquired specifically for the channel these films made up the majority of tnt s programming during its first six years of operation
the initial schedule also consisted of animated and live action children s programs airing sunday through fridays from to a m
eastern time and monday through saturdays from to p m
eastern time with western series on saturday mornings and a limited schedule of other classic television series in select other time periods
in its early years tnt caused controversy among film critics and fans for its airings of colorized versions of many classics that were originally filmed in black and white
the channel launched with an estimated million subscribers its initial coverage totaling times that of the largest previous cable network launch vh which launched on january with million homes estimated to have initially received that channel
the channel s operations were based inside office space at turner broadcasting s techwood drive complex in midtown atlanta that formerly served as the facilities for cnn headline news from its launch as cnn in january until it and parent network cnn moved their operations into the cnn center downtown in
turner entertainment networks president gerald hogan stated around the time of its launch that tnt would eventually become the first cable network to directly challenge the three broadcast networks through the production of original programming that would be of a quality level equal to and significantly better than programs carried on the major american broadcast television networks as such the channel slowly began to add original programming and newer reruns within two years of its launch
the channel debuted its first original made for tv film on march when tnt premiered nightbreaker an arms race era drama starring martin sheen who also co produced the film and emilio estevez
in tnt debuted wcw monday nitro which assumed the distinction as the flagship program of the now defunct world championship wrestling from wcw saturday night ran on that channel until
at one point monday nitro was regularly the highest rated weekly program on cable television
the program beat monday night raw the flagship show of the world wrestling federation now the wwe or world wrestling entertainment in the ratings for consecutive weeks from to
however by early the program began to lose viewers to raw which became the highest rated wrestling program on television due to its use of more adult like storylines
on march the wwf acquired most of the assets of wcw which had been up for sale since late monday nitro aired its last episode three days later
on september time warner a new york city based media company formed in through the merger of time inc
and warner bros
corporate parent warner communications reached an agreement to acquire the turner broadcasting system and its associated properties including tnt tbs cnn headline news and cartoon network as well as turner entertainment for billion the deal would also expand time warner s pay television holdings as it had owned hbo and sister premium service cinemax as well as cable television provider time warner cable since the time warner communications merger six years prior
time warner and predecessor warner communications had owned an interest in turner broadcasting since as part of a cable television industry backed bailout of the company amid severe financial issues under the terms turner would acquire an approximate interest in time warner as well as oversee its subscription network group comprising the turner and home box office units and its minority interests in comedy central and e and hold a position on the company s board of directors which he retained until he stepped down from the company in february upon the merger s closure
the merger received regulatory approval on september the turner time warner deal was finalized one month later on october forming what at the time was the largest media company in the world
the channel was also known for its late night programming
one such program was monstervision a saturday night b movie showcase that aired from to
often the series had special themes such as godzilla bash an all day marathon of movies from the godzilla franchise
penn teller served as occasional guest hosts during its early years and in monstervision found a permanent host in cult personality and drive in movie aficionado joe bob briggs who hosted a pair of more contemporary horror films each week such as friday the th part and wes craven s new nightmare
during the wraparound segments within each film briggs provided a running commentary trivia off color jokes and a drive in total as well as jokes at the expense of tnt s standards practices department regarding the heavy censorship of the featured movies
this running joke culminated in a friday the th all night halloween marathon in where it was implied that ted turner was out to kill him
into the s tnt continued to air cartoons from the turner library such as the flintstones scooby doo the depatie freleng pink panther cartoons dexter s laboratory and the real adventures of jonny quest as part of a daily block called tnt toons
the rudy and gogo world famous cartoon show which ran from to was an original children s program on the channel featuring warner bros mgm and popeye shorts hosted by a titular pair of a marionette and a nanny goat
in january the channel began scaling back its children s programming amid competition in that market from nickelodeon and turner owned sister channel cartoon network at that time tnt discontinued its late afternoon block of animated series in favor of airing acquired drama series such as starsky hutch and in the heat of the night
in tnt dropped all of its remaining cartoons relegating those shows to cartoon network
most of the animated series and shorts that were dropped would also serve as the core of boomerang a subscription channel devoted to classic cartoons that launched on april
during the s tnt scheduled a weekday afternoon block that included due south kung fu the legend continues lois clark the new adventures of superman and babylon
in tnt made efforts to increase its original programming bumping its production budget by with programming production costs running in the range of million to million by
that year tnt took over production of the fifth and final season of babylon from the prime time entertainment network after the ad hoc syndication block ceased operations
the following year tnt produced the babylon spinoff series crusade which was canceled after episodes as tnt management decided that science fiction did not fit the channel s brand identity
in tnt debuted what became its most successful original series at the time witchblade which ran for two seasons ending in
on june tnt underwent an extensive rebrand with the introduction of a new logo designed by trollb ck company as well as a new slogan we know drama a repositioning of the network that bradley siegel then president of turner entertainment networks explained had emerged through extensive focus group research with frequent tnt viewers
the slogan emphasized the channel s new focus on dramatic programming including sports and off network syndicated dramas such as law order nypd blue er and judging amy
on january tnt launched a substitute feed called tnt plus although it does not appear this was ever reflected in the channel s on air identity
the apparent sole purpose of its establishment was to force renegotiations with subscription providers to increase carriage fees with some multiple system operators suggesting that turner was seeking a increase in subscriber fees for the channel to help pay for tnt s new nba and nascar contracts well before the channel s distribution agreements with providers were scheduled to come up for renewal
in theory tnt plus was to have been the sole carrier of turner s nba and nascar coverage from that point forward while any providers still carrying the original tnt would have seen replacement programming instead
although it appears that comcast did not immediately sign on to carry tnt plus there is no evidence that turner had actually pulled its sports programming from the original tnt
on december tnt unveiled an update to its logo displaying it mainly in a silver or sometimes gold beveling
the we know drama tagline remained but the channel added more of a focus on its original series and announced plans to carry three nights of original programming a week during primetime starting in

time warner shareholders approved the merger on february however on february fcc chairman ajit pai announced that his agency will not review the deal leaving the review to the u s
department of justice
on november the justice department filed a lawsuit against at t and time warner in an attempt to block the merger citing antitrust concerns surrounding the transaction
the proposed merger which had already been approved by the european commission and mexican chilean and brazilian regulatory authorities was affirmed by court ruling on june after district of columbia u s
district court judge richard j
leon ruled in favor of at t dismissing the doj s antitrust claims in the lawsuit
the merger closed two days later on june with the company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of at t under the renamed parent company warnermedia
the u s

tnt hd is a high definition simulcast feed of tnt which broadcasts at a picture resolution of i the hd feed launched on may inaugurated with the network s coverage of game of the nba western conference finals between the los angeles lakers and the minnesota timberwolves
tnt has been criticized for its practice of airing a significant amount of standard definition content stretched to on its hd feed utilizing a nonlinear process similar to the panorama setting on many hdtvs that some viewers have nicknamed stretch o vision
though other cable channels have also fallen into this practice for their hd simulcast feeds tnt has been the one most commonly cited since it was one of the first channels to offer such a simulcast

in july the turner broadcasting system announced that tnt would obtain partial pay television rights to the national basketball association nba beginning with the season as part of a transference of tbs superstation s existing nba telecast rights
as a result tnt s nba coverage would consist of games involving other teams within the league with tbs s rights being scaled back to only encompass game telecasts involving the franchise serving its parent television station wtbs s home market the atlanta hawks which ted turner had purchased from atlanta based real estate developer tom cousins in
under the initial agreement and a subsequent five year contract signed in december tnt carried about regular season and playoff games during the inaugural season of its contractual rights
tbs superstation wtbs in acquiring exclusivity for the hawks expanded its schedule to include away games through the acquisition of atlanta rival wgnx now cbs affiliate wgcl tv s partial hawks telecast rights
in the early s some hawks game telecasts shown on tnt and tbs were blacked out within miles of the home team s arena
this restriction was dropped in allowing tnt the right to be the exclusive broadcaster of any game it chose to carry
