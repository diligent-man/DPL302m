The World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, is a series of international rugby sevens tournaments for women's national teams run by World Rugby
The inaugural series was held in 2012–13 as the successor to the IRB Women's Sevens Challenge Cup held the previous season
The competition has been sponsored by banking group HSBC since 2015.
The series, the women's counterpart to the World Rugby Sevens Series, provides elite-level women's competition between rugby nations
As with the men's Sevens World Series, teams compete for the title by accumulating points based on their finishing position in each tournament.
The first 2012–13 series consisted of four tournaments on three continents
The first two events were hosted by the United Arab Emirates (specifically Dubai) and the United States, both of which host events in the men's version
The other two events were hosted by China and the Netherlands.
For the second series in 2013–14, five tournaments took place; a sixth had initially been announced, but never materialized
All nations that hosted events in 2012–13 hosted in the second season, with the added event hosted by Brazil.
The series expanded to six events for 2014–15
The Dubai, Brazil, USA, and Netherlands events remained on the schedule
China was not on the 2014–15 schedule
New rounds of the series were launched in Canada (specifically in Greater Victoria) and London
 Initially, the 2015–16 series was announced with only four events, with London and the Netherlands dropping from the schedule, but a fifth event was eventually added, hosted by France
Events in Australia and Japan were added in 2016–17
With the USA hosting the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens, the USA was not on the 2017–18 schedule.
The USA Women's Sevens returned to the schedule for the 2018–19 series, but the event was moved within the season to become the opening event
The same season saw three events move to new locations
First, the USA event moved from Las Vegas to the Denver suburb of Glendale, Colorado
The Australian Women's Sevens, as well as the country's corresponding event in the men's Sevens Series, moved within Sydney from Sydney Football Stadium to Sydney Showground Stadium
This was necessary because the Football Stadium was demolished, with an entirely new stadium to be built on the same site
Finally, the France Women's Sevens, originally set for Paris, was moved to Biarritz, with the date also being moved forward two weeks from its original schedule
This change was promoted by both World Rugby and the French Rugby Federation (FFR) as "enabl[ing] the FFR to maximise the visibility, attendance and impact of hosting the final round of the record-breaking series."
The World Rugby Women's Sevens Series expanded to eight tournaments in 2019–20
From 2020 to 2022, however, several of these events had to be cancelled due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unlike the men's Sevens Series, which has enjoyed title sponsorship by banking giant HSBC in recent years, the Women's Sevens Series did not have a title sponsor until 2015–16
HSBC is now the title sponsor of both the men's and women's series.
Summary of the top six placegetters for each series:
Tally of top six placings in the series for each team, updated after the most recent 2019–20 season:
Rugby sevens is a version of rugby union, invented in Scotland in the 19th century, with seven players each side on a normal-sized field
Games are much shorter, generally lasting only seven minutes each half, and tend to be very fast-paced, open affairs
The game is quicker and higher-scoring than 15-a-side rugby and the rules are simpler, which explains part of its appeal
It also gives players the space for superb feats of individual skill
Sevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format.
The women's series features 12 teams in each tournament
The remaining participants are invited on the basis of regional tournament rankings.
Each tournament uses a format similar to that of the men's series, adjusted for the lower number of teams, with pool play followed by three separate knockout tournaments.
Prior to the inaugural season, a group of  "core teams" that are guaranteed places in all series events was announced
This concept is taken directly from the men's series
Unlike the men's series, which features 15 core teams as of the 2012–13 season, the women's series began with only six.
For the 2013–14 series, the number of core teams was increased to eight, all reached the quarter final from the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens:
Brazil was invited to participate in all events for the 2013–14 series
This was part of an IRB initiative to help jump-start women's rugby development in the country, which is set to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.
For the 2014–15 series, the number of core teams increased to 11, and qualification was extensively revamped, changing to a system more similar to that currently used in the men's World Series
The top seven teams in the 2013–14 series retained core team status
Four additional core teams were determined in a 12-team qualifying tournament held in Hong Kong on 12–13 September 2014
World Rugby did not initially announce full details of the qualification system for future series, but eventually determined that the top nine teams from the 2014–15 series would retain their status for 2015–16, with a world qualifier following in September 2015.
The overall winner of the series was determined by points gained from the standings across all events in the season
The points schedule is similar to that of the men's Series, with the differences noted above.
In Series V, 2016–17 the awards changed
At each event teams compete for gold, silver and bronze medals while lower ranked teams will contest a new Challenge Trophy competition
In the first four Series teams played, after the pool stage, for a Cup (1st four teams), a Plate (second 4 teams) and a Bowl (last 4 teams)
Twelve teams competed at each event; nine being "core" teams, with three teams invited to participate in particular events (similar to previous women's series as well as the men's counterpart).
Tie-breaking: Should teams finish equal on series points at the end of the season, the tiebreakers are the same as those in the men's series:
