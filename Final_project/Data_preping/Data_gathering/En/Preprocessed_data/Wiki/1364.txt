first the usa event moved from las vegas to the denver suburb of glendale colorado
the australian women s sevens as well as the country s corresponding event in the men s sevens series moved within sydney from sydney football stadium to sydney showground stadium

rugby sevens is a version of rugby union invented in scotland in the th century with seven players each side on a normal sized field
games are much shorter generally lasting only seven minutes each half and tend to be very fast paced open affairs
the game is quicker and higher scoring than a side rugby and the rules are simpler which explains part of its appeal
it also gives players the space for superb feats of individual skill
sevens is traditionally played in a two day tournament format
the women s series features teams in each tournament
the remaining participants are invited on the basis of regional tournament rankings
each tournament uses a format similar to that of the men s series adjusted for the lower number of teams with pool play followed by three separate knockout tournaments
prior to the inaugural season a group of core teams that are guaranteed places in all series events was announced
this concept is taken directly from the men s series
unlike the men s series which features core teams as of the season the women s series began with only six
