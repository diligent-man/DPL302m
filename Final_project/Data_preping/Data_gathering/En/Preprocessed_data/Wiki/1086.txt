David II (5 March 1324 – 22 February 1371) was King of Scots from 1329 until his death in 1371
Upon the death of his father, Robert the Bruce, David succeeded to the throne at the age of five, and was crowned at Scone in November 1331, becoming the first Scottish monarch to be anointed at their coronation
During his childhood Scotland was governed by a series of guardians, and Edward III of England sought to take advantage of David's minority by supporting an invasion of Scotland by Edward Balliol, beginning the Second War of Scottish Independence
Following the English victory at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, David, his queen and the rump of his government were evacuated to France, where he remained in exile until it was safe for him to return to Scotland in 1341.
In 1346, David invaded England in support of France during the Hundred Years' War
His army was defeated at the Battle of Neville's Cross and he was captured and held as a prisoner in England for eleven years, while his nephew, Robert the Steward, governed Scotland
In 1357 the Treaty of Berwick brought the Second War of Independence to an end, the Scots agreed to pay a ransom of 100,000 merks, and David II was allowed to return home
Heavy taxation was needed to provide funds for the ransom, which was to be paid in instalments, and David alienated his subjects by using the money for his own purposes
By 1363 it was found impossible to raise the remaining ransom, and David sought its cancellation by offering to bequeath the succession to the Scottish throne to Edward III or one of his sons
In 1364, the Parliament of Scotland rejected David's proposal to make Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the next king
Despising his nephew, David sought to prevent him succeeding to his throne by marrying his mistress, Margaret Drummond, and producing an alternative heir
When his second wife failed to do so, David unsuccessfully attempted to divorce her.
Although David II spent long periods in exile or captivity, he managed to ensure the survival of his kingdom, reformed the machinery of government, and left the Scottish monarchy in a strong position
The last male of the House of Bruce, David died, childless, in 1371 after a reign of 41 years, and was succeeded by his nephew, Robert II.
David II was born on 5 March 1324 at Dunfermline Abbey in Fife, one of twin sons born to Robert I, King of Scotland and Elizabeth de Burgh
Soon after his birth he was wet nursed at the Bishop of St Andrews' manor at Inchmurdoch in Fife
He was created Earl of Carrick by his father in 1326, and an official household was established for the prince at Turnberry Castle
Very little is known of his youth, though it is recorded that King Robert paid for Dominican friars to educate David, and also purchased books for him
David's mother died in 1327, when he was three years old
In accordance with the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton's terms, on 17 July 1328, when he was four years old, David was married to seven-year-old Joan, the daughter of Edward II of England and Isabella of France, at Berwick Castle
They had no issue.
David became king upon the death of his father on 7 June 1329
David II's youth and the uncertainty of the Anglo-Scottish peace meant that he was not moved from Turnberry to Scone for his coronation for two-and-a-half years
The seven-year old king and his wife were crowned at Scone Abbey on 24 November 1331
Upon David's accession, Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray was appointed as Guardian in accordance with Robert I's orders, to govern Scotland until David reached adulthood, and the royal government of King Robert remained largely in place from 1329 to 1332
After Moray's death, on 20 July 1332, he was replaced by Donald, Earl of Mar, elected by an assembly of the magnates of Scotland at Perth, 2 August 1332
Only ten days later Mar fell at the Battle of Dupplin Moor
Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell, who was married to Christian (or Christina), the sister of King Robert I, was chosen as the new Guardian
He was taken prisoner by the English at Roxburgh in April 1333 and was thence replaced as Guardian by Archibald Douglas (the Tyneman), who fell at the Battle of Halidon Hill that July.
Meanwhile, on 24 September 1332, following the Scots' defeat at Dupplin, Edward Balliol, a protégé of Edward III of England, and a pretender to the throne of Scotland, was crowned by the English and his Scots adherents
By December, however, Balliol was forced to flee to England after the Battle of Annan, although he returned the following year as part of an invasion force led by the English king.
Following the English victory at the Battle of Halidon Hill in July 1333, David and his wife were sent for safety into France, reaching Boulogne on 14 May 1334
They were received very graciously by King Philip VI
Little is known about the life of the Scottish king in France, except that Château Gaillard was given to him for a residence, and that he was present at the bloodless meeting of the English and French armies in October 1339 at Vironfosse, now known as Buironfosse, in the Arrondissement of Vervins.
By 1341, David's representatives had once again obtained the upper hand in Scotland
David was able to return to his kingdom, landing at Inverbervie in Kincardineshire on 2 June 1341
He took the reins of government into his own hands, at the age of 17.
In 1346, under the terms of the Auld Alliance, David invaded England to try to draw King Edward away from the French, who had been invaded by the English and badly defeated at the Battle of Crecy
After initial success at Hexham, David's army was soundly defeated at the Battle of Neville's Cross on 17 October 1346
David suffered two arrow wounds to the face and was captured and taken prisoner by Sir John de Coupland who took him to Wark-on-Tweed where barber-surgeons from York were brought to treat his serious injuries
When Edward promised to reward Coupland with a knighthood, David was turned over to Philippa and taken to the Tower
David was transferred to Windsor Castle in Berkshire upon the return of Edward III from France
The depiction of David being presented to King Edward III in the play The Raigne of King Edward the Third is fictitious
David and his household were later moved to Odiham Castle in Hampshire
His imprisonment was not reputed to be a rigorous one as was typical of most royal prisoners
However, the fact that from 1355 he was denied contact with any of his subjects may indicate otherwise
 He remained captive in England for eleven years.
On 3 October 1357, after several protracted negotiations with the Scots' regency council, a treaty was signed at Berwick-upon-Tweed under which Scotland's nobility agreed to pay 100,000 marks, at the rate of 10,000 marks per year, as a ransom for their king
This was ratified by the Scottish Parliament at Scone on 6 November 1357.
David returned at once to Scotland, bringing with him a mistress, Katherine (or Catherine) Mortimer, of whom little is known
This was an unpopular move, and Katherine was murdered in 1360 by men hired by the Earl of Angus and other nobles, according to some sources; the Earl was then starved to death
She was replaced as mistress by Margaret Drummond.
After six years, owing to the poverty of the kingdom, it was found impossible to raise the ransom instalment of 1363
David then made for London and sought to get rid of the liability by offering to bequeath Scotland to Edward III, or one of his sons, in return for a cancellation of the ransom
David did this with the full awareness that the Scots would never accept such an arrangement
In 1364, the Scottish parliament indignantly rejected a proposal to make Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the next king
Over the next few years, David strung out secret negotiations with Edward III, which apparently appeased the matter.
His wife, Queen Joan, died on 7 September 1362 (aged 41) at Hertford Castle, Hertfordshire, possibly a victim of the Black Death
He remarried, on about 20 February 1364, Margaret Drummond, widow of Sir John Logie, and daughter of Sir Malcolm Drummond
He divorced her on about 20 March 1370
They had no children
Margaret, however, travelled to Avignon, and made a successful appeal to the Pope Urban V to reverse the sentence of divorce which had been pronounced against her in Scotland
She was still alive in January 1375, four years after David died.
From 1364, David governed actively, dealing firmly with recalcitrant nobles, and a wider baronial revolt, led by his prospective successor, the future Robert II
David continued to pursue the goal of a final peace with England
At the time of his death, the Scottish monarchy was stronger and the country was "a free and independent kingdom" according to a reliable source
The royal finances were more prosperous than might have seemed possible.
King David II of Scotland married twice and had several mistresses, but none of his relationships produced children.
1) Joan of the Tower, the daughter of King Edward II of England and Isabella of France, was David's first wife
David and Joan were married on 17 July 1328, when he was four years old and she was seven
The marriage was in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Northampton
They were married for 34 years but produced no children
Queen Joan died on 7 September 1362 (aged 41) at Hertford Castle, Hertfordshire, possibly a victim of the Black Death.
2) Margaret Drummond was the widow of Sir John Logie, and daughter of Sir Malcolm Drummond
Margaret was David's mistress before the death of Queen Joan, from about 1361
David and Margaret married on 20 February 1364
Still producing no heirs, David attempted to divorce Margaret on 20 March 1370, on the grounds that she was infertile
Pope Urban V, however, reversed the divorce
When David died on 22 February 1371, Margaret and David were still actually married, according to Rome
Margaret died sometime after 31 January 1375, and her funeral was paid for by Pope Gregory XI.
3) Agnes Dunbar was David's mistress at the time of his death
He was planning to marry her, however, the marriage was delayed by the reversal of his divorce to Margaret.
David II died unexpectedly of natural causes, and at the height of his power, in Edinburgh Castle on 22 February 1371
He was buried in Holyrood Abbey
The funeral was overseen by Abbot Thomas
He left no children and was succeeded by his nephew, Robert II, the son of David's half-sister Marjorie Bruce
David II was the last male of the House of Bruce.
David II has been depicted in historical novels
They include
Cressy and Poictiers; or, the Story of the Black Prince's Page (1865) by John George Edgar (1834–1864)
The novel depicts events of the years 1344 to 1370, with an epilogue in 1376
The events depicted cover part of the Hundred Years' War and the "Scotch Border Wars" (Second War of Scottish Independence), with the Battle of Neville's Cross (1346) being a key part of the plot
David II is one of the "principal characters", alongside Edward III of England, Philippa of Hainault, and Edward, the Black Prince.
Flowers of Chivalry (1988), by Nigel Tranter, covers events of the Second War of Scottish Independence from 1332 to 1339
David II is a secondary character, the protagonists being Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie and William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale.
Vagabond (2002) by Bernard Cornwell.David II also appears as a character in the Elizabethan play Edward III and also in the 2012 grand strategy game Crusader Kings II as the monarch of Scotland in 1336.
