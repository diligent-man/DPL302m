in the united states fugitive slaves or runaway slaves were terms used in the th and th century to describe enslaved people who fled slavery
the term also refers to the federal fugitive slave acts of and
such people are also called freedom seekers to avoid implying that the enslaved person had committed a crime and that the slaveholder was the injured party
generally they tried to reach states or territories where slavery was banned including canada or until spanish florida
most slave law tried to control slave travel by requiring them to carry official passes if traveling without a master with them
passage of the fugitive slave act of increased penalties against enslaved people and those who aided them
because of this freedom seekers left the united states altogether traveling to canada or mexico
approximately american slaves escaped to freedom
beginning in the slave laws were enacted in colonial america initially among the new england confederation and then by several of the original thirteen colonies
in the province of new york passed a measure to keep bondspeople from escaping north into canada
the states began to divide into free and slave states
while maryland and virginia passed laws to offer rewards to people who captured and returned enslaved to their slaveholders
slavery was abolished in five states by the time of the constitutional convention in
at that time new hampshire vermont massachusetts connecticut and rhode island had become free states
legislators from the southern united states were concerned that free states would offer protection for enslaved people who fled slavery
the united states constitution ratified in never uses the words slave or slavery but recognized its existence in the so called fugitive slave clause article iv section clause the three fifths clause and the prohibition on prohibiting importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit article i section
the fugitive slave act of is the first of two federal laws that allowed for runaway enslaved people to be captured and returned to their slave holders
it was enacted in by the congress to allow agents for the slaveholders and local governments including free states in tracking and capturing bondspeople
they were also able to penalize individuals with a equivalent to in fine if they assisted african americans in their escape
the slave hunters were required to get a court approved affidavit to capture the enslaved person
northerners thought that this meant that it was like legalized kidnapping and deplored the idea of slave hunters stalking through their state
it resulted in the creation of a network of safe houses called the underground railroad
the fugitive slave act of part of the compromise of was a law enacted by the congress that declared that all fugitive slaves should be returned to their masters
because the south agreed to have california enter as a free state the north allowed the fugitive slave act of to be created
the act was passed on september and it was repealed on june
the act strengthened the authority of the federal government in the capturing of fugitive slaves
the act authorized federal marshals to require northern citizen bystanders to aid in the capturing of runaways
many northerners perceived the legislation as a way in which the federal government overstepped its authority due to the fact that the legislation could be used to force northerners to act against their abolitionist beliefs
many northern states eventually passed personal liberty laws which prevented the kidnapping of alleged runaway slaves however in the court case known as prigg v
pennsylvania the personal liberty laws were ruled unconstitutional on the grounds that the capturing of fugitive slaves was a federal matter in which states did not have the power to interfere
many northern citizens were outraged at the criminalization of actions by underground railroad operators and abolitionists who helped enslaved people escape slavery
it is considered one of the causes of the american civil war
the fugitive acts of and were repealed on june by an act of congress
many states tried to nullify the new slave act or prevent capture of escaped slaves by setting up new laws to protect their rights
one of the most notable is the massachusetts liberty act
this act was passed in order to keep escaped slaves from being returned to their masters through abduction by federal marshals or bounty hunters
wisconsin and vermont also enacted legislation to bypass the federal law
abolitionists became more involved in underground railroad operations
when the slaves were found missing masters were outraged many of them believing that slavery was good to the slave and if they ran away it was the work of northern abolitionists they are indeed happy and if let alone would still remain so a new name was invented for the supposed mental illness of a slave that made him or her want to run away drapetomania flyers would be put up advertisements placed in newspapers rewards offered and posses send out to find him or her
under the new fugitive slave act they could now send federal marshals into the north to extract them
this new law also brought bounty hunters into the business of returning slaves to their masters a former slave could be brought back into the south to be sold back into slavery if he she was without freedom papers
in there was a case of a black coffeehouse waiter who was kidnapped by federal marshals on behalf of john debree who claimed to be the man s enslaver
numerous escaped slaves upon return were to face harsh punishments such as amputation of limbs whippings branding hobbling and many other horrible acts
individuals who aided fugitive slaves were charged and punished under this law
in the case of ableman v
booth the latter was charged with aiding glover s escape in wisconsin by preventing his capture by federal marshals
the wisconsin supreme court ruled that the fugitive slave act of was unconstitutional as it required states to violate their own laws in protecting slavery
ableman v
booth was appealed by the federal government to the us supreme court which upheld the constitutionality of the act
the underground railroad was a network of black and white abolitionists between the late th century and the end of the civil war who helped fugitive slaves escape to freedom
in george washington complained that a quaker tried to free one of his slaves
isaac t
hopper a quaker from philadelphia and a group of people from north carolina established a network of stations in their local area in the early s
members of the religious society of friends quakers african methodist episcopal church baptists methodists and other religious sects helped in operating the underground railroad
in when tice david was captured going into ohio from kentucky
his owner blamed an underground railroad who helped in escape
eight years later while being tortured for his escape a man named jim said that he was going north along the underground railroad to boston the network extended throughout the united states including spanish florida indian territory and western united states and into canada and mexico
in some cases freedom seekers immigrated to europe and the caribbean islands
stations were set up in private homes churches and schoolhouses in border states between slave and free states
often enslaved people had to make their way through southern slave states
slaves helped people who had run away
there were signals such as use of a light or two lamps or the choice of songs sung on sundays to let escaping people know if it was safe to be in the area of if there were slave hunters nearby
if they stayed in a slave cabin they would likely get food and learn good hiding places in the woods as they made their way north
john brown had a secret room in his tannery to give escaped slaves places to stay on their way
people who maintained the stations provided food clothing shelter and instructions about reaching the next station
the underground railroad was initially an escape route that would assist fugitive enslaved african americans in arriving in the northern states however the passage of the fugitive slave act of as well as other laws aiding the southern states in the capturing of runaway slaves resulted in the underground railroad being used as a mechanism to reach canada
canada was a safe haven for african american slaves because canada had already abolished slavery by
blacks in canada were also provided equal protection under the law
the well known underground railroad conductor harriet tubman is said to have led approximately slaves to canada
one of the most notable runaway slaves of american history and conductors of the underground railroad is harriet tubman
born into slavery in dorchester county maryland around tubman as a young adult escaped from her master s plantation in
between and she returned to the south numerous times to help parties of other slaves to freedom guiding them through the lands she knew well
she has aided hundreds of people to escape from slavery including her parents
tubman followed north south flowing rivers and the north star to make her way north
she preferred to guide enslaved people on saturdays since newspapers were not published on sundays and gave her a one day head start before runaway advertisements would be published
she preferred the winters because the nights were longer when it was the safest to travel
tubman wore disguises
she sang songs in different tempos to indicate whether is was safe for freedom seekers to come out of hiding
she sang go down moses and bound for the promised land
many people called her the moses of her people during the american civil war harriet tubman also worked as a spy cook and as a nurse
