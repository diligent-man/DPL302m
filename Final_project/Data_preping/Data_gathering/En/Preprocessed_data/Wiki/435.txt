it runs on windows and above including windows windows and windows
internet explorer versions through are supported
version released october was separated in two editions ultimate edition which added the gecko layout engine used by mozilla firefox allowing the user choose between both layout engines and lite edition which contains only the trident layout engine
avant browser was largely inspired by opera the first major browser to have a multiple document interface
the developer s objective was to wrap a comparable interface around the layout engine used by internet explorer thereby achieving opera like ergonomics without suffering the frequent problems that browser had rendering pages tested only in internet explorer
in fact it was initially released under the name ieopera though this was soon changed due to trademark concerns
later avant s developer anderson che has concentrated on adding user requested features and avant was among the first browsers to have popup blocking advertising server blocking and one click disabling of potential security vulnerabilities such as activex java and javascript
the avant browser s default search engine is a version of the yahoo search engine renamed avantfind and is given a custom look
other search engines are available via the address bar s quick search facility and instructions on how to change the default to an engine of the user s choice have been posted by the very active avant browser user community
the community has also created other tools and extensions for avant including registry files which allow it to use the information bar and other security enhancements of windows xp sp
the developer also used to have a sister project known as orca browser an avant like shell of mozilla s gecko layout engine as used in firefox using similar approaches to flock
orca browser project is now discontinued
