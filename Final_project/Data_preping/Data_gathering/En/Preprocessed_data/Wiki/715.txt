Cheltenham Township is a home rule township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States
Cheltenham's population density ranges from over 10,000 per square mile in rowhouses and high-rise apartments along Cheltenham Avenue to historic neighborhoods in Wyncote and Elkins Park
It is the most densely populated township in Montgomery County
The population was 36,793 at the 2010 U.S
Census, making it the third most populous township in Montgomery County and the 27th most populous municipality in Pennsylvania
It was originally part of Philadelphia County, and it became part of Montgomery County upon that county's creation in 1784.
Cheltenham is located 5 miles from Center City, Philadelphia and surrounded by the North and Northeast sections of Philadelphia, Abington, Jenkintown, and Springfield
The SEPTA Main Line passes through Cheltenham via 5 regional rail stations, some of which are the busiest in the SEPTA system
Cheltenham is served by the SEPTA City Transit Division and is adjacent to Fern Rock Transportation Center and the Broad Street Line subway which terminates at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex and also the Frankford Transportation Center and the El, which terminates at 69th Street in Upper Darby Township
The northern terminus of Broad Street is in Cheltenham, at its intersection with Cheltenham Avenue (Pennsylvania Route 309).
Cheltenham was established in 1682 as part of Philadelphia County by 15 Quakers from Cheltenham, England, including Richard Wall and Tobias Leech, who purchased 4,070 acres (16.5 km) of land from William Penn
Upon creation of Montgomery County in 1784, Cheltenham became the smallest township in the new county.
The following is the list of the 15 original founders of Cheltenham Township
From early in its history, Cheltenham was fueled by the development of various mills along Tookany Creek
Communities and villages grew around these mills and formed what is now modern Cheltenham neighborhoods
The first gristmill was built by Richard Dungworth in 1690
After changing ownership several times, the Rowland family eventually made the mill the second largest producer of shovels in the United States
The site was demolished in 1929.
The USCT (United States Colored Troops) 3rd Regiment were the first to be trained at Camp William Penn
It is tradition that soldiers have a grand parade before leaving for war, but Philadelphia was partially a racist community at that time and the government believed that a parade might cause a riot, so it was cancelled
The leader of the Camp (Colonel Louis Wagner) was furious and made sure the next regiment to come through would have a parade.
Cheltenham Township contains no incorporated areas
Its districts include the communities of Glenside, Laverock, Edge Hill, Wyncote, Cedarbrook, Chelten Hills, La Mott, Elkins Park, Melrose Park, and Cheltenham Village.
From the late 19th to early 20th century, Cheltenham established itself as one of the most prominent communities in the Philadelphia area
Railroad tycoon Jay Cooke was one of the first to build his mansion in Cheltenham
His 200-acre estate was eventually converted to a school in 1883 and was later demolished
John Wanamaker built his mansion Lindenhurst, which was destroyed by a fire in 1907
His second Lindenhurst was destroyed by another fire in 1944
Henry Breyer, Jr
eventually bought the land from Wanamaker
Other famous mansions built include Abraham Barker's "Lyndon," Cyrus H
K
Curtis's "Curtis Hall," George Horace Lorimer's "Belgrame," and John B
Stetson's "Idro." Perhaps the most famous mansions that still stand to this day are the prominent Widener family mansion Lynnewood Hall, the Elkins Estate which was home to William Elkins, and Grey Towers Castle which was home to William Welsh Harrison
The latter is a National Historic Landmark and was designed by famed architect Horace Trumbauer, who designed many buildings and homes in Cheltenham.
As the Gilded Age ended and the depression hit the country, many of the estates and mansions were destroyed and made way for the building of houses in their place
Many of the communities that were formed in the early stages of Cheltenham remained, and still exist to this day
As the 20th century progressed, many people moved out of the city and into the first community over the city line, Cheltenham
With the population increase, the township's identity evolved from being largely a community of prominent Philadelphians and their mansions to several distinct communities
One of the major groups to come to Cheltenham was Koreans
The original Koreatown was located in the Olney section of Philadelphia, but eventually was moved north to Logan
Large pockets of Koreans were eventually established in Cheltenham, and also in Upper Darby Township and West Philadelphia
Many other races and ethnicities migrated to Cheltenham to make it one of the most diverse municipalities in the Delaware Valley
By the 2000 Census, Cheltenham was one of only two (the other being Norristown) municipalities in Montgomery County that was considered "diverse" (20–60% of the population is non-white).
Cheltenham, along with the other earliest communities in the Philadelphia area such as Upper Darby Township, Haverford, Lower Merion, and Jenkintown have retained their distinct identities while being surrounded by suburbia over the middle to late part of the twentieth century
Cheltenham and Lower Merion are of the few townships in Montgomery County who had a large population prior to the postwar population boom and thus whose majority of houses, communities, and streets have remained virtually unchanged since the early 20th century
Cheltenham has 13 listings on the National Register of Historic Places, the most of any municipality in Montgomery County.
Cheltenham became a township of the first class in 1900
In 1976, it passed a home rule charter that took effect in 1977.
There are many books about Cheltenham Township's history.

It is also a Tree City USA member, a program dedicated to forestry management
Most recently in 2013, Cheltenham was named a "Classic Town of Greater Philadelphia," for being "one of the most diverse, unique, and livable communities in our region" and "truly at the center of it all."
The seal of Cheltenham was adopted from the seal of the namesake and sister city, Cheltenham, England
It appears on all formal documents, resolutions, proclamations, and all legal records or documents
