Several types of connectors for car audio systems are used
Splicing wires used in car audio are mainly for power ground amplifier and antenna speakers phone and others
ACC red supplies V power to car audio and other accessories only when the car's ignition is switched on
Constant yellow also called BAT or Battery provides permanent V power from battery This allows the radio to retain settings for example stored radio stations when the ignition is switched off
Illumination orange with white stripe or dimmer when it is night and cars lights are turned on head unit screen illumination is dimmed
Ground abbrev as GND black V usually connected to the vehicle's metal chassis and body Wires with black stripe are for negative power
Left rear green They have low amperage and it is activated when radio is turned on
Amplifier remote turn on blue with white stripe Phone the cable to mute when receiving a call is brown
Back view orange with white strip works when reverse gear light is on and it is used to turn on back camera screen i e when parking
Steering Wheel Controls SWC or Key brown with black stripe usually employs CAN bus ISO was created in and defines a standard for connectors for the head unit to the car's electrical system consisting of a system of four different connectors typically used in head units for car audio
Part of the standard is dedicated to Dimensions and general requirements and Part to Performance requirements
The first connector A is always present is usually black in colour and contains pins for power supply off on typically controlled by ignition key optional control for a motorised antenna and so on
On some cars the V Ignition and Battery positions are reversed such as later Volkswagen Group cars Peugeot Vauxhall Astra Citro n C and some JCB tractors
Pin is optional used for speed dependent volume control and possibly navigation
Pin is optional used for phone mute
Pin is optional used for reversing lamp signal on Becker radios with navigation
Pin is optional used for vehicle instrument illuminationThe second connector B is for connecting four loudspeakers front rear left and right and is usually brown in colour
The connector C is optional Sometimes it appears as one pin connector often red in colour or it may be divided into three separate connectors which may be hooked together in which case C is usually yellow C is usually green and C is usually blue in colour The contact spacing is narrower than the other connectors so the C connector is sometimes referred to as mini ISO
Note ISO only defines the physical attributes of the connectors not the pin signal designations which are manufacturer defined
The example above is oriented towards VW vehicles only
The connector D is for satellite navigation systems It has pins
From and onwards manufacturers such as BMW Citro n Ford Mercedes Benz Peugeot Volkswagen Rover Audi SEAT Opel or koda have sometimes started using a pin connector instead called the Quadlock
Unfortunately Quadlock may not be the description used by manufacturers of the connector components Therefore searching for Quadlock components may be unsuccessful for example Molex refer to a typical component of the connector as MOST Frame Receptacle Housing part number
The Quadlock connector consists of a block of flat pins analogous to the two main ISO connectors While the physical contact pins are the same the pin allocation is not entirely the same and the connector housing is not compatible In addition to the pins like ISO there are minor connectors for optional equipment They fit within the frame of the main connector and has coding so that they cannot be interchanged Minor connector B has pins for audio output signals Minor connector C has pins for various audio sources such as CD changers MP players
