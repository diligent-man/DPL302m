Madden NFL known as John Madden Football until is an American football video game series developed by EA Tiburon for EA Sports It is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame coach and commentator John Madden and sold more than million copies by It is also the only officially licensed National Football League NFL video game series and it has influenced many players and coaches of the physical sport Among the series' features are detailed playbooks and player statistics and voice commentary in the style of a real NFL television broadcast As of the franchise has generated over billion in sales
Electronic Arts EA founder Trip Hawkins conceived the series and approached Madden in for his endorsement and expertise Because of Madden's insistence that the game be as realistic as possible the first version of John Madden Football did not appear until EA has released annual versions since and the series' name changed to Madden NFL in after EA acquired the rights to use NFL teams and players
Trip Hawkins created a clone of the Strat o Matic paper and dice based football simulation game as a teenager The game was unsuccessful due to its complexity and he hoped to one day delegate its rules to a computer At Harvard College where Hawkins played football for the Crimson he wrote a football simulation for the PDP minicomputer which he later said predicted that the Miami Dolphins would defeat the Minnesota Vikings actually in the Super Bowl After founding Electronic Arts in —The real reason that I founded it was because I wanted to make computerized versions of games like Strat O Matic Hawkins later said—the company began designing a microcomputer football game Hawkins first approached his favorite player Joe Montana to endorse the proposed game but the quarterback already had an endorsement deal with Atari Inc and his second choice Cal coach Joe Kapp demanded royalties
In Hawkins approached Madden He and game producer Joe Ybarra arranged a follow up meeting with the broadcaster during an Amtrak train trip over two days because of Madden's fear of flying The EA executives promised that the proposed game would be a sophisticated football simulation and they asked the retired Oakland Raiders coach for his endorsement and expertise Madden knew nothing about computers beyond his telestrator but agreed he had taught a class at the University of California Berkeley called Football for Fans and envisioned the program as a tool for teaching and testing plays Madden would continue to see the game as an educational tool When asked in to describe Madden NFL he called it a way for people to learn the game and participate in the game at a pretty sophisticated level Hawkins and Ybarra during the train trip learned football plays and strategies from Madden from sunrise to midnight
EA likely expected Madden to endorse the game without participating in its design Early plans envisioned six or seven players per team because of technical limitations but Madden insisted on having players stating I'm not putting my name on it if it's not real Ybarra who had played chess not football in high school became an expert on the subject through his work but found that players overwhelmed contemporary home computers Most projects that are as delayed as Madden are canceled Ybarra and developer Robin Antonick needed three years more than twice the length of the average development process The project became known within the company as Trip's Folly and Madden—who had received advance against royalties that EA's outside auditors advised to write off because it would never be recouped—believed at times that EA had given up
The company hired Bethesda Softworks to finish the game but this only got them partway to their goal While EA used many of its designs including contributions to their physics engine within a year Bethesda stopped working on Madden and sued EA over EA's failure to publish new versions of Bethesda's Gridiron football game This added to the delay After a final development push John Madden Football debuted in for the Apple II series of computers Hawkins and an exhausted Ybarra All my memories are of pain could move on to other projects
Contracted to provide plays Madden gave EA the Raiders playbook and EA hired San Francisco Chronicle writer Frank Cooney who had designed his own figurine football game with numerical skill ratings Although the company could not yet legally use NFL teams' or players' names Cooney obtained real plays from NFL teams The back of the box called the game The First Real Football Simulation and quoted Madden Hey if there aren't players it isn't real football Documentation included diagrams of dozens of offensive and defensive plays with Madden's commentary on coaching strategies and philosophy The game sold moderately well but given the sophisticated playbook its interface was complex and Madden's insistence on players caused the game to run slowly
During this period Madden turned down the opportunity to buy an unlimited number of options for EA stock in its initial public offering a decision he later called the dumbest thing I ever did in my life
In early EA hired Park Place Productions to develop Madden for the Sega Genesis video game console Park Place had developed ABC Monday Night Football with arcade style action heavy game play and its Madden also emphasized hyperreality compared to the computer version's focus on exact simulation Impressed with Park Place's work EA chose it for the Genesis Madden instead of completing an in house version by Antonick
EA reverse engineered the console to sell the game without paying the standard to license fee per cartridge to Sega then proposed a compromise of per cartridge and a million cap on the fee The console maker agreed afraid that EA would sell its reverse engineered knowledge to other companies the agreement saved EA million over the next three years As its own Joe Montana endorsed football game would miss the Christmas shopping season Sega asked EA to let it sell Madden with the Montana name EA refused but offered an inferior alternative that lacked Madden's D graphics and most of its plays Joe Montana Football sold well despite shipping after Christmas and it remained popular after BlueSky Software took over development John Madden Football for the Genesis however became both the first hugely successful Madden game—selling copies when the company expected —and the first killer app for EA and Sega helping the console gain market share against the Super NES From to Mega placed the game at in their monthly Top Mega Drive Games of All Time
In EA producer Richard Hilleman brought in veteran sports game designer Scott Orr who had founded the mid s Commodore game publisher GameStar and led the design of their best selling sports games The team of Orr and Hilleman designed and led the development of what is today still recognizable as the modern Madden Early versions of Madden were created by external development studios such as Bethesda Visual Concepts and Stormfront Studios John Madden Football ' also featured the ambulance which would run over any players in its path
After Visual Concepts failed to deliver Madden NFL ' for the new PlayStation in EA hired Tiburon Entertainment for Madden NFL ' and later acquired the company centralizing development in house It planned to release John Madden Football as its first sports based arcade game but the game was cancelled due to unenthusiastic reactions from play testers EA's refusal to release Madden and other sports titles for the Dreamcast in contributed to the console's lack of success and Sega's exit from the hardware market
By Madden was the best selling sports video game franchise with more than eight million units sold up until then
In Electronic Arts added Franchise Mode to Madden giving players the ability to play multiple seasons make off season draft picks and trade players
Within Franchise Mode players take on the role of General Manager and manage all personnel matters including contracts free agency draft picks and hiring and firing coaches The player also acts as a head coach like character although there is a head coach figure in game choosing which players to play making substitutions running practices practicing gameplans etc
Players may play with any of the NFL's franchises they can choose whether or not to have trade deadlines and salary caps and if they want to start their Franchise with a round fantasy draft of all active NFL players Players can also upload created teams for use in the game
Once in game players run training camp individual drills for improving players' attributes play in preseason games and compete in a regular game NFL season including playoffs and the Super Bowl The player has the option to play any game in the simulation including those involving other teams if they so desire or may simulate through the games as they choose Most versions of Madden give a player years with their franchise sometimes with an opportunity to apply for the Hall of Fame at the end of the simulation
Madden NFL was the first Madden to have a play editor arcade mode and the Madden Challenge The game was released on August for Microsoft Windows PlayStation Game Boy Nintendo and Classic Mac OS The cover athletes were former Raiders Coach John Madden and the Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders in the background This was the second Madden to have someone besides John Madden on the cover
Madden NFL featured a segment called Great Games where one would be put in a situation where they control one team and would have to win the game with a set amount of time If the player wins they unlock either a new team or a stadium Overall there were more than teams and over stadiums in Madden NFL Tennessee Titans running back Eddie George is the cover athlete
Madden NFL featured for the first time Create A Team where one would make a team and play with that team in either Play Now or Franchise mode It also featured Create A League mode but it never caught on Create A Team was not featured in Madden NFL and moving teams was first featured in Madden NFL called Stadium in the Franchise mode of the game Madden NFL was the nd highest selling game in Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper is the cover athlete
There are multiple modes of game play from a quick head to head game to running a team for a whole season or even multiple seasons Online play which was a new feature for Madden NFL in this version there are also mini camp challenges was only available for users of the PlayStation console Xbox console or a Microsoft Windows PC until early St Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk is the cover athlete
Also starting with Madden NFL EA Sports created the new Playmaker tool using the right analog joystick found on each of the adjustments previously unavailable in prior installments of the franchise One such adjustment includes the ability to switch which direction a running play was going without changing the formation Prior to the Playmaker tool the Player could only call one of four available hot routes With Playmaker and the use of the right thumb stick the player is given additional Hot Route options When the quarterback has the ball the Playmaker Tool can be used to make receivers alter their routes mid play When running the ball on offense the runner can control the direction in which the blocker is going Defensive alignment adjustments however were not available leading to obvious imbalance in favor of the Offensive player Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick is the cover athlete
In Madden NFL EA Sports ran a campaign with the Theme Fear the D emphasising their improvements on the other side of the ball In an attempt to re balance the players experience EA gave a Playmaker Tool to the defense Similar to the offensive Playmaker Tool the defensive Playmaker allows the player to make pre snap defensive adjustments EA Sports further utilized the right analog joystick on defense by creating the Hit Stick an option on defense that allows the controlled player to make big hits with a simple flick that increases the chances the ball carrier will fumble Also introduced for the first time is the Formation Shift This new feature allowed players to shift their formation in the pre snap audible menu without actually changing the play For example if you call a run play up the middle out of a goal line formation you could then call a formation shift and make your players spread out into a four wide receiver formation while still in the same running play The problem with this new function was that EA also added a fatigue penalty for the defense causing defensive players to get more tired each time there was a formation shift This led to players on offense calling multiple formation shifts each play making the defensive players too exhausted to keep up and force them to substitute out of the game until they are fully rested This led to more imbalance that could only be fixed by turning off fatigue Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis is the cover athlete
also added EA Sports Radio a fictional show that plays during the menu screen of Franchise mode to provide a greater sense of a storyline during gameplay It features Tony Bruno as the host who often interviews players and coaches about how the season is going and also has quiz questions in which fake listeners call in to make attempts at answering football related questions It included mock interviews of famous NFL players and coaches throughout the in game season Some fans have criticized EA Sports for not including new features to the 'programming' as the radio became stale after only two seasons in franchise mode but the feature drew acclaim for adding content to the Franchise menu Also added was the Newspaper where the player could look at National News from licensed USA Today and Licensed Local papers for almost each of the NFL teams Lastly also saw the introduction of multiple progressions during franchise mode Previously NFL players in Madden would only progress or regress at the end of each season Now at the end of Week and the game would use a program to progress players based on their performance in addition to end of season progression

EA also introduced the QB Vision feature in the installment With this feature a cone of spotlight emits from the quarterback during passing plays simulating his field of vision To make an accurate pass the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly The size of the quarterback's vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness and Passer Accuracy rating Brett Favre and Peyton Manning see nearly the entire field at once whereas an inexperienced quarterback such as J P Losman or Kyle Boller sees only a sliver of the field This feature also allows for bigger plays and more interceptions
Also EA sports added the Smart Route This means that when pressing a hot route to the corresponding receiver you put the analog stick down and the receiver will run to the first down and you can throw him the ball
While current gen Madden remained the same with the exception of a Smart Route and QB Vision this was also the first year Madden was released on the next gen Xbox It was completely stripped down almost every change made in the previous gen was wiped away

Voice commentary in Madden allows players or watchers to hear the game being called as if it were a real game on TV For early versions of the game this commentary was performed by Madden himself and his play by play partner Initially this was Pat Summerall his partner during their days at CBS and Fox from the early s to the early s until Summerall retired the role was then filled by Al Michaels John's broadcast partner on Monday Night Football and NBC Sunday Night Football For the first Madden games on the Xbox and PS they featured a generic EA Sports radio announcer doing play by play This started with Madden and ended with Madden Other versions of those games still featured Madden's commentary
Madden recorded thousands of lines for each Madden game Madden NFL was the last version to feature Madden's commentary albeit in a reduced role By that time he felt that reciting a script covering every single scenario in the game was boring and tedious—Madden recalled the long hours spent alone in the recording studio as the most difficult part of any part that I've ever had in the game and the least amount of fun—but said that in the decision to remove him from game commentary I feel that something is being taken away from me

Madden once better known for Ace Hardware commercials than football despite winning Super Bowl XI as the head coach for the Oakland Raiders is now better known for Madden NFL than as coach or broadcaster He received an estimated to million each year for his endorsement but describes himself as never a good player of Madden and prefers to watch others play Although Madden says that a computer is a helluva lot smarter than me he has influenced the series' design from the first game and since retiring from broadcasting and doing video game voice commentary in his participation in each Madden's development has increased
EA estimates that the series has five to seven million dedicated fans and an underground circuit of Madden cash tournaments exists Marshall Faulk in estimated that percent on up of NFL players are Madden players who play in the league with or against childhood heroes they once chose to play as in the game Players typically play as themselves regardless of their electronic counterparts' abilities and immediately check new releases of the game for changes in the more than ratings of their talent They often complain to Madden and EA about allegedly inaccurate ratings only Emmitt Smith has told him that the game rated him too high or ask for changes in their in game appearance Such complaints began as early as confusing the broadcaster who did not contribute the player statistics for that year's version due to lack of time
Coaches and players at all levels of the sport such as K J Wright and Joe Brady say that Madden has influenced them and recommend the game to learn football strategy and tactics practice plays and assignments and simulate opponents Teddy Bridgewater who has used Madden to practice plays since college at Louisville created Brady's playbook in the game to help his backups P J Walker and Will Grier Young players who grew up with Madden reportedly understand plays better than those who did not Wired in wrote that the growing use of rookie quarterbacks and the spread offense was influenced by the game stating that the sport is being taken over by something you might call Maddenball — a sophisticated high scoring pass happy youth driven phenomenon When the Denver Broncos' Brandon Stokley in burned six seconds of the clock with an unusual run before scoring the winning touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals Madden designers—who were watching the game with Madden—immediately recognized his action as what happens in the game
Football broadcasts on television use Madden like visual cues to more closely resemble it and the NFL considers the series its rd franchise because each week during the season EA Sports receives the same searchable film database of every play that each of the league's teams do The game is the NFL's second largest source of licensing revenue after apparel and an important part of the league's recruitment of children as new football fans
The Pro Football Hall of Fame in opened an interactive exhibit in which visitors play Madden three years before its namesake's induction Museum of the Moving Image in New York City in early celebrated Madden NFL's th anniversary with an exhibit including five playable versions of the game

Since Madden NFL on the seventh generation of consoles Electronic Arts has received criticism for not evolving the Madden games for next generation consoles while graphics have certainly improved certain popular features from older games in the series have been removed for unknown reasons then some come back in newer iterations slightly altered and advertised as a new feature Many glitches and poor balancing of the meta have been seen in the games and some gamers and reviewers think there has been little to no improvement with recent iterations of Madden Some reviews of recent Madden games have criticized the series for not evolving and not making changes to the series and saying older iterations of the series are better games EA has also received criticism not improving Franchise Mode which was one of its flagship modes and instead only focusing on Ultimate Team its team building card game mode introduced in Madden NFL which gradually started to get monetized throughout the s The trailer release for Madden NFL on June was widely panned by gamers and reviewers as seen in its like to dislike ratio and its user review score on Metacritic are at an all time low sitting at as of January
Prior to every annual installment of the Madden NFL series primarily featured Madden on its cover In Electronic Arts selected Garrison Hearst to appear on the PAL version's cover although Madden remained on the North American release Beginning with Eddie George in the series has since featured one of the league's top players on every annual installment despite Madden's opposition While appearing on the cover has become an honor akin to appearing on the Wheaties box much like the Sports Illustrated Cover Jinx certain players who appeared on Madden video game box art have experienced a decline in performance or an injury This run of misfortune for Madden cover athletes has been dubbed the Madden curse
When asked about the Madden Curse EA Sports' Chris Erb said I don't know that we believe in the curse The players don't believe in the curse Running back Shaun Alexander who was featured on the cover of Madden NFL commented Do you want to be hurt and on the cover or just hurt Madden NFL cover athlete Vince Young expressed skepticism while Madden NFL cover athlete Peyton Hillis attributed his subpar season that year to the curse
The perception that the curse is real has resulted in fans lobbying for their favorite players not to be on the cover such as fans of LaDainian Tomlinson who were strongly opposed to EA Sports' initial decision to feature him on the cover of Madden NFL so much that a fan created SaveLTfromMaddencom to voice their disdain Tomlinson declined the offer but later said it was solely due to contract negotiations Starting with Madden NFL EA has allowed fans to choose their favorite player for the cover However EA believes that many fans vote against their favorite player to avoid the curse It has become so prominent that bookmakers create odds on how likely an injury will occur to the player appearing on the cover
The injuries that Madden cover athletes experience can be attributed to the physical nature of football Critics of the curse also note that several cover athletes had successful seasons when they appeared on the cover such as Madden NFL 's Calvin Johnson who set the single season record for receiving yards Madden NFL 's Tom Brady who was named MVP and Madden NFL 's Patrick Mahomes who won Super Bowl LIV
In December EA announced plans to develop a comedy film based on the Madden curse However EA Entertainment executive Pat O'Brien stated in October that EA is not working on a Madden curse movie
