madden nfl known as john madden football until is an american football video game series developed by ea tiburon for ea sports
it is named after pro football hall of fame coach and commentator john madden and sold more than million copies by
it is also the only officially licensed national football league nfl video game series and it has influenced many players and coaches of the physical sport
among the series features are detailed playbooks and player statistics and voice commentary in the style of a real nfl television broadcast
as of the franchise has generated over billion in sales
electronic arts ea founder trip hawkins conceived the series and approached madden in for his endorsement and expertise
because of madden s insistence that the game be as realistic as possible the first version of john madden football did not appear until
ea has released annual versions since and the series name changed to madden nfl in after ea acquired the rights to use nfl teams and players
trip hawkins created a clone of the strat o matic paper and dice based football simulation game as a teenager
the game was unsuccessful due to its complexity and he hoped to one day delegate its rules to a computer
at harvard college where hawkins played football for the crimson he wrote a football simulation for the pdp minicomputer which he later said predicted that the miami dolphins would defeat the minnesota vikings actually in the super bowl
after founding electronic arts in the real reason that i founded it was because i wanted to make computerized versions of games like strat o matic hawkins later said the company began designing a microcomputer football game
hawkins first approached his favorite player joe montana to endorse the proposed game but the quarterback already had an endorsement deal with atari inc and his second choice cal coach joe kapp demanded royalties
in hawkins approached madden
he and game producer joe ybarra arranged a follow up meeting with the broadcaster during an amtrak train trip over two days because of madden s fear of flying
the ea executives promised that the proposed game would be a sophisticated football simulation and they asked the retired oakland raiders coach for his endorsement and expertise
madden knew nothing about computers beyond his telestrator but agreed he had taught a class at the university of california berkeley called football for fans and envisioned the program as a tool for teaching and testing plays
madden would continue to see the game as an educational tool
when asked in to describe madden nfl he called it a way for people to learn the game and participate in the game at a pretty sophisticated level hawkins and ybarra during the train trip learned football plays and strategies from madden from sunrise to midnight
ea likely expected madden to endorse the game without participating in its design
early plans envisioned six or seven players per team because of technical limitations but madden insisted on having players stating i m not putting my name on it if it s not real
ybarra who had played chess not football in high school became an expert on the subject through his work but found that players overwhelmed contemporary home computers
most projects that are as delayed as madden are canceled ybarra and developer robin antonick needed three years more than twice the length of the average development process
the project became known within the company as trip s folly and madden who had received advance against royalties that ea s outside auditors advised to write off because it would never be recouped believed at times that ea had given up
the company hired bethesda softworks to finish the game but this only got them partway to their goal
while ea used many of its designs including contributions to their physics engine within a year bethesda stopped working on madden and sued ea over ea s failure to publish new versions of bethesda s gridiron football game
this added to the delay
after a final development push john madden football debuted in for the apple ii series of computers
hawkins and an exhausted ybarra all my memories are of pain could move on to other projects
contracted to provide plays madden gave ea the raiders playbook and ea hired san francisco chronicle writer frank cooney who had designed his own figurine football game with numerical skill ratings
although the company could not yet legally use nfl teams or players names cooney obtained real plays from nfl teams
the back of the box called the game the first real football simulation and quoted madden hey if there aren t players it isn t real football documentation included diagrams of dozens of offensive and defensive plays with madden s commentary on coaching strategies and philosophy
the game sold moderately well but given the sophisticated playbook its interface was complex and madden s insistence on players caused the game to run slowly
during this period madden turned down the opportunity to buy an unlimited number of options for ea stock in its initial public offering a decision he later called the dumbest thing i ever did in my life
in early ea hired park place productions to develop madden for the sega genesis video game console
park place had developed abc monday night football with arcade style action heavy game play and its madden also emphasized hyperreality compared to the computer version s focus on exact simulation
impressed with park place s work ea chose it for the genesis madden instead of completing an in house version by antonick
ea reverse engineered the console to sell the game without paying the standard to license fee per cartridge to sega then proposed a compromise of per cartridge and a million cap on the fee
the console maker agreed afraid that ea would sell its reverse engineered knowledge to other companies the agreement saved ea million over the next three years
as its own joe montana endorsed football game would miss the christmas shopping season sega asked ea to let it sell madden with the montana name
ea refused but offered an inferior alternative that lacked madden s d graphics and most of its plays
joe montana football sold well despite shipping after christmas and it remained popular after bluesky software took over development
john madden football for the genesis however became both the first hugely successful madden game selling copies when the company expected and the first killer app for ea and sega helping the console gain market share against the super nes
from to mega placed the game at in their monthly top mega drive games of all time
in ea producer richard hilleman brought in veteran sports game designer scott orr who had founded the mid s commodore game publisher gamestar and led the design of their best selling sports games
the team of orr and hilleman designed and led the development of what is today still recognizable as the modern madden
early versions of madden were created by external development studios such as bethesda visual concepts and stormfront studios
john madden football also featured the ambulance which would run over any players in its path
after visual concepts failed to deliver madden nfl for the new playstation in ea hired tiburon entertainment for madden nfl and later acquired the company centralizing development in house
it planned to release john madden football as its first sports based arcade game but the game was cancelled due to unenthusiastic reactions from play testers
ea s refusal to release madden and other sports titles for the dreamcast in contributed to the console s lack of success and sega s exit from the hardware market
by madden was the best selling sports video game franchise with more than eight million units sold up until then
in electronic arts added franchise mode to madden giving players the ability to play multiple seasons make off season draft picks and trade players
within franchise mode players take on the role of general manager and manage all personnel matters including contracts free agency draft picks and hiring and firing coaches
the player also acts as a head coach like character although there is a head coach figure in game choosing which players to play making substitutions running practices practicing gameplans etc
players may play with any of the nfl s franchises they can choose whether or not to have trade deadlines and salary caps and if they want to start their franchise with a round fantasy draft of all active nfl players
players can also upload created teams for use in the game
once in game players run training camp individual drills for improving players attributes play in preseason games and compete in a regular game nfl season including playoffs and the super bowl
the player has the option to play any game in the simulation including those involving other teams if they so desire or may simulate through the games as they choose
most versions of madden give a player years with their franchise sometimes with an opportunity to apply for the hall of fame at the end of the simulation
madden nfl was the first madden to have a play editor arcade mode and the madden challenge
the game was released on august for microsoft windows playstation game boy nintendo and classic mac os
the cover athletes were former raiders coach john madden and the detroit lions running back barry sanders in the background
this was the second madden to have someone besides john madden on the cover
madden nfl featured a segment called great games where one would be put in a situation where they control one team and would have to win the game with a set amount of time
if the player wins they unlock either a new team or a stadium
overall there were more than teams and over stadiums in madden nfl
tennessee titans running back eddie george is the cover athlete
madden nfl featured for the first time create a team where one would make a team and play with that team in either play now or franchise mode
it also featured create a league mode but it never caught on
create a team was not featured in madden nfl and moving teams was first featured in madden nfl called stadium in the franchise mode of the game
madden nfl was the nd highest selling game in
minnesota vikings quarterback daunte culpepper is the cover athlete
there are multiple modes of game play from a quick head to head game to running a team for a whole season or even multiple seasons
online play which was a new feature for madden nfl in this version there are also mini camp challenges was only available for users of the playstation console xbox console or a microsoft windows pc until early
louis rams running back marshall faulk is the cover athlete
also starting with madden nfl ea sports created the new playmaker tool using the right analog joystick found on each of the adjustments previously unavailable in prior installments of the franchise
one such adjustment includes the ability to switch which direction a running play was going without changing the formation
prior to the playmaker tool the player could only call one of four available hot routes with playmaker and the use of the right thumb stick the player is given additional hot route options
when the quarterback has the ball the playmaker tool can be used to make receivers alter their routes mid play
when running the ball on offense the runner can control the direction in which the blocker is going
defensive alignment adjustments however were not available leading to obvious imbalance in favor of the offensive player
atlanta falcons quarterback michael vick is the cover athlete
in madden nfl ea sports ran a campaign with the theme fear the d emphasising their improvements on the other side of the ball in an attempt to re balance the players experience ea gave a playmaker tool to the defense
similar to the offensive playmaker tool the defensive playmaker allows the player to make pre snap defensive adjustments
ea sports further utilized the right analog joystick on defense by creating the hit stick an option on defense that allows the controlled player to make big hits with a simple flick that increases the chances the ball carrier will fumble
also introduced for the first time is the formation shift this new feature allowed players to shift their formation in the pre snap audible menu without actually changing the play
for example if you call a run play up the middle out of a goal line formation you could then call a formation shift and make your players spread out into a four wide receiver formation while still in the same running play
the problem with this new function was that ea also added a fatigue penalty for the defense causing defensive players to get more tired each time there was a formation shift
this led to players on offense calling multiple formation shifts each play making the defensive players too exhausted to keep up and force them to substitute out of the game until they are fully rested
this led to more imbalance that could only be fixed by turning off fatigue
baltimore ravens linebacker ray lewis is the cover athlete
also added ea sports radio a fictional show that plays during the menu screen of franchise mode to provide a greater sense of a storyline during gameplay
it features tony bruno as the host who often interviews players and coaches about how the season is going and also has quiz questions in which fake listeners call in to make attempts at answering football related questions
it included mock interviews of famous nfl players and coaches throughout the in game season
some fans have criticized ea sports for not including new features to the programming as the radio became stale after only two seasons in franchise mode but the feature drew acclaim for adding content to the franchise menu
also added was the newspaper where the player could look at national news from licensed usa today and licensed local papers for almost each of the nfl teams
lastly also saw the introduction of multiple progressions during franchise mode
previously nfl players in madden would only progress or regress at the end of each season
now at the end of week and the game would use a program to progress players based on their performance in addition to end of season progression
in madden nfl the truck stick was introduced
this feature allows the offensive player to lower his shoulder and break a tackle or back juke to avoid one
another new feature is the superstar mode which allows the player to take control of a rookie and progress through his career
this includes an iq test interviews workouts the nfl draft hiring an agent and other aspects of a superstar s life
philadelphia eagles quarterback donovan mcnabb is the cover athlete
ea also introduced the qb vision feature in the installment
with this feature a cone of spotlight emits from the quarterback during passing plays simulating his field of vision
to make an accurate pass the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision
passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly
the size of the quarterback s vision cone is directly correlated to his awareness and passer accuracy rating brett favre and peyton manning see nearly the entire field at once whereas an inexperienced quarterback such as j
losman or kyle boller sees only a sliver of the field
this feature also allows for bigger plays and more interceptions
also ea sports added the smart route
this means that when pressing a hot route to the corresponding receiver you put the analog stick down and the receiver will run to the first down and you can throw him the ball
while current gen madden remained the same with the exception of a smart route and qb vision this was also the first year madden was released on the next gen xbox
it was completely stripped down almost every change made in the previous gen was wiped away
this is an arcade game developed by global vr and released in
the game comes in standard and deluxe cabinets
it can be played with up to four players and includes five game modes exhibition training tournament competition and career
it features rosters from the season
in madden nfl ea introduced lead blocker controls which allow users to control blockers during running plays
in addition ea redefined the truck stick into the highlight stick
with the highlight stick users can have their running backs perform different running moves and combos instead of just bowling over defenders
truck stick features still exist for bigger backs but not for smaller backs who would never realistically use them anyway
instead more agile backs perform acrobatic ducks and dodges to avoid tackles
seattle seahawks running back shaun alexander is the cover athlete
this game is the sequel to ea sports madden nfl football
like the original it was also developed by global vr
it was released in only in arcades
this version adds qb vision the hit stick and the truck stick
the rosters are also updated for the season

until the madden series did not have official licenses from the national football league nfl or national football league players association nflpa
madden nfl was the first game in the series to include real nfl teams and madden nfl added an nflpa license for real players through the national football league players incorporated nflpi
the licenses restrict ea from including certain content in current madden games such as the humorous ambulance that picks up injured players in s john madden football ii
the nfl coaches association sold the rights to have nfl coaches names appear in the madden nfl games madden nfl was the first game in the series to feature this license
neither new england patriots coach bill belichick nor bill parcells appeared in the game as they are not members of the nfl coaches association
likewise non nflpa players such as thurman thomas during his playing career do not appear in the game instead being replaced with generic placeholders
in ea signed an exclusive licensing rights agreement through with the nfl and the nflpa to give the company the exclusive rights to use the nfl s teams stadiums and players in a video game
mike mika who was working on nfl k described the agreement as like a nuclear bomb going off in the game industry canceling rival nfl projects
this exclusive license prevents other rival video game developers from producing official nfl video games
the deal reportedly worth million and later extended to has been widely criticized
some competitors such as the blitz the league series have elected to continue seeking to distinguish themselves through innovative gameplay while others such as the nfl k series have ceased production
in k sports released all pro football k which used former nfl stars
in k gained the rights for non simulation football game experiences from the nfl
the deal is said to not impact madden which will remain the only simulation football game
in the nfl extended its exclusive rights with ea which were due to expire in which changed to until for a reported billion with a provision for an additional year of exclusivity if ea hits revenue targets
in august ea sports debuted nfl head coach which utilized the madden engine to create a football management simulation
the game was criticized as buggy and unrealistic
ea tiburon rebuilt the game from the ground up addressing flaws and creating a proprietary engine over the course of three years
nfl head coach was released on august bundled with the special edition of madden nfl and as a standalone game on september
madden nfl social was an early version of madden nfl mobile for facebook and ios that was released november and shut down september
released on november the game is on and takes the best players from each of the nfl teams

the game is very similar to the madden ultimate team mut game mode and the game is currently on its th season
madden nfl football was released as a launch title for the nintendo ds on march
voice commentary in madden allows players or watchers to hear the game being called as if it were a real game on tv
for early versions of the game this commentary was performed by madden himself and his play by play partner
initially this was pat summerall his partner during their days at cbs and fox from the early s to the early s until summerall retired the role was then filled by al michaels john s broadcast partner on monday night football and nbc sunday night football
for the first madden games on the xbox and ps they featured a generic ea sports radio announcer doing play by play
this started with madden and ended with madden
other versions of those games still featured madden s commentary
madden recorded thousands of lines for each madden game
madden nfl was the last version to feature madden s commentary albeit in a reduced role
by that time he felt that reciting a script covering every single scenario in the game was boring and tedious madden recalled the long hours spent alone in the recording studio as the most difficult part of any part that i ve ever had in the game and the least amount of fun but said that in the decision to remove him from game commentary i feel that something is being taken away from me
madden and michaels were replaced by cris collinsworth as color commentator and tom hammond on play by play in madden nfl and madden nfl
gus johnson replaced hammond in madden nfl and madden nfl with collinsworth handling color commentary in both games
madden nfl marked the debut of real life announcing team jim nantz and phil simms including them appearing in an in booth cutscene before the game
nantz and simms stayed until madden nfl when they were replaced by fox s brandon gaudin and charles davis for madden nfl
nantz continued to work as the primary play by play announcer for cbs while simms later left the cbs broadcast booth to work on the nfl today
gaudin and davis returned to the studio throughout the nfl season to add new commentary relevant to each week of the season
in addition madden nfl and madden nfl were also released in spanish featuring espn deportes announcer lvaro mart n providing both play by play and analysis
as of electronic arts has sold more than million copies of madden nfl and more than five million in one year for more than billion in total sales
at ea tiburon in orlando florida a team of developers and more than game testers works on each new game in the series which as of contains more than million lines of source code
madden once better known for ace hardware commercials than football despite winning super bowl xi as the head coach for the oakland raiders is now better known for madden nfl than as coach or broadcaster
he received an estimated to million each year for his endorsement but describes himself as never a good player of madden and prefers to watch others play
although madden says that a computer is a helluva lot smarter than me he has influenced the series design from the first game and since retiring from broadcasting and doing video game voice commentary in his participation in each madden s development has increased
ea estimates that the series has five to seven million dedicated fans and an underground circuit of madden cash tournaments exists
marshall faulk in estimated that percent on up of nfl players are madden players who play in the league with or against childhood heroes they once chose to play as in the game
players typically play as themselves regardless of their electronic counterparts abilities and immediately check new releases of the game for changes in the more than ratings of their talent
they often complain to madden and ea about allegedly inaccurate ratings only emmitt smith has told him that the game rated him too high or ask for changes in their in game appearance
such complaints began as early as confusing the broadcaster who did not contribute the player statistics for that year s version due to lack of time
coaches and players at all levels of the sport such as k
wright and joe brady say that madden has influenced them and recommend the game to learn football strategy and tactics practice plays and assignments and simulate opponents
teddy bridgewater who has used madden to practice plays since college at louisville created brady s playbook in the game to help his backups p
walker and will grier
young players who grew up with madden reportedly understand plays better than those who did not
wired in wrote that the growing use of rookie quarterbacks and the spread offense was influenced by the game stating that the sport is being taken over by something you might call maddenball a sophisticated high scoring pass happy youth driven phenomenon
when the denver broncos brandon stokley in burned six seconds of the clock with an unusual run before scoring the winning touchdown against the cincinnati bengals madden designers who were watching the game with madden immediately recognized his action as what happens in the game
football broadcasts on television use madden like visual cues to more closely resemble it and the nfl considers the series its rd franchise because each week during the season ea sports receives the same searchable film database of every play that each of the league s teams do
the game is the nfl s second largest source of licensing revenue after apparel and an important part of the league s recruitment of children as new football fans
the pro football hall of fame in opened an interactive exhibit in which visitors play madden three years before its namesake s induction
museum of the moving image in new york city in early celebrated madden nfl s th anniversary with an exhibit including five playable versions of the game
in a similar approach used by the automobile industry until madden nfl the madden series has always historically been numbered one year later than the year in which it is released
however the season it represents is the year in which the game is released thus madden nfl was actually released in and is modeled after the nfl season
in next generation listed the genesis installments of the series collectively as number on their top games of all time calling them one of the best two player games of all time the game that reinvented ea and along with sonic the hedgehog the game that launched sega s bit assault on nintendo
during the mid s the series came under increasing criticism for its exploitable ai in single player mode as certain plays would consistently trounce ai controlled teams and came to be regarded as primarily a multiplayer experience
on august a mass shooting occurred at an esports tournament in jacksonville florida that was a qualification event for the madden nfl championship series playing madden nfl
the incident was live streamed on twitch and shots can be heard in the streaming coverage
people including the suspect were killed and at least people were injured
one victim was not hurt by gunfire
since madden nfl on the seventh generation of consoles electronic arts has received criticism for not evolving the madden games for next generation consoles while graphics have certainly improved certain popular features from older games in the series have been removed for unknown reasons then some come back in newer iterations slightly altered and advertised as a new feature
many glitches and poor balancing of the meta have been seen in the games and some gamers and reviewers think there has been little to no improvement with recent iterations of madden
some reviews of recent madden games have criticized the series for not evolving and not making changes to the series and saying older iterations of the series are better games
ea has also received criticism not improving franchise mode which was one of its flagship modes and instead only focusing on ultimate team its team building card game mode introduced in madden nfl which gradually started to get monetized throughout the s
the trailer release for madden nfl on june was widely panned by gamers and reviewers as seen in its like to dislike ratio and its user review score on metacritic are at an all time low sitting at as of january
prior to every annual installment of the madden nfl series primarily featured madden on its cover
in electronic arts selected garrison hearst to appear on the pal version s cover although madden remained on the north american release
beginning with eddie george in the series has since featured one of the league s top players on every annual installment despite madden s opposition
while appearing on the cover has become an honor akin to appearing on the wheaties box much like the sports illustrated cover jinx certain players who appeared on madden video game box art have experienced a decline in performance or an injury
this run of misfortune for madden cover athletes has been dubbed the madden curse
when asked about the madden curse ea sports chris erb said i don t know that we believe in the curse
the players don t believe in the curse running back shaun alexander who was featured on the cover of madden nfl commented do you want to be hurt and on the cover or just hurt madden nfl cover athlete vince young expressed skepticism while madden nfl cover athlete peyton hillis attributed his subpar season that year to the curse
the perception that the curse is real has resulted in fans lobbying for their favorite players not to be on the cover such as fans of ladainian tomlinson who were strongly opposed to ea sports initial decision to feature him on the cover of madden nfl so much that a fan created saveltfrommadden com to voice their disdain
tomlinson declined the offer but later said it was solely due to contract negotiations
starting with madden nfl ea has allowed fans to choose their favorite player for the cover
however ea believes that many fans vote against their favorite player to avoid the curse
it has become so prominent that bookmakers create odds on how likely an injury will occur to the player appearing on the cover
the injuries that madden cover athletes experience can be attributed to the physical nature of football
critics of the curse also note that several cover athletes had successful seasons when they appeared on the cover such as madden nfl s calvin johnson who set the single season record for receiving yards madden nfl s tom brady who was named mvp and madden nfl s patrick mahomes who won super bowl liv
in december ea announced plans to develop a comedy film based on the madden curse
however ea entertainment executive pat o brien stated in october that ea is not working on a madden curse movie
the madden bowl is a single elimination tournament held on the most current edition of madden nfl
it has been held since during super bowl weekend in the host city and in the past participation included nfl players and celebrities
the madden bowl s participation has changed over the years from being an event held with athletes musicians and celebrities to become an event where only nfl players who are invited to participate get a chance to play
participants in the madden bowl are free to choose whichever team they like
winners receive a madden bowl trophy and recognition in the upcoming madden video game
the madden bowl held during the weekend of super bowl xl in detroit was televised on espn and premiered in april
concurrently espn also hosted a separate series of competitions called madden nation which was a reality television show that chronicled a cross country trip to crown the best madden player in the united states and aired from to
from to the madden bowl competition utilizes the new online team play feature included in madden nfl
