In mathematics any vector space
has a corresponding dual vector space or just dual space for short consisting of all linear forms on
together with the vector space structure of pointwise addition and scalar multiplication by constants
The dual space as defined above is defined for all vector spaces and to avoid ambiguity may also be called the algebraic dual space
When defined for a topological vector space there is a subspace of the dual space corresponding to continuous linear functionals called the continuous dual space
Dual vector spaces find application in many branches of mathematics that use vector spaces such as in tensor analysis with finite dimensional vector spaces
When applied to vector spaces of functions which are typically infinite dimensional dual spaces are used to describe measures distributions and Hilbert spaces Consequently the dual space is an important concept in functional analysis
Early terms for dual include polarer Raum Hahn espace conjugu adjoint space Alaoglu and transponierter Raum Schauder and Banach The term dual is due to Bourbaki
is defined as the set of all linear maps
displaystyle varphi V to F
linear functionals Since linear maps are vector space homomorphisms the dual space may be denoted
itself becomes a vector space over
when equipped with an addition and scalar multiplication satisfying

displaystyle varphi psi in V
Elements of the algebraic dual space
are sometimes called covectors or one forms
The pairing of a functional
is sometimes denoted by a bracket
displaystyle varphi x x varphi
displaystyle varphi x langle x varphi rangle
This pairing defines a nondegenerate bilinear mapping
displaystyle langle cdot cdot rangle V times V to F
If V is finite dimensional then V has the same dimension as V Given a basis e en in V it is possible to construct a specific basis in V called the dual basis This dual basis is a set e e of linear functionals on V defined by the relation
displaystyle mathbf e i c mathbf e cdots c n mathbf e n c i quad i ldots n
for any choice of coefficients c F In particular letting in turn each one of those coefficients be equal to one and the other coefficients zero gives the system of equations
displaystyle mathbf e i mathbf e j delta j i
is the Kronecker delta symbol This property is referred to as bi orthogonality property
For example if V is R let its basis be chosen as e e The basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other Then e and e are one forms functions that map a vector to a scalar such that e e e e e e and e e Note The superscript here is the index not an exponent This system of equations can be expressed using matrix notation as
displaystyle begin bmatrix e e e e end bmatrix begin bmatrix e e e e end bmatrix begin bmatrix end bmatrix
Solving this equation shows the dual basis to be e e Because e and e are functionals they can be rewritten as e x y x and e x y x y In general when V is R if E e en is a matrix whose columns are the basis vectors and e e is a matrix whose columns are the dual basis vectors then
displaystyle E T hat E I n
where In is an identity matrix of order n The biorthogonality property of these two basis sets allows any point x V to be represented as
displaystyle mathbf x sum i langle mathbf x mathbf e i rangle mathbf e i sum i langle mathbf x mathbf e i rangle mathbf e i
even when the basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other Strictly speaking the above statement only makes sense once the inner product
displaystyle langle cdot cdot rangle
and the corresponding duality pairing are introduced as described below in Bilinear products and dual spaces
In particular R can be interpreted as the space of columns of n real numbers its dual space is typically written as the space of rows of n real numbers Such a row acts on R as a linear functional by ordinary matrix multiplication This is because a functional maps every n vector x into a real number y Then seeing this functional as a matrix M and x y as a n matrix and a matrix trivially a real number respectively if Mx y then by dimension reasons M must be a n matrix that is M must be a row vector
If V consists of the space of geometrical vectors in the plane then the level curves of an element of V form a family of parallel lines in V because the range is dimensional so that every point in the range is a multiple of any one nonzero element
So an element of V can be intuitively thought of as a particular family of parallel lines covering the plane To compute the value of a functional on a given vector it suffices to determine which of the lines the vector lies on Informally this counts how many lines the vector crosses
More generally if V is a vector space of any dimension then the level sets of a linear functional in V are parallel hyperplanes in V and the action of a linear functional on a vector can be visualized in terms of these hyperplanes
If V is not finite dimensional but has a basis e indexed by an infinite set A then the same construction as in the finite dimensional case yields linearly independent elements e A of the dual space but they will not form a basis
For instance the space R whose elements are those sequences of real numbers that contain only finitely many non zero entries which has a basis indexed by the natural numbers N for i N ei is the sequence consisting of all zeroes except in the i th position which is
The dual space of R is isomorphic to R the space of all sequences of real numbers each real sequence an defines a function where the element xn of R is sent to the number
displaystyle sum n a n x n
which is a finite sum because there are only finitely many nonzero xn The dimension of R is countably infinite whereas R does not have a countable basis
This observation generalizes to any infinite dimensional vector space V over any field F a choice of basis e A identifies V with the space F of functions f A F such that f f is nonzero for only finitely many A where such a function f is identified with the vector
displaystyle sum alpha in A f alpha mathbf e alpha
in V the sum is finite by the assumption on f and any v V may be written in this way by the definition of the basis
The dual space of V may then be identified with the space F of all functions from A to F a linear functional T on V is uniquely determined by the values T e it takes on the basis of V and any function A F with defines a linear functional T on V by
displaystyle T left sum alpha in A f alpha mathbf e alpha right sum alpha in A f alpha T e alpha sum alpha in A f alpha theta alpha
Again the sum is finite because f is nonzero for only finitely many
The set F may be identified essentially by definition with the direct sum of infinitely many copies of F viewed as a dimensional vector space over itself indexed by A i e there are linear isomorphisms
displaystyle V cong F A cong bigoplus alpha in A F
On the other hand F is again by definition the direct product of infinitely many copies of F indexed by A and so the identification
displaystyle V cong left bigoplus alpha in A F right cong prod alpha in A F cong prod alpha in A F cong F A
is a special case of a general result relating direct sums of modules to direct products
Considering cardinal numbers denoted here as absolute values one has thus for a F vector space V that has an infinite basis A
displaystyle V max F A V ast F A
It follows that if a vector space is not finite dimensional then the axiom of choice implies that the algebraic dual space is always of larger dimension as a cardinal number than the original vector space since if two bases have the same cardinality the spanned vector spaces have the same cardinality This is in contrast to the case of the continuous dual space discussed below which may be isomorphic to the original vector space even if the latter is infinite dimensional
If V is finite dimensional then V is isomorphic to V But there is in general no natural isomorphism between these two spaces Any bilinear form on V gives a mapping of V into its dual space via
displaystyle v mapsto langle v cdot rangle
where the right hand side is defined as the functional on V taking each w V to v w In other words the bilinear form determines a linear mapping
displaystyle Phi langle cdot cdot rangle V to V
displaystyle left Phi langle cdot cdot rangle v w right langle v w rangle
If the bilinear form is nondegenerate then this is an isomorphism onto a subspace of V
If V is finite dimensional then this is an isomorphism onto all of V Conversely any isomorphism
from V to a subspace of V resp all of V if V is finite dimensional defines a unique nondegenerate bilinear form
displaystyle langle cdot cdot rangle Phi
displaystyle langle v w rangle Phi Phi v w Phi v w
Thus there is a one to one correspondence between isomorphisms of V to a subspace of resp all of V and nondegenerate bilinear forms on V
If the vector space V is over the complex field then sometimes it is more natural to consider sesquilinear forms instead of bilinear forms
In that case a given sesquilinear form determines an isomorphism of V with the complex conjugate of the dual space
displaystyle Phi langle cdot cdot rangle V to overline V
The conjugate of the dual space
can be identified with the set of all additive complex valued functionals f V C such that
displaystyle f alpha v overline alpha f v
There is a natural homomorphism
displaystyle V Phi V to F Phi mathrm linear
displaystyle Psi v varphi varphi v
displaystyle v in V varphi in V
displaystyle mathrm ev v V to F
is the evaluation map defined by
displaystyle varphi mapsto varphi v
displaystyle Psi V to V
is defined as the map
displaystyle v mapsto mathrm ev v
is always injective it is an isomorphism if and only if
Indeed the isomorphism of a finite dimensional vector space with its double dual is an archetypal example of a natural isomorphism
Infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces are not a counterexample to this as they are isomorphic to their continuous double duals not to their algebraic double duals
If f V W is a linear map then the transpose or dual f W V is defined by
displaystyle f varphi varphi circ f
is called the pullback of
The following identity holds for all
displaystyle f varphi v varphi f v
where the bracket on the left is the natural pairing of V with its dual space and that on the right is the natural pairing of W with its dual This identity characterizes the transpose and is formally similar to the definition of the adjoint
The assignment f f produces an injective linear map between the space of linear operators from V to W and the space of linear operators from W to V this homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if W is finite dimensional
If V W then the space of linear maps is actually an algebra under composition of maps and the assignment is then an antihomomorphism of algebras meaning that fg gf
In the language of category theory taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a contravariant functor from the category of vector spaces over F to itself
It is possible to identify f with f using the natural injection into the double dual
If the linear map f is represented by the matrix A with respect to two bases of V and W then f is represented by the transpose matrix A with respect to the dual bases of W and V hence the name
Alternatively as f is represented by A acting on the left on column vectors f is represented by the same matrix acting on the right on row vectors
These points of view are related by the canonical inner product on R which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors
Let S be a subset of V
The annihilator of S in V denoted here S is the collection of linear functionals f V such that f s for all s S
That is S consists of all linear functionals f V F such that the restriction to S vanishes f S
Within finite dimensional vector spaces the annihilator is dual to isomorphic to the orthogonal complement
The annihilator of a subset is itself a vector space
The annihilator of the zero vector is the whole dual space
and the annihilator of the whole space is just the zero covector
Furthermore the assignment of an annihilator to a subset of V reverses inclusions so that if S T V then
displaystyle subseteq T subseteq S subseteq V
If A and B are two subsets of V then
displaystyle A B subseteq A cap B
and equality holds provided V is finite dimensional If Ai is any family of subsets of V indexed by i belonging to some index set I then
displaystyle left bigcup i in I A i right bigcap i in I A i
In particular if A and B are subspaces of V then
displaystyle A B A cap B
If V is finite dimensional and W is a vector subspace then
after identifying W with its image in the second dual space under the double duality isomorphism V V In particular forming the annihilator is a Galois connection on the lattice of subsets of a finite dimensional vector space
If W is a subspace of V then the quotient space V W is a vector space in its own right and so has a dual By the first isomorphism theorem a functional f V F factors through V W if and only if W is in the kernel of f There is thus an isomorphism
displaystyle V W cong W
As a particular consequence if V is a direct sum of two subspaces A and B then V is a direct sum of A and B
When dealing with topological vector spaces the continuous linear functionals from the space into the base field
displaystyle mathbb F mathbb C
This gives rise to the notion of the continuous dual space or topological dual which is a linear subspace of the algebraic dual space
For any finite dimensional normed vector space or topological vector space such as Euclidean n space the continuous dual and the algebraic dual coincide
This is however false for any infinite dimensional normed space as shown by the example of discontinuous linear maps
Nevertheless in the theory of topological vector spaces the terms continuous dual space and topological dual space are often replaced by dual space
For a topological vector space
its continuous dual space or topological dual space or just dual space in the sense of the theory of topological vector spaces
is defined as the space of all continuous linear functionals
displaystyle varphi V to mathbb F
If X is a Hausdorff topological vector space TVS then the continuous dual space of X is identical to the continuous dual space of the completion of X
There is a standard construction for introducing a topology on the continuous dual
of a topological vector space
This gives the topology on
of uniform convergence on sets from
or what is the same thing the topology generated by seminorms of the form
displaystyle varphi A sup x in A varphi x
is a continuous linear functional on
This means that a net of functionals
displaystyle text for all A in mathcal A qquad varphi i varphi A sup x in A varphi i x varphi x underset i to infty longrightarrow
Usually but not necessarily the class
is supposed to satisfy the following conditions
displaystyle A in mathcal A
displaystyle text for all x in V quad text there exists some A in mathcal A quad text such that x in A
displaystyle A in mathcal A
displaystyle B in mathcal A
are contained in some set
displaystyle C in mathcal A
displaystyle text for all A B in mathcal A quad text there exists some C in mathcal A quad text such that A cup B subseteq C
is closed under the operation of multiplication by scalars
displaystyle text for all A in mathcal A quad text and all lambda in mathbb F quad text such that lambda cdot A in mathcal A
If these requirements are fulfilled then the corresponding topology on
is Hausdorff and the sets
displaystyle U A left varphi in V' quad varphi A right qquad text for A in mathcal A
Here are the three most important special cases
is the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets in
can be chosen as the class of all bounded subsets in
is a normed vector space for example a Banach space or a Hilbert space then the strong topology on
is normed in fact a Banach space if the field of scalars is complete with the norm
displaystyle varphi sup x leq varphi x
is the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets in
can be chosen as the class of all totally bounded subsets in
is the topology of uniform convergence on finite subsets in
can be chosen as the class of all finite subsets in
Each of these three choices of topology on
leads to a variant of reflexivity property for topological vector spaces
is endowed with the strong topology then the corresponding notion of reflexivity is the standard one the spaces reflexive in this sense are just called reflexive
is endowed with the stereotype dual topology then the corresponding reflexivity is presented in the theory of stereotype spaces the spaces reflexive in this sense are called stereotype
is endowed with the weak topology then the corresponding reflexivity is presented in the theory of dual pairs the spaces reflexive in this sense are arbitrary Hausdorff locally convex spaces with the weak topology Let p be a real number and consider the Banach space of all sequences a an for which
displaystyle mathbf a p left sum n infty a n p right frac p infty
Define the number q by p q Then the continuous dual of is naturally identified with given an element
displaystyle varphi in ell p '
the corresponding element of is the sequence
displaystyle varphi mathbf e n
denotes the sequence whose n th term is and all others are zero Conversely given an element a an the corresponding continuous linear functional
displaystyle varphi mathbf b sum n a n b n
for all b bn see H lder's inequality
In a similar manner the continuous dual of is naturally identified with the space of bounded sequences
Furthermore the continuous duals of the Banach spaces c consisting of all convergent sequences with the supremum norm and c the sequences converging to zero are both naturally identified with
By the Riesz representation theorem the continuous dual of a Hilbert space is again a Hilbert space which is anti isomorphic to the original space
This gives rise to the bra ket notation used by physicists in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
By the Riesz Markov Kakutani representation theorem the continuous dual of certain spaces of continuous functions can be described using measures
If T V W is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces then the continuous transpose T W V is defined by the same formula as before
displaystyle T' varphi varphi circ T quad varphi in W'
The resulting functional T is in V The assignment T T produces a linear map between the space of continuous linear maps from V to W and the space of linear maps from W to V
When T and U are composable continuous linear maps then
displaystyle U circ T ' T' circ U'
When V and W are normed spaces the norm of the transpose in L W V is equal to that of T in L V W
Several properties of transposition depend upon the Hahn Banach theorem
For example the bounded linear map T has dense range if and only if the transpose T is injective
When T is a compact linear map between two Banach spaces V and W then the transpose T is compact
This can be proved using the Arzel Ascoli theorem
When V is a Hilbert space there is an antilinear isomorphism iV from V onto its continuous dual V
For every bounded linear map T on V the transpose and the adjoint operators are linked by
displaystyle i V circ T T' circ i V
When T is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces V and W then the transpose T is continuous when W and V are equipped with compatible topologies for example when for X V and X W both duals X have the strong topology X X of uniform convergence on bounded sets of X or both have the weak topology X X of pointwise convergence on X
The transpose T is continuous from W W to V V or from W W to V V
Assume that W is a closed linear subspace of a normed space V and consider the annihilator of W in V
displaystyle W perp varphi in V' W subseteq ker varphi
Then the dual of the quotient V W can be identified with W and the dual of W can be identified with the quotient V W
Indeed let P denote the canonical surjection from V onto the quotient V W then the transpose P is an isometric isomorphism from V W into V with range equal to W
If j denotes the injection map from W into V then the kernel of the transpose j is the annihilator of W
displaystyle ker j' W perp
and it follows from the Hahn Banach theorem that j induces an isometric isomorphism
If the dual of a normed space V is separable then so is the space V itself
The converse is not true for example the space is separable but its dual is not
In analogy with the case of the algebraic double dual there is always a naturally defined continuous linear operator V V from a normed space V into its continuous double dual V defined by
displaystyle Psi x varphi varphi x quad x in V varphi in V'
As a consequence of the Hahn Banach theorem this map is in fact an isometry meaning x x for all x V
Normed spaces for which the map is a bijection are called reflexive
When V is a topological vector space then x can still be defined by the same formula for every x V however several difficulties arise
First when V is not locally convex the continuous dual may be equal to and the map trivial
However if V is Hausdorff and locally convex the map is injective from V to the algebraic dual V of the continuous dual again as a consequence of the Hahn Banach theorem
Second even in the locally convex setting several natural vector space topologies can be defined on the continuous dual V so that the continuous double dual V is not uniquely defined as a set Saying that maps from V to V or in other words that x is continuous on V for every x V is a reasonable minimal requirement on the topology of V namely that the evaluation mappings
displaystyle varphi in V' mapsto varphi x quad x in V
be continuous for the chosen topology on V Further there is still a choice of a topology on V and continuity of depends upon this choice
As a consequence defining reflexivity in this framework is more involved than in the normed case
