has a corresponding dual vector space or just dual space for short consisting of all linear forms on
together with the vector space structure of pointwise addition and scalar multiplication by constants
The dual space as defined above is defined for all vector spaces and to avoid ambiguity may also be called the algebraic dual space
When defined for a topological vector space there is a subspace of the dual space corresponding to continuous linear functionals called the continuous dual space
Dual vector spaces find application in many branches of mathematics that use vector spaces such as in tensor analysis with finite-dimensional vector spaces
When applied to vector spaces of functions which are typically infinite-dimensional dual spaces are used to describe measures distributions and Hilbert spaces
Consequently the dual space is an important concept in functional analysis
Early terms for dual include polarer Raum Hahn espace conjugu adjoint space Alaoglu and transponierter Raum Schauder and Banach
The term dual is due to Bourbaki
is defined as the set of all linear maps
Since linear maps are vector space homomorphisms the dual space may be denoted
when equipped with an addition and scalar multiplication satisfying
displaystyle beginalignedvarphi +psi x=varphi x+psi xavarphi x=aleftvarphi xrightendaligned
This pairing defines a nondegenerate bilinear mapping
displaystyle langle cdot cdot rangle Vtimes Vto F
If V is finite-dimensional then V has the same dimension as V
Given a basis e en in V it is possible to construct a specific basis in V called the dual basis
This dual basis is a set e e of linear functionals on V defined by the relation
displaystyle mathbf e icmathbf e +cdots +cnmathbf e n=ciquad i=ldots n
for any choice of coefficients c ∈ F
In particular letting in turn each one of those coefficients be equal to one and the other coefficients zero gives the system of equations
displaystyle mathbf e imathbf e j=delta ji
This property is referred to as bi-orthogonality property
For example if V is R let its basis be chosen as e = e =
The basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other
Then e and e are one-forms functions that map a vector to a scalar such that ee = ee = ee = and ee =
Note The superscript here is the index not an exponent This system of equations can be expressed using matrix notation as
Solving this equation shows the dual basis to be e = e = −
Because e and e are functionals they can be rewritten as ex y = x and ex y = −x + y
In general when V is R if E = e en is a matrix whose columns are the basis vectors and = e e is a matrix whose columns are the dual basis vectors then
where In is an identity matrix of order n
The biorthogonality property of these two basis sets allows any point x ∈ V to be represented as
displaystyle mathbf x =sum ilangle mathbf x mathbf e irangle mathbf e i=sum ilangle mathbf x mathbf e irangle mathbf e i
even when the basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other
Strictly speaking the above statement only makes sense once the inner product
and the corresponding duality pairing are introduced as described below in § Bilinear products and dual spaces
In particular R can be interpreted as the space of columns of n real numbers its dual space is typically written as the space of rows of n real numbers
Such a row acts on R as a linear functional by ordinary matrix multiplication
This is because a functional maps every n-vector x into a real number y
Then seeing this functional as a matrix M and x y as a n × matrix and a × matrix trivially a real number respectively if Mx = y then by dimension reasons M must be a × n matrix that is M must be a row vector
If V consists of the space of geometrical vectors in the plane then the level curves of an element of V form a family of parallel lines in V because the range is -dimensional so that every point in the range is a multiple of any one nonzero element
So an element of V can be intuitively thought of as a particular family of parallel lines covering the plane
To compute the value of a functional on a given vector it suffices to determine which of the lines the vector lies on
Informally this counts how many lines the vector crosses
More generally if V is a vector space of any dimension then the level sets of a linear functional in V are parallel hyperplanes in V and the action of a linear functional on a vector can be visualized in terms of these hyperplanes
If V is not finite-dimensional but has a basis eα indexed by an infinite set A then the same construction as in the finite-dimensional case yields linearly independent elements e α ∈ A of the dual space but they will not form a basis
For instance the space R whose elements are those sequences of real numbers that contain only finitely many non-zero entries which has a basis indexed by the natural numbers N for i ∈ N ei is the sequence consisting of all zeroes except in the i-th position which is
The dual space of R is isomorphic to R the space of all sequences of real numbers each real sequence an defines a function where the element xn of R is sent to the number
which is a finite sum because there are only finitely many nonzero xn
The dimension of R is countably infinite whereas R does not have a countable basis
This observation generalizes to any infinite-dimensional vector space V over any field F a choice of basis eα α ∈ A identifies V with the space F of functions f A → F such that fα = fα is nonzero for only finitely many α ∈ A where such a function f is identified with the vector
displaystyle sum alpha in Afalpha mathbf e alpha
in V the sum is finite by the assumption on f and any v ∈ V may be written in this way by the definition of the basis
The dual space of V may then be identified with the space F of all functions from A to F a linear functional T on V is uniquely determined by the values θα = Teα it takes on the basis of V and any function θ A → F with θα = θα defines a linear functional T on V by
displaystyle Tleftsum alpha in Afalpha mathbf e alpha right=sum alpha in Afalpha Tealpha =sum alpha in Afalpha theta alpha
Again the sum is finite because fα is nonzero for only finitely many α
The set F may be identified essentially by definition with the direct sum of infinitely many copies of F viewed as a -dimensional vector space over itself indexed by A ie
displaystyle Vcong FAcong bigoplus alpha in AF
On the other hand F is again by definition the direct product of infinitely many copies of F indexed by A and so the identification
displaystyle Vcong leftbigoplus alpha in AFrightcong prod alpha in AFcong prod alpha in AFcong FA
is a special case of a general result relating direct sums of modules to direct products
Considering cardinal numbers denoted here as absolute values one has thus for a F-vector space V that has an infinite basis A
It follows that if a vector space is not finite-dimensional then the axiom of choice implies that the algebraic dual space is always of larger dimension as a cardinal number than the original vector space since if two bases have the same cardinality the spanned vector spaces have the same cardinality
This is in contrast to the case of the continuous dual space discussed below which may be isomorphic to the original vector space even if the latter is infinite-dimensional
If V is finite-dimensional then V is isomorphic to V
But there is in general no natural isomorphism between these two spaces
Any bilinear form ⟨··⟩ on V gives a mapping of V into its dual space via
where the right hand side is defined as the functional on V taking each w ∈ V to ⟨v w⟩
In other words the bilinear form determines a linear mapping
displaystyle Phi langle cdot cdot rangle Vto V
displaystyle leftPhi langle cdot cdot rangle vwright=langle vwrangle
If the bilinear form is nondegenerate then this is an isomorphism onto a subspace of V
If V is finite-dimensional then this is an isomorphism onto all of V
from V to a subspace of V resp all of V if V is finite dimensional defines a unique nondegenerate bilinear form
displaystyle langle vwrangle Phi =Phi vw=Phi vw
Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of V to a subspace of resp all of V and nondegenerate bilinear forms on V
If the vector space V is over the complex field then sometimes it is more natural to consider sesquilinear forms instead of bilinear forms
In that case a given sesquilinear form ⟨··⟩ determines an isomorphism of V with the complex conjugate of the dual space
displaystyle Phi langle cdot cdot rangle Vto overline V
can be identified with the set of all additive complex-valued functionals f V → C such that
is always injective it is an isomorphism if and only if
Indeed the isomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space with its double dual is an archetypal example of a natural isomorphism
Infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not a counterexample to this as they are isomorphic to their continuous double duals not to their algebraic double duals
If f V → W is a linear map then the transpose or dual f W → V is defined by
where the bracket ·· on the left is the natural pairing of V with its dual space and that on the right is the natural pairing of W with its dual
This identity characterizes the transpose and is formally similar to the definition of the adjoint
The assignment f ↦ f produces an injective linear map between the space of linear operators from V to W and the space of linear operators from W to V this homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if W is finite-dimensional
If V = W then the space of linear maps is actually an algebra under composition of maps and the assignment is then an antihomomorphism of algebras meaning that fg = gf
In the language of category theory taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a contravariant functor from the category of vector spaces over F to itself
It is possible to identify f with f using the natural injection into the double dual
If the linear map f is represented by the matrix A with respect to two bases of V and W then f is represented by the transpose matrix A with respect to the dual bases of W and V hence the name
Alternatively as f is represented by A acting on the left on column vectors f is represented by the same matrix acting on the right on row vectors
These points of view are related by the canonical inner product on R which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors
Let S be a subset of V
The annihilator of S in V denoted here S is the collection of linear functionals f ∈ V such that f s = for all s ∈ S
That is S consists of all linear functionals f V → F such that the restriction to S vanishes fS =
Within finite dimensional vector spaces the annihilator is dual to isomorphic to the orthogonal complement
The annihilator of a subset is itself a vector space
The annihilator of the zero vector is the whole dual space
and the annihilator of the whole space is just the zero covector
Furthermore the assignment of an annihilator to a subset of V reverses inclusions so that if S ⊆ T ⊆ V then
If A and B are two subsets of V then
and equality holds provided V is finite-dimensional
If Ai is any family of subsets of V indexed by i belonging to some index set I then
In particular if A and B are subspaces of V then
If V is finite-dimensional and W is a vector subspace then
after identifying W with its image in the second dual space under the double duality isomorphism V ≈ V
In particular forming the annihilator is a Galois connection on the lattice of subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space
If W is a subspace of V then the quotient space VW is a vector space in its own right and so has a dual
By the first isomorphism theorem a functional f V → F factors through VW if and only if W is in the kernel of f
As a particular consequence if V is a direct sum of two subspaces A and B then V is a direct sum of A and B
When dealing with topological vector spaces the continuous linear functionals from the space into the base field
This gives rise to the notion of the continuous dual space or topological dual which is a linear subspace of the algebraic dual space
For any finite-dimensional normed vector space or topological vector space such as Euclidean n-space the continuous dual and the algebraic dual coincide
This is however false for any infinite-dimensional normed space as shown by the example of discontinuous linear maps
Nevertheless in the theory of topological vector spaces the terms continuous dual space and topological dual space are often replaced by dual space
its continuous dual space or topological dual space or just dual space in the sense of the theory of topological vector spaces
is defined as the space of all continuous linear functionals
If X is a Hausdorff topological vector space TVS then the continuous dual space of X is identical to the continuous dual space of the completion of X
There is a standard construction for introducing a topology on the continuous dual
or what is the same thing the topology generated by seminorms of the form
This means that a net of functionals
displaystyle text for all Ain mathcal Aqquad varphi i-varphi A=sup xin Avarphi ix-varphi xunderset ito infty longrightarrow
is supposed to satisfy the following conditions

If these requirements are fulfilled then the corresponding topology on

Here are the three most important special cases
is the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets in
can be chosen as the class of all bounded subsets in
is a normed vector space for example a Banach space or a Hilbert space then the strong topology on
is normed in fact a Banach space if the field of scalars is complete with the norm
is the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets in
can be chosen as the class of all totally bounded subsets in
is the topology of uniform convergence on finite subsets in
can be chosen as the class of all finite subsets in
Each of these three choices of topology on
leads to a variant of reflexivity property for topological vector spaces
is endowed with the strong topology then the corresponding notion of reflexivity is the standard one the spaces reflexive in this sense are just called reflexive
is endowed with the stereotype dual topology then the corresponding reflexivity is presented in the theory of stereotype spaces the spaces reflexive in this sense are called stereotype
is endowed with the weak topology then the corresponding reflexivity is presented in the theory of dual pairs the spaces reflexive in this sense are arbitrary Hausdorff locally convex spaces with the weak topologyLet p ∞ be a real number and consider the Banach space ℓ of all sequences a = an for which
displaystyle mathbf a p=leftsum n=infty anprightfrac pinfty
Define the number q by p + q =
Then the continuous dual of ℓ is naturally identified with ℓ given an element
the corresponding element of ℓ is the sequence
denotes the sequence whose n-th term is and all others are zero
Conversely given an element a = an ∈ ℓ the corresponding continuous linear functional
for all b = bn ∈ ℓ see Hölder's inequality
In a similar manner the continuous dual of ℓ is naturally identified with ℓ the space of bounded sequences
Furthermore the continuous duals of the Banach spaces c consisting of all convergent sequences with the supremum norm and c the sequences converging to zero are both naturally identified with ℓ
By the Riesz representation theorem the continuous dual of a Hilbert space is again a Hilbert space which is anti-isomorphic to the original space
This gives rise to the braket notation used by physicists in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
By the RieszMarkovKakutani representation theorem the continuous dual of certain spaces of continuous functions can be described using measures
If T V → W is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces then the continuous transpose T′ W′ → V′ is defined by the same formula as before
displaystyle T'varphi =varphi circ Tquad varphi in W'
The resulting functional T′φ is in V′
The assignment T → T′ produces a linear map between the space of continuous linear maps from V to W and the space of linear maps from W′ to V′
When T and U are composable continuous linear maps then
When V and W are normed spaces the norm of the transpose in LW′ V′ is equal to that of T in LV W
Several properties of transposition depend upon the HahnBanach theorem
For example the bounded linear map T has dense range if and only if the transpose T′ is injective
When T is a compact linear map between two Banach spaces V and W then the transpose T′ is compact
This can be proved using the ArzelAscoli theorem
When V is a Hilbert space there is an antilinear isomorphism iV from V onto its continuous dual V′
For every bounded linear map T on V the transpose and the adjoint operators are linked by
When T is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces V and W then the transpose T′ is continuous when W′ and V′ are equipped withcompatible topologies for example when for X = V and X = W both duals X′ have the strong topology βX′ X of uniform convergence on bounded sets of X or both have the weak-∗ topology σX′ X of pointwise convergence on X
The transpose T′ is continuous from βW′ W to βV′ V or from σW′ W to σV′ V
Assume that W is a closed linear subspace of a normed space V and consider the annihilator of W in V′
displaystyle Wperp =varphi in V'Wsubseteq ker varphi
Then the dual of the quotient V W can be identified with W and the dual of W can be identified with the quotient V′ W
Indeed let P denote the canonical surjection from V onto the quotient V W then the transpose P′ is an isometric isomorphism from V W ′ into V′ with range equal to W
If j denotes the injection map from W into V then the kernel of the transpose j′ is the annihilator of W
and it follows from the HahnBanach theorem that j′ induces an isometric isomorphism
If the dual of a normed space V is separable then so is the space V itself
The converse is not true for example the space ℓ is separable but its dual ℓ is not
In analogy with the case of the algebraic double dual there is always a naturally defined continuous linear operator Ψ V → V′′ from a normed space V into its continuous double dual V′′ defined by
displaystyle Psi xvarphi =varphi xquad xin V varphi in V'
As a consequence of the HahnBanach theorem this map is in fact an isometry meaning ‖ Ψx ‖ = ‖ x ‖ for all x ∈ V
Normed spaces for which the map Ψ is a bijection are called reflexive
When V is a topological vector space then Ψx can still be defined by the same formula for every x ∈ V however several difficulties arise
First when V is not locally convex the continuous dual may be equal to and the map Ψ trivial
However if V is Hausdorff and locally convex the map Ψ is injective from V to the algebraic dual V′ of the continuous dual again as a consequence of the HahnBanach theorem
Second even in the locally convex setting several natural vector space topologies can be defined on the continuous dual V′ so that the continuous double dual V′′ is not uniquely defined as a set
Saying that Ψ maps from V to V′′ or in other words that Ψx is continuous on V′ for every x ∈ V is a reasonable minimal requirement on the topology of V′ namely that the evaluation mappings
displaystyle varphi in V'mapsto varphi xquad xin V
be continuous for the chosen topology on V′
Further there is still a choice of a topology on V′′ and continuity of Ψ depends upon this choice
As a consequence defining reflexivity in this framework is more involved than in the normed case
