buddhism b d z m us bu d also known as dharmavinaya doctrines and disciplines and buddha dharma is an indian religion or philosophical tradition based on a series of original teachings attributed to gautama buddha
it originated in ancient india as a sramana tradition sometime between the th and th centuries bce spreading through much of asia
it is the world s fourth largest religion with over million followers or over of the global population known as buddhists
buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on the buddha s teachings born siddh rtha gautama in the th century bce and resulting interpreted philosophies
as expressed in the buddha s four noble truths the goal of buddhism is to overcome suffering du kha caused by desire and ignorance of reality s true nature including impermanence anicca and the non existence of the self anatt
most buddhist traditions emphasize transcending the individual self through the attainment of nirvana or by following the path of buddhahood ending the cycle of death and rebirth
buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various buddhist texts and their specific teachings and practices
widely observed practices include meditation observance of moral precepts monasticism taking refuge in the buddha the dharma and the sangha and the cultivation of the paramitas perfections or virtues
two major extant branches of buddhism are generally recognized by scholars therav da pali the school of the elders and mah y na sanskrit the great vehicle
theravada has a widespread following in sri lanka and southeast asia such as cambodia laos myanmar and thailand
mahayana which includes the traditions of zen pure land nichiren buddhism tiantai buddhism tendai and shingon is practiced prominently in nepal malaysia bhutan mainland china japan korea vietnam and taiwan
vajrayana a body of teachings attributed to indian adepts may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of mahayana buddhism
tibetan buddhism which preserves the vajrayana teachings of eighth century india is practised in the countries of the himalayan region mongolia and kalmykia
historically until the early nd millennium buddhism was also widely practised in afghanistan and it also had a foothold to some extent in other places including the philippines the maldives and uzbekistan
buddhism is an indian religion founded on the teachings of gautama buddha a rama a also called shakyamuni sage of the shakya s or the buddha the awakened one who lived c
th to th century bce
early texts have the buddha s family name as gautama pali gotama
the details of buddha s life are mentioned in many early buddhist texts but are inconsistent
his social background and life details are difficult to prove and the precise dates are uncertain
the evidence of the early texts suggests that siddhartha gautama was born in lumbini present day nepal and grew up in kapilavastu a town in the ganges plain near the modern nepal india border and that he spent his life in what is now modern bihar and uttar pradesh
some hagiographic legends state that his father was a king named suddhodana his mother was queen maya
scholars such as richard gombrich consider this a dubious claim because a combination of evidence suggests he was born in the shakya community which was governed by a small oligarchy or republic like council where there were no ranks but where seniority mattered instead
some of the stories about buddha his life his teachings and claims about the society he grew up in may have been invented and interpolated at a later time into the buddhist texts
according to early texts such as the pali ariyapariyesan sutta the discourse on the noble quest mn and its chinese parallel at m gautama was moved by the suffering dukkha of life and death and its endless repetition due to rebirth
he thus set out on a quest to find liberation from suffering also known as nirvana
early texts and biographies state that gautama first studied under two teachers of meditation namely ra k l ma sanskrit arada kalama and uddaka ramaputta sanskrit udraka ramaputra learning meditation and philosophy particularly the meditative attainment of the sphere of nothingness from the former and the sphere of neither perception nor non perception from the latter
finding these teachings to be insufficient to attain his goal he turned to the practice of severe asceticism which included a strict fasting regime and various forms of breath control
this too fell short of attaining his goal and then he turned to the meditative practice of dhyana
he famously sat in meditation under a ficus religiosa tree now called the bodhi tree in the town of bodh gaya and attained awakening bodhi
according to various early texts like the mah saccaka sutta and the sama aphala sutta on awakening the buddha gained insight into the workings of karma and his former lives as well as achieving the ending of the mental defilements asavas the ending of suffering and the end of rebirth in sa s ra
this event also brought certainty about the middle way as the right path of spiritual practice to end suffering
as a fully enlightened buddha he attracted followers and founded a sangha monastic order
he spent the rest of his life teaching the dharma he had discovered and then died achieving final nirvana at the age of in kushinagar india
buddha s teachings were propagated by his followers which in the last centuries of the st millennium bce became various buddhist schools of thought each with its own basket of texts containing different interpretations and authentic teachings of the buddha these over time evolved into many traditions of which the more well known and widespread in the modern era are theravada mahayana and vajrayana buddhism
the term buddhism is an occidental neologism commonly and rather roughly according to donald s
lopez jr used as a translation for the dharma of the buddha f ji o in chinese bukky in japanese nang pa sangs rgyas pa i chos in tibetan buddhadharma in sanskrit buddha sana in pali
the four truths express the basic orientation of buddhism we crave and cling to impermanent states and things which is dukkha incapable of satisfying and painful
this keeps us caught in sa s ra the endless cycle of repeated rebirth dukkha and dying again
but there is a way to liberation from this endless cycle to the state of nirvana namely following the noble eightfold path
the truth of dukkha is the basic insight that life in this mundane world with its clinging and craving to impermanent states and things is dukkha and unsatisfactory
dukkha can be translated as incapable of satisfying the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all conditioned phenomena or painful dukkha is most commonly translated as suffering but this is inaccurate since it refers not to episodic suffering but to the intrinsically unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things including pleasant but temporary experiences
we expect happiness from states and things which are impermanent and therefore cannot attain real happiness
in buddhism dukkha is one of the three marks of existence along with impermanence and anatt non self
buddhism like other major indian religions asserts that everything is impermanent anicca but unlike them also asserts that there is no permanent self or soul in living beings anatt
the ignorance or misperception avijj that anything is permanent or that there is self in any being is considered a wrong understanding and the primary source of clinging and dukkha
dukkha arises when we crave pali ta h and cling to these changing phenomena
the clinging and craving produces karma which ties us to samsara the cycle of death and rebirth
craving includes kama tanha craving for sense pleasures bhava tanha craving to continue the cycle of life and death including rebirth and vibhava tanha craving to not experience the world and painful feelings
dukkha ceases or can be confined when craving and clinging cease or are confined
this also means that no more karma is being produced and rebirth ends
cessation is nirvana blowing out and peace of mind
by following the buddhist path to moksha liberation one starts to disengage from craving and clinging to impermanent states and things
the term path is usually taken to mean the noble eightfold path but other versions of the path can also be found in the nikayas
the theravada tradition regards insight into the four truths as liberating in itself
sa s ra means wandering or world with the connotation of cyclic circuitous change
it refers to the theory of rebirth and cyclicality of all life matter existence a fundamental assumption of buddhism as with all major indian religions
samsara in buddhism is considered to be dukkha unsatisfactory and painful perpetuated by desire and avidya ignorance and the resulting karma
liberation from this cycle of existence nirvana has been the foundation and the most important historical justification of buddhism
buddhist texts assert that rebirth can occur in six realms of existence namely three good realms heavenly demi god human and three evil realms animal hungry ghosts hellish
samsara ends if a person attains nirvana the blowing out of the afflictions through insight into impermanence and non self
rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life each running from conception to death
in buddhist thought this rebirth does not involve a soul or any fixed substance
this is because the buddhist doctrine of anatt sanskrit an tman no self doctrine rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging eternal soul found in other religions
the buddhist traditions have traditionally disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after death
some buddhist traditions assert that no self doctrine means that there is no enduring self but there is avacya inexpressible personality pudgala which migrates from one life to another
the majority of buddhist traditions in contrast assert that vij na a person s consciousness though evolving exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes the rebirth process
the quality of one s rebirth depends on the merit or demerit gained by one s karma i e
actions as well as that accrued on one s behalf by a family member
buddhism also developed a complex cosmology to explain the various realms or planes of rebirth
each individual rebirth takes place within one of five realms according to theravadins or six according to other schools heavenly demi gods humans animals hungry ghosts and hellish
in east asian and tibetan buddhism rebirth is not instantaneous and there is an intermediate state tibetan bardo between one life and the next
the orthodox theravada position rejects the intermediate state and asserts that rebirth of a being is immediate
however there are passages in the samyutta nikaya of the pali canon that seem to lend support to the idea that the buddha taught about an intermediate stage between one life and the next
in buddhism karma from sanskrit action work drives sa s ra the endless cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being
good skilful deeds p li kusala and bad unskilful deeds p li akusala produce seeds in the unconscious receptacle laya that mature later either in this life or in a subsequent rebirth
the existence of karma is a core belief in buddhism as with all major indian religions and it implies neither fatalism nor that everything that happens to a person is caused by karma
a central aspect of buddhist theory of karma is that intent cetan matters and is essential to bring about a consequence or phala fruit or vip ka result
however good or bad karma accumulates even if there is no physical action and just having ill or good thoughts creates karmic seeds thus actions of body speech or mind all lead to karmic seeds
in the buddhist traditions life aspects affected by the law of karma in past and current births of a being include the form of rebirth realm of rebirth social class character and major circumstances of a lifetime
it operates like the laws of physics without external intervention on every being in all six realms of existence including human beings and gods
a notable aspect of the karma theory in buddhism is merit transfer
a person accumulates merit not only through intentions and ethical living but also is able to gain merit from others by exchanging goods and services such as through d na charity to monks or nuns
further a person can transfer one s own good karma to living family members and ancestors
the cessation of the kleshas and the attainment of nirvana nibb na with which the cycle of rebirth ends has been the primary and the soteriological goal of the buddhist path for monastic life since the time of the buddha
the term path is usually taken to mean the noble eightfold path but other versions of the path can also be found in the nikayas
in some passages in the pali canon a distinction is being made between right knowledge or insight samm a and right liberation or release samm vimutti as the means to attain cessation and liberation
nirvana literally means blowing out quenching becoming extinguished
in early buddhist texts it is the state of restraint and self control that leads to the blowing out and the ending of the cycles of sufferings associated with rebirths and redeaths
many later buddhist texts describe nirvana as identical with anatta with complete emptiness nothingness
in some texts the state is described with greater detail such as passing through the gate of emptiness sunyata realising that there is no soul or self in any living being then passing through the gate of signlessness animitta realising that nirvana cannot be perceived and finally passing through the gate of wishlessness apranihita realising that nirvana is the state of not even wishing for nirvana
the nirvana state has been described in buddhist texts partly in a manner similar to other indian religions as the state of complete liberation enlightenment highest happiness bliss fearlessness freedom permanence non dependent origination unfathomable and indescribable
it has also been described in part differently as a state of spiritual release marked by emptiness and realisation of non self
while buddhism considers the liberation from sa s ra as the ultimate spiritual goal in traditional practice the primary focus of a vast majority of lay buddhists has been to seek and accumulate merit through good deeds donations to monks and various buddhist rituals in order to gain better rebirths rather than nirvana
pratityasamutpada also called dependent arising or dependent origination is the buddhist theory to explain the nature and relations of being becoming existence and ultimate reality
buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent except the state of nirvana
all physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre existing states and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease
the dependent arisings have a causal conditioning and thus pratityasamutpada is the buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology not a creator god nor the ontological vedic concept called universal self brahman nor any other transcendent creative principle
however buddhist thought does not understand causality in terms of newtonian mechanics rather it understands it as conditioned arising
in buddhism dependent arising refers to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co originate a phenomenon within and across lifetimes such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of the realms of existence for another lifetime
buddhism applies the theory of dependent arising to explain origination of endless cycles of dukkha and rebirth through twelve nid nas or twelve links
it states that because avidy ignorance exists sa sk ras karmic formations exist because sa sk ras exist therefore vij na consciousness exists and in a similar manner it links n mar pa the sentient body a yatana our six senses spar a sensory stimulation vedan feeling ta h craving up d na grasping bhava becoming j ti birth and jar mara a old age death sorrow and pain
by breaking the circuitous links of the twelve nidanas buddhism asserts that liberation from these endless cycles of rebirth and dukkha can be attained
a related doctrine in buddhism is that of anatt pali or an tman sanskrit
it is the view that there is no unchanging permanent self soul or essence in phenomena
the buddha and buddhist philosophers who follow him such as vasubandhu and buddhaghosa generally argue for this view by analyzing the person through the schema of the five aggregates and then attempting to show that none of these five components of personality can be permanent or absolute
this can be seen in buddhist discourses such as the anattalakkhana sutta
emptiness or voidness skt nyat pali su at is a related concept with many different interpretations throughout the various buddhisms
in early buddhism it was commonly stated that all five aggregates are void rittaka hollow tucchaka coreless as raka for example as in the phe api pama sutta sn
similarly in theravada buddhism it often simply means that the five aggregates are empty of a self
emptiness is a central concept in mah y na buddhism especially in nagarjuna s madhyamaka school and in the praj p ramit sutras
in madhyamaka philosophy emptiness is the view which holds that all phenomena dharmas are without any svabhava literally own nature or self nature and are thus without any underlying essence and so are empty of being independent
this doctrine sought to refute the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time
all forms of buddhism revere and take spiritual refuge in the three jewels triratna buddha dharma and sangha
while all varieties of buddhism revere buddha and buddhahood they have different views on what these are
whatever that may be buddha is still central to all forms of buddhism
in theravada buddhism a buddha is someone who has become awake through their own efforts and insight
they have put an end to their cycle of rebirths and have ended all unwholesome mental states which lead to bad action and thus are morally perfected
while subject to the limitations of the human body in certain ways for example in the early texts the buddha suffers from backaches a buddha is said to be deep immeasurable hard to fathom as is the great ocean and also has immense psychic powers abhij
theravada generally sees gautama buddha the historical buddha sakyamuni as the only buddha of the current era
while he is no longer in this world he has left us the dharma teaching the vinaya discipline and the sangha community
there are also said to be two types of buddhas a sammasambuddha is also said to teach the dharma to others while a paccekabuddha solitary buddha does not teach
mah y na buddhism meanwhile has a vastly expanded cosmology with various buddhas and other holy beings aryas residing in different realms
mah y na texts not only revere numerous buddhas besides sakyamuni such as amitabha and vairocana but also see them as transcendental or supramundane lokuttara beings
mah y na buddhism holds that these other buddhas in other realms can be contacted and are able to benefit beings in this world
in mah y na a buddha is a kind of spiritual king a protector of all creatures with a lifetime that is countless of eons long rather than just a human teacher who has transcended the world after death
buddha sakyamuni s life and death on earth is then usually understood as a mere appearance or a manifestation skilfully projected into earthly life by a long enlightened transcendent being who is still available to teach the faithful through visionary experiences
dharma pali dhamma in buddhism refers to the buddha s teaching which includes all of the main ideas outlined above
while this teaching reflects the true nature of reality it is not a belief to be clung to but a pragmatic teaching to be put into practice
it is likened to a raft which is for crossing over to nirvana not for holding on to
it also refers to the universal law and cosmic order which that teaching both reveals and relies upon
it is an everlasting principle which applies to all beings and worlds
in that sense it is also the ultimate truth and reality about the universe it is thus the way that things really are
the dharma is the second of the three jewels which all buddhists take refuge in
all buddhas in all worlds in the past present and in the future are believed by buddhists to understand and teach the dharma
indeed it is part of what makes them a buddha that they do so
the third jewel which buddhists take refuge in is the sangha which refers to the monastic community of monks and nuns who follow gautama buddha s monastic discipline which was designed to shape the sangha as an ideal community with the optimum conditions for spiritual growth the sangha consists of those who have chosen to follow the buddha s ideal way of life which is one of celibate monastic renunciation with minimal material possessions such as an alms bowl and robes
the sangha is seen as important because they preserve and pass down buddha dharma
as gethin states the sangha lives the teaching preserves the teaching as scriptures and teaches the wider community
without the sangha there is no buddhism
the sangha also acts as a field of merit for laypersons allowing them to make spiritual merit or goodness by donating to the sangha and supporting them
in return they keep their duty to preserve and spread the dharma everywhere for the good of the world
the sangha is also supposed to follow the vinaya monastic rule of the buddha thereby serving as an spiritual example for the world and future generations
the vinaya rules also force the sangha to live in dependence on the rest of the lay community they must beg for food etc and thus draw the sangha into a relationship with the lay community
there is also a separate definition of sangha referring to those who have attained any stage of awakening whether or not they are monastics
this sangha is called the ryasa gha noble sangha
all forms of buddhism generally reveres these ryas pali ariya noble ones or holy ones who are spiritually attained beings
aryas have attained the fruits of the buddhist path
becoming an arya is a goal in most forms of buddhism
the ryasa gha includes holy beings such as bodhisattvas arhats and stream enterers
in early buddhism and in theravada buddhism an arhat literally meaning worthy is someone who reached the same awakening bodhi of a buddha by following the teaching of a buddha
they are seen as having ended rebirth and all the mental defilements
a bodhisattva a being bound for awakening meanwhile is simply a name for someone who is working towards awakening bodhi as a buddha
according to all the early buddhist schools as well as theravada to be considered a bodhisattva one has to have made a vow in front of a living buddha and also has to have received a confirmation of one s future buddhahood
in theravada the future buddha is called metteyya maitreya and he is revered as a bodhisattva currently working for future buddhahood
mah y na buddhism generally sees the attainment of the arhat as an inferior one since it is seen as being done only for the sake of individual liberation
it thus promotes the bodhisattva path as the highest and most worthwhile
while in mah y na anyone who has given rise to bodhicitta the wish to become a buddha that arises from a sense of compassion for all beings is considered a bodhisattva some of these holy beings such as maitreya and avalokiteshvara have reached very high levels of spiritual attainment and are seen as being very powerful supramundane beings who provide aid to countless beings through their advanced powers
mah y na buddhism also differs from theravada and the other schools of early buddhism in promoting several unique doctrines which are contained in mah y na sutras and philosophical treatises
one of these is the unique interpretation of emptiness and dependent origination found in the madhyamaka school
another very influential doctrine for mah y na is the main philosophical view of the yog c ra school variously termed vij aptim trat v da the doctrine that there are only ideas or mental impressions or vij nav da the doctrine of consciousness
according to mark siderits what classical yog c ra thinkers like vasubandhu had in mind is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions which may appear as external objects but there is actually no such thing outside the mind there are several interpretations of this main theory many scholars see it as a type of idealism others as a kind of phenomenology
another very influential concept unique to mah y na is that of buddha nature buddhadh tu or tathagata womb tath gatagarbha
buddha nature is a concept found in some st millennium ce buddhist texts such as the tath gatagarbha s tras
according to paul williams these sutras suggest that all sentient beings contain a tathagata as their essence core inner nature self
according to karl brunnholzl the earliest mahayana sutras that are based on and discuss the notion of tath gatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century for some the doctrine seems to conflict with the buddhist anatta doctrine non self leading scholars to posit that the tath gatagarbha sutras were written to promote buddhism to non buddhists
this can be seen in texts like the la k vat ra s tra which state that buddha nature is taught to help those who have fear when they listen to the teaching of anatta
buddhist texts like the ratnagotravibh ga clarify that the self implied in tathagatagarbha doctrine is actually not self
various interpretations of the concept have been advanced by buddhist thinkers throughout the history of buddhist thought and most attempt to avoid anything like the hindu atman doctrine
these indian buddhist ideas in various synthetic ways form the basis of subsequent mah y na philosophy in tibetan buddhism and east asian buddhism
while the noble eightfold path is best known in the west a wide variety of paths and models of progress have been used and described in the different buddhist traditions
however they generally share basic practices such as sila ethics samadhi meditation dhyana and praj a wisdom which are known as the three trainings
an important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world
devotion is also important in some buddhist traditions and in the tibetan traditions visualisations of deities and mandalas are important
the value of textual study is regarded differently in the various buddhist traditions
it is central to theravada and highly important to tibetan buddhism while the zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance
an important guiding principle of buddhist practice is the middle way madhyamapratipad
it was a part of buddha s first sermon where he presented the noble eightfold path that was a middle way between the extremes of asceticism and hedonistic sense pleasures
in buddhism states harvey the doctrine of dependent arising conditioned arising prat tyasamutp da to explain rebirth is viewed as the middle way between the doctrines that a being has a permanent soul involved in rebirth eternalism and death is final and there is no rebirth annihilationism
a common presentation style of the path m rga to liberation in the early buddhist texts is the graduated talk in which the buddha lays out a step by step training
in the early texts numerous different sequences of the gradual path can be found
one of the most important and widely used presentations among the various buddhist schools is the noble eightfold path or eightfold path of the noble ones skt
ry gam rga
this can be found in various discourses most famously in the dhammacakkappavattana sutta the discourse on the turning of the dharma wheel
other suttas such as the tevijja sutta and the cula hatthipadopama sutta give a different outline of the path though with many similar elements such as ethics and meditation
according to rupert gethin the path to awakening is also frequently summarized by another a short formula abandoning the hindrances practice of the four establishings of mindfulness and development of the awakening factors
the eightfold path consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions that when developed together lead to the cessation of dukkha
these eight factors are right view or right understanding right intention or right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
this eightfold path is the fourth of the four noble truths and asserts the path to the cessation of dukkha suffering pain unsatisfactoriness
the path teaches that the way of the enlightened ones stopped their craving clinging and karmic accumulations and thus ended their endless cycles of rebirth and suffering
the noble eightfold path is grouped into three basic divisions as follows
theravada buddhism is a diverse tradition and thus includes different explanations of the path to awakening
however the teachings of the buddha are often encapsulated by theravadins in the basic framework of the four noble truths and the eighthfold path
some theravada buddhists also follow the presentation of the path laid out in buddhaghosa s visuddhimagga
this presentation is known as the seven purifications satta visuddhi
this schema and its accompanying outline of insight knowledges vipassan a is used by modern influential theravadin scholars such mahasi sayadaw in his the progress of insight and nyanatiloka thera in the buddha s path to deliverance
mah y na buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva
a bodhisattva refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood
the term mah y na was originally a synonym for bodhisattvay na or bodhisattva vehicle
in the earliest texts of mah y na buddhism the path of a bodhisattva was to awaken the bodhicitta
between the st and rd century ce this tradition introduced the ten bhumi doctrine which means ten levels or stages of awakening
this development was followed by the acceptance that it is impossible to achieve buddhahood in one current lifetime and the best goal is not nirvana for oneself but buddhahood after climbing through the ten levels during multiple rebirths
mah y na scholars then outlined an elaborate path for monks and laypeople and the path includes the vow to help teach buddhist knowledge to other beings so as to help them cross samsara and liberate themselves once one reaches the buddhahood in a future rebirth
one part of this path are the p ramit perfections to cross over derived from the jatakas tales of buddha s numerous rebirths
the doctrine of the bodhisattva bh mis was also eventually merged with the sarv stiv da vaibh ika schema of the five paths by the yogacara school
this mah y na five paths presentation can be seen in asanga s mah y nasa graha
the mah y na texts are inconsistent in their discussion of the p ramit s and some texts include lists of two others four six ten and fifty two
the six paramitas have been most studied and these are
d na p ramit perfection of giving primarily to monks nuns and the buddhist monastic establishment dependent on the alms and gifts of the lay householders in return for generating religious merit some texts recommend ritually transferring the merit so accumulated for better rebirth to someone else
la p ramit perfection of morality it outlines ethical behaviour for both the laity and the mahayana monastic community this list is similar to la in the eightfold path i e
right speech right action right livelihood
k nti p ramit perfection of patience willingness to endure hardship
v rya p ramit perfection of vigour this is similar to right effort in the eightfold path
dhy na p ramit perfection of meditation this is similar to right concentration in the eightfold path
praj p ramit perfection of insight wisdom awakening to the characteristics of existence such as karma rebirths impermanence no self dependent origination and emptiness this is complete acceptance of the buddha teaching then conviction followed by ultimate realisation that dharmas are non arising in mah y na sutras that include ten p ramit the additional four perfections are skillful means vow power and knowledge
the most discussed p ramit and the highest rated perfection in mahayana texts is the prajna paramita or the perfection of insight
this insight in the mah y na tradition states sh hei ichimura has been the insight of non duality or the absence of reality in all things
east asian buddhism in influenced by both the classic indian buddhist presentations of the path such as the eighth fold path as well as classic indian mah y na presentations such as that found in the da zhidu lun
there many different presentations of soteriology including numerous paths and vehicles yanas in the different traditions of east asian buddhism
there is no single dominant presentation
in zen buddhism for example one can find outlines of the path such as the two entrances and four practices the five ranks the ten ox herding pictures and the three mysterious gates of linji
in indo tibetan buddhism the path to liberation is outlined in the genre known as lamrim stages of the path
all the various tibetan schools have their own lamrim presentations
this genre can be traced to ati a s th century a lamp for the path to enlightenment bodhipathaprad pa
in various suttas which present the graduated path taught by the buddha such as the sama aphala sutta and the cula hatthipadopama sutta the first step on the path is hearing the buddha teach the dharma
this then said to lead to the acquiring of confidence or faith in the buddha s teachings
mahayana buddhist teachers such as yin shun also state that hearing the dharma and study of the buddhist discourses is necessary if one wants to learn and practice the buddha dharma likewise in indo tibetan buddhism the stages of the path lamrim texts generally place the activity of listening to the buddhist teachings as an important early practice
traditionally the first step in most buddhist schools requires taking of the three refuges also called the three jewels sanskrit triratna pali tiratana as the foundation of one s religious practice
this practice may have been influenced by the brahmanical motif of the triple refuge found in the rigveda rigveda and chandogya upanishad
tibetan buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge in the lama
the three refuges are believed by buddhists to be protective and a form of reverence
the ancient formula which is repeated for taking refuge affirms that i go to the buddha as refuge i go to the dhamma as refuge i go to the sangha as refuge reciting the three refuges according to harvey is considered not as a place to hide rather a thought that purifies uplifts and strengthens the heart
la sanskrit or s la p li is the concept of moral virtues that is the second group and an integral part of the noble eightfold path
it generally consists of right speech right action and right livelihood
one of the most basic forms of ethics in buddhism is the taking of precepts
this includes the five precepts for laypeople eight or ten precepts for monastic life as well as rules of dhamma vinaya or patimokkha adopted by a monastery
other important elements of buddhist ethics include giving or charity d na mett good will heedfulness appamada self respect hri and regard for consequences apatrapya
buddhist scriptures explain the five precepts pali pa cas la sanskrit pa ca la as the minimal standard of buddhist morality
it is the most important system of morality in buddhism together with the monastic rules
the five precepts are seen as a basic training applicable to all buddhists
they are
i undertake the training precept sikkha padam to abstain from onslaught on breathing beings this includes ordering or causing someone else to kill
the pali suttas also say one should not approve of others killing and that one should be scrupulous compassionate trembling for the welfare of all living beings
i undertake the training precept to abstain from taking what is not given according to harvey this also covers fraud cheating forgery as well as falsely denying that one is in debt to someone
i undertake the training precept to abstain from misconduct concerning sense pleasures this generally refers to adultery as well as rape and incest
it also applies to sex with those who are legally under the protection of a guardian
it is also interpreted in different ways in the varying buddhist cultures
i undertake the training precept to abstain from false speech according to harvey this includes any form of lying deception or exaggeration even non verbal deception by gesture or other indication or misleading statements the precept is often also seen as including other forms of wrong speech such as divisive speech harsh abusive angry words and even idle chatter
i undertake the training precept to abstain from alcoholic drink or drugs that are an opportunity for heedlessness according to harvey intoxication is seen as a way to mask rather than face the sufferings of life
it is seen as damaging to one s mental clarity mindfulness and ability to keep the other four precepts undertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of non harming p li and sanskrit ahi sa
the pali canon recommends one to compare oneself with others and on the basis of that not to hurt others
compassion and a belief in karmic retribution form the foundation of the precepts
undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice both at home and at the local temple
however the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time
they are sometimes referred to as the r vakay na precepts in the mah y na tradition contrasting them with the bodhisattva precepts
the five precepts are not commandments and transgressions do not invite religious sanctions but their power has been based on the buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in the afterlife
killing in buddhist belief leads to rebirth in the hell realms and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk
adultery similarly invites a rebirth as prostitute or in hell depending on whether the partner was unmarried or married
these moral precepts have been voluntarily self enforced in lay buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth
within the buddhist doctrine the precepts are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to enlightenment
the monastic life in buddhism has additional precepts as part of patimokkha and unlike lay people transgressions by monks do invite sanctions
full expulsion from sangha follows any instance of killing engaging in sexual intercourse theft or false claims about one s knowledge
temporary expulsion follows a lesser offence
the sanctions vary per monastic fraternity nikaya
lay people and novices in many buddhist fraternities also uphold eight asta shila or ten das shila from time to time
four of these are same as for the lay devotee no killing no stealing no lying and no intoxicants
the other four precepts are
no sexual activity
abstain from eating at the wrong time e g
only eat solid food before noon
abstain from jewellery perfume adornment entertainment
abstain from sleeping on high bed i e
to sleep on a mat on the ground all eight precepts are sometimes observed by lay people on uposatha days full moon new moon the first and last quarter following the lunar calendar
the ten precepts also include to abstain from accepting money
in addition to these precepts buddhist monasteries have hundreds of rules of conduct which are a part of its patimokkha
vinaya is the specific code of conduct for a sangha of monks or nuns
it includes the patimokkha a set of offences including rules of decorum for monks along with penalties for transgression in the theravadin tradition
the precise content of the vinaya pitaka scriptures on the vinaya differs in different schools and tradition and different monasteries set their own standards on its implementation
the list of pattimokkha is recited every fortnight in a ritual gathering of all monks
buddhist text with vinaya rules for monasteries have been traced in all buddhist traditions with the oldest surviving being the ancient chinese translations
monastic communities in the buddhist tradition cut normal social ties to family and community and live as islands unto themselves
within a monastic fraternity a sangha has its own rules
a monk abides by these institutionalised rules and living life as the vinaya prescribes it is not merely a means but very nearly the end in itself
transgressions by a monk on sangha vinaya rules invites enforcement which can include temporary or permanent expulsion
another important practice taught by the buddha is the restraint of the senses indriyasamvara
in the various graduated paths this is usually presented as a practice which is taught prior to formal sitting meditation and which supports meditation by weakening sense desires that are a hindrance to meditation
according to an layo sense restraint is when one guards the sense doors in order to prevent sense impressions from leading to desires and discontent this is not an avoidance of sense impression but a kind of mindful attention towards the sense impressions which does not dwell on their main features or signs nimitta
this is said to prevent harmful influences from entering the mind
this practice is said to give rise to an inner peace and happiness which forms a basis for concentration and insight
a related buddhist virtue and practice is renunciation or the intent for desirelessness nekkhamma
generally renunciation is the giving up of actions and desires that are seen as unwholesome on the path such as lust for sensuality and worldly things
renunciation can be cultivated in different ways
the practice of giving for example is one form of cultivating renunciation
another one is the giving up of lay life and becoming a monastic bhiksu o bhiksuni
practicing celibacy whether for life as a monk or temporarily is also a form of renunciation
many jataka stories such as the focus on how the buddha practiced renunciation in past lives
one way of cultivating renunciation taught by the buddha is the contemplation anupassana of the dangers or negative consequences of sensual pleasure k m na d nava
as part of the graduated discourse this contemplation is taught after the practice of giving and morality
another related practice to renunciation and sense restraint taught by the buddha is restraint in eating or moderation with food which for monks generally means not eating after noon
devout laypersons also follow this rule during special days of religious observance uposatha
observing the uposatha also includes other practices dealing with renunciation mainly the eight precepts
for buddhist monastics renunciation can also be trained through several optional ascetic practices called dhuta ga
in different buddhist traditions other related practices which focus on fasting are followed
the training of the faculty called mindfulness pali sati sanskrit sm ti literally meaning recollection remembering is central in buddhism
according to analayo mindfulness is a full awareness of the present moment which enhances and strengthens memory
the indian buddhist philosopher asanga defined mindfulness thus it is non forgetting by the mind with regard to the object experienced
its function is non distraction according to rupert gethin sati is also an awareness of things in relation to things and hence an awareness of their relative value
there are different practices and exercises for training mindfulness in the early discourses such as the four satipa h nas sanskrit sm tyupasth na establishments of mindfulness and n p nasati sanskrit n p nasm ti mindfulness of breathing
a closely related mental faculty which is often mentioned side by side with mindfulness is sampaja a clear comprehension
this faculty is the ability to comprehend what one is doing and is happening in the mind and whether it is being influenced by unwholesome states or wholesome ones
a wide range of meditation practices has developed in the buddhist traditions but meditation primarily refers to the attainment of sam dhi and the practice of dhy na pali jh na
sam dhi is a calm undistracted unified and concentrated state of consciousness
it is defined by asanga as one pointedness of mind on the object to be investigated
its function consists of giving a basis to knowledge j na
dhy na is state of perfect equanimity and awareness upekkh sati parisuddhi reached through focused mental training
the practice of dhy na aids in maintaining a calm mind and avoiding disturbance of this calm mind by mindfulness of disturbing thoughts and feelings
the earliest evidence of yogis and their meditative tradition states karel werner is found in the ke in hymn of the rigveda
while evidence suggests meditation was practised in the centuries preceding the buddha the meditative methodologies described in the buddhist texts are some of the earliest among texts that have survived into the modern era
these methodologies likely incorporate what existed before the buddha as well as those first developed within buddhism
there is no scholarly agreement on the origin and source of the practice of dhy na
some scholars like bronkhorst see the four dhy nas as a buddhist invention
alexander wynne argues that the buddha learned dhy na from brahmanical teachers
whatever the case the buddha taught meditation with a new focus and interpretation particularly through the four dhy nas methodology in which mindfulness is maintained
further the focus of meditation and the underlying theory of liberation guiding the meditation has been different in buddhism
for example states bronkhorst the verse of the brihadaranyaka upanishad with its become calm subdued quiet patiently enduring concentrated one sees soul in oneself is most probably a meditative state
the buddhist discussion of meditation is without the concept of soul and the discussion criticises both the ascetic meditation of jainism and the real self soul meditation of hinduism
buddhist texts teach various meditation schemas
one of the most prominent is that of the four rupa jh nas four meditations in the realm of form which are stages of progressively deepening concentration
according to gethin they are states of perfect mindfulness stillness and lucidity they are described in the pali canon as trance like states without desire
in the early texts the buddha is depicted as entering jh na both before his awakening under the bodhi tree and also before his final nirvana see the mah saccaka sutta and the mah parinibb a sutta
the four rupa jh nas are
first jh na the first dhyana can be entered when one is secluded from sensuality and unskillful qualities due to withdrawal and right effort
there is p ti rapture and non sensual sukha pleasure as the result of seclusion while vitarka vicara thought and examination continues
second jh na there is p ti rapture and non sensual sukha pleasure as the result of concentration samadhi ji born of samadhi ekaggata unification of awareness free from vitarka vicara discursive thought sampasadana inner tranquility
third jh na p ti drops away there is upekkh equanimous affective detachment and one is mindful alert and senses pleasure sukha with the body
fourth jh na a stage of pure equanimity and mindfulness upekkh satip risuddhi without any pleasure or pain happiness or sadness there is a wide variety of scholarly opinions both from modern scholars and from traditional buddhists on the interpretation of these meditative states as well as varying opinions on how to practice them
often grouped into the jh na scheme are four other meditative states referred to in the early texts as arupa sam pattis formless attainments
these are also referred to in commentarial literature as immaterial formless jh nas ar pajh nas
the first formless attainment is a place or realm of infinite space k s na c yatana without form or colour or shape
the second is termed the realm of infinite consciousness vi a c yatana the third is the realm of nothingness ki ca yatana while the fourth is the realm of neither perception nor non perception
the four rupa jh nas in buddhist practice lead to rebirth in successfully better rupa brahma heavenly realms while arupa jh nas lead into arupa heavens
in the pali canon the buddha outlines two meditative qualities which are mutually supportive samatha p li sanskrit amatha calm and vipassan sanskrit vipa yan insight
the buddha compares these mental qualities to a swift pair of messengers who together help deliver the message of nibbana sn
the various buddhist traditions generally see buddhist meditation as being divided into those two main types
samatha is also called calming meditation and focuses on stilling and concentrating the mind i e
developing samadhi and the four dhy nas
according to damien keown vipassan meanwhile focuses on the generation of penetrating and critical insight pa
there are numerous doctrinal positions and disagreements within the different buddhist traditions regarding these qualities or forms of meditation
for example in the pali four ways to arahantship sutta an it is said that one can develop calm and then insight or insight and then calm or both at the same time
meanwhile in vasubandhu s abhidharmako ak rik vipa yan is said to be practiced once one has reached samadhi by cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness sm tyupasth nas
beginning with comments by la vallee poussin a series of scholars have argued that these two meditation types reflect a tension between two different ancient buddhist traditions regarding the use of dhy na one which focused on insight based practice and the other which focused purely on dhy na
however other scholars such as analayo and rupert gethin have disagreed with this two paths thesis instead seeing both of these practices as complementary
the four immeasurables or four abodes also called brahma viharas are virtues or directions for meditation in buddhist traditions which helps a person be reborn in the heavenly brahma realm
these are traditionally believed to be a characteristic of the deity brahma and the heavenly abode he resides in
the four brahma vihara are
loving kindness p li mett sanskrit maitr is active good will towards all
compassion p li and sanskrit karu results from metta it is identifying the suffering of others as one s own
empathetic joy p li and sanskrit mudit is the feeling of joy because others are happy even if one did not contribute to it it is a form of sympathetic joy
equanimity p li upekkh sanskrit upek is even mindedness and serenity treating everyone impartially according to peter harvey the buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the four brahmavihara meditation practices did not originate within the buddhist tradition
the brahmavihara sometimes as brahmaloka along with the tradition of meditation and the above four immeasurables are found in pre buddha and post buddha vedic and sramanic literature
aspects of the brahmavihara practice for rebirths into the heavenly realm have been an important part of buddhist meditation tradition
according to gombrich the buddhist usage of the brahma vih ra originally referred to an awakened state of mind and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to living with brahman here and now
the later tradition took those descriptions too literally linking them to cosmology and understanding them as living with brahman by rebirth in the brahma world
according to gombrich the buddha taught that kindness what christians tend to call love was a way to salvation
some buddhist traditions especially those associated with tantric buddhism also known as vajrayana and secret mantra use images and symbols of deities and buddhas in meditation
this is generally done by mentally visualizing a buddha image or some other mental image like a symbol a mandala a syllable etc and using that image to cultivate calm and insight
one may also visualize and identify oneself with the imagined deity
while visualization practices have been particularly popular in vajrayana they may also found in mahayana and theravada traditions
in tibetan buddhism unique tantric techniques which include visualization but also mantra recitation mandalas and other elements are considered to be much more effective than non tantric meditations and they are one of the most popular meditation methods
the methods of unsurpassable yoga tantra anuttarayogatantra are in turn seen as the highest and most advanced
anuttarayoga practice is divided into two stages the generation stage and the completion stage
in the generation stage one meditates on emptiness and visualizes oneself as a deity as well as visualizing its mandala
the focus is on developing clear appearance and divine pride the understanding that oneself and the deity are one
this method is also known as deity yoga devata yoga
there are numerous meditation deities yidam used each with a mandala a circular symbolic map used in meditation
in the completion stage one meditates on ultimate reality based on the image that has been generated
completion stage practices also include techniques such as tummo and phowa
these are said to work with subtle body elements like the energy channels nadi vital essences bindu vital winds vayu and chakras
the subtle body energies are seen as influencing consciousness in powerful ways and are thus used in order to generate the great bliss maha sukha which is used to attain the luminous nature of the mind and realization of the empty and illusory nature of all phenomena the illusory body which leads to enlightenment
completion practices are often grouped into different systems such as the six dharmas of naropa and the six yogas of kalachakra
in tibetan buddhism there are also practices and methods which are sometimes seen as being outside of the two tantric stages mainly mahamudra and dzogchen atiyoga
according to peter harvey whenever buddhism has been healthy not only ordained but also more committed lay people have practised formal meditation
loud devotional chanting however adds harvey has been the most prevalent buddhist practice and considered a form of meditation that produces energy joy lovingkindness and calm purifies mind and benefits the chanter
throughout most of buddhist history meditation has been primarily practised in buddhist monastic tradition and historical evidence suggests that serious meditation by lay people has been an exception
in recent history sustained meditation has been pursued by a minority of monks in buddhist monasteries
western interest in meditation has led to a revival where ancient buddhist ideas and precepts are adapted to western mores and interpreted liberally presenting buddhism as a meditation based form of spirituality
praj sanskrit or pa p li is wisdom or knowledge of the true nature of existence
another term which is associated with praj and sometimes is equivalent to it is vipassan p li or vipa yan sanskrit which is often translated as insight
in buddhist texts the faculty of insight is often said to be cultivated through the four establishments of mindfulness
in the early texts pa is included as one of the five faculties indriya which are commonly listed as important spiritual elements to be cultivated see for example an i
pa along with samadhi is also listed as one of the trainings in the higher states of mind adhicittasikkha
the buddhist tradition regards ignorance avidy a fundamental ignorance misunderstanding or mis perception of the nature of reality as one of the basic causes of dukkha and samsara
overcoming this ignorance is part of the path to awakening
this overcoming includes the contemplation of impermanence and the non self nature of reality and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging and liberates a being from dukkha and sa s ra
praj is important in all buddhist traditions
it is variously described as wisdom regarding the impermanent and not self nature of dharmas phenomena the functioning of karma and rebirth and knowledge of dependent origination
likewise vipa yan is described in a similar way such as in the pa isambhid magga where it is said to be the contemplation of things as impermanent unsatisfactory and not self
some scholars such as bronkhorst and vetter have argued that the idea that insight leads to liberation was a later development in buddhism and that there are inconsistencies with the early buddhist presentation of samadhi and insight
however others such as collett cox and damien keown have argued that insight is a key aspect of the early buddhist process of liberation which cooperates with samadhi to remove the obstacles to enlightenment i e the savas
in therav da buddhism the focus of vipassan meditation is to continuously and thoroughly know how phenomena dhammas are impermanent annica not self anatta and dukkha
the most widely used method in modern therav da for the practice of vipassan is that found in the satipatthana sutta
there is some disagreement in contemporary therav da regarding samatha and vipassan
some in the vipassana movement strongly emphasize the practice of insight over samatha and other theravadins disagree with this
in mah y na buddhism the development of insight vipa yan and tranquility amatha are also taught and practiced
the many different schools of mah y na buddhism have a large repertoire of meditation techniques to cultivate these qualities
these include visualization of various buddhas recitation of a buddha s name the use of tantric buddhist mantras and dharanis
insight in mah y na buddhism also includes gaining a direct understanding of certain mah y na philosophical views such as the emptiness view and the consciousness only view
this can be seen in meditation texts such as kamala la s bh van krama stages of meditation th century which teaches insight vipa yan from the yog c ra madhyamaka perspective
according to harvey most forms of buddhism consider saddh skt raddh trustful confidence or faith as a quality which must be balanced by wisdom and as a preparation for or accompaniment of meditation because of this devotion skt
bhakti pali bhatti is an important part of the practice of most buddhists
devotional practices include ritual prayer prostration offerings pilgrimage and chanting
buddhist devotion is usually focused on some object image or location that is seen as holy or spiritually influential
examples of objects of devotion include paintings or statues of buddhas and bodhisattvas stupas and bodhi trees
public group chanting for devotional and ceremonial is common to all buddhist traditions and goes back to ancient india where chanting aided in the memorization of the orally transmitted teachings
rosaries called malas are used in all buddhist traditions to count repeated chanting of common formulas or mantras
chanting is thus a type of devotional group meditation which leads to tranquility and communicates the buddhist teachings
in east asian pure land buddhism devotion to the buddha amitabha is the main practice
in nichiren buddhism devotion to the lotus sutra is the main practice
devotional practices such as pujas have been a common practice in theravada buddhism where offerings and group prayers are made to deities and particularly images of buddha
according to karel werner and other scholars devotional worship has been a significant practice in theravada buddhism and deep devotion is part of buddhist traditions starting from the earliest days
guru devotion is a central practice of tibetan buddhism
the guru is considered essential and to the buddhist devotee the guru is the enlightened teacher and ritual master in vajrayana spiritual pursuits
for someone seeking buddhahood the guru is the buddha the dharma and the sangha wrote the th century buddhist scholar sadhanamala
the veneration of and obedience to teachers is also important in theravada and zen buddhism
based on the indian principle of ahimsa non harming the buddha s ethics strongly condemn the harming of all sentient beings including all animals
he thus condemned the animal sacrifice of the brahmins as well hunting and killing animals for food
this led to various policies by buddhist kings such as asoka meant to protect animals such as the establishing of no slaughter days and the banning of hunting on certain circumstances
however early buddhist texts depict the buddha as allowing monastics to eat meat
this seems to be because monastics begged for their food and thus were supposed to accept whatever food was offered to them
this was tempered by the rule that meat had to be three times clean which meant that they had not seen had not heard and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them
also while the buddha did not explicitly promote vegetarianism in his discourses he did state that gaining one s livelihood from the meat trade was unethical
however this rule was not a promotion of a specific diet but a rule against the actual killing of animals for food
there was also a famed schism which occurred in the buddhist community when devadatta attempted to make vegetarianism compulsory and the buddha disagreed
in contrast to this various mahayana sutras and texts like the mahaparinirvana sutra surangama sutra and the lankavatara sutra state that the buddha promoted vegetarianism out of compassion
indian mahayana thinkers like shantideva promoted the avoidance of meat
throughout history the issue of whether buddhists should be vegetarian has remained a much debated topic and there is a variety of opinions on this issue among modern buddhists
in the east asian buddhism most monastics are expected to be vegetarian and the practice is seen as very virtuous and it is taken up by some devout laypersons
most theravadins in sri lanka and southeast asia do not practice vegetarianism and eat whatever is offered by the lay community who are mostly also not vegetarians
but there are exceptions some monks choose to be vegetarian and some abbots like ajahn sumedho have encouraged the lay community to donate vegetarian food to the monks
mahasi sayadaw meanwhile has recommended vegetarianism as the best way to make sure one s meal is pure in three ways
also the new religious movement santi asoke promotes vegetarianism
according to peter harvey in the theravada world vegetarianism is universally admired but little practiced because of the rule against killing in many buddhist countries most butchers and others who work in the meat trade are non buddhists
likewise most tibetan buddhists have historically tended not to be vegetarian however there have been some strong debates and pro vegetarian arguments by some pro vegetarian tibetans
some influential figures have spoken and written in favor of vegetarianism throughout history including well known figures like shabkar and the th karmapa ogyen trinley dorje who has mandated vegetarianism in all his monasteries
buddhism like all indian religions was initially an oral tradition in ancient times
the buddha s words the early doctrines concepts and their traditional interpretations were orally transmitted from one generation to the next
the earliest oral texts were transmitted in middle indo aryan languages called prakrits such as pali through the use of communal recitation and other mnemonic techniques
the first buddhist canonical texts were likely written down in sri lanka about years after the buddha died
the texts were part of the tripitakas and many versions appeared thereafter claiming to be the words of the buddha
scholarly buddhist commentary texts with named authors appeared in india around the nd century ce
these texts were written in pali or sanskrit sometimes regional languages as palm leaf manuscripts birch bark painted scrolls carved into temple walls and later on paper
unlike what the bible is to christianity and the quran is to islam but like all major ancient indian religions there is no consensus among the different buddhist traditions as to what constitutes the scriptures or a common canon in buddhism
the general belief among buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast
this corpus includes the ancient sutras organised into nikayas or agamas itself the part of three basket of texts called the tripitakas
each buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts much of which is translation of ancient pali and sanskrit buddhist texts of india
the chinese buddhist canon for example includes texts in volumes while the tibetan canon comprises texts all claimed to have been spoken by the buddha and another texts composed by indian scholars revered in the tibetan tradition
the buddhist textual history is vast over manuscripts mostly buddhist some non buddhist were discovered in in the dunhuang chinese cave alone
the early buddhist texts refers to the literature which is considered by modern scholars to be the earliest buddhist material
the first four pali nikayas and the corresponding chinese gamas are generally considered to be among the earliest material
apart from these there are also fragmentary collections of ebt materials in other languages such as sanskrit khotanese tibetan and g ndh r
the modern study of early buddhism often relies on comparative scholarship using these various early buddhist sources to identify parallel texts and common doctrinal content
one feature of these early texts are literary structures which reflect oral transmission such as widespread repetition after the development of the different early buddhist schools these schools began to develop their own textual collections which were termed tripi akas triple baskets
many early tripi akas like the p li tipitaka were divided into three sections vinaya pitaka focuses on monastic rule sutta pitaka buddhist discourses and abhidhamma pitaka which contain expositions and commentaries on the doctrine
the p li tipitaka also known as the pali canon of the theravada school constitutes the only complete collection of buddhist texts in an indic language which has survived until today
however many sutras vinayas and abhidharma works from other schools survive in chinese translation as part of the chinese buddhist canon
according to some sources some early schools of buddhism had five or seven pitakas
much of the material in the pali canon is not specifically theravadin but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early non sectarian body of teachings
according to peter harvey it contains material at odds with later theravadin orthodoxy
he states the theravadins then may have added texts to the canon for some time but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period
a distinctive feature of many tripitaka collections is the inclusion of a genre called abhidharma which dates from the rd century bce and later
according to collett cox the genre began as explanations and elaborations of the teachings in the suttas but over time evolved into an independent system of doctrinal exposition
over time the various abhidharma traditions developed various disagreements which each other on points of doctrine which were discussed in the different abhidharma texts of these schools
the major abhidharma collections which modern scholars have the most information about are those of the therav da and sarv stiv da schools
in sri lanka and south india the therav da abhidhamma system was the most influential
in addition to the abhidharma project some of the schools also began accumulating a literary tradition of scriptural commentary on their respective tripitakas
these commentaries were particularly important in the therav da school and the pali commentaries a hakath remain influential today
both abhidhamma and the pali commentaries influenced the visuddhimagga an important th century text by the theravada scholar buddhaghosa who also translated and compiled many of the a hakath s from older sinhalese sources
the sarv stiv da school was one of the most influential abhidharma traditions in north india
the magnum opus of this tradition was the massive abhidharma commentary called the mah vibha a great commentary compiled at a great synod in kashmir during the reign of kanishka ii c
the abhidharmakosha of vasubandhu is another very influential abhidharma work from the northern tradition which continues to be studied in east asian buddhism and in tibetan buddhism
the mah y na s tras are a very broad genre of buddhist scriptures that the mah y na buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the buddha
modern historians generally hold that the first of these texts were composed probably around the st century bce or st century ce
in mah y na these texts are generally given greater authority than the early gamas and abhidharma literature which are called r vakay na or hinayana to distinguish them from mah y na s tras
mah y na traditions mainly see these different classes of texts as being designed for different types of persons with different levels of spiritual understanding
the mah y na s tras are mainly seen as being for those of greater capacity
the mah y na s tras often claim to articulate the buddha s deeper more advanced doctrines reserved for those who follow the bodhisattva path
that path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness
hence the name mah y na lit the great vehicle
besides the teaching of the bodhisattva mah y na texts also contain expanded cosmologies and mythologies with many more buddhas and powerful bodhisattvas as well as new spiritual practices and ideas
the modern theravada school does not treat the mah y na s tras as authoritative or authentic teachings of the buddha
likewise these texts were not recognized as authoritative by many early buddhist schools and in some cases communities such as the mah s ghika school split up due to this disagreement
recent scholarship has discovered many early mah y na texts which shed light into the development of mah y na
among these is the listamba sutra which survives in tibetan and chinese translation
this text contains numerous sections which are remarkably similar to pali suttas
the listamba sutra was cited by mah y na scholars such as the th century yasomitra to be authoritative
this suggests that buddhist literature of different traditions shared a common core of buddhist texts in the early centuries of its history until mah y na literature diverged about and after the st century ce
mah y na also has a very large literature of philosophical and exegetical texts
these are often called stra treatises or vrittis commentaries
some of this literature was also written in verse form karik s the most famous of which is the m lamadhyamika karik root verses on the middle way by nagarjuna the foundational text of the madhyamika school
during the gupta empire a new class of buddhist sacred literature began to develop which are called the tantras
by the th century the tantric tradition was very influential in india and beyond
besides drawing on a mah y na buddhist framework these texts also borrowed deities and material from other indian religious traditions such as the aiva and pancharatra traditions local god goddess cults and local spirit worship such as yaksha or n ga spirits
some features of these texts include the widespread use of mantras meditation on the subtle body worship of fierce deities and antinomian and transgressive practices such as ingesting alcohol and performing sexual rituals
historically the roots of buddhism lie in the religious thought of iron age india around the middle of the first millennium bce
this was a period of great intellectual ferment and socio cultural change known as the second urbanisation marked by the growth of towns and trade the composition of the upanishads and the historical emergence of the rama a traditions
new ideas developed both in the vedic tradition in the form of the upanishads and outside of the vedic tradition through the rama a movements
the term rama a refers to several indian religious movements parallel to but separate from the historical vedic religion including buddhism jainism and others such as j vika
several rama a movements are known to have existed in india before the th century bce pre buddha pre mahavira and these influenced both the stika and n stika traditions of indian philosophy
according to martin wilshire the rama a tradition evolved in india over two phases namely paccekabuddha and savaka phases the former being the tradition of individual ascetic and the latter of disciples and that buddhism and jainism ultimately emerged from these
brahmanical and non brahmanical ascetic groups shared and used several similar ideas but the rama a traditions also drew upon already established brahmanical concepts and philosophical roots states wiltshire to formulate their own doctrines
brahmanical motifs can be found in the oldest buddhist texts using them to introduce and explain buddhist ideas
for example prior to buddhist developments the brahmanical tradition internalised and variously reinterpreted the three vedic sacrificial fires as concepts such as truth rite tranquility or restraint
buddhist texts also refer to the three vedic sacrificial fires reinterpreting and explaining them as ethical conduct
the rama a religions challenged and broke with the brahmanic tradition on core assumptions such as atman soul self brahman the nature of afterlife and they rejected the authority of the vedas and upanishads
buddhism was one among several indian religions that did so
the history of indian buddhism may be divided into five periods early buddhism occasionally called pre sectarian buddhism nikaya buddhism or sectarian buddhism the period of the early buddhist schools early mahayana buddhism late mahayana and the era of vajrayana or the tantric age
according to lambert schmithausen pre sectarian buddhism is the canonical period prior to the development of different schools with their different positions
the early buddhist texts include the four principal pali nik yas and their parallel agamas found in the chinese canon together with the main body of monastic rules which survive in the various versions of the patimokkha
however these texts were revised over time and it is unclear what constitutes the earliest layer of buddhist teachings
one method to obtain information on the oldest core of buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the theravadin p li canon and other texts
the reliability of the early sources and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings is a matter of dispute
according to vetter inconsistencies remain and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies
according to schmithausen three positions held by scholars of buddhism can be distinguished
stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the nikayic materials
scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest buddhism
cautious optimism in this respect according to mitchell certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts which has led most scholars to conclude that gautama buddha must have taught something similar to the four noble truths the noble eightfold path nirvana the three marks of existence the five aggregates dependent origination karma and rebirth
according to n
ross reat all of these doctrines are shared by the theravada pali texts and the mahasamghika school s listamba s tra
a recent study by bhikkhu analayo concludes that the theravada majjhima nikaya and sarvastivada madhyama agama contain mostly the same major doctrines
richard salomon in his study of the gandharan texts which are the earliest manuscripts containing early discourses has confirmed that their teachings are consistent with non mahayana buddhism which survives today in the theravada school of sri lanka and southeast asia but which in ancient times was represented by eighteen separate schools
however some scholars argue that critical analysis reveals discrepancies among the various doctrines found in these early texts which point to alternative possibilities for early buddhism
the authenticity of certain teachings and doctrines have been questioned
for example some scholars think that karma was not central to the teaching of the historical buddha while other disagree with this position
likewise there is scholarly disagreement on whether insight was seen as liberating in early buddhism or whether it was a later addition to the practice of the four jh nas
scholars such as bronkhorst also think that the four noble truths may not have been formulated in earliest buddhism and did not serve in earliest buddhism as a description of liberating insight
according to vetter the description of the buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term the middle way
in time this short description was elaborated resulting in the description of the eightfold path
according to numerous buddhist scriptures soon after the parinirv a from sanskrit highest extinguishment of gautama buddha the first buddhist council was held to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission
many modern scholars question the historicity of this event
however richard gombrich states that the monastic assembly recitations of the buddha s teaching likely began during buddha s lifetime and they served a similar role of codifying the teachings
the so called second buddhist council resulted in the first schism in the sangha
modern scholars believe that this was probably caused when a group of reformists called sthaviras elders sought to modify the vinaya monastic rule and this caused a split with the conservatives who rejected this change they were called mah s ghikas
while most scholars accept that this happened at some point there is no agreement on the dating especially if it dates to before or after the reign of ashoka
buddhism may have spread only slowly throughout india until the time of the mauryan emperor ashoka bce who was a public supporter of the religion
the support of a oka and his descendants led to the construction of more st pas such as at sanchi and bharhut temples such as the mahabodhi temple and to its spread throughout the maurya empire and into neighbouring lands such as central asia and to the island of sri lanka
during and after the mauryan period bce the sthavira community gave rise to several schools one of which was the theravada school which tended to congregate in the south and another which was the sarv stiv da school which was mainly in north india
likewise the mah s ghika groups also eventually split into different sanghas
originally these schisms were caused by disputes over monastic disciplinary codes of various fraternities but eventually by about ce if not earlier schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too
following or leading up to the schisms each sa gha started to accumulate their own version of tripi aka triple basket of texts
in their tripi aka each school included the suttas of the buddha a vinaya basket disciplinary code and some schools also added an abhidharma basket which were texts on detailed scholastic classification summary and interpretation of the suttas
the doctrine details in the abhidharmas of various buddhist schools differ significantly and these were composed starting about the third century bce and through the st millennium ce
according to the edicts of a oka the mauryan emperor sent emissaries to various countries west of india to spread dharma particularly in eastern provinces of the neighbouring seleucid empire and even farther to hellenistic kingdoms of the mediterranean
it is a matter of disagreement among scholars whether or not these emissaries were accompanied by buddhist missionaries
in central and west asia buddhist influence grew through greek speaking buddhist monarchs and ancient asian trade routes a phenomenon known as greco buddhism
an example of this is evidenced in chinese and pali buddhist records such as milindapanha and the greco buddhist art of gandh ra
the milindapanha describes a conversation between a buddhist monk and the nd century bce greek king menander after which menander abdicates and himself goes into monastic life in the pursuit of nirvana
some scholars have questioned the milindapanha version expressing doubts whether menander was buddhist or just favourably disposed to buddhist monks
the kushan empire ce came to control the silk road trade through central and south asia which brought them to interact with gandharan buddhism and the buddhist institutions of these regions
the kushans patronised buddhism throughout their lands and many buddhist centers were built or renovated the sarvastivada school was particularly favored especially by emperor kanishka ce
kushan support helped buddhism to expand into a world religion through their trade routes
buddhism spread to khotan the tarim basin and china eventually to other parts of the far east
some of the earliest written documents of the buddhist faith are the gandharan buddhist texts dating from about the st century ce and connected to the dharmaguptaka school
the islamic conquest of the iranian plateau in the th century followed by the muslim conquests of afghanistan and the later establishment of the ghaznavid kingdom with islam as the state religion in central asia between the th and th century led to the decline and disappearance of buddhism from most of these regions
the origins of mah y na great vehicle buddhism are not well understood and there are various competing theories about how and where this movement arose
theories include the idea that it began as various groups venerating certain texts or that it arose as a strict forest ascetic movement
the first mah y na works were written sometime between the st century bce and the nd century ce
much of the early extant evidence for the origins of mah y na comes from early chinese translations of mah y na texts mainly those of lokak ema
nd century ce
some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest mah y na s tras to include the first versions of the prajnaparamita series along with texts concerning ak obhya which were probably composed in the st century bce in the south of india
there is no evidence that mah y na ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of buddhism with a separate monastic code vinaya but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals and later doctrines for bodhisattvas
records written by chinese monks visiting india indicate that both mah y na and non mah y na monks could be found in the same monasteries with the difference that mah y na monks worshipped figures of bodhisattvas while non mahayana monks did not
mah y na initially seems to have remained a small minority movement that was in tension with other buddhist groups struggling for wider acceptance
however during the fifth and sixth centuries ce there seems to have been a rapid growth of mah y na buddhism which is shown by a large increase in epigraphic and manuscript evidence in this period
however it still remained a minority in comparison to other buddhist schools
mah y na buddhist institutions continued to grow in influence during the following centuries with large monastic university complexes such as nalanda established by the th century ce gupta emperor kumaragupta i and vikramashila established under dharmapala c
to becoming quite powerful and influential
during this period of late mah y na four major types of thought developed m dhyamaka yog c ra buddha nature tath gatagarbha and the epistemological tradition of dignaga and dharmakirti
according to dan lusthaus m dhyamaka and yog c ra have a great deal in common and the commonality stems from early buddhism
during the gupta period th th centuries and the empire of har avardana c
ce buddhism continued to be influential in india and large buddhist learning institutions such as nalanda and valabahi universities were at their peak
buddhism also flourished under the support of the p la empire th th centuries
under the guptas and palas tantric buddhism or vajrayana developed and rose to prominence
it promoted new practices such as the use of mantras dharanis mudras mandalas and the visualization of deities and buddhas and developed a new class of literature the buddhist tantras
this new esoteric form of buddhism can be traced back to groups of wandering yogi magicians called mahasiddhas
the question of the origins of early vajrayana has been taken up by various scholars
david seyfort ruegg has suggested that buddhist tantra employed various elements of a pan indian religious substrate which is not specifically buddhist shaiva or vaishnava
according to indologist alexis sanderson various classes of vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both buddhism and saivism
sanderson has argued that buddhist tantras can be shown to have borrowed practices terms rituals and more form shaiva tantras
he argues that buddhist texts even directly copied various shaiva tantras especially the bhairava vidyapitha tantras
ronald m
davidson meanwhile argues that sanderson s claims for direct influence from shaiva vidyapitha texts are problematic because the chronology of the vidyapitha tantras is by no means so well established and that the shaiva tradition also appropriated non hindu deities texts and traditions
thus while there can be no question that the buddhist tantras were heavily influenced by kapalika and other saiva movements argues davidson the influence was apparently mutual
already during this later era buddhism was losing state support in other regions of india including the lands of the karkotas the pratiharas the rashtrakutas the pandyas and the pallavas
this loss of support in favor of hindu faiths like vaishnavism and shaivism is the beginning of the long and complex period of the decline of buddhism in the indian subcontinent
the islamic invasions and conquest of india th to th century further damaged and destroyed many buddhist institutions leading to its eventual near disappearance from india by the s
the silk road transmission of buddhism to china is most commonly thought to have started in the late nd or the st century ce though the literary sources are all open to question
the first documented translation efforts by foreign buddhist monks in china were in the nd century ce probably as a consequence of the expansion of the kushan empire into the chinese territory of the tarim basin
the first documented buddhist texts translated into chinese are those of the parthian an shigao ce
the first known mah y na scriptural texts are translations into chinese by the kushan monk lokak ema in luoyang between and ce
from china buddhism was introduced into its neighbours korea th century japan th th centuries and vietnam c
st nd centuries
during the chinese tang dynasty chinese esoteric buddhism was introduced from india and chan buddhism zen became a major religion
chan continued to grow in the song dynasty and it was during this era that it strongly influenced korean buddhism and japanese buddhism
pure land buddhism also became popular during this period and was often practised together with chan
it was also during the song that the entire chinese canon was printed using over wooden printing blocks
during the indian period of esoteric buddhism from the th century onwards buddhism spread from india to tibet and mongolia
johannes bronkhorst states that the esoteric form was attractive because it allowed both a secluded monastic community as well as the social rites and rituals important to laypersons and to kings for the maintenance of a political state during succession and wars to resist invasion
during the middle ages buddhism slowly declined in india while it vanished from persia and central asia as islam became the state religion
the theravada school arrived in sri lanka sometime in the rd century bce
sri lanka became a base for its later spread to southeast asia after the th century ce myanmar malaysia indonesia thailand cambodia and coastal vietnam
theravada buddhism was the dominant religion in burma during the mon hanthawaddy kingdom
it also became dominant in the khmer empire during the th and th centuries and in the thai sukhothai kingdom during the reign of ram khamhaeng
buddhists generally classify themselves as either therav da or mah y na
this classification is also used by some scholars and is the one ordinarily used in the english language
an alternative scheme used by some scholars divides buddhism into the following three traditions or geographical or cultural areas therav da or southern buddhism south asian buddhism east asian buddhism or just eastern buddhism and indo tibetan buddhism or northern buddhism
some scholars use other schemes
buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes
hinayana literally lesser or inferior vehicle is sometimes used by mah y na followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary therav da emerged but as the hinayana term is considered derogatory a variety of other terms are used instead including r vakay na nikaya buddhism early buddhist schools sectarian buddhism and conservative buddhism
not all traditions of buddhism share the same philosophical outlook or treat the same concepts as central
each tradition however does have its own core concepts and some comparisons can be drawn between them
both therav da and mah y na accept and revere the buddha sakyamuni as the founder mah y na also reveres numerous other buddhas such as amitabha or vairocana as well as many other bodhisattvas not revered in therav da
both accept the middle way dependent origination the four noble truths the noble eightfold path the three jewels the three marks of existence and the bodhipak adharmas aids to awakening
mah y na focuses mainly on the bodhisattva path to buddhahood which it sees as universal and to be practiced by all persons while therav da does not focus on teaching this path and teaches the attainment of arhatship as a worthy goal to strive towards
the bodhisattva path is not denied in therav da it is generally seen as a long and difficult path suitable for only a few
thus the bodhisattva path is normative in mah y na while it is an optional path for a heroic few in therav da
mah y na sees the arhat s nirvana as being imperfect and inferior or preliminary to full buddhahood
it sees arhatship as selfish since bodhisattvas vow to save all beings while arhats save only themselves
therav da meanwhile does not accept that the arhat s nirvana is an inferior or preliminary attainment nor that it is a selfish deed to attain arhatship since not only are arhats described as compassionate but they have destroyed the root of greed the sense of i am
mah y na accepts the authority of the many mah y na sutras along with the other nikaya texts like the agamas and the pali canon though it sees mah y na texts as primary while therav da does not accept that the mah y na sutras are buddhavacana word of the buddha at all the therav da tradition bases itself on the p li canon considers itself to be the more orthodox form of buddhism and tends to be more conservative in doctrine and monastic discipline
the p li canon is the only complete buddhist canon surviving in an ancient indian language
this language p li serves as the school s sacred language and lingua franca
besides the p li canon therav da scholastics also often rely on a post canonical p li literature which comments on and interprets the p li canon
these later works such as the visuddhimagga a doctrinal summa written in the fifth century by the exegete buddhaghosa also remain influential today
therav da derives from the mah vih ra t mrapar ya sect a sri lankan branch of the vibhajyav da sthaviras which began to establish itself on the island from the rd century bce onwards
therav da flourished in south india and sri lanka in ancient times from there it spread for the first time into mainland southeast asia about the th century into its elite urban centres
by the th century therav da had spread widely into the rural areas of mainland southeast asia displacing mahayana buddhism and some traditions of hinduism
in the modern era buddhist figures such as anagarika dhammapala and king mongkut sought to re focus the tradition on the p li canon as well as emphasize the rational and scientific nature of therav da while also opposing superstition
this movement often termed buddhist modernism has influenced most forms of modern therav da
another influential modern turn in therav da is the vipassana movement which led to the widespread adoption of meditation by laypersons
therav da is primarily practised today in sri lanka burma laos thailand cambodia as well as small portions of china vietnam malaysia and bangladesh
it has a growing presence in the west especially as part of the vipassana movement
mah y na great vehicle refers to all forms of buddhism which consider the mah y na sutras as authoritative scriptures and accurate rendering of buddha s words
these traditions have been the more liberal form of buddhism allowing different and new interpretations that emerged over time
the focus of mah y na is the path of the bodhisattva bodhisattvay na though what this path means is interpreted in many different ways
the first mah y na texts date to sometime between the st century bce and the st century ce
it remained a minority movement until the time of the guptas and palas when great mah y na monastic centres of learning such as n land university were established as evidenced by records left by three chinese visitors to india
these universities supported buddhist scholarship as well as studies into non buddhist traditions and secular subjects such as medicine
they hosted visiting students who then spread buddhism to east and central asia
native mah y na buddhism is practised today in china japan korea singapore parts of russia and most of vietnam also commonly referred to as eastern buddhism
the buddhism practised in tibet the himalayan regions and mongolia is also a form of mah y na but is also different in many ways due to its adoption of tantric practices and is discussed below under the heading of vajray na also commonly referred to as northern buddhism
there are a variety of strands in eastern buddhism of which the pure land school of mah y na is the most widely practised today in most of china these different strands and traditions are generally fused together
vietnamese mah y na is similarly very eclectic
in japan in particular they form separate denominations with the five major ones being nichiren peculiar to japan pure land shingon a form of vajrayana tendai and zen
in korea nearly all buddhists belong to the chogye school which is officially son zen but with substantial elements from other traditions
the goal and philosophy of the vajray na remains mah y nist but its methods are seen by its followers as far more powerful so as to lead to buddhahood in just one lifetime
the practice of using mantras was adopted from hinduism where they were first used in the vedas
tibetan buddhism preserves the vajrayana teachings of eighth century india
tantric buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices
a central feature of buddhist tantra is deity yoga which includes visualisation and identification with an enlightened yidam or meditation deity and its associated mandala
another element of tantra is the need for ritual initiation or empowerment abhi eka by a guru or lama
some tantras like the guhyasam ja tantra features new forms of antinomian ritual practice such as the use taboo substances like alcohol sexual yoga and charnel ground practices which evoke wrathful deities
buddhist institutions are often housed and centered around monasteries sanskrit viharas and temples
buddhist monastics originally followed a life of wandering never staying in one place for long
during the three month rainy season vassa they would gather together in one place for a period of intense practice and then depart again
some of the earliest buddhist monasteries were at groves vanas or woods ara as such as jetavana and sarnath s deer park
there originally seems to have been two main types of monasteries monastic settlements sangharamas were built and supported by donors and woodland camps avasas were set up by monks
whatever structures were built in these locales were made out of wood and were sometimes temporary structures built for the rainy season
over time the wandering community slowly adopted more settled cenobitic forms of monasticism
also these monasteries slowly evolved from the simpler collections of rustic dwellings of early buddhism into larger more permanent structures meant to house the entire community who now lived in a more collective fashion
during the gupta era even larger monastic university complexes like nalanda arose with larger and more artistically ornate structures as well as large land grants and accumulated wealth
there are many different forms of buddhist structures
classic indian buddhist institutions mainly made use of the following structures monasteries rock hewn cave complexes such as the ajanta caves stupas funerary mounds which contained relics and temples such as the mahabodhi temple
in southeast asia the most widespread institutions are centered on wats which refers to an establishment with various buildings such as an ordination hall a library monks quarters and stupas
east asian buddhist institutions also use various structures including monastic halls temples lecture halls bell towers and pagodas
in japanese buddhist temples these different structures are usually grouped together in an area termed the garan
in indo tibetan buddhism buddhist institutions are generally housed in gompas
they include monastic quarters stupas and prayer halls with buddha images
the complexity of buddhist institutions varies ranging from minimalist and rustic forest monasteries to large monastic centers like tawang monastery
the core of traditional buddhist institutions is the monastic community sangha who manage and lead religious services
they are supported by the lay community who visit temples and monasteries for religious services and holidays
in the modern era the buddhist meditation centre which is mostly used by laypersons and often also staffed by them has also become widespread
buddhism has faced various challenges and changes during the colonisation of buddhist states by christian countries and its persecution under modern states
like other religions the findings of modern science has challenged its basic premises
one response to some of these challenges has come to be called buddhist modernism
early buddhist modernist figures such as the american convert henry olcott and anagarika dharmapala reinterpreted and promoted buddhism as a scientific and rational religion which they saw as compatible with modern science
east asian buddhism meanwhile suffered under various wars which ravaged china during the modern era such as the taiping rebellion and world war ii which also affected korean buddhism
during the republican period a new movement called humanistic buddhism was developed by figures such as taixu and though buddhist institutions were destroyed during the cultural revolution there has been a revival of the religion in china after
japanese buddhism also went through a period of modernisation during the meiji period
in central asia meanwhile the arrival of communist repression to tibet and mongolia between and had a strong negative impact on buddhist institutions though the situation has improved somewhat since the s and s
while there were some encounters of western travellers or missionaries such as st
francis xavier and ippolito desideri with buddhist cultures it was not until the th century that buddhism began to be studied by western scholars
it was the work of pioneering scholars such as eug ne burnouf max m ller hermann oldenberg and thomas william rhys davids that paved the way for modern buddhist studies in the west
the english words such as buddhism boudhist bauddhist and buddhist were coined in the early th century in the west while in rhys davids founded the pali text society an influential western resource of buddhist literature in the pali language and one of the earliest publisher of a journal on buddhist studies
it was also during the th century that asian buddhist immigrants mainly from china and japan began to arrive in western countries such as the united states and canada bringing with them their buddhist religion
this period also saw the first westerners to formally convert to buddhism such as helena blavatsky and henry steel olcott
an important event in the introduction of buddhism to the west was the world parliament of religions which for the first time saw well publicized speeches by major buddhist leaders alongside other religious leaders
the th century saw a prolific growth of new buddhist institutions in western countries including the buddhist society london das buddhistische haus and datsan gunzechoinei in st petersburg
the publication and translations of buddhist literature in western languages thereafter accelerated
after the second world war further immigration from asia globalisation the secularisation on western culture as well a renewed interest in buddhism among the s counterculture led to further growth in buddhist institutions
influential figures on post war western buddhism include shunryu suzuki jack kerouac alan watts th ch nh t h nh and the th dalai lama
while buddhist institutions have grown some of the central premises of buddhism such as the cycles of rebirth and four noble truths have been problematic in the west
in contrast states christopher gowans for most ordinary asian buddhists today as well as in the past their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth
most asian buddhist laypersons states kevin trainor have historically pursued buddhist rituals and practices seeking better rebirth not nirvana or freedom from rebirth
buddhism has spread across the world and buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages
while buddhism in the west is often seen as exotic and progressive in the east it is regarded as familiar and traditional
in countries such as cambodia and bhutan it is recognised as the state religion and receives government support
in certain regions such as afghanistan and pakistan militants have targeted violence and destruction of historic buddhist monuments
a number of modern movements in buddhism emerged during the second half of the th century
these new forms of buddhism are diverse and significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices
in india b r
ambedkar launched the navayana tradition literally new vehicle
ambedkar s buddhism rejects the foundational doctrines and historic practices of traditional theravada and mahayana traditions such as monk lifestyle after renunciation karma rebirth samsara meditation nirvana four noble truths and others
ambedkar s navayana buddhism considers these as superstitions and re interprets the original buddha as someone who taught about class struggle and social equality
ambedkar urged low caste indian dalits to convert to his marxism inspired reinterpretation called the navayana buddhism also known as bhimayana buddhism
ambedkar s effort led to the expansion of navayana buddhism in india
the thai king mongkut r
and his son king chulalongkorn r
were responsible for modern reforms of thai buddhism
modern buddhist movements include secular buddhism in many countries won buddhism in korea the dhammakaya movement in thailand and several japanese organisations such as shinnyo en rissh k sei kai or soka gakkai
some of these movements have brought internal disputes and strife within regional buddhist communities
for example the dhammakaya movement in thailand teaches a true self doctrine which traditional theravada monks consider as heretically denying the fundamental anatta not self doctrine of buddhism
buddhism has not been immune from sexual abuse and misconduct scandals with victims coming forward in various buddhist schools such as zen and tibetan
there are huge cover ups in the catholic church but what has happened within tibetan buddhism is totally along the same lines says mary finnigan an author and journalist who has been chronicling such alleged abuses since the mid s
one notably covered case in media of various western countries was that of sogyal rinpoche which began in and ended with his retirement from his position as rigpa s spiritual director in
buddhism has had a profound influence on various cultures especially in asia
buddhist philosophy buddhist art buddhist architecture buddhist cuisine and buddhist festivals continue to be influential elements of the modern culture of asia especially in east asia and the sinosphere as well as in southeast asia and the indosphere
according to litian fang buddhism has permeated a wide range of fields such as politics ethics philosophy literature art and customs in these asian regions
buddhist teachings influenced the development of modern hinduism as well as other asian religions like taoism and confucianism
for example various scholars have argued that key hindu thinkers such as adi shankara and patanjali author of the yoga sutras were influenced by buddhist ideas
likewise buddhist practices were influential in the early development of indian yoga
buddhist philosophers like dignaga and dharmakirti were very influential in the development of indian logic and epistemology
buddhist educational institutions like nalanda and vikramashila preserved various disciplines of classical indian knowledge such as grammar astronomy astrology and medicine and taught foreign students from asia
buddhist institutions were major centers for the study and practice of traditional forms of medicine including ayurveda chinese medicine and tibetan medicine
according to pierce salguero buddhist monasteries had ample opportunity and motivation to combine imported and local therapies and the institutional contexts in which to accumulate oral and tacit knowledge of what was efficacious the most important of these buddhist centers of medical practice such as n land produced medical texts materia medica pharmaceuticals and trained doctors which were widely disseminated across the buddhist world
n land university was also said to have been the site of the composition of the a gah daya sa hit an influential medical work by the physician v gbha a
buddhists spread these traditional approaches to health sometimes called buddhist medicine throughout east and southeast asia where they remain influential today in regions like sri lanka burma tibet and thailand
in an effort to preserve their sacred scriptures buddhist institutions such as temples and monasteries housed schools which educated the populace and promoted writing and literacy
this led to high levels of literacy among some traditional buddhist societies such as burma
according to david steinberg early british observers claimed that burma was the most literate state between suez and japan and one british traveler in the early nineteenth century believed that burmese women had a higher percentage of literacy than british women
buddhist institutions were also at the forefront of the adoption of chinese technologies related to bookmaking including papermaking and block printing which buddhists often deployed on a large scale
examples of the early buddhist adoption of these technologies are a buddhist charm which is the first surviving printed text the chinese diamond sutra c
which is the first full printed book and the first hand colored print which is an illustration of guanyin dated to
in the western world buddhism has had a strong influence on modern new age spirituality and other alternative spiritualities
this began with its influence on th century theosophists such as helena blavatsky which were some of the first westerners to take buddhism seriously as a spiritual tradition
more recently buddhist meditation practices have influenced the development of modern psychology particularly the practice of mindfulness based stress reduction mbsr and other similar mindfulness based modalities
the influence of buddhism on psychology can also be seen in certain forms of modern psychoanalysis
buddhism also influenced the modern avant garde movements during the s and s through people like d
suzuki and his influence on figures like jack kerouac and allen ginsberg
shamanism is a widespread practice in buddhist societies
buddhist monasteries have long existed alongside local shamanic traditions
lacking an institutional orthodoxy buddhists adapted to the local cultures blending their own traditions with pre existing shamanic culture
there was very little conflict between the sects mostly limited to the shamanic practice of animal sacrifice which buddhists see as equivalent to killing one s parents
however buddhism requires acceptance of buddha as the greatest being in the cosmos and local shamanic traditions were bestowed an inferior status
research into himalayan religion has shown that buddhist and shamanic traditions overlap in many respects the worship of localized deities healing rituals and exorcisms
the shamanic gurung people have adopted some of the buddhist beliefs such and rebirth but maintain the shamanic rites of guiding the soul after death
geoffrey samuel describes shamanic buddhism vajrayana buddhism as practiced in tibet may be described as shamanic in that it is centered around communication with an alternative mode of reality via the alternative states of consciousness of tantric yoga
buddhism is practised by an estimated million million or million people as of the s representing to of the world s total population
china is the country with the largest population of buddhists approximately million or of its total population
they are mostly followers of chinese schools of mahayana making this the largest body of buddhist traditions
mahayana also practised in broader east asia is followed by over half of world buddhists
according to a demographic analysis reported by peter harvey mahayana has million adherents theravada has million adherents and vajrayana has million adherents
according to johnson grim buddhism has grown from a total of million adherents in of which million were in asia to million in of which million are in asia
over of all buddhists live in the asia pacific and south asia region
north america had about million buddhists europe million while south america africa and the middle east had an estimated combined total of about million buddhists in
buddhism is the dominant religion in bhutan myanmar cambodia hong kong japan tibet laos macau mongolia singapore sri lanka thailand and vietnam
large buddhist populations live in mainland china taiwan north korea nepal and south korea
in russia buddhists form majority in tuva and kalmykia
buryatia and zabaykalsky krai also have significant buddhist populations
buddhism is also growing by conversion
in new zealand about of the total buddhists are converts to buddhism
buddhism has also spread to the nordic countries for example the burmese buddhists founded in the city of kuopio in north savonia the first buddhist monastery of finland named the buddha dhamma ramsi monastery
