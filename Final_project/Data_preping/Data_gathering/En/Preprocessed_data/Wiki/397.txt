dukkha translated incapable satisfying unsatisfactory nature general insecurity conditioned phenomenon painful dukkha commonly translated suffering inaccurate since refers episodic suffering intrinsically unsatisfactory nature temporary state thing including pleasant temporary experiences
expect happiness state thing impermanent therefore cannot attain real happiness
buddhism dukkha one three mark existence along impermanence anatt non-self
buddhism like major indian religion asserts everything impermanent anicca unlike also asserts permanent self soul living anatt
ignorance misperception avijj anything permanent self considered wrong understanding primary source clinging dukkha

theravada tradition regard insight four truth liberating itself
sasra mean wandering world connotation cyclic circuitous change
refers theory rebirth cyclicality life matter existence fundamental assumption buddhism major indian religions
samsara buddhism considered dukkha unsatisfactory painful perpetuated desire avidya ignorance resulting karma
liberation cycle existence nirvana ha foundation important historical justification buddhism
buddhist text assert rebirth occur six realm existence namely three good realm heavenly demi-god human three evil realm animal hungry ghost hellish
samsara end person attains nirvana blowing affliction insight impermanence non-self
rebirth refers process whereby go succession lifetime one many possible form sentient life running conception death
buddhist thought rebirth doe involve soul fixed substance
buddhist doctrine anatt sanskrit antman no-self doctrine reject concept permanent self unchanging eternal soul found religions
buddhist tradition traditionally disagreed person reborn well quickly rebirth occurs death
buddhist tradition assert self doctrine mean enduring self avacya inexpressible personality pudgala migrates one life another
majority buddhist tradition contrast assert vijna person's consciousness though evolving exists continuum mechanistic basis undergoes rebirth process
quality one's rebirth depends merit demerit gained one's karma ie
buddhism also developed complex cosmology explain various realm plane rebirth
individual rebirth take place within one five realm according theravadins six according school heavenly demi-gods human animal hungry ghost hellish
east asian tibetan buddhism rebirth instantaneous intermediate state tibetan bardo one life next

existence karma core belief buddhism major indian religion implies neither fatalism everything happens person caused karma
central aspect buddhist theory karma intent cetan matter essential bring consequence phala fruit vipka result
however good bad karma accumulates even physical action ill good thought creates karmic seed thus action body speech mind lead karmic seeds
buddhist tradition life aspect affected law karma past current birth include form rebirth realm rebirth social class character major circumstance lifetime

nirvana state ha described buddhist text partly manner similar indian religion state complete liberation enlightenment highest happiness bliss fearlessness freedom permanence non-dependent origination unfathomable indescribable
ha also described part differently state spiritual release marked emptiness realisation non-self
buddhism considers liberation sasra ultimate spiritual goal traditional practice primary focus vast majority lay buddhist ha seek accumulate merit good deed donation monk various buddhist ritual order gain better rebirth rather nirvana
pratityasamutpada also called dependent arising dependent origination buddhist theory explain nature relation becoming existence ultimate reality
physical mental state depend arise pre-existing state turn arise dependent state cease
'dependent arisings' causal conditioning thus pratityasamutpada buddhist belief causality basis ontology creator god ontological vedic concept called universal self brahman 'transcendent creative principle'
however buddhist thought doe understand causality term newtonian mechanic rather understands conditioned arising
buddhism dependent arising refers condition created plurality cause necessarily co-originate phenomenon within across lifetime karma one life creating condition lead rebirth one realm existence another lifetime
buddhism applies theory dependent arising explain origination endless cycle dukkha rebirth twelve nidnas twelve links

based indian principle ahimsa non-harming buddha's ethic strongly condemn harming sentient including animals
thus condemned animal sacrifice brahmin well hunting killing animal food
led various policy buddhist king asoka meant protect animal establishing 'no slaughter days' banning hunting certain circumstances
however early buddhist text depict buddha allowing monastic eat meat
seems monastic begged food thus supposed accept whatever food wa offered them
wa tempered rule meat three time clean meant seen heard reason suspect animal killed meat could given them
also buddha explicitly promote vegetarianism discourse state gaining one's livelihood meat trade wa unethical
however rule wa promotion specific diet rule actual killing animal food
wa also famed schism occurred buddhist community devadatta attempted make vegetarianism compulsory buddha disagreed
contrast various mahayana sutra text like mahaparinirvana sutra surangama sutra lankavatara sutra state buddha promoted vegetarianism compassion
indian mahayana thinker like shantideva promoted avoidance meat
throughout history issue whether buddhist vegetarian ha remained much debated topic variety opinion issue among modern buddhists
east asian buddhism monastic expected vegetarian practice seen virtuous taken devout laypersons
theravadins sri lanka southeast asia practice vegetarianism eat whatever offered lay community mostly also vegetarians
exception monk choose vegetarian abbot like ajahn sumedho encouraged lay community donate vegetarian food monks
mahasi sayadaw meanwhile ha recommended vegetarianism best way make sure one's meal pure three ways
also new religious movement santi asoke promotes vegetarianism
according peter harvey theravada world vegetarianism universally admired little practiced rule killing many buddhist country butcher others work meat trade non-buddhists
likewise tibetan buddhist historically tended vegetarian however strong debate pro-vegetarian argument pro-vegetarian tibetans
influential figure spoken written favor vegetarianism throughout history including well known figure like shabkar karmapa ogyen trinley dorje ha mandated vegetarianism monasteries
buddhism like indian religion wa initially oral tradition ancient times
buddha's word early doctrine concept traditional interpretation orally transmitted one generation next
earliest oral text transmitted middle indo-aryan language called prakrit pali use communal recitation mnemonic techniques
first buddhist canonical text likely written sri lanka year buddha died
text part tripitakas many version appeared thereafter claiming word buddha
scholarly buddhist commentary text named author appeared india around nd century ce
text written pali sanskrit sometimes regional language palm-leaf manuscript birch bark painted scroll carved temple wall later paper
