this and the subsequent more clearly country influenced albums john wesley harding and nashville skyline have been seen as creating the genre of country folk a route pursued by a number of largely acoustic folk musicians
dylan s lead was also followed by the byrds who were joined by gram parsons in
parsons had mixed country with rock blues and folk to create what he called cosmic american music
earlier in the year parsons had released safe at home although the principal recording for the album had taken place in mid with the international submarine band which made extensive use of pedal steel and is seen by some as the first true country rock album

the byrds hired guitarist clarence white and drummer gene parsons both from the country band nashville west
the flying burrito brothers recorded the albums the gilded palace of sin and burrito deluxe which helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre before parsons departed to pursue a solo career
country rock was a particularly popular style in the california music scene of the late s and was adopted by bands including hearts and flowers poco formed by richie furay and jim messina formerly of the buffalo springfield and new riders of the purple sage
some folk rockers followed the byrds into the genre among them the beau brummels and the nitty gritty dirt band

one of the few acts to successfully move from the country side towards rock were the bluegrass band the dillards
doug dillard left the band to form the group dillard clark with ex byrds member gene clark and bernie leadon
the greatest commercial success for country rock came in the s with the doobie brothers mixing in elements of r b emmylou harris the former singer with parsons becoming a star on country radio and linda ronstadt the queen of country rock creating a highly successful pop oriented brand of the genre
pure prairie league formed in ohio in by craig fuller had both critical and commercial success with straight top lp releases including bustin out acclaimed by allmusic critic richard foss as an album that is unequaled in country rock and two lane highway described by rolling stone as a worthy companion to the likes of the byrds sweetheart of the rodeo and other gems of the genre
former poco and buffalo springfield member jim messina joined kenny loggins in a very successful duo while former members of ronstadt s backing band went on to form the eagles two members of which were from the flying burrito brothers and poco who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time producing albums that included desperado and hotel california
however the principal country rock influence in the eagles came from bernie leadon formerly of the flying burrito brothers and the eagles are perceived as shifting towards hard rock after he left the band in late

japan even took influence in the s with country rock mainly in the kayokyoku genre
artists such as takuro yoshida kousetsu minami and his band kaguyahime
