dirigisme or dirigism from french diriger to direct is an economic doctrine in which the state plays a strong directive role as opposed to a merely regulatory interventionist role over a capitalist market economy
as an economic doctrine dirigisme is the opposite of laissez faire stressing a positive role for state intervention in curbing alleged productive inefficiencies and market failures
dirigiste policies often include indicative planning state directed investment and the use of market instruments taxes and subsidies to incentivize market entities to fulfill state economic objectives
the term emerged in the post war era to describe the economic policies of france which included substantial state directed investment the use of indicative economic planning to supplement the market mechanism and the establishment of state enterprises in strategic domestic sectors
it coincided with both the period of substantial economic and demographic growth known as the trente glorieuses which followed the war and the slowdown beginning with the oil crisis
the term has subsequently been used to classify other economies that pursued similar policies most notably the east asian tiger economies of hong kong singapore south korea and the republic of china roc and more recently the economy of the people s republic of china prc after the chinese economic reform
most modern economies can be characterized as dirigist to some degree as the state may exercise directive action by performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies through government procurement especially military or through state run research institutes
before the second world war france had a relatively fragmented capitalist economic system
the many small companies often family owned were often not dynamic and efficient in comparison to the large industrial groups in germany or the united states
the second world war laid waste to france
railroads and industries were destroyed by aerial bombardment and sabotage industries were seized by nazi germany in the immediate postwar years loomed the spectre of long years of rationing such as the system enforced in that period in the united kingdom
some sections of the french business and political world lost authority after collaborating with the german occupiers
post war french governments from whichever political side generally sought rational efficient economic development with the long term goal of matching the highly developed and technologically advanced economy of the united states
the development of french dirigisme coincided with the development of meritocratic technocracy the cole nationale d administration supplied the state with high level administrators while leadership positions in industry were staffed with corps of mines state engineers and other personnel trained at the cole polytechnique
during the period france experienced unprecedented economic growth on average and a demographic boom leading to the coinage of the term trente glorieuses the glorious thirty years
dirigisme flourished under the conservative governments of charles de gaulle and georges pompidou
in those times the policy was viewed as a middle way between the american policy of little state involvement and the soviet policy of total state control
in socialist president fran ois mitterrand was elected promising greater state enterprise in the economy his government soon nationalised industries and banks
however in the initial bad economic results forced the government to renounce dirigisme and start the era of rigueur rigour
this was primarily due to the inflation of the french franc and the keynesian policies taken by fran ois mitterrand
dirigisme has remained out of favour with subsequent governments though some of its traits remain
the main french tool under dirigisme was indicative planning through plans designed by the commissariat g n ral du plan commission for the plan
indicative planning used various incentives to induce public and private actors to behave in an optimal fashion with the plan serving as a general guideline for optimal investment
during this period france never ceased to be a capitalist economy directed by the accumulation of capital profit maximizing enterprise and market based allocation of producer goods
in contrast to soviet type central planning practiced in the former soviet bloc where economic planning substituted private profit incentivized investment and operated the factors of production according to a binding plan the french state never owned more than a minority of industry and did not seek to replace private profit with central planning
the idea of dirigisme is to complement and improve the efficiency of the market through indirect planning intended to provide better information to market participants
this concept is held in contrast to a planned economy which aims to replace market based allocation of production and investment with a binding plan of production expressed in units of physical quantities
because french industry prior to the second world war was weak due to fragmentation the french government encouraged mergers and the formation of national champions large industry groups backed by the state
two areas where the french government sought greater control were in infrastructure and the transportation system
the french government owned the national railway company sncf the national electricity utility edf the national natural gas utility gdf the national airline air france phone and postal services were operated as the ptt administration
the government chose to devolve the construction of most autoroutes freeways to semi private companies rather than to administer them itself
other areas where the french government directly intervened were defense nuclear and aerospace industries a rospatiale
this development was marked by volontarisme the belief that difficulties e g
postwar devastation lack of natural resources could be overcome through willpower and ingenuity
for instance following the energy crisis the saying in france we don t have oil but we have ideas was coined
volontarisme emphasized modernization resulting in a variety of ambitious state plans
examples of this trend include the extensive use of nuclear energy close to of french electrical consumption the minitel an early online system for the masses and the tgv a high speed rail network
dirigisme is seen in india but was especially prevalent during pre liberalisation period
after the end of british rule domestic policy in india tended towards protectionism with a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialisation economic interventionism a large government run public sector business regulation and central planning while trade and foreign investment policies were relatively liberal
however in regards to trade and foreign investment other authors disagree stating that high tariff barriers were maintained with import duties of not being uncommon and there was also severe restrictions on the entry of foreign goods capital and technology
in fy india s gdp growth grew to under the planned economy
after india shifted from a planned dirigisme to market dirigisme economy
the state has complete control and ownership of railways highways majority control and stake in banking insurance farming dairy fertilizers chemicals airports nuclear mining digitization defense steel rare earths water electricity oil and gas industries and power plants and has substantial control over digitalization broadband as national infrastructure telecommunication supercomputing space port and shipping industries among other industries were effectively nationalised in the mid s
indian government has indirect control on all sector except technology and consumer goods
economic dirigisme has been described as an inherent aspect of fascist economies by hungarian author iv n t
berend in his book an economic history of twentieth century europe
however the fascist systems created by benito mussolini italy ant nio salazar portugal francisco franco spain emperor hirohito japan and adolf hitler germany are a varied mix of elements from numerous philosophies including nationalism authoritarianism militarism corporatism collectivism totalitarianism and anti communism
dirigisme has been brought up as a politico economic scheme at odds with laissez faire capitalism in the context of french overseas holdings
to varying degrees throughout the post colonial period countries such as lebanon and syria have been influenced by this motif
