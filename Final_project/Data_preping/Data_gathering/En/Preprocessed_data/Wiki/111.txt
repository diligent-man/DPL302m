enoch i n k listen is a biblical figure and patriarch prior to noah s flood and the son of jared and father of methuselah
he was of the antediluvian period in the hebrew bible
the text of the book of genesis says enoch lived years before he was taken by god
the text reads that enoch walked with god and he was no more for god took him gen which is interpreted as enoch s entering heaven alive in some jewish and christian traditions and interpreted differently in others
enoch is the subject of many jewish and christian traditions
he was considered the author of the book of enoch and also called the scribe of judgment
in the new testament enoch is referenced in the gospel of luke the epistle to the hebrews and in the epistle of jude the last of which also quotes from it
enoch appears in the book of genesis of the pentateuch as the seventh of the ten pre deluge patriarchs
genesis recounts that each of the pre flood patriarchs lived for several centuries
genesis provides a genealogy of these ten figures from adam to noah providing the age at which each fathered the next and the age of each figure at death
enoch is considered by many to be the exception who is said to not see death hebrews
furthermore genesis states that enoch lived for years which is shorter than other pre flood patriarchs who are all recorded as dying at over years of age
the brief account of enoch in genesis ends with the cryptic note that he was not for god took him
this happens years after adam s death and years before noah s birth
three extensive apocrypha are attributed to enoch
the book of enoch aka enoch composed in hebrew or aramaic and preserved in ge ez first brought to europe by james bruce from ethiopia and translated into english by august dillmann and reverent schoode recognized by the orthodox tewahedo churches and usually dated between the third century bc and the first century ad
enoch aka book of the secrets of enoch preserved in old church slavonic and first translated in english by william morfill usually dated to the first century ad
enoch a rabbinic text in hebrew usually dated to the fifth century ad these recount how enoch was taken up to heaven and was appointed guardian of all the celestial treasures chief of the archangels and the immediate attendant on the throne of god
he was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries and with all the angels at his back fulfils of his own accord whatever comes out of the mouth of god executing his decrees
some esoteric literature such as enoch identifies enoch as the metatron the angel which communicates god s word
in consequence enoch was seen by this literature and the rabbinic kabbalah of jewish mysticism as the one who communicated god s revelation to moses and in particular as the dictator of the book of jubilees
the book of giants is a jewish pseudepigraphal work from the third century bc and resembles the book of enoch
fragments from at least six and as many as eleven copies were found among the dead sea scrolls collections
the third century bc translators who produced the septuagint in koine greek rendered the phrase god took him with the greek verb metatithemi meaning moving from one place to another
sirach from about the same period states that enoch pleased god and was translated into paradise that he may give repentance to the nations the greek word used here for paradise paradeisos was derived from an ancient persian word meaning enclosed garden and was used in the septuagint to describe the garden of eden
later however the term became synonymous for heaven as is the case here
in classical rabbinical literature there are various views of enoch
one view regarding enoch that was found in the targum pseudo jonathan which thought of enoch as a pious man taken to heaven and receiving the title of safra rabba great scribe
after christianity was completely separated from judaism this view became the prevailing rabbinical idea of enoch s character and exaltation
according to rashi from genesis rabbah enoch was a righteous man but he could easily be swayed to return to do evil
therefore the holy one blessed be he hastened and took him away and caused him to die before his time
for this reason scripture changed the wording in the account of his demise and wrote and he was no longer in the world to complete his years
among the minor midrashim esoteric attributes of enoch are expanded upon
in the sefer hekalot rabbi ishmael is described as having visited the seventh heaven where he met enoch who claims that earth had in his time been corrupted by the demons shammazai and azazel and so enoch was taken to heaven to prove that god was not cruel
similar traditions are recorded in sirach
later elaborations of this interpretation treated enoch as having been a pious ascetic who called to mix with others preached repentance and gathered despite the small number of people on earth a vast collection of disciples to the extent that he was proclaimed king
under his wisdom peace is said to have reigned on earth to the extent that he is summoned to heaven to rule over the sons of god
the new testament contains three references to enoch
the first is a brief mention in one of the genealogies of the ancestors of jesus in the gospel of luke
the second mention is in the epistle to the hebrews which says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god hebrews kjv
this suggests he did not experience the mortal death ascribed to adam s other descendants which is consistent with genesis kjv which says and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him
the third mention is in the epistle of jude where the author attributes to enoch the seventh from adam a passage not found in catholic and protestant canons of the old testament
the quotation is believed by most modern scholars to be taken from enoch which exists in greek in ge ez as part of the ethiopian orthodox canon and also in aramaic among the dead sea scrolls
though the same scholars recognise that enoch itself is a midrash of deuteronomy the introductory phrase enoch the seventh from adam is also found in enoch en
though not in the old testament
in the new testament this enoch prophesies to ungodly men that god shall come with his holy ones to judge and convict them jude
the book of enoch was excluded from both the hebrew tanakh and the greek translation of the hebrew bible the septuagint
it was not considered canon by either jewish or early christian readers
church fathers such as justin martyr athenagoras of athens irenaeus clement of alexandria origen tertullian and lactantius all speak highly of enoch and contain many allusions to the book of enoch as well as in some instances advocating explicitly for the use of the book of enoch as scripture
because of the letter of jude s citation of the book of enoch as prophetic text this encouraged acceptance and usage of the book of enoch in early christian circles
the main themes of enoch about the watchers corrupting humanity were commonly mentioned in early literature
this positive treatment of the book of enoch was associated with millennialism which was popular in the early church
when amillennialism began to be common in christianity the book of enoch being incompatible with amillennialism started to be rejected widespread and with the split of the oriental orthodox from the catholic church in the th century use of the book of enoch was limited primarily to the oriental orthodox church
eventually the usage of the book of enoch became limited to ethiopian circles of the oriental orthodox church
another common element that some church fathers like john of damascus spoke of was that they considered enoch to be one of the two witnesses mentioned in the book of revelation
this view still has many supporters today in christianity
among the latter day saint movement and particularly in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints enoch is viewed as having founded an exceptionally righteous city named zion in the midst of an otherwise wicked world
this view is encountered in the standard works the pearl of great price and the doctrine and covenants which states that not only enoch but the entire peoples of the city of zion were taken off this earth without death because of their piety
zion is defined as the pure in heart and this city of zion will return to the earth at the second coming of jesus the doctrine and covenants further states that enoch prophesied that one of his descendants noah and his family would survive a great flood and thus carry on the human race and preserve the scripture
the book of moses in the pearl of great price includes chapters that give an account of enoch s preaching visions and conversations with god
they provide details concerning the wars violence and natural disasters in enoch s day but also reference the miracles performed by enoch
the book of moses is itself an excerpt from joseph smith s translation of the bible which is published in full complete with these chapters concerning enoch by community of christ in the joseph smith translation of the bible where it appears as part of the book of genesis
d c cofc lds states that adam ordained enoch to the higher priesthood now called the melchizedek after the great king and high priest at age that he was when adam blessed him and that he lived for an additional years until he and his city were blessed making enoch years old at the time that he was not for god took him genesis
additionally in lds theology enoch is implied to be the scribe who recorded adam s blessings and prophecies at adam ondi ahman as recorded in d c lds d c b cofc
in islam enoch arabic romanized akhn kh is commonly identified with idris as for example by the history of al tabari interpretation and the meadows of gold
the quran contains two references to idris in surah al anbiya the prophets verse number and in surah maryam mary verses
the prophets and the same blessing was bestowed upon ismail and idris and zul kifl because they all practised fortitude
mary and remember idris in the book he was indeed very truthful a prophet
and we lifted him to a lofty station idris is closely linked in muslim tradition with the origin of writing and other technical arts of civilization including the study of astronomical phenomena both of which enoch is credited with in the testament of abraham
nonetheless although some muslims view enoch and idris as the same prophet while others do not many muslims still honor enoch as one of the earliest prophets regardless of which view they hold
idris seems to be less mysterious in the qur an than enoch is in the bible
furthermore idris is the only antediluvian prophet named in the qur an other than adam
