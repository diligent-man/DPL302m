stochastic greek stkhos 'aim guess' refers property well described random probability distribution
although stochasticity randomness distinct former refers modeling approach latter refers phenomenon two term often used synonymously
furthermore probability theory formal concept stochastic process also referred random process
stochasticity used many different field including natural science biology chemistry ecology neuroscience physic well technology engineering field image processing signal processing information theory computer science cryptography telecommunications
also used finance due seemingly random change financial market well medicine linguistics music medium colour theory botany manufacturing geomorphology
word stochastic english wa originally used adjective definition pertaining conjecturing stemming greek word meaning aim mark guess oxford english dictionary give year earliest occurrence
work probability ar conjectandi originally published latin jakob bernoulli used phrase ar conjectandi sive stochastice ha translated art conjecturing stochastics
phrase wa used reference bernoulli ladislaus bortkiewicz wrote german word stochastik sense meaning random
term stochastic process first appeared english paper joseph doob
term specific mathematical definition doob cited another paper term stochastischer proze wa used german aleksandr khinchin though german term used earlier andrey kolmogorov
early aleksandr khinchin gave first mathematical definition stochastic process family random variable indexed real line
fundamental work probability theory stochastic process wa done khinchin well mathematician andrey kolmogorov joseph doob william feller maurice frchet paul lvy wolfgang doeblin harald cramr
decade later cramr referred heroic period mathematical probability theory
mathematics theory stochastic process important contribution probability theory continues active topic research theory applications
example include stochastic matrix describes stochastic process known markov process stochastic calculus involves differential equation integral based stochastic process wiener process also called brownian motion process
