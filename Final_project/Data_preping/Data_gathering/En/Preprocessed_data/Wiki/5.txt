sharia ri arabic romanized shar a a ri a is a body of religious law that forms part of the islamic tradition
it is derived from the religious precepts of islam and is based on the sacred scriptures of islam particularly the quran and the hadith
in arabic the term shar ah refers to god s immutable divine law and is contrasted with fiqh which refers to its human scholarly interpretations
the manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between muslims and secularists
traditional theory of islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources of sharia the quran sunnah authentic hadith qiyas analogical reasoning and ijma juridical consensus
different legal schools of which the most prominent are hanafi maliki shafi i hanbali and ja fari developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ijtihad
traditional jurisprudence fiqh distinguishes two principal branches of law ib d t rituals and mu mal t social relations which together comprise a wide range of topics
its rulings are concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms assigning actions to one of five categories mandatory recommended neutral abhorred and prohibited
fiqh was elaborated over the centuries by legal opinions fatwas issued by qualified jurists muftis and historically applied in sharia courts by ruler appointed judges complemented by various economic criminal and administrative laws issued by muslim rulers
in the modern era traditional laws in the muslim world have been widely replaced by statutes inspired by european models
judicial procedures and legal education were likewise brought in line with european practice
while the constitutions of most muslim majority states contain references to sharia its rules are largely retained only in family law
the legislators who codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence
the islamic revival of the late th century brought along calls by islamism movements for full implementation of sharia including hudud corporal punishments such as stoning
in some cases this resulted in traditionalist legal reform while other countries witnessed juridical reinterpretation of sharia advocated by progressive reformers
in the st century the role of sharia has become an increasingly contested topic around the world
the introduction of sharia based laws has been cited as a cause of conflict in some african countries such as nigeria and sudan and some jurisdictions in north america have passed bans on use of sharia framed as restrictions on religious or foreign laws
there are ongoing theoretical debates as to whether sharia is compatible with democracy human rights freedom of thought women s rights lgbt rights and banking
the european court of human rights in strasbourg ecthr ruled in several cases that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy
some traditional practices include serious violations of human rights especially on women and freedom of religion
the word shar ah is used by arabic speaking peoples of the middle east to designate a prophetic religion in its totality
for example shar at m s means law or religion of moses and shar atu n can mean our religion in reference to any monotheistic faith
within islamic discourse ar ah refers to religious regulations governing the lives of muslims
for many muslims the word means simply justice and they will consider any law that promotes justice and social welfare to conform to sharia
jan michiel otto distinguishes four senses conveyed by the term sharia in religious legal and political discourse
divine abstract sharia god s plan for mankind and the norms of behavior which should guide the islamic community
muslims of different perspectives agree in their respect for the abstract notion of sharia but they differ in how they understand the practical implications of the term
classical sharia the body of rules and principles elaborated by islamic jurists during the first centuries of islam
historical sharia s the body of rules and interpretations developed throughout islamic history ranging from personal beliefs to state legislation and varying across an ideological spectrum
classical sharia has often served as a point of reference for these variants but they have also reflected the influences of their time and place
contemporary sharia s the full spectrum of rules and interpretations that are developed and practiced at present a related term al q n n al isl m islamic law which was borrowed from european usage in the late th century is used in the muslim world to refer to a legal system in the context of a modern state
the primary range of meanings of the arabic word ar ah derived from the root r is related to religion and religious law
the lexicographical tradition records two major areas of use where the word ar ah can appear without religious connotation
in texts evoking a pastoral or nomadic environment the word and its derivatives refer to watering animals at a permanent water hole or to the seashore with special reference to animals who come there
another area of use relates to notions of stretched or lengthy
this range of meanings is cognate with the hebrew sara and is likely to be the origin of the meaning way or path
both these areas have been claimed to have given rise to aspects of the religious meaning
some scholars describe the word ar ah as an archaic arabic word denoting pathway to be followed analogous to the hebrew term halakhah the way to go or path to the water hole and argue that its adoption as a metaphor for a divinely ordained way of life arises from the importance of water in an arid desert environment
in the quran ar ah and its cognate ir ah occur once each with the meaning way or path
the word ar ah was widely used by arabic speaking jews during the middle ages being the most common translation for the word torah in the th century arabic translation of the torah by sa adya gaon
a similar use of the term can be found in christian writers
the arabic expression shar at all h god s law is a common translation for god s law in hebrew and god s law in greek in the new testament rom
in muslim literature ar ah designates the laws or message of a prophet or god in contrast to fiqh which refers to a scholar s interpretation thereof
in older english language law related works in the late th early th centuries the word used for sharia was sheri
it along with the french variant ch ri was used during the time of the ottoman empire and is from the turkish er i
a similar legal concept eye for an eye first recorded in the code of hammurabi
qisas was a practice used as a resolution tool in inter tribal conflicts in pre islamic arab society
the basis of this resolution was that a member from the tribe to which the murderer belonged was handed over to the victim s family for execution equivalent to the social status of the murdered person
the condition of social equivalence meant the execution of a member of the murderer s tribe who was equivalent to the murdered in that the murdered person was male or female slave or free elite or commonone
for example only one slave could be killed for a slave and a woman for a woman
in these cases compensatory payment diyya could be paid to the family of the murdered person
on this pre islamic understanding added a debate about whether a muslim can be executed for a non muslim during the islamic period
the main verse for implementation in islam is al baqara verse
believers retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed
free versus free captive versus captive woman versus woman
whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price let him abide by the custom and pay the price well
according to the traditional muslim view the major precepts of sharia were passed down directly from the islamic prophet muhammad without historical development and the emergence of islamic jurisprudence fiqh also goes back to the lifetime of muhammad
in this view his companions and followers took what he did and approved of as a model sunnah and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of hadith
these reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists abu hanifah malik ibn anas al shafi i and ahmad ibn hanbal who are viewed as the founders of the hanafi maliki shafi i and hanbali legal schools madhhabs of sunni jurisprudence
modern historians have presented alternative theories of the formation of fiqh
at first western scholars accepted the general outlines of the traditional account
in the late th century an influential revisionist hypothesis was advanced by ignac goldziher and elaborated by joseph schacht in the mid th century
schacht and other scholars argued that having conquered much more populous agricultural and urban societies with already existing laws and legal needs the initial muslim efforts to formulate legal norms
regarded the quran and muhammad s hadiths as just one source of law with jurist personal opinions the legal practice of conquered peoples and the decrees and decisions of the caliphs also being valid sources
according to this theory most canonical hadiths did not originate with muhammad but were actually created at a later date despite the efforts of hadith scholars to weed out fabrications
after it became accepted that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources proponents of rules of jurisprudence supported by the hadith would extend the chains of transmission of the hadith back to muhammad s companions
in his view the real architect of islamic jurisprudence was al shafi i d
ce ah who formulated this idea that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources and other elements of classical legal theory in his work al risala but who was preceded by a body of islamic law not based on primacy of muhammad s hadiths
while the origin of hadith remains a subject of scholarly controversy this theory of goldziher and schacht has given rise to objections and modern historians generally adopt more cautious intermediate positions
and it is generally accepted that early islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of islam
it continued some aspects of pre islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under muslim rule in the aftermath of the early conquests and modified other aspects aiming to meet the practical need of establishing islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the early muslim communities
juristic thought gradually developed in study circles where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics
at first these circles were fluid in their membership but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles
as the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times who was henceforth identified as the school s founder
in the course of the first three centuries of islam all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory according to which islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the quran and hadith
fiqh is traditionally divided into the fields of u l al fiqh lit
the roots of fiqh which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence and fur al fiqh lit
the branches of fiqh which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles
classical jurists held that human reason is a gift from god which should be exercised to its fullest capacity
however they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong and that rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the quran and through the sunnah of muhammad
traditional theory of islamic jurisprudence elaborates how scriptures should be interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric
it also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date
in addition to the quran and sunnah the classical theory of sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law juristic consensus ijma and analogical reasoning qiyas
it therefore studies the application and limits of analogy as well as the value and limits of consensus along with other methodological principles some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools
this interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of ijtihad which refers to a jurist s exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question
the theory of twelver shia jurisprudence parallels that of sunni schools with some differences such as recognition of reason aql as a source of law in place of qiyas and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams
islamic scholar sayyid rashid rida c e lists the four basic sources of islamic law agreed upon by all sunni muslims the well known sources of legislation in islam are four the qur an the sunnah the consensus of the ummah and ijtihad undertaken by competent jurists
quran in islam the quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law
classical jurists held its textual integrity to be beyond doubt on account of it having been handed down by many people in each generation which is known as recurrence or concurrent transmission taw tur
only several hundred verses of the quran have direct legal relevance and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means
hadith the body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic
early islamic scholars developed a methodology for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains
these criteria narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand sound hadiths which were collected in several canonical compilations
the hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed unquestionably authentic however the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge
the uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and quranic passages
disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings
ijma it is the consensus that could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty
this classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the islamic community could never agree on an error
this form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation acting as representatives of the community
however the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development
a more pragmatic form of consensus which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion
the cases for which there was a consensus account form less than percent of the body of classical jurisprudence
qiyas it is the analogical reasoning that is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally based rule
in a classic example the quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances on the basis of the cause illa shared by these situations which in this case is identified to be intoxication
since the cause of a rule may not be apparent its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate
majority of sunni muslims view qiyas as a central pillar of ijtihad
on the other hand zahirites ahmad ibn hanbal al bukhari early hanbalites etc rejected qiyas amongst the sunnis
twelver shia jurisprudence also does not recognize the use of qiyas but relies on reason aql in its place
the classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods which were not adopted by all legal schools such as istihsan juristic preference istislah consideration of public interest and istishab presumption of continuity
a jurist who is qualified to practice ijtihad is known as a mujtahid
the use of independent reasoning to arrive at a ruling is contrasted with taqlid imitation which refers to following the rulings of a mujtahid
by the beginning of the th century development of sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted
from the th century on leading muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad which they saw as a return to the vitality of early islamic jurisprudence
maq id aims or purposes of sharia and ma la a welfare or public interest are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times
they were first clearly articulated by al ghazali d
who argued that maslaha was god s general purpose in revealing the divine law and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well being religion life intellect offspring and property
although most classical era jurists recognized maslaha and maqasid as important legal principles they held different views regarding the role they should play in islamic law
some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning
others regarded them as an independent source of law whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture
while the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence
these scholars expanded the inventory of maqasid to include such aims of sharia as reform and women s rights rashid rida justice and freedom mohammed al ghazali and human dignity and rights yusuf al qaradawi
fiqh is concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms seeking to establish not only what is and is not legal but also what is morally right and wrong
sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as the five decisions al a k m al khamsa mandatory far or w jib recommended mand b or musta abb neutral mub reprehensible makr h and forbidden ar m
it is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action
reprehensible acts should be avoided but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court
avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife while neutral actions entail no judgment from god
jurists disagree on whether the term al l covers the first three or the first four categories
the legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity ar ra and on the underlying intention niyya as expressed in the legal maxim acts are evaluated according to intention
these actions have material or moral equivalents in the classical understanding of sharia
the abandonment of the actions that are considered fard wajib and sunnah and doing the things that are considered makruh and haram are penalized as hadd or tazir punishments
in the understanding of sharia peoples are not only divided into classes such as free slave male and female but also classified according to their beliefs and behaviors as muslims muttaki fasiq mulhid apostate dhimmi etc and are exposed to the rights or deprivations of these classes
this separation can have light consequences such as the rejection of testimony in courts severe consequences such as the burning of apostates and mulhids and it manifests itself in many areas such as inheritance death compensation retaliation qisas administrator or judge appointments
there is also a distinction between married and unmarried in adultery zina punishments
legal rights and responsibilities in sharia begins at puberty baligh
constant committing of minor sins or the major sins that do not require greater punishment which are described as wickedness fisq in fiqh terminology are punished by the judge s discretion without a certain limit and measure
in tazir punishments there is no obligation to prove the crime principle of legality by witnessing or similar mechanisms
the domain of fur al fiqh lit
branches of fiqh is traditionally divided into ib d t rituals or acts of worship and mu mal t social relations
many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into the four quarters called rituals sales marriage and injuries
each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects
for example the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships guaranty gifts and bequests among other topics
juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics each called a book kitab
the special significance of ritual was marked by always placing its discussion at the start of the work
some historians distinguish a field of islamic criminal law which combines several traditional categories
several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as hudud
jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply
other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of lex talionis that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime qisas but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation diya or pardon the perpetrator instead only diya is imposed for non intentional harm
other criminal cases belong to the category of ta z r where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge s discretion
in practice since early on in islamic history criminal cases were usually handled by ruler administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia
the two major genres of fur literature are the mukhtasar concise summary of law and the mabsut extensive commentary
mukhtasars were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges
a mabsut which usually provided a commentary on a mukhtasar and could stretch to dozens of large volumes recorded alternative rulings with their justifications often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions
the terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance
at the same time the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions
other juristic genres include the qaw id succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar
classical jurisprudence has been described as one of the major intellectual achievements of islam and its importance in islam has been compared to that of theology in christianity
the main sunni schools of law madhhabs are the hanafi maliki shafi i and hanbali madhhabs
they emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab
these four schools recognize each other s validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries
rulings of these schools are followed across the muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world
for example the maliki school is predominant in north and west africa the hanafi school in south and central asia the shafi i school in lower egypt east africa and southeast asia and the hanbali school in north and central arabia
the first centuries of islam also witnessed a number of short lived sunni madhhabs
the zahiri school which is commonly identified as extinct continues to exert influence over legal thought
the development of shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the twelver zaidi and ismaili madhhabs whose differences from sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among sunni schools
the ibadi legal school distinct from sunni and shia madhhabs is predominant in oman
the transformations of islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system
legal practice in most of the muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system
state law codification commonly utilized the methods of takhayyur selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab and talfiq combining parts of different rulings on the same question
legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws
global islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence
the hanbali school with its particularly strict adherence to the quran and hadith has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the salafi and wahhabi movements
other currents such as networks of indonesian ulema and islamic scholars residing in muslim minority countries have advanced liberal interpretations of islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab
sharia was traditionally interpreted by muftis
during the first few centuries of islam muftis were private legal specialists who normally also held other jobs
they issued fatwas legal opinions generally free of charge in response to questions from laypersons or requests for consultation coming from judges which would be stated in general terms
fatwas were regularly upheld in courts and when they were not it was usually because the fatwa was contradicted by a more authoritative legal opinion
the stature of jurists was determined by their scholarly reputation
the majority of classical legal works written by author jurists were based in large part on fatwas of distinguished muftis
these fatwas functioned as a form of legal precedent unlike court verdicts which were valid only for the given case
although independent muftis never disappeared from the th century onward muslim rulers began to appoint salaried muftis to answer questions from the public
over the centuries sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies while shia jurists in iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era
islamic law was initially taught in study circles that gathered in mosques and private homes
the teacher assisted by advanced students provided commentary on concise treatises of law and examined the students understanding of the text
this tradition continued to be practiced in madrasas which spread during the th and th centuries
madrasas were institutions of higher learning devoted principally to study of law but also offering other subjects such as theology medicine and mathematics
the madrasa complex usually consisted of a mosque boarding house and a library
it was maintained by a waqf charitable endowment which paid salaries of professors stipends of students and defrayed the costs of construction and maintenance
at the end of a course the professor granted a license ijaza certifying a student s competence in its subject matter
students specializing in law would complete a curriculum consisting of preparatory studies the doctrines of a particular madhhab and training in legal disputation and finally write a dissertation which earned them a license to teach and issue fatwas
a judge qadi was in charge of the qadi s court mahkama also called the sharia court
qadis were trained in islamic law though not necessarily to a level required to issue fatwas
court personnel also included a number of assistants performing various roles
judges were theoretically independent in their decisions though they were appointed by the ruler and often experienced pressure from members of the ruling elite where their interests were at play
the role of qadis was to evaluate the evidence establish the facts of the case and issue a verdict based on the applicable rulings of islamic jurisprudence
the qadi was supposed to solicit a fatwa from a mufti if it was unclear how the law should be applied to the case
since islamic legal theory does not recognize the distinction between private and public law court procedures were identical for civil and criminal cases and required a private plaintiff to produce evidence against the defendant
the main type of evidence was oral witness testimony
the standards of evidence for criminal cases were so strict that a conviction was often difficult to obtain even for apparently clear cut cases
most historians believe that because of these stringent procedural norms qadi s courts at an early date lost their jurisdiction over criminal cases which were instead handled in other types of courts
if an accusation did not result in a verdict in a qadi s court the plaintiff could often pursue it in another type of court called the mazalim court administered by the ruler s council
the rationale for mazalim lit
wrongs grievances courts was to address the wrongs that sharia courts were unable to address including complaints against government officials
islamic jurists were commonly in attendance and a judge often presided over the court as a deputy of the ruler
mazalim verdicts were supposed to conform to the spirit of sharia but they were not bound by the letter of the law or the procedural restrictions of qadi s courts
the police shurta which took initiative in preventing and investigating crime operated its own courts
like the mazalim courts police courts were not bound by the rules of sharia and had the powers to inflict discretionary punishments
another office for maintaining public order was the muhtasib market inspector who was charged with preventing fraud in economic transactions and infractions against public morality
the muhtasib took an active role in pursuing these types of offenses and meted out punishments based on local custom
the social fabric of pre modern islamic societies was largely defined by close knit communities organized around kinship groups and local neighborhoods
conflicts between individuals had the potential to escalate into a conflict between their supporting groups and disrupt the life of the entire community
court litigation was seen as a last resort for cases where informal mediation had failed
this attitude was reflected in the legal maxim amicable settlement is the best verdict al sulh sayyid al ahkam
in court disputes qadis were generally less concerned with legal theory than with achieving an outcome that enabled the disputants to resume their previous social relationships
this could be accomplished by avoiding a total loss for the losing side or simply giving them a chance to articulate their position in public and obtain a measure of psychological vindication
islamic law required judges to be familiar with local customs and they exercised a number of other public functions in the community including mediation and arbitration supervision of public works auditing waqf finances and looking after the interests of orphans
unlike pre modern cultures where the ruling dynasty promulgated the law islamic law was formulated by religious scholars without involvement of the rulers
the law derived its authority not from political control but rather from the collective doctrinal positions of the legal schools madhhabs in their capacity as interpreters of the scriptures
the ulema religious scholars were involved in management of communal affairs and acted as representatives of the muslim population vis vis the ruling dynasties who before the modern era had limited capacity for direct governance
military elites relied on the ulema for religious legitimation with financial support for religious institutions being one of the principal means through which these elites established their legitimacy
in turn the ulema depended on the support of the ruling elites for the continuing operation of religious institutions
although the relationship between secular rulers and religious scholars underwent a number of shifts and transformations in different times and places this mutual dependence characterized islamic history until the start of the modern era
additionally since sharia contained few provisions in several areas of public law muslim rulers were able to legislate various collections of economic criminal and administrative laws outside the jurisdiction of islamic jurists the most famous of which is the qanun promulgated by ottoman sultans beginning from the th century
the mughal emperor aurangzeb r
issued a hybrid body of law known as fatawa e alamgiri based on hanafi fatwas as well as decisions of islamic courts and made it applicable to all religious communities on the indian subcontinent
this early attempt to turn islamic law into semi codified state legislation sparked rebellions against mughal rule
in both the rules of civil disputes and application of penal law classical sharia distinguishes between men and women between muslims and non muslims and between free persons and slaves
traditional islamic law assumes a patriarchal society with a man at the head of the household
different legal schools formulated a variety of legal norms which could be manipulated to the advantage of men or women but women were generally at a disadvantage with respect to the rules of inheritance blood money diya and witness testimony where in some cases a woman s value is effectively treated as half of that of a man
various financial obligations imposed on the husband acted as a deterrent against unilateral divorce and commonly gave the wife financial leverage in divorce proceedings
women were active in sharia courts as both plaintiffs and defendants in a wide variety of cases though some opted to be represented by a male relative
sharia was intended to regulate affairs of the muslim community
non muslims residing under islamic rule had the legal status of dhimmi which entailed a number of protections restrictions freedoms and legal inequalities including payment of the jizya tax
dhimmi communities had legal autonomy to adjudicate their internal affairs
cases involving litigants from two different religious groups fell under jurisdiction of sharia courts where unlike in secular courts testimony of non muslim witnesses against a muslim was inadmissible in criminal cases or at all
this legal framework was implemented with varying degree of rigor
in some periods or towns all inhabitants apparently used the same court without regard for their religious affiliation
the mughal emperor aurangzeb imposed islamic law on all his subjects including provisions traditionally applicable only to muslims while some of his predecessors and successors are said to have abolished jizya
according to ottoman records non muslim women took their cases to a sharia court when they expected a more favorable outcome on marital divorce and property questions than in christian and jewish courts
over time non muslims in the ottoman empire could be more or less likely to use islamic courts
for example in at the islamic court in galata only two percent of cases involved non muslims whereas in non muslims were a part of thirty percent of cases
ottoman court records also reflect the use of islamic courts by formerly non muslim women
as it was illegal for non muslims to own muslims and for non muslim men to marry muslim women in the ottoman empire conversion to islam would have been an option for non muslim women to free themselves of a spouse or master they did not want to subject to
however this would likely lead to them being shunned by their former community
classical fiqh acknowledges and regulates slavery as a legitimate institution
it granted slaves certain rights and protections improving their status relative to greek and roman law and restricted the scenarios under which people could be enslaved
however slaves could not inherit or enter into a contract and were subject to their master s will in a number of ways
the labor and property of slaves were owned by the master who was also entitled to sexual submission of his unmarried slaves
formal legal disabilities for some groups coexisted with a legal culture that viewed sharia as a reflection of universal principles of justice which involved protection of the weak against injustices committed by the strong
this conception was reinforced by the historical practice of sharia courts where peasants almost always won cases against oppressive landowners and non muslims often prevailed in disputes against muslims including such powerful figures as the governor of their province
in family matters the sharia court was seen as a place where the rights of women could be asserted against their husband s transgressions
starting from the th century european powers began to extend political influence over lands ruled by muslim dynasties and by the end of the th century much of the muslim world came under colonial domination
the first areas of islamic law to be impacted were usually commercial and criminal laws which impeded colonial administration and were soon replaced by european regulations
islamic commercial laws were also replaced by european mostly french laws in muslim states which retained formal independence because these states increasingly came to rely on western capital and could not afford to lose the business of foreign merchants who refused to submit to islamic regulations
the first significant changes to the legal system of british india were initiated in the late th century by the governor of bengal warren hastings
hastings plan of legal reform envisioned a multi tiered court system for the muslim population with a middle tier of british judges advised by local islamic jurists and a lower tier of courts operated by qadis
hastings also commissioned a translation of the classic manual of hanafi fiqh al hidayah from arabic into persian and then english later complemented by other texts
these translations enabled british judges to pass verdicts in the name of islamic law based on a combination of sharia rules and common law doctrines and eliminated the need to rely on consultation by local ulema whom they mistrusted
in the traditional islamic context a concise text like al hidayah would be used as a basis for classroom commentary by a professor and the doctrines thus learned would be mediated in court by judicial discretion consideration of local customs and availability of different legal opinions that could fit the facts of the case
the british use of al hidayah which amounted to an inadvertent codification of sharia and its interpretation by judges trained in western legal traditions anticipated later legal reforms in the muslim world
british administrators felt that sharia rules too often allowed criminals to escape punishment as exemplified by hastings complaint that islamic law was founded on the most lenient principles and on an abhorrence of bloodshed
in the course of the th century criminal laws and other aspects of the islamic legal system in india were supplanted by british law with the exception of sharia rules retained in family laws and some property transactions
among other changes these reforms brought about abolition of slavery prohibition of child marriage and a much more frequent use of capital punishment
the resulting legal system known as anglo muhammadan law was treated by the british as a model for legal reforms in their other colonies
like the british in india colonial administrations typically sought to obtain precise and authoritative information about indigenous laws which prompted them to prefer classical islamic legal texts over local judicial practice
this together with their conception of islamic law as a collection of inflexible rules led to an emphasis on traditionalist forms of sharia that were not rigorously applied in the pre colonial period and served as a formative influence on the modern identity politics of the muslim world
during the colonial era muslim rulers concluded that they could not resist european pressure unless they modernized their armies and built centrally administered states along the lines of western models
in the ottoman empire the first such changes in the legal sphere involved placing the formerly independent waqfs under state control
this reform passed in enriched the public treasury at the expense of the waqfs thereby depleting the financial support for traditional islamic legal education
over the second half of the th century a new hierarchical system of secular courts was established to supplement and eventually replace most religious courts
students hoping to pursue legal careers in the new court system increasingly preferred attending secular schools over the traditional path of legal education with its dimming financial prospects
the tanzimat reforms of the th century saw reorganization of both islamic civil law and sultanic criminal law after the model of the napoleonic code
in the s a codification of civil law and procedure excepting marriage and divorce called the mecelle was produced for use in both sharia and secular courts
it adopted the turkish language for the benefit of the new legal class who no longer possessed competence in the arabic idiom of traditional jurisprudence
the code was based on hanafi law and its authors selected minority opinions over authoritative ones when they were felt to better suit the present conditions
the mecelle was promulgated as a qanun sultanic code which represented an unprecedented assertion of the state s authority over islamic civil law traditionally the preserve of the ulema
the ottoman law of family rights adopted an innovative approach of drawing rules from minority and majority opinions of all sunni madhhabs with a modernizing intent
the republic of turkey which emerged after the dissolution of the ottoman empire abolished its sharia courts and replaced ottoman civil laws with the swiss civil code but ottoman civil laws remained in force for several decades in jordan lebanon palestine syria and iraq
westernization of legal institutions and expansion of state control in all areas of law which began during the colonial era continued in nation states of the muslim world
sharia courts at first continued to exist alongside state courts as in earlier times but the doctrine that sultanic courts should implement the ideals of sharia was gradually replaced by legal norms imported from europe
court procedures were also brought in line with european practice
though the islamic terms qadi and mahkama qadi s sharia court were preserved they generally came to mean judge and court in the western sense
while in the traditional sharia court all parties represented themselves in modern courts they are represented by professional lawyers educated in western style law schools and the verdicts are subject to review in an appeals court
in the th century most countries abolished a parallel system of sharia courts and brought all cases under a national civil court system
in most muslim majority countries traditional rules of classical fiqh have been largely preserved only in family law
in some countries religious minorities such as christians or shia muslims have been subject to separate systems of family laws
many muslims today believe that contemporary sharia based laws are an authentic representation of the pre modern legal tradition
in reality they generally represent the result of extensive legal reforms made in the modern era
as traditional islamic jurists lost their role as authoritative interpreters of the laws applied in courts these laws were codified by legislators and administered by state systems which employed a number of devices to effect changes including
selection of alternative opinions from traditional legal literature takhayyur potentially among multiple madhhabs or denominations and combining parts of different rulings talfiq
appeal to the classical doctrines of necessity darura public interest maslaha and the objectives maqasid of sharia which played a limited role in classical fiqh but were now given wider utilitarian applications
changes in administrative law that grant the courts discretionary powers to restrict certain practices which are not forbidden by substantive law e g polygamy in some cases imposing penal sanctions as additional deterrence
modernist interpretation of islamic scriptures without adherence to the rules or methodologies of traditional jurisprudence known as neo ijtihad the most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the egyptian islamic scholar muhammad abduh
abduh viewed only sharia rules pertaining to religious rituals as inflexible and argued that the other islamic laws should be adapted based on changing circumstances in consideration of social well being
following precedents of earlier islamic thinkers he advocated restoring islam to its original purity by returning to the quran and the sunna instead of following the medieval schools of jurisprudence
he championed a creative approach to ijtihad that involved direct interpretation of scriptures as well as the methods of takhayyur and talfiq
one of the most influential figures in modern legal reforms was the egyptian legal scholar abd el razzak el sanhuri who possessed expertise in both islamic and western law
sanhuri argued that reviving islamic legal heritage in a way that served the needs of contemporary society required its analysis in light of the modern science of comparative law
he drafted the civil codes of egypt and iraq based on a variety of sources including classical fiqh european laws existing arab and turkish codes and the history of local court decisions
sanhuri s egyptian code incorporated few classical sharia rules but he drew on traditional jurisprudence more frequently for the iraqi code
sanhuri s codes were subsequently adopted in some form by most arab countries
aside from the radical reforms of islamic family law carried out in tunisia and iran governments often preferred to make changes that made a clear break from traditional sharia rules by imposing administrative hurdles rather than changing the rules themselves in order to minimize objections from religious conservatives
various procedural changes have been made in a number of countries to restrict polygamy give women greater rights in divorce and eliminate child marriage
inheritance has been the legal domain least susceptible to reform as legislators have been generally reluctant to tamper with the highly technical system of quranic shares
some reforms have faced strong conservative opposition
for example the reform of egyptian family law promulgated by anwar sadat through presidential decree provoked an outcry and was annulled in by the supreme court on procedural grounds to be later replaced by a compromise version
the reform of moroccan family law which sought to reconcile universal human rights norms and the country s islamic heritage was drafted by a commission that included parliamentarians religious scholars and feminist activists and the result has been praised by international rights groups as an example of progressive legislation achieved within an islamic framework
the islamic revival of the late th century brought the topic of sharia to international attention in the form of numerous political campaigns in the muslim world calling for full implementation of sharia
a number of factors have contributed to the rise of these movements classified under the rubric of islamism or political islam including the failure of authoritarian secular regimes to meet the expectations of their citizens and a desire of muslim populations to return to more culturally authentic forms of socio political organization in the face of a perceived cultural invasion from the west
islamist leaders such as ayatollah khomeini drew on leftist anticolonialist rhetoric by framing their call for sharia as a resistance struggle
they accused secular leaders of corruption and predatory behavior and claimed that a return to sharia would replace despotic rulers with pious leaders striving for social and economic justice
in the arab world these positions are often encapsulated in the slogan islam is the solution al islam huwa al hall
full implementation of sharia theoretically refers to expanding its scope to all fields of law and all areas of public life
in practice islamization campaigns have focused on a few highly visible issues associated with the conservative muslim identity particularly women s hijab and the hudud criminal punishments whipping stoning and amputation prescribed for certain crimes
for many islamists hudud punishments are at the core of the divine sharia because they are specified by the letter of scripture rather than by human interpreters
modern islamists have often rejected at least in theory the stringent procedural constraints developed by classical jurists to restrict their application
to the broader muslim public the calls for sharia often represent even more than any specific demands a vague vision of their current economic and political situation being replaced by a just utopia
a number of legal reforms have been made under the influence of these movements starting from the s when egypt and syria amended their constitutions to specify sharia as the basis of legislation
the iranian revolution of represented a watershed for islamization advocates demonstrating that it was possible to replace a secular regime with a theocracy
several countries including iran pakistan sudan and some nigerian states have incorporated hudud rules into their criminal justice systems which however retained fundamental influences of earlier westernizing reforms
in practice these changes were largely symbolic and aside from some cases brought to trial to demonstrate that the new rules were being enforced hudud punishments tended to fall into disuse sometimes to be revived depending on the local political climate
the supreme courts of sudan and iran have rarely approved verdicts of stoning or amputation and the supreme courts of pakistan and nigeria have never done so
nonetheless islamization campaigns have also had repercussions in several other areas of law leading to curtailment of rights of women and religious minorities and in the case of sudan contributing to the breakout of a civil war
advocates of islamization have often been more concerned with ideology than traditional jurisprudence and there is no agreement among them as to what form a modern sharia based islamic state should take
this is particularly the case for the theorists of islamic economics and islamic finance who have advocated both free market and socialist economic models
the notion of sharia compliant finance has become an active area of doctrinal innovation and its development has had a major impact on business operations around the world
the legal systems of most muslim majority countries can be classified as either secular or mixed
sharia plays no role in secular legal systems
in mixed legal systems sharia rules are allowed to influence some national laws which are codified and may be based on european or indian models and the central legislative role is played by politicians and modern jurists rather than the ulema traditional islamic scholars
saudi arabia and some other gulf states possess what may be called classical sharia systems where national law is largely uncodified and formally equated with sharia with ulema playing a decisive role in its interpretation
iran has adopted some features of classical sharia systems while also maintaining characteristics of mixed systems like codified laws and a parliament
constitutions of many muslim majority countries refer to sharia as a source or the main source of law though these references are not in themselves indicative of how much the legal system is influenced by sharia and whether the influence has a traditionalist or modernist character
the same constitutions usually also refer to universal principles such as democracy and human rights leaving it up to legislators and the judiciary to work out how these norms are to be reconciled in practice
conversely some countries e g algeria whose constitution does not mention sharia possess sharia based family laws
nisrine abiad identifies bahrain iran pakistan and saudi arabia as states with strong constitutional consequences of sharia on the organization and functioning of power
except for secular systems muslim majority countries possess sharia based laws dealing with family matters marriage inheritance etc
these laws generally reflect influence of various modern era reforms and tend to be characterized by ambiguity with traditional and modernist interpretations often manifesting themselves in the same country both in legislation and court decisions
in some countries e g parts of nigeria people can choose whether to pursue a case in a sharia or secular court
countries in the muslim world generally have criminal codes influenced by french law or common law and in some cases a combination of western legal traditions
saudi arabia has never adopted a criminal code and saudi judges still follow traditional hanbali jurisprudence
in the course of islamization campaigns several countries libya pakistan iran sudan mauritania and yemen inserted islamic criminal laws into their penal codes which were otherwise based on western models
in some countries only hudud penalties were added while others also enacted provisions for qisas law of retaliation and diya monetary compensation
iran subsequently issued a new islamic penal code
the criminal codes of afghanistan and united arab emirates contain a general provision that certain crimes are to be punished according to islamic law without specifying the penalties
some nigerian states have also enacted islamic criminal laws
laws in the indonesian province of aceh provide for application of discretionary ta zir punishments for violation of islamic norms but explicitly exclude hudud and qisas
brunei has been implementing a sharia penal code which includes provisions for stoning and amputation in stages since
the countries where hudud penalties are legal do not use stoning and amputation routinely and generally apply other punishments instead
sharia recognizes the concept of haqq
haqq refers to personal rights of the individual and the right to generate and accumulate wealth
the various ways in which property can be acquired under sharia are purchase inheritance bequest physical or mental effort diya and donations
certain concepts relating to property under sharia are mulk waqf mawat and motasarruf
sharia also plays a role beyond religious rituals and personal ethics in some countries with muslim minorities
for example in israel sharia based family laws are administered for the muslim population by the ministry of justice through the sharia courts
in india the muslim personal law shariat application act provides for the use of islamic law for muslims in several areas mainly related to family law
in england the muslim arbitration tribunal makes use of sharia family law to settle disputes though this limited adoption of sharia is controversial
sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves
in saudi arabia and qatar which have preserved traditional procedure in sharia courts trials are conducted solely by the judge and there is no jury system
there is no pre trial discovery process and no cross examination of witnesses
unlike common law judges verdicts do not set binding precedents under the principle of stare decisis and unlike civil law sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally codified universal statutes
the rules of evidence in sharia courts traditionally prioritize oral testimony and witnesses must be muslim
male muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female muslim witnesses and non muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court
in civil cases in some countries a muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a muslim man witness
in criminal cases women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter traditional interpretations of sharia such as those found in hanbali jurisprudence which forms the basis of law in saudi arabia
a confession an oath or the oral testimony of muslim witnesses are the main evidence admissible in traditional sharia courts for hudud crimes i e the religious crimes of adultery fornication rape accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it apostasy drinking intoxicants and theft
according to classical jurisprudence testimony must be from at least two free muslim male witnesses or one muslim male and two muslim females who are not related parties and who are of sound mind and reliable character
testimony to establish the crime of adultery fornication or rape must be from four muslim male witnesses with some fiqhs allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses however at least one must be a muslim male
forensic evidence i e fingerprints ballistics blood samples dna etc and other circumstantial evidence may likewise rejected in hudud cases in favor of eyewitnesses in some modern interpretations
in the case of regulations that were part of local malaysian legislation that did not go into effect this could cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases
in pakistan dna evidence is rejected in paternity cases on the basis of legislation that favors the presumption of children s legitimacy while in sexual assault cases dna evidence is regarded as equivalent to expert opinion and evaluated on a case by case basis
quran recommends written financial contracts with reliable witnesses although there is dispute about equality of female testimony
marriage is solemnized as a written financial contract in the presence of two muslim male witnesses and it includes a brideprice mahr payable from a muslim man to a muslim woman
the brideprice is considered by a sharia court as a form of debt
written contracts were traditionally considered paramount in sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt related which includes marriage contracts
written contracts in debt related cases when notarized by a judge is deemed more reliable
in commercial and civil contracts such as those relating to exchange of merchandise agreement to supply or purchase goods or property and others oral contracts and the testimony of muslim witnesses historically triumphed over written contracts
islamic jurists traditionally held that written commercial contracts may be forged
timur kuran states that the treatment of written evidence in religious courts in islamic regions created an incentive for opaque transactions and the avoidance of written contracts in economic relations
this led to a continuation of a largely oral contracting culture in muslim majority nations and communities
in lieu of written evidence oaths are traditionally accorded much greater weight rather than being used simply to guarantee the truth of ensuing testimony they are themselves used as evidence
plaintiffs lacking other evidence to support their claims may demand that defendants take an oath swearing their innocence refusal thereof can result in a verdict for the plaintiff
taking an oath for muslims can be a grave act one study of courts in morocco found that lying litigants would often maintain their testimony right up to the moment of oath taking and then to stop refuse the oath and surrender the case accordingly defendants are not routinely required to swear before testifying which would risk casually profaning the quran should the defendant commit perjury
in classical jurisprudence monetary compensation for bodily harm diya or blood money is assessed differently for different classes of victims
for example for muslim women the amount was half that assessed for a muslim man
diya for the death of a free muslim man is twice as high as for jewish and christian victims according to the maliki and hanbali madhhabs and three times as high according to shafi i rules
several legal schools assessed diya for magians majus at one fifteenth the value of a free muslim male
modern countries which incorporate classical diya rules into their legal system treat them in different ways
the pakistan penal code modernized the hanafi doctrine by eliminating distinctions between muslims and non muslims
in iran diya for non muslim victims professing one of the faiths protected under the constitution jews christians and zoroastrians was made equal to diya for muslims in though according to a us state department report the penal code still discriminates against other religious minorities and women
according to human rights watch and the us state department in saudi arabia jewish or christian male plaintiffs are entitled to half the amount a muslim male would receive while for all other non muslim males the proportion is one sixteenth
the spread of codified state laws and western style legal education in the modern muslim world has displaced traditional muftis from their historical role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts
instead fatwas have increasingly served to advise the general public on other aspects of sharia particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life
modern fatwas deal with topics as diverse as insurance sex change operations moon exploration and beer drinking
most muslim majority states have established national organizations devoted to issuing fatwas and these organizations to a considerable extent replaced independent muftis as religious guides for the general population
state employed muftis generally promote a vision of islam that is compatible with state law of their country
modern public and political fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the muslim world and beyond
ayatollah khomeini s proclamation condemning salman rushdie to death for his novel the satanic verses is credited with bringing the notion of fatwa to world s attention although some scholars have argued that it did not qualify as one
together with later militant fatwas it has contributed to the popular misconception of the fatwa as a religious death warrant
modern fatwas have been marked by an increased reliance on the process of ijtihad i e
deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities taqlid and some of them are issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti
the most notorious examples are the fatwas of militant extremists
when osama bin laden and his associates issued a fatwa in proclaiming jihad against jews and crusaders many islamic jurists in addition to denouncing its content stressed that bin laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or proclaim a jihad
new forms of ijtihad have also given rise to fatwas that support such notions as gender equality and banking interest which are at variance with classical jurisprudence
in the internet age a large number of websites provide fatwas in response to queries from around the world in addition to radio shows and satellite television programs offering call in fatwas
erroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals in recent times have sometimes given rise to complaints about a chaos in the modern practice of issuing fatwas
there exists no international islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of islamic law
an international islamic fiqh academy was created by the organisation of islamic cooperation but its legal opinions are not binding
the vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of islamic authenticity to many muslims
however there is little research available to indicate to what extent muslims acknowledge the authority of different muftis or heed their rulings in real life
the classical doctrine of hisba associated with the quranic injunction of enjoining good and forbidding wrong refers to the duty of muslims to promote moral rectitude and intervene when another muslim is acting wrongly
historically its legal implementation was entrusted to a public official called muhtasib market inspector who was charged with preventing fraud disturbance of public order and infractions against public morality
this office disappeared in the modern era everywhere in the muslim world but it was revived in arabia by the first saudi state and later instituted as a government committee responsible for supervising markets and public order
it has been aided by volunteers enforcing attendance of daily prayers gender segregation in public places and a conservative notion of hijab
committee officers were authorized to detain violators before a reform
with the rising international influence of wahhabism the conception of hisba as an individual obligation to police religious observance has become more widespread which led to the appearance of activists around the world who urge fellow muslims to observe islamic rituals dress code and other aspects of sharia
in iran hisba was enshrined in the constitution after the revolution as a universal and reciprocal duty incumbent upon both the government and the people
its implementation has been carried out by official committees as well as volunteer forces basij
elsewhere policing of various interpretations of sharia based public morality has been carried out by the kano state hisbah corps in the nigerian state of kano by polisi perda syariah islam in the aceh province of indonesia by the committee for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice in the gaza strip and by the taliban during their and rule of afghanistan
religious police organizations tend to have support from conservative currents of public opinion but their activities are often disliked by other segments of the population especially liberals urban women and younger people
in egypt a law based on the doctrine of hisba had for a time allowed a muslim to sue another muslim over beliefs that may harm society though because of abuses it has been amended so that only the state prosecutor may bring suit based on private requests
before the amendment was passed a hisba suit brought by a group of islamists against the liberal theologian nasr abu zayd on charges of apostasy led to the annulment of his marriage
the law was also invoked in an unsuccessful blasphemy suit against the feminist author nawal el saadawi
hisba has also been invoked in several muslim majority countries as rationale for blocking pornographic content on the internet and for other forms of faith based censorship
a survey based on interviews of muslims randomly selected from urban and rural parts in countries using area probability designs by the pew forum on religion and public life found that a majority in some cases overwhelming majority of muslims in a number of countries support making sharia or islamic law the law of the land including afghanistan iraq niger malaysia pakistan morocco bangladesh egypt indonesia jordan uganda ethiopia mali ghana and tunisia
in muslim regions of southern eastern europe and central asia the support is less than russia kyrgyzstan tajikistan kosovo albania turkey kazakhstan azerbaijan
regional averages of support were in south asia in southeast asia in the middle east north africa in sub saharan africa in southern eastern europe and in central asia
however while most of those who support implementation of sharia favor using it in family and property disputes fewer supported application of severe punishments such as whippings and cutting off hands and interpretations of some aspects differed widely
according to the pew poll among muslims who support making sharia the law of the land most do not believe that it should be applied to non muslims
in the muslim majority countries surveyed this proportion varied between of in egypt and of in kazakhstan as percentage of those who favored making sharia the law of the land
in all of the countries surveyed respondents were more likely to define sharia as the revealed word of god rather than as a body of law developed by men based on the word of god
in analyzing the poll amaney jamal has argued that there is no single shared understanding of the notions sharia and islamic law among the respondents
in particular in countries where muslim citizens have little experience with rigid application of sharia based state laws these notions tend to be more associated with islamic ideals like equality and social justice than with prohibitions
other polls have indicated that for egyptians the word sharia is associated with notions of political social and gender justice
in rowan williams the archbishop of canterbury has suggested that islamic and orthodox jewish courts should be integrated into the british legal system alongside ecclesiastical courts to handle marriage and divorce subject to agreement of all parties and strict requirements for protection of equal rights for women
his reference to the sharia sparked a controversy
later that year nicholas phillips then lord chief justice of england and wales stated that there was no reason why sharia principles should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution a yougov poll in the united kingdom found of muslim students interviewed supported the introduction of sharia into british law for muslims
michael broyde professor of law at emory university specializing in alternative dispute resolution and jewish law has argued that sharia courts can be integrated into the american religious arbitration system provided that they adopt appropriate institutional requirements as american rabbinical courts have done
in the western world sharia has been called a source of hysteria more controversial than ever the one aspect of islam that inspires particular dread
on the internet dozens of self styled counter jihadis emerged to campaign against sharia law describing it in strict interpretations resembling those of salafi muslims
also fear of sharia law and of the ideology of extremism among muslims as well as certain congregations donating money to terrorist organizations within the muslim community reportedly spread to mainstream conservative republicans in the united states
former house speaker newt gingrich won ovations calling for a federal ban on sharia law
the issue of liberty versus sharia was called a momentous civilisational debate by right wing pundit diana west
in in britain the future prime minister david cameron declared his opposition to any expansion of sharia law in the uk in germany in the interior minister thomas de maizi re told a newspaper bild sharia law is not tolerated on german soil
some countries and jurisdictions have explicit bans on sharia law
in canada for example sharia law has been explicitly banned in quebec by a unanimous vote of the national assembly while the province of ontario allows family law disputes to be arbitrated only under ontario law
in the u s opponents of sharia have sought to ban it from being considered in courts where it has been routinely used alongside traditional jewish and catholic laws to decide legal business and family disputes subject to contracts drafted with reference to such laws as long as they do not violate secular law or the u s
constitution
after failing to gather support for a federal law making observing sharia a felony punishable by up to years in prison anti sharia activists have focused on state legislatures
by bills aimed against use of sharia have been introduced in states and passed in
a notable example of this would be oklahoma state question which sought to permanently ban the use of sharia law in courts
while approved by voters the tenth circuit court of appeals placed an injunction on the law
citing the unconstitutionality of the law s impartial focus on a specific religion the law was struck down and never took effect
these bills have generally referred to banning foreign or religious law in order to thwart legal challenges
according to jan michiel otto professor of law and governance in developing countries at leiden university a nthropological research shows that people in local communities often do not distinguish clearly whether and to what extent their norms and practices are based on local tradition tribal custom or religion
those who adhere to a confrontational view of sharia tend to ascribe many undesirable practices to sharia and religion overlooking custom and culture even if high ranking religious authorities have stated the opposite
it has been argued that the extent to which sharia is compatible with democracy depends on how it is culturally interpreted with a cultural position that sharia represents the human attempt to interpret god s message associated with a greater preference for democracy than an islamist interpretation that sharia law is the literal word of god
scholars john l
esposito and delong bas distinguish four attitudes toward sharia and democracy prominent among contemporary muslims
advocacy of democratic ideas often accompanied by a belief that they are compatible with islam which can play a public role within a democratic system as exemplified by many protestors who took part in the arab spring uprisings
support for democratic procedures such as elections combined with religious or moral objections toward some aspects of western democracy seen as incompatible with sharia as exemplified by islamic scholars like yusuf al qaradawi
rejection of democracy as a western import and advocacy of traditional islamic institutions such as shura consultation and ijma consensus as exemplified by supporters of absolute monarchy and radical islamist movements
belief that democracy requires restricting religion to private life held by a minority in the muslim world according to polls conducted by gallup and pew in muslim majority countries most muslims see no contradiction between democratic values and religious principles desiring neither a theocracy nor a secular democracy but rather a political model where democratic institutions and values can coexist with the values and principles of sharia
muslih and browers identify three major perspectives on democracy among prominent muslims thinkers who have sought to develop modern distinctly islamic theories of socio political organization conforming to islamic values and law
the rejectionist islamic view elaborated by sayyid qutb and abul a la maududi condemns imitation of foreign ideas drawing a distinction between western democracy and the islamic doctrine of shura consultation between ruler and ruled
this perspective which stresses comprehensive implementation of sharia was widespread in the s and s among various movements seeking to establish an islamic state but its popularity has diminished in recent years
the moderate islamic view stresses the concepts of maslaha public interest adl justice and shura
islamic leaders are considered to uphold justice if they promote public interest as defined through shura
in this view shura provides the basis for representative government institutions that are similar to western democracy but reflect islamic rather than western liberal values
hasan al turabi rashid al ghannushi and yusuf al qaradawi have advocated different forms of this view
the liberal islamic view is influenced by muhammad abduh s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion
it stresses democratic principles based on pluralism and freedom of thought
authors like fahmi huwaidi and tariq al bishri have constructed islamic justifications for full citizenship of non muslims in an islamic state by drawing on early islamic texts
others like mohammed arkoun and nasr hamid abu zayd have justified pluralism and freedom through non literalist approaches to textual interpretation
abdolkarim soroush has argued for a religious democracy based on religious thought that is democratic tolerant and just
islamic liberals argue for the necessity of constant reexamination of religious understanding which can only be done in a democratic context in the constitutional court of turkey banned and dissolved turkey s refah party over its announced intention to introduce sharia based laws ruling that it would change turkey s secular order and undermine democracy
on appeal by refah the european court of human rights determined that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy
refah s sharia based notion of a plurality of legal systems grounded on religion was ruled to contravene the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms
it was determined that it would do away with the state s role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms and infringe the principle of non discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy
in an analysis maurits s
berger found the ruling to be nebulous and surprising from a legal point of view since the court neglected to define what it meant by sharia and would not for example be expected to regard sharia rules for islamic rituals as contravening european human rights values
kevin boyle also criticized the decision for not distinguishing between extremist and mainstream interpretations of islam and implying that peaceful advocacy of islamic doctrines an attitude which fails to respect the principle of secularism is not protected by the european convention provisions for freedom of religion
governments of several predominantly muslim countries have criticized the universal declaration of human rights udhr for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non western countries
iran declared in the un assembly that udhr was a secular understanding of the judeo christian tradition which could not be implemented by muslims without trespassing the islamic law
islamic scholars and islamist political parties consider universal human rights arguments as imposition of a non muslim culture on muslim people a disrespect of customary cultural practices and of islam
in the organisation of islamic cooperation a group representing all muslim majority nations met in cairo to respond to the udhr then adopted the cairo declaration on human rights in islam
ann elizabeth mayer points to notable absences from the cairo declaration provisions for democratic principles protection for religious freedom freedom of association and freedom of the press as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law
article of the cairo declaration states that all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this declaration are subject to the islamic shari a
in the journal free inquiry summarized the criticism of the cairo declaration in an editorial we are deeply concerned with the changes to the universal declaration of human rights by a coalition of islamic states within the united nations that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect islam s limited view of human rights
in view of the conditions inside the islamic republic of iran egypt pakistan saudi arabia the sudan syria bangladesh iraq and afghanistan we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women the suppression of political dissent the curtailment of free expression the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters in short protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations
instead they are worrying about protecting islam
patrick glenn states that sharia is structured around the concept of mutual obligations of a collective and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations
in giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty the islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals women non islamic people
bassam tibi states that sharia framework and human rights are incompatible
abdel al hakeem carney in contrast states that sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish sharia from siyasah politics
in classical fiqh blasphemy refers to any form of cursing questioning or annoying god muhammad or anything considered sacred in islam including denying one of the islamic prophets or scriptures insulting an angel or refusing to accept a religious commandment
jurists of different schools prescribed different punishment for blasphemy against islam by muslims and non muslims ranging from imprisonment or fines to the death penalty
in some cases sharia allows non muslims to escape death by converting and becoming a devout follower of islam
in the modern muslim world the laws pertaining to blasphemy vary by country and some countries prescribe punishments consisting of fines imprisonment flogging hanging or beheading
blasphemy laws were rarely enforced in pre modern islamic societies but in the modern era some states and radical groups have used charges of blasphemy in an effort to burnish their religious credentials and gain popular support at the expense of liberal muslim intellectuals and religious minorities
blasphemy as interpreted under sharia is controversial
representatives of the organisation of islamic cooperation have petitioned the united nations to condemn defamation of religions because unrestricted and disrespectful freedom of opinion creates hatred and is contrary to the spirit of peaceful dialogue
the cairo declaration on human rights in islam subjects free speech to unspecified sharia restrictions article a of the declaration states that everyone shall have the right to express his opinion freely in such manner as would not be contrary to the principles of the shariah others in contrast consider blasphemy laws to violate freedom of speech stating that freedom of expression is essential to empowering both muslims and non muslims and point to the abuse of blasphemy laws in prosecuting members of religious minorities political opponents and settling personal scores
in pakistan blasphemy laws have been used to convict more than a thousand people about half of them ahmadis and christians
while none have been legally executed two pakistani politicians shahbaz bhatti and salmaan taseer have been assassinated over their criticism of the blasphemy laws
the pakistani blasphemy laws are based upon colonial era legislation which made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly trespass on burial grounds insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship with these laws being modified between and by the military government of general zia ul haq to make them more severe
a number of clauses were added by the government in order to islamicise the laws and deny the muslim character of the ahmadi minority
according to the classical doctrine apostasy from islam is a crime as well as a sin punishable with the death penalty typically after a waiting period to allow the apostate time to repent and to return to islam
wael hallaq writes that in a culture whose lynchpin is religion religious principles and religious morality apostasy is in some way equivalent to high treason in the modern nation state
early islamic jurists set the standard for apostasy from islam so high that practically no apostasy verdict could be passed before the th century but later jurists lowered the bar for applying the death penalty allowing judges to interpret the apostasy law in different ways which they did sometimes leniently and sometimes strictly
in the late th century the use of criminal penalties for apostasy fell into disuse although civil penalties were still applied
according to abdul rashied omar the majority of modern islamic jurists continue to regard apostasy as a crime deserving the death penalty
this view is dominant in conservative societies like saudi arabia and pakistan
a number of liberal and progressive islamic scholars have argued that apostasy should not be viewed as a crime
others argue that the death penalty is an inappropriate punishment inconsistent with the qur anic verses such as no compulsion in religion and or that it was a man made rule enacted in the early islamic community to prevent and punish the equivalent of desertion or treason and should be enforced only if apostasy becomes a mechanism of public disobedience and disorder fitna
according to khaled abou el fadl moderate muslims do not believe that apostasy requires punishment
critics argue that the death penalty or other punishment for apostasy in islam is a violation of universal human rights and an issue of freedom of faith and conscience
twenty three muslim majority countries as of penalized apostasy from islam through their criminal laws
as of apostasy from islam was a capital offense in afghanistan brunei mauritania qatar saudi arabia sudan the united arab emirates and yemen
in other countries sharia courts could use family laws to void the muslim apostate s marriage and to deny child custody rights as well as inheritance rights
in the years four individuals were legally executed for apostasy from islam one in sudan in two in iran in and and one in saudi arabia in while modern states have rarely prosecuted apostasy the issue has a deep cultural resonance in some muslim societies and islamists have tended to exploit it for political gain
in a pew research center poll public support for capital punishment for apostasy among muslims ranged from in afghanistan to less than in kazakhstan reaching over in of the countries surveyed
homosexual intercourse is illegal in classical sharia with different penalties including capital punishment stipulated depending on the situation and legal school
in pre modern islam the penalties prescribed for homosexual acts were to a large extent theoretical owing in part to stringent procedural requirements for their harsher hudud forms and in part to prevailing social tolerance toward same sex relationships
historical instances of prosecution for homosexual acts are rare and those which followed sharia rules are even rarer
public attitudes toward homosexuality in the muslim world turned more negative starting from the th century through the gradual spread of islamic fundamentalist movements such as salafism and wahhabism and under the influence of sexual notions prevalent in europe at that time
a number of muslim majority countries have retained criminal penalties for homosexual acts enacted under colonial rule
in recent decades prejudice against lgbt individuals in the muslim world has been exacerbated by increasingly conservative attitudes and the rise of islamist movements resulting in sharia based penalties enacted in several countries
the death penalty for homosexual acts is currently a legal punishment in brunei iran mauritania some northern states in nigeria pakistan qatar saudi arabia parts of somalia and yemen all of which have sharia based criminal laws
it is unclear whether the laws of afghanistan and united arab emirates provide for the death penalty for gay sex as they have never been carried out
criminalization of consensual homosexual acts and especially making them liable to capital punishment has been condemned by international rights groups
according to polls the level of social acceptance for homosexuality ranges from among muslims in the u s
to less than in a number of muslim majority nations
some extremists have used their interpretation of islamic scriptures and sharia in particular the doctrine of jihad to justify acts of war and terror against muslim as well as non muslim individuals and governments
the expert on terrorism rachel ehrenfeld wrote that the sharia s finance islamic banking is a new weapon in the arsenal of what might be termed fifth generation warfare gw
however sharia complaint financing actually requires a person to stay away from weapons manufacturing
in classical fiqh the term jihad refers to armed struggle against unbelievers
classical jurists developed an elaborate set of rules pertaining to jihad including prohibitions on harming those who are not engaged in combat
according to bernard lewis a t no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism and the terrorist practice of suicide bombing has no justification in terms of islamic theology law or tradition
in the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse
while modernist islamic scholars have emphasized defensive and non military aspects of jihad some radical islamists have advanced aggressive interpretations that go beyond the classical theory
for al qaeda ideologues in jihad all means are legitimate including targeting muslim non combatants and the mass killing of non muslim civilians
according to these interpretations islam does not discriminate between military and civilian targets but rather between muslims and nonbelievers whose blood can be legitimately spilled
some modern ulema such as yusuf al qaradawi and sulaiman al alwan have supported suicide attacks against israeli civilians arguing that they are army reservists and hence should be considered as soldiers while hamid bin abdallah al ali declared that suicide attacks in chechnya were justified as a sacrifice
many prominent islamic scholars including al qaradawi himself have issued condemnations of terrorism in general terms
for example abdul aziz ibn abdullah al ash sheikh the grand mufti of saudi arabia has stated that terrorizing innocent people constitute s a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by islam while muhammad sayyid tantawy grand imam of al azhar and former grand mufti of egypt has stated that attacking innocent people is not courageous it is stupid and will be punished on the day of judgment
the surah in the quran has been debated for domestic violence and also has been the subject to varied interpretations
according to some interpretations sharia condones certain forms of domestic violence against women when a husband suspects nushuz disobedience disloyalty rebellion ill conduct in his wife only after admonishing and staying away from the bed does not work
these interpretations have been criticized as inconsistent with women s rights in domestic abuse cases
musawah cedaw kafa and other organizations have proposed ways to modify sharia inspired laws to improve women s rights in muslim majority nations including women s rights in domestic abuse cases
others believe that wife beating is not consistent with a more modernist perspective of the quran
many imams and scholars who learned shariah in traditional islamic seminaries object to the misuse of this verse to justify domestic violence
muslims for white ribbon campaign was launched in with imams and muslim leaders committing to join with others to work to end violence against women
khutbah campaigns were held in many parts of the world to speak out against domestic violence and encourage muslim congregants to eradicate domestic abuse
in those friday sermons and lectures muslim congregants are told to oppose and condemn domestic violence and that the qur an should never be misused to justify this evil practice
shari a is the basis for personal status laws in most islamic majority nations
these personal status laws determine rights of women in matters of marriage divorce and child custody
a unicef report concludes that sharia law provisions are discriminatory against women from a human rights perspective
in many countries in legal proceedings relating to sharia based personal status law a woman s testimony is worth half of a man s before a court
the codification of islamic family law in the ottoman empire distinguished between the age of competence for marriage which was set at for boys and for girls and the minimum age for marriage which followed the traditional hanafi limits of for boys and for girls
marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden
during the th century most countries in the middle east followed the ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence while raising the minimum age to or for boys and for girls
marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent
egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of for boys and for girls without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age
many senior clerics in saudi arabia have opposed setting a minimum age for marriage arguing that a woman reaches adulthood at puberty
rape is considered a serious crime in the sharia law since the islamic prophet muhammad ordered rapists to be punished by stoning
rape is a crime in all countries of the north africa and middle east region but as of sharia based or secular laws in some countries including bahrain iraq jordan libya morocco syria and tunisia allowed a rapist to escape punishment by marrying his victim while in other countries including libya oman saudi arabia and united arab emirates rape victims who press charges risk being prosecuted for extramarital sex zina
islamic law granted muslim women certain legal rights such as property rights which women in the west did not possess until comparatively recent times
starting with the th century western legal systems evolved to expand women s rights but women s rights in the muslim world have to varying degree remained tied to the quran hadiths and their traditional interpretations by islamic jurists
sharia grants women the right to inherit property from other family members and these rights are detailed in the quran
a woman s inheritance is unequal and less than a man s and dependent on many factors
for instance a daughter s inheritance is usually half that of her brother s
sharia recognizes the basic inequality between master and slave between free women and slave women between believers and non believers as well as their unequal rights
sharia prescribes kindness towards slaves and recommends for the manumission of slaves
many muslims have interpreted the quran as gradually phasing out slavery
in the quran the phrase ma malakat aymanukum that which your right hand owns appearing times in the quran
some interpret the verse to refer to women slaves seized as captives of war though others interpret the phrase in the context of marriage not concubinage
under islamic law muslim men could have sexual relations with female captives and slaves
slave women under sharia did not have a right to own property or to move freely
sharia in islam s history provided a religious foundation for enslaving non muslim women and men but allowed for the manumission of slaves
however manumission required that the non muslim slave first convert to islam
a slave woman who bore a child to her muslim master umm al walad could not be sold becoming legally free upon her master s death and the child was considered free and a legitimate heir of the father
islamic legal tradition has a number of parallels with judaism
in both religions revealed law holds a central place in contrast to christianity which does not possess a body of revealed law and where theology rather than law is considered to be the principal field of religious study
both islamic and jewish law halakha are derived from formal textual revelations quran and pentateuch as well as less formal orally transmitted prophetic traditions hadith and mishna
according to some scholars the words sharia and halakha both mean literally the path to follow
the fiqh literature parallels rabbinical law developed in the talmud with fatwas being analogous to rabbinic responsa
however the emphasis on qiyas in classical sunni legal theory is both more explicitly permissive than talmudic law with respect to authorizing individual reason as a source of law and more implicitly restrictive in excluding other unauthorized forms of reasoning
early islamic law developed a number of legal concepts that anticipated similar such concepts that later appeared in english common law
similarities exist between the royal english contract protected by the action of debt and the islamic aqd between the english assize of novel disseisin and the islamic istihqaq and between the english jury and the islamic lafif in classical maliki jurisprudence
the law schools known as inns of court also parallel madrasahs
the methodology of legal precedent and reasoning by analogy qiyas are also similar in both the islamic and common law systems as are the english trust and agency institutions to the islamic waqf and hawala institutions respectively
elements of islamic law also have other parallels in western legal systems
for example the influence of islam on the development of an international law of the sea can be discerned alongside that of the roman influence
george makdisi has argued that the madrasa system of attestation paralleled the legal scholastic system in the west which gave rise to the modern university system
the triple status of faqih master of law mufti professor of legal opinions and mudarris teacher conferred by the classical islamic legal degree had its equivalents in the medieval latin terms magister professor and doctor respectively although they all came to be used synonymously in both east and west
makdisi suggested that the medieval european doctorate licentia docendi was modeled on the islamic degree ijazat al tadris wa l ifta of which it is a word for word translation with the term ifta issuing of fatwas omitted
he also argued that these systems shared fundamental freedoms the freedom of a professor to profess his personal opinion and the freedom of a student to pass judgement on what he is learning
there are differences between islamic and western legal systems
for example sharia classically recognizes only natural persons and never developed the concept of a legal person or corporation i e a legal entity that limits the liabilities of its managers shareholders and employees exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders and that can own assets sign contracts and appear in court through representatives
interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting
such factors according to timur kuran have played a significant role in retarding economic development in the middle east
however the rise of monopoly wealth and corporations have proven to also be detrimental to the economic equality of a society
ziauddin sardar also suggests that the promotion of equitable wealth distribution and suppression of monopoly capital are a part of islam s message that emphasises genuine equity and justice
