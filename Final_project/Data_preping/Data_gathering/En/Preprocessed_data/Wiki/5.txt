according traditional muslim view major precept sharia passed directly islamic prophet muhammad without historical development emergence islamic jurisprudence fiqh also go back lifetime muhammad
view companion follower took approved model sunnah transmitted information succeeding generation form hadith
report led first informal discussion systematic legal thought articulated greatest success eighth ninth century master jurist abu hanifah malik ibn ana al-shafii ahmad ibn hanbal viewed founder hanafi maliki shafii hanbali legal school madhhabs sunni jurisprudence
first western scholar accepted general outline traditional account
late century influential revisionist hypothesis wa advanced ignac goldziher elaborated joseph schacht mid- century
schacht scholar argued conquered much populous agricultural urban society already existing law legal need initial muslim effort formulate legal norms
regarded quran muhammad's hadith one source law jurist personal opinion legal practice conquered people decree decision caliph also valid sources
according theory canonical hadith originate muhammad actually created later date despite effort hadith scholar weed fabrications
became accepted legal norm must formally grounded scriptural source proponent rule jurisprudence supported hadith would extend chain transmission hadith back muhammad's companions
view real architect islamic jurisprudence wa al-shafii d
ce ah formulated idea legal norm must formally grounded scriptural source element classical legal theory work al-risala wa preceded body islamic law based primacy muhammad's hadiths
origin hadith remains subject scholarly controversy theory goldziher schacht ha given rise objection modern historian generally adopt cautious intermediate positions
generally accepted early islamic jurisprudence developed combination administrative popular practice shaped religious ethical precept islam
continued aspect pre-islamic law custom land fell muslim rule aftermath early conquest modified aspect aiming meet practical need establishing islamic norm behavior adjudicating dispute arising early muslim communities
juristic thought gradually developed study circle independent scholar met learn local master discus religious topics
first circle fluid membership time distinct regional legal school crystallized around shared set methodological principles
boundary school became clearly delineated authority doctrinal tenet came vested master jurist earlier time wa henceforth identified school's founder
course first three century islam legal school came accept broad outline classical legal theory according islamic law firmly rooted quran hadith
root fiqh study theoretical principle jurisprudence fur al-fiqh lit
classical jurist held human reason gift god exercised fullest capacity
however believed use reason alone insufficient distinguish right wrong rational argumentation must draw content body transcendental knowledge revealed quran sunnah muhammad
traditional theory islamic jurisprudence elaborates scripture interpreted standpoint linguistics rhetoric
also comprises method establishing authenticity hadith determining legal force scriptural passage abrogated passage revealed later date
addition quran sunnah classical theory sunni fiqh recognizes two source law juristic consensus ijma analogical reasoning qiyas
therefore study application limit analogy well value limit consensus along methodological principle accepted certain legal schools
interpretive apparatus brought together rubric ijtihad refers jurist's exertion attempt arrive ruling particular question
theory twelver shia jurisprudence parallel sunni school difference recognition reason aql source law place qiyas extension notion sunnah include tradition imams
islamic scholar sayyid rashid rida ce list four basic source islamic law agreed upon sunni muslimsthe well-known source legislation islam four qur'an sunnah consensus ummah ijtihad undertaken competent jurists
classical jurist held textual integrity beyond doubt account handed many people generation known recurrence concurrent transmission tawtur
several hundred verse quran direct legal relevance concentrated specific area inheritance though passage used source general principle whose legal ramification elaborated means
hadith body hadith provides detailed practical legal guidance wa recognized early authentic
early islamic scholar developed methodology evaluating authenticity assessing trustworthiness individual listed transmission chains
criterion narrowed vast corpus prophetic tradition several thousand sound hadith collected several canonical compilations
hadith enjoyed concurrent transmission deemed unquestionably authentic however vast majority hadith handed one transmitter therefore seen yield probable knowledge
uncertainty wa compounded ambiguity language contained hadith quranic passages
disagreement relative merit interpretation textual source allowed legal scholar considerable leeway formulating alternative rulings
ijma consensus could principle elevate ruling based probable evidence absolute certainty
classical doctrine drew authority series hadith stating islamic community could never agree error
form consensus wa technically defined agreement competent jurist particular generation acting representative community
however practical difficulty obtaining ascertaining agreement meant little impact legal development
pragmatic form consensus could determined consulting work prominent jurist wa used confirm ruling could reopened discussion
case wa consensus account form le percent body classical jurisprudence
qiyas analogical reasoning used derive ruling situation addressed scripture analogy scripturally based rule
classic example quranic prohibition drinking wine extended intoxicating substance basis cause illa shared situation case identified intoxication
since cause rule may apparent selection commonly occasioned controversy extensive debate
majority sunni muslim view qiyas central pillar ijtihad
hand zahirites ahmad ibn hanbal al-bukhari early hanbalites etc rejected qiyas amongst sunnis
twelver shia jurisprudence also doe recognize use qiyas relies reason aql place
classical process ijtihad combined generally recognized principle method adopted legal school istihsan juristic preference istislah consideration public interest istishab presumption continuity
use independent reasoning arrive ruling contrasted taqlid imitation refers following ruling mujtahid
beginning century development sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurist state main legal question addressed scope ijtihad wa gradually restricted
century leading muslim reformer began calling abandonment taqlid renewed emphasis ijtihad saw return vitality early islamic jurisprudence
maqid aim purpose sharia malaa welfare public interest two related classical doctrine come play increasingly prominent role modern times
argued maslaha wa god's general purpose revealing divine law specific aim wa preservation five essential human well-being religion life intellect offspring property
although classical-era jurist recognized maslaha maqasid important legal principle held different view regarding role play islamic law
jurist viewed auxiliary rationale constrained scriptural source analogical reasoning
others regarded independent source law whose general principle could override specific inference based letter scripture
latter view wa held minority classical jurist modern time came championed different form prominent scholar sought adapt islamic law changing social condition drawing intellectual heritage traditional jurisprudence
scholar expanded inventory maqasid include aim sharia reform women's right rashid rida justice freedom mohammed al-ghazali human dignity right yusuf al-qaradawi
fiqh concerned ethical standard much legal norm seeking establish legal also morally right wrong

sin crime perform forbidden action perform mandatory action
avoiding reprehensible act performing recommended act held subject reward afterlife neutral action entail judgment god
jurist disagree whether term cover first three first four categories
legal moral verdict depends whether action committed necessity arra underlying intention niyya expressed legal maxim act evaluated according intention
abandonment action considered fard wajib sunnah thing considered makruh haram penalized hadd tazir punishments
understanding sharia people divided class free-slave male female also classified according belief behavior muslim muttaki fasiq mulhid apostate dhimmi etc exposed right deprivation classes
separation light consequence rejection testimony court severe consequence burning apostate mulhids manifest many area inheritance death compensation retaliation qisas administrator judge appointments
constant committing minor sin major sin require greater punishment described wickedness fisq fiqh terminology punished judge's discretion without certain limit measure
tazir punishment obligation prove crime principle legality witnessing similar mechanisms
branch fiqh traditionally divided ibdt ritual act worship mumalt social relations
many jurist divided body substantive jurisprudence four quarter called ritual sale marriage injuries
example quarter sale would encompass partnership guaranty gift bequest among topics
juristic work arranged sequence smaller topic called book kitab
special significance ritual wa marked always placing discussion start work
historian distinguish field islamic criminal law combine several traditional categories
jurist developed various restriction many case made virtually impossible apply
crime involving intentional bodily harm judged according version lex talionis prescribes punishment analogous crime qisas victim heir may accept monetary compensation diya pardon perpetrator instead diya imposed non-intentional harm
criminal case belong category tazr goal punishment correction rehabilitation culprit form largely left judge's discretion
practice since early islamic history criminal case usually handled ruler-administered court local police using procedure loosely related sharia
two major genre fur literature mukhtasar concise summary law mabsut extensive commentary
mukhtasars short specialized treatise general overview could used classroom consulted judges
mabsut usually provided commentary mukhtasar could stretch dozen large volume recorded alternative ruling justification often accompanied proliferation case conceptual distinctions

wrong grievance court wa address wrong sharia court unable address including complaint government officials
islamic jurist commonly attendance judge often presided court deputy ruler
mazalim verdict supposed conform spirit sharia bound letter law procedural restriction qadi's courts

islamic law required judge familiar local custom exercised number public function community including mediation arbitration supervision public work auditing waqf finance looking interest orphans
unlike pre-modern culture ruling dynasty promulgated law islamic law wa formulated religious scholar without involvement rulers
law derived authority political control rather collective doctrinal position legal school madhhabs capacity interpreter scriptures
ulema religious scholar involved management communal affair acted representative muslim population vi vi ruling dynasty modern era limited capacity direct governance
military elite relied ulema religious legitimation financial support religious institution one principal mean elite established legitimacy
turn ulema depended support ruling elite continuing operation religious institutions
although relationship secular ruler religious scholar underwent number shift transformation different time place mutual dependence characterized islamic history start modern era

iran ha adopted feature classical sharia system also maintaining characteristic mixed system like codified law parliament
constitution many muslim-majority country refer sharia source main source law though reference indicative much legal system influenced sharia whether influence ha traditionalist modernist character
constitution usually also refer universal principle democracy human right leaving legislator judiciary work norm reconciled practice
conversely country eg algeria whose constitution doe mention sharia posse sharia-based family laws
nisrine abiad identifies bahrain iran pakistan saudi arabia state strong constitutional consequence sharia organization functioning power
except secular system muslim-majority country posse sharia-based law dealing family matter marriage inheritance etc

unlike common law judges' verdict set binding precedent principle stare decisis unlike civil law sharia left interpretation case ha formally codified universal statutes
rule evidence sharia court traditionally prioritize oral testimony witness must muslim
male muslim witness deemed reliable female muslim witness non-muslim witness considered unreliable receive priority sharia court
civil case country muslim woman witness considered half worth reliability muslim man witness
criminal case woman witness unacceptable stricter traditional interpretation sharia found hanbali jurisprudence form basis law saudi arabia
confession oath oral testimony muslim witness main evidence admissible traditional sharia court hudud crime ie religious crime adultery fornication rape accusing someone illicit sex failing prove apostasy drinking intoxicant theft

lieu written evidence oath traditionally accorded much greater weight rather used simply guarantee truth ensuing testimony used evidence
plaintiff lacking evidence support claim may demand defendant take oath swearing innocence refusal thereof result verdict plaintiff
taking oath muslim grave act one study court morocco found lying litigant would often maintain testimony right moment oath-taking stop refuse oath surrender case accordingly defendant routinely required swear testifying would risk casually profaning quran defendant commit perjury
classical jurisprudence monetary compensation bodily harm diya blood money assessed differently different class victims
example muslim woman amount wa half assessed muslim man
diya death free muslim man twice high jewish christian victim according maliki hanbali madhhabs three time high according shafi'i rules
several legal school assessed diya magians majus one-fifteenth value free muslim male
modern country incorporate classical diya rule legal system treat different ways
pakistan penal code modernized hanafi doctrine eliminating distinction muslim non-muslims
iran diya non-muslim victim professing one faith protected constitution jew christian zoroastrian wa made equal diya muslim though according u state department report penal code still discriminates religious minority women
according human right watch u state department saudi arabia jewish christian male plaintiff entitled half amount muslim male would receive non-muslim male proportion one-sixteenth

muslim-majority state established national organization devoted issuing fatwa organization considerable extent replaced independent mufti religious guide general population
state-employed mufti generally promote vision islam compatible state law country
modern public political fatwa addressed sometimes sparked controversy muslim world beyond
ayatollah khomeini's proclamation condemning salman rushdie death novel satanic verse credited bringing notion fatwa world's attention although scholar argued qualify one
together later militant fatwa ha contributed popular misconception fatwa religious death warrant
modern fatwa marked increased reliance process ijtihad ie
