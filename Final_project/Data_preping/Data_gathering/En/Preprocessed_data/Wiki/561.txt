Bupivacaine marketed under the brand name Marcaine among others is a medication used to decrease feeling in a specific area In nerve blocks it is injected around a nerve that supplies the area or into the spinal canal's epidural space It is available mixed with a small amount of epinephrine to increase the duration of its action It typically begins working within minutes and lasts for to hours
Possible side effects include sleepiness muscle twitching ringing in the ears changes in vision low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate Concerns exist that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage Concentrated bupivacaine is not recommended for epidural freezing Epidural freezing may also increase the length of labor It is a local anaesthetic of the amide group
Bupivacaine was discovered in It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines Bupivacaine is available as a generic medication An implantable formulation of bupivacaine Xaracoll was approved for medical use in the United States in August
Bupivacaine is indicated for local infiltration peripheral nerve block sympathetic nerve block and epidural and caudal blocks It is sometimes used in combination with epinephrine to prevent systemic absorption and extend the duration of action The most concentrated formulation is used in retrobulbar block It is the most commonly used local anesthetic in epidural anesthesia during labor as well as in postoperative pain management Liposomal formulations of bupivacaine brand name EXPAREL have shown to be more effective in providing pain relief than plain solutions of bupivacaine
The fixed dose combination of bupivacaine with Type I collagen brand name Xaracoll is indicated for acute postsurgical analgesia pain relief for up to hours in adults following open inguinal hernia repair
Bupivacaine Posimir is indicated in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post surgical analgesia for up to hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression
Bupivacaine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to bupivacaine or amino amide anesthetics It is also contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical blocks and intravenous regional anaesthesia Bier block because of potential risk of tourniquet failure and systemic absorption of the drug and subsequent cardiac arrest The formulation is contraindicated in epidural anesthesia during labor because of the association with refractory cardiac arrest
Compared to other local anaesthetics bupivacaine is markedly cardiotoxic However adverse drug reactions are rare when it is administered correctly Most reactions are caused by accelerated absorption from the injection site unintentional intravascular injection or slow metabolic degradation However allergic reactions can rarely occur
Clinically significant adverse events result from systemic absorption of bupivacaine and primarily involve the central nervous and cardiovascular systems Effects on the central nervous system typically occur at lower blood plasma concentrations Initially cortical inhibitory pathways are selectively inhibited causing symptoms of neuronal excitation At higher plasma concentrations both inhibitory and excitatory pathways are inhibited causing central nervous system depression and potentially coma Higher plasma concentrations also lead to cardiovascular effects though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations Adverse effects on the central nervous system may indicate impending cardiotoxicity and should be carefully monitored
Central nervous system circumoral numbness facial tingling vertigo tinnitus restlessness anxiety dizziness seizure coma
Cardiovascular hypotension arrhythmia bradycardia heart block cardiac arrestToxicity can also occur in the setting of subarachnoid injection during high spinal anesthesia These effects include paresthesia paralysis apnea hypoventilation fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence Additionally bupivacaine can cause chondrolysis after continuous infusion into a joint space
Bupivacaine has caused several deaths when the epidural anaesthetic has been administered intravenously accidentally
Animal evidence indicates intralipid a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anaesthetic overdose and human case reports of successful use in this way Plans to publicize this treatment more widely have been published
Bupivacaine crosses the placenta and is a pregnancy category C drug However it is approved for use at term in obstetrical anesthesia Bupivacaine is excreted in breast milk Risks of stopping breast feeding versus stopping bupivacaine should be discussed with the patient
Bupivacaine is toxic to cartilage and its intra articular infusions may lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis
Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of voltage gated sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells which prevents depolarization Without depolarization no initiation or conduction of a pain signal can occur
The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine and other local anesthetics is dependent upon the dose and concentration of drug administered the route of administration the vascularity of the administration site and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the preparation

Excretion renal unchangedLike lidocaine bupivacaine is an amino amide anesthetic the aromatic head and the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics As a result the amino amide anesthetics are more stable and less likely to cause allergic reactions Unlike lidocaine the terminal amino portion of bupivacaine as well as mepivacaine ropivacaine and levobupivacaine is contained within a piperidine ring these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines
On September the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP of the European Medicines Agency EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Exparel intended for the treatment of post operative pain The applicant for this medicinal product is Pacira Ireland Limited Exparel liposomal was approved for medical use in the European Union in November
Bupivacaine is available as a generic medication
Levobupivacaine is the S enantiomer of bupivacaine with a longer duration of action producing less vasodilation Durect Corporation is developing a biodegradable controlled release drug delivery system for after surgery It has currently completed a phase III clinical trial
