implantable formulation bupivacaine xaracoll wa approved medical use united state august
bupivacaine indicated local infiltration peripheral nerve block sympathetic nerve block epidural caudal blocks
sometimes used combination epinephrine prevent systemic absorption extend duration action

liposomal formulation bupivacaine brand name exparel shown effective providing pain relief plain solution bupivacaine
fixed-dose combination bupivacaine type collagen brand name xaracoll indicated acute postsurgical analgesia pain relief hour adult following open inguinal hernia repair
bupivacaine posimir indicated adult administration subacromial space direct arthroscopic visualization produce post-surgical analgesia hour following arthroscopic subacromial decompression
bupivacaine contraindicated patient known hypersensitivity reaction bupivacaine amino-amide anesthetics
also contraindicated obstetrical paracervical block intravenous regional anaesthesia bier block potential risk tourniquet failure systemic absorption drug subsequent cardiac arrest
formulation contraindicated epidural anesthesia labor association refractory cardiac arrest
reaction caused accelerated absorption injection site unintentional intravascular injection slow metabolic degradation
clinically significant adverse event result systemic absorption bupivacaine primarily involve central nervous cardiovascular systems
effect central nervous system typically occur lower blood plasma concentrations
initially cortical inhibitory pathway selectively inhibited causing symptom neuronal excitation
higher plasma concentration inhibitory excitatory pathway inhibited causing central nervous system depression potentially coma
higher plasma concentration also lead cardiovascular effect though cardiovascular collapse may also occur low concentrations
adverse effect central nervous system may indicate impending cardiotoxicity carefully monitored
central nervous system circumoral numbness facial tingling vertigo tinnitus restlessness anxiety dizziness seizure coma
cardiovascular hypotension arrhythmia bradycardia heart block cardiac arresttoxicity also occur setting subarachnoid injection high spinal anesthesia
effect include paresthesia paralysis apnea hypoventilation fecal incontinence urinary incontinence
additionally bupivacaine cause chondrolysis continuous infusion joint space
