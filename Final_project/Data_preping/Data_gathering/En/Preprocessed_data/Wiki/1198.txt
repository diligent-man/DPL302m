tide pool rock pool shallow pool seawater form rocky intertidal shore
many pool exist separate body water low tide
many tide pool habitat home especially adaptable animal engaged attention naturalist marine biologist well philosophical essayist john steinbeck wrote log sea cortez advisable look tide pool star back tide pool
tidal movement water creates zonation pattern along rocky shore high low-tide
area high-tide mark supralittoral zone virtually terrestrial environment
presence abundance animal algae vary zone along rocky shore due niche adaptation response varying level tidal solar exposure
tide pool exist intertidal zone area within tidal range submerged sea high tide storm may receive spray wave action
time rock may undergo extreme condition baking sun exposed cold winds
different barnacle specie live tightly constrained elevation tidal condition precisely determining exact height assemblage relative sea level
intertidal zone periodically exposed sun wind condition cause barnacle become desiccated
calcite shell impermeable posse two plate slide across mouth opening feeding
organism must survive wave action current exposure sun
zone predominantly inhabited seaweed invertebrate sea anemone starfish chiton crab green algae mussels
wave current make life high tide zone difficult bring food filter feeder intertidal organisms
also called lower littoral zone area mostly submerged exposed unusually low tide
often teems life ha far marine vegetation especially seaweeds
low tide zone organism include abalone anemone brown seaweed chiton crab green algae hydroid isopod limpet mussel sometimes even small vertebrate fish
creature grow larger size available energy better water coverage water shallow enough allow additional sunlight photosynthetic activity almost normal level salinity
area also relatively protected large predator wave action shallow water
tide pool provide home hardy organism starfish mussel clams
inhabitant must able deal frequently changing environment fluctuation water temperature salinity oxygen content
hazard include wave strong current exposure midday sun predators
black bear known sometimes feast intertidal creature low tide
although tide pool organism must avoid getting washed away ocean drying sun eaten depend tide pool's constant change food
sea anemone anthopleura elegantissima reproduces clone process longitudinal fission animal split two part along length
sea anemone anthopleura sola often engages territorial fights
specie must retain intact central part body able regenerate regrow single ray
sea urchin echinoidia move around tide pool tube like feet
different specie urchin different color many seen tide pools
spine filled poison like toxopnesutes pileolus protect predator feed almost undisturbed tide pools
sea palm postelsia look similar miniature palm trees
live middle upper intertidal zone area greater wave action
high wave action may increase nutrient availability move blade thallus allowing sunlight reach organism photosynthesize
addition constant wave action remove competitor mussel specie mytilus californianus
recent study shown postelsia grows greater number competition exists control group competition produced fewer offspring experimental group mussel thought mussel provide protection developing gametophytes
alternatively mussel may prevent growth competing algae corallina halosaccion allowing postelsia grow freely wave action ha eliminated mussels
coralline algae corallinales predominant feature mid low intertidal tide pools
calcium carbonate caco take form calcite cell wall providing hard outer shell
shell protects herbivore desiccation due lack water evaporation
many form coralline algae bring herbivore mollusk notoacmea tide pool high tide increasing biomass area
low tide come herbivore exposed carnivore area fueling food web
