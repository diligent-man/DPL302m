a tide pool or rock pool is a shallow pool of seawater that forms on the rocky intertidal shore
many of these pools exist as separate bodies of water only at low tide
many tide pool habitats are home to especially adaptable animals that have engaged the attention of naturalists and marine biologists as well as philosophical essayists john steinbeck wrote in the log from the sea of cortez it is advisable to look from the tide pool to the stars and then back to the tide pool
the rocky shoreline exhibits zonation as a feature of the shoreline
tidal movements of water creates zonation patterns along rocky shores from high to low tide
the area above the high tide mark is the supralittoral zone which is virtually a terrestrial environment
the area around the high tide mark is known as the intertidal fringe
between the high and low tide marks is the intertidal or littoral zone
below the low tide mark is the sublittoral or subtidal zone
the presence and abundance of animals and algae vary between zones along the rocky shore due to niche adaptations in response to the varying levels of tidal and solar exposure
tide pools exist in the intertidal zone the area within the tidal range which is submerged by the sea at high tides and during storms and may receive spray from wave action
at other times the rocks may undergo other extreme conditions baking in the sun or exposed to cold winds
few organisms can survive such harsh conditions
lichens and barnacles live in this zone
different barnacle species live at very tightly constrained elevations with tidal conditions precisely determining the exact height of an assemblage relative to sea level
the intertidal zone is periodically exposed to sun and wind conditions that can cause barnacles to become desiccated
these animals therefore need to be well adapted to water loss
their calcite shells are impermeable and they possess two plates which they slide across their mouth opening when not feeding
these plates also protect against predation
the high tide zone is flooded during each high tide
organisms must survive wave action currents and exposure to the sun
this zone is predominantly inhabited by seaweed and invertebrates such as sea anemones starfish chitons crabs green algae and mussels
marine algae provide shelter for nudibranchs and hermit crabs
the same waves and currents that make life in the high tide zone difficult bring food to filter feeders and other intertidal organisms
also called the lower littoral zone this area is mostly submerged and is exposed only during unusually low tide
it often teems with life and has far more marine vegetation especially seaweeds
there is also greater biodiversity
organisms in this zone do not have to be as well adapted to drying out and temperature extremes
low tide zone organisms include abalone anemones brown seaweed chitons crabs green algae hydroids isopods limpets mussels and sometimes even small vertebrates such as fish
these creatures can grow to larger sizes because there is more available energy and better water coverage the water is shallow enough to allow additional sunlight for photosynthetic activity with almost normal levels of salinity
this area is also relatively protected from large predators because of the wave action and shallow water
tide pools provide a home for hardy organisms such as starfish mussels and clams
inhabitants must be able to deal with a frequently changing environment fluctuations in water temperature salinity and oxygen content
hazards include waves strong currents exposure to midday sun and predators
waves can dislodge mussels and draw them out to sea
gulls pick up and drop sea urchins to break them open
starfish prey on mussels and are eaten by gulls themselves
black bears are known to sometimes feast on intertidal creatures at low tide
although tide pool organisms must avoid getting washed away into the ocean drying up in the sun or being eaten they depend on the tide pool s constant changes for food
the sea anemone anthopleura elegantissima reproduces clones of itself through a process of longitudinal fission in which the animal splits into two parts along its length
the sea anemone anthopleura sola often engages in territorial fights
the white tentacles acrorhagi which contain stinging cells are for fighting
the sea anemones sting each other repeatedly until one of them moves
some species of starfish can regenerate lost arms
most species must retain an intact central part of the body to be able to regenerate but a few can regrow from a single ray
the regeneration of these stars is possible because the vital organs are in the arms
sea urchins echinoidia move around tide pools with tube like feet
different species of urchin have different colors and many are seen in tide pools
with spines some filled with poison like with toxopnesutes pileolus that protect them from predators they feed almost undisturbed in tide pools
algae and other microorganism are the food sources that attract them to the tide pools

sea palms postelsia look similar to miniature palm trees
they live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in areas with greater wave action
high wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize
in addition the constant wave action removes competitors such as the mussel species mytilus californianus
recent studies have shown that postelsia grows in greater numbers when such competition exists a control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes
alternatively the mussels may prevent the growth of competing algae such as corallina or halosaccion allowing postelsia to grow freely after wave action has eliminated the mussels
coralline algae corallinales are predominant features of mid and low intertidal tide pools
calcium carbonate caco takes the form of calcite in their cell walls providing them with a hard outer shell
this shell protects from herbivores and desiccation due to lack of water and evaporation
many forms of the coralline algae bring herbivores such as mollusks notoacmea to the tide pools during high tides increasing the biomass of the area
once low tides comes these herbivores are exposed to carnivores in the areas fueling the food web
