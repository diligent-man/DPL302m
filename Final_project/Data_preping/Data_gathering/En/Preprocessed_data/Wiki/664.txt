Lochore played domestic rugby for Masterton and Wairarapa, debuting for both in 1959
After playing six tests, including all four tests of the 1965 South African tour of New Zealand, he was selected as captain by coach Fred Allen for the Lions tour in 1966
He continued as captain until his retirement from playing in 1970 (although at the selectors request he returned to play one game in 1971 for an injury-hit All Black side).
Lochore was also a Wairarapa tennis representative from 1957 to 1961 and then 1979 to 1980.
His involvement in the game did not end with his playing days

On Waitangi Day (6 February) 2007, Lochore was inducted into the Order of New Zealand as an additional member; the Order of New Zealand is the country's highest honour.
In his biography, Sir Colin Meads wrote: "at the peak of his career, from 1966 through to 1969, he was everything I would want in a number 8
He spared himself, not an ounce working away in the tight-loose, covering, winning us great lineout ball in the deep, backing and filling and playing his part in the rolling drive-and-feed
As a captain he could be self-effacing, for this was the very nature of the man".
In June 2019, Rugby Union chief executive Steve Tew announced Lochore had been diagnosed with bowel cancer
Lochore died on 3 August that year, aged 78.
Lochore's funeral was held on 8 August at Memorial Park, Masterton, with around 2,500 people attending
