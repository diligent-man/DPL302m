as a work of speculative fiction atwood notes of the technology in oryx and crake i think for the first time in human history we see where we might go
we can see far enough into the future to know that we can t go on the way we ve been going forever without inventing possibly a lot of new and different things she later cautions in the acknowledgements to maddaddam although maddaddam is a work of fiction it does not include any technologies or bio beings that do not already exist are not under construction or are not possible in theory

the texts are going to slumber for years and then they ll wake up come to life again

she slept for years
in early while on the paperback tour in denver for her novel oryx and crake atwood conceived the concept of a remote robotic writing technology what would later be known as the longpen that would enable a person to remotely write in ink anywhere in the world via tablet pc and the internet thus allowing her to conduct her book tours without being physically present

atwood s contributions to the theorizing of canadian identity have garnered attention both in canada and internationally
her principal work of literary criticism survival a thematic guide to canadian literature is considered somewhat outdated but remains a standard introduction to canadian literature in canadian studies programs internationally
writer and academic joseph pivato has criticised the continued reprinting of survival by anansi press as a view narrowing disservice to students of canadian literature
in survival atwood postulates that canadian literature and by extension canadian identity is characterized by the symbol of survival
this symbol is expressed in the omnipresent use of victim positions in canadian literature
these positions represent a scale of self consciousness and self actualization for the victim in the victor victim relationship
the victor in these scenarios may be other humans nature the wilderness or other external and internal factors which oppress the victim
atwood s survival bears the influence of northrop frye s theory of garrison mentality atwood uses frye s concept of canada s desire to wall itself off from outside influence as a critical tool to analyze canadian literature
according to her theories in works such as survival and her exploration of similar themes in her fiction atwood considers canadian literature as the expression of canadian identity
according to this literature canadian identity has been defined by a fear of nature by settler history and by unquestioned adherence to the community
in an interview with the scottish critic bill findlay in atwood discussed the relationship of canadian writers and writing to the imperial cultures of america and britain
atwood s contribution to the theorizing of canada is not limited to her non fiction works
several of her works including the journals of susanna moodie alias grace the blind assassin and surfacing are examples of what postmodern literary theorist linda hutcheon calls historiographic metafiction
in such works atwood explicitly explores the relation of history and narrative and the processes of creating history
among her contributions to canadian literature atwood is a founding trustee of the griffin poetry prize as well as a founder of the writers trust of canada a non profit literary organization that seeks to encourage canada s writing community
atwood s work has been of interest to feminist literary critics despite atwood s unwillingness at times to apply the label feminist to her works
starting with the publication of her first novel the edible woman atwood asserted i don t consider it feminism i just consider it social realism despite her rejection of the label at times critics have analyzed the sexual politics use of myth and fairytale and gendered relationships in her work through the lens of feminism
in she clarified her discomfort with the label feminism by stating i always want to know what people mean by that word feminism
some people mean it quite negatively other people mean it very positively some people mean it in a broad sense other people mean it in a more specific sense
therefore in order to answer the question you have to ask the person what they mean speaking to the guardian she said for instance some feminists have historically been against lipstick and letting transgender women into women s washrooms
those are not positions i have agreed with a position she repeated to the irish times
in an interview with penguin books atwood stated that the driving question throughout her writing of the handmaid s tale was if you were going to shove women back into the home and deprive them of all of these gains that they thought they had made how would you do it but related this question to totalitarianism not feminism
in january atwood penned the op ed am i a bad feminist for the globe and mail
the piece was in response to social media backlash related to atwood s signature on a petition calling for an independent investigation into the firing of steven galloway a former university of british columbia professor accused of sexual harassment and assault by a student
while feminist critics denounced atwood for her support of galloway atwood asserts that her signature was in support of due process in the legal system
she has been criticized for her comments surrounding the metoo movement particularly that it is a symptom of a broken legal system
in following a partnership between hulu s adaptation of the handmaid s tale and women s rights organisation equality now atwood was honored at their make equality reality gala
in her acceptance speech she said
i am of course not a real activist i m simply a writer without a job who is frequently asked to speak about subjects that would get people with jobs fired if they themselves spoke
you however at equality now are real activists
i hope people will give equality now lots and lots of money today so they can write equal laws enact equal laws and see that equal laws are implemented
that way in time all girls may be able to grow up believing that there are no avenues that are closed to them simply because they are girls in atwood partnered with equality now for the release of the testaments
atwood has resisted the suggestion that the handmaid s tale and oryx and crake are science fiction suggesting to the guardian in that they are speculative fiction instead science fiction has monsters and spaceships speculative fiction could really happen she told the book of the month club oryx and crake is a speculative fiction not a science fiction proper
it contains no intergalactic space travel no teleportation no martians on bbc breakfast she explained that science fiction as opposed to what she herself wrote was talking squids in outer space the latter phrase particularly rankled advocates of science fiction and frequently recurs when her writing is discussed
in atwood said that she does at times write social science fiction and that the handmaid s tale and oryx and crake can be designated as such
she clarified her meaning on the difference between speculative and science fiction admitting that others use the terms interchangeably for me the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can t yet do
speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand and that takes place on planet earth she said that science fiction narratives give a writer the ability to explore themes in ways that realistic fiction cannot
atwood further clarified her definitions of terms in stating in response to a discussion with ursula k
le guin that what le guin means by science fiction is what i mean by speculative fiction and what she means by fantasy would include what i mean by science fiction she added that genre borders were increasingly fluid and that all forms of sf might be placed under a common larger umbrella
atwood repeatedly makes observations about the relationship of humans to animals in her works
a large portion of the dystopia atwood creates in oryx and crake rests upon the genetic modification and alteration of animals and humans resulting in hybrids such as pigoons rakunks wolvogs and crakers which function to raise questions on the limits and ethics of science and technology as well as questions on what it means to be human
in surfacing one character remarks about eating animals the animals die that we may live they are substitute people
and we eat them out of cans or otherwise we are eaters of death dead christ flesh resurrecting inside us granting us life some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat eating and consequently give up meat eating
in the edible woman atwood s character marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fianc s experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit
marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it
in cat s eye the narrator recognizes the similarity between a turkey and a baby
she looks at the turkey which resembles a trussed headless baby
it has thrown off its disguise as a meal and has revealed itself to me for what it is a large dead bird in atwood s surfacing a dead heron represents purposeless killing and prompts thoughts about other senseless deaths
atwood is a pescetarian
in a interview she stated that i shouldn t use the term vegetarian because i m allowing myself gastropods crustaceans and the occasional fish
nothing with fur or feathers though
atwood has indicated in an interview that she considers herself a red tory in what she sees as the historical sense of the term saying that the tories were the ones who believed that those in power had a responsibility to the community that money should not be the measure of all things atwood also stated on twitter that she is a monarchist
in the federal election she attended a rally for the bloc qu b cois a quebec separatist party because of her support for their position on the arts and stated that she would vote for the party if she lived in quebec and the choice was between the bloc and the conservatives
in an editorial in the globe and mail she urged canadians to vote for any other party other than the conservatives to prevent them gaining a majority
atwood has strong views on environmental issues and she and graeme gibson were the joint honorary presidents of the rare bird club within birdlife international
atwood celebrated her th birthday at a gala dinner at laurentian university in sudbury ontario
she stated that she had chosen to attend the event because the city has been home to one of canada s most ambitious environmental reclamation programs when people ask if there s hope for the environment i say if sudbury can do it so can you
having been a symbol of desolation it s become a symbol of hope atwood has been chair of the writers union of canada and helped to found the canadian english speaking chapter of pen international a group originally started to free politically imprisoned writers
she held the position of pen canada president in the mid s and was the recipient of the pen center usa s lifetime achievement award
despite calls for a boycott by gazan students atwood visited israel and accepted the dan david prize along with indian author amitav ghosh at tel aviv university in may
atwood commented that we don t do cultural boycotts
in her dystopian novel the handmaid s tale all the developments take place near boston in the united states now known as gilead while canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape
to some this reflects her status of being in the vanguard of canadian anti americanism of the s and s
critics have seen the mistreated handmaid as canada
during the debate in over a free trade agreement between canada and the united states atwood spoke out against the deal and wrote an essay opposing it
she said that the united states presidential election led to an increase in sales of the handmaid s tale
amazon reported that the handmaid s tale was the most read book of
in she signed an appeal of the american pen center in defense of ukrainian director oleg sentsov a political prisoner in russia
