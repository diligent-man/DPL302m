The Canton Coup of March also known as the Zhongshan Incident or the March th Incident was a purge of Communist elements of the Nationalist army in Guangzhou then romanized as Canton undertaken by Chiang Kai-shek
The incident solidified Chiang's power immediately before the successful Northern Expedition turning him into the paramount leader of the country
At the time of the incident the Nationalist and Communist parties of China were working together as part of the First United Front allied against the local warlords who were carving the country into fiefdoms
The Soviet Union was working with both groups and notably bankrolling Guangzhou's Whampoa Military Academy
It had assisted Sun Yat-sen in regaining control of Guangdong after his death from cancer in the Nationalists began a protracted leadership struggle that included interprovincial war
The assassination of Liao Zhongkai led to Hu Hanmin's ouster and the promotion of Chiang Kai-shek then commandant of the military academy to commander of the National Revolutionary Army
There were plans for a northern offensive against the warlords but leadership remained divided—principally between the right-wing Chiang and the left-wing Wang Jingwei
With support from the Soviets and the Communists the left wing looked ascendant Hu had said the Nationalists' ultimate goal was socialism and the January party conference had placed Communists in strategic posts and the party apparently almost wholly under leftist control
The coastal defense ship SS Yongfeng had been renamed the SS Zhongshan romanized at the time as Chung Shan in honor of Sun Yat-sen following his death
It was the most powerful ship in the Nationalist navy
Its captain Li Zhilong was a Communist working with a Soviet naval advisor
They had moved his warship to Guangzhou to support uprisings in the area alarming the Nationalists
On the night of March it suddenly relocated from Guangzhou to anchorage off Changzhou Dane's Island
It then sailed back the next day
In his subsequent reports Chiang stated that he became alarmed when the ship's commander claimed to be acting on orders from him which he had never given
His suspicions were further increased by numerous odd phone calls
Chen Jieru reported that Wang's wife Chen Bijun had called her five times on the th to check Chiang's schedule
Xu Zhen reported repeated calls by Deng Yanda Whampoa's political director inquiring when Chiang would next ride to Changzhou upon Chiang telling him it wouldn't be soon Li Zhilong called him to report Deng's order to depart
Li Dongfang stated that Chiang never explained who had made the repeated calls but thought it to have been Wang Jingwei
In reaction Chiang purchased a ticket on a Japanese steamer to Shantou but ultimately decided to fight rather than run
Andrei Bubnov head of the Soviet mission in Guangzhou noted in his reports that the incident was due to an abortive putsch mistakenly pursued by some of the Communist commanders in the Nationalist army
On March Chiang declared martial law and cut off Guangzhou's phone network
He used Nationalist troops and cadets from the Whampoa Military Academy where he was commandant to arrest its Communist political commissars
Chen Zhaoying Chen Ce and Ouyang Ge arrested Li Zhilong in his bedroom at dawn and secured the warship with Jiang Dingwen taking Li's place at the Navy Bureau
Wu Tiecheng and Hui Dongsheng surrounded the residences of Wang Jingwei and the Soviet advisors effectively placing them under house arrest
Hui also surrounded the GuangzhouHong Kong Strike Committee
Liu Zhi arrested Communists in the nd Division and those at Whampoa or in the st Corps—including Zhou Enlai—were arrested and later expelled following Three Principles orientation
Chiang's men also disarmed the Communists' paramilitary Workers' Guard
Victor Rogacheff the head of the Soviet military mission at Guangzhou fled to Beijing but Vasily Blyukher the military consultant to the Nationalists and Mikhail Borodin the political consultant helping to remake the KMT into a Leninist organization were both arrested Borodin's assistant Kassanga pseudonym of Nikolay Kuibyshev was expelled on the th
Wang Jingwei who had a high fever at the time was visited by Chen Gongbo Tan Yankai head of the nd Corps Zhu Peide rd Corps Li Jishen th Corps and T
Wang was indignant and some of the others felt Chiang was overreacting but the Nationalist Executive Committee convened at the house on March and a compromise was reached in which Wang would take a vacation abroad in the near future
The Canton Coup effectively ended the efforts of the Chinese Communists and Soviets to undermine the Nationalists through steady work to strengthen the party's left wing at the expense of its right
As the Soviets were anxious to maintain their influence and Chiang had need of their help in the upcoming Northern Expedition however he and AS
The Soviets would maintain some advisors and provide support but recall Kuibishev provide a list of Communist members in the KMT and accept that Communists would no longer hold top cabinet positions
On April a public telegram from Chiang stated that the affair was a limited and individual matter of a small number of members of our Party who had carried out an anti-revolutionary plot
He removed some right-wingers from leadership including Wu Tiecheng and criticized the Western Hills Group
He also forbade right-wing demonstrations and never publicly questioned the United Front
Trotsky in Russia and the central committees of the Communist parties in Shanghai and Guangdong all opposed the arrangement with Chiang but Stalin backed it
On May the Nationalists required the Communists not to entertain any doubt on or criticize Dr Sun or his principles to provide lists of their members within the Nationalist Party to not exceed one-third of the membership of any municipal provincial or central party committee and not to serve as the head of any government department or party
The same session formalized Chiang's leadership of the party and army ending civilian oversight of the Nationalist military
Emergency decrees soon expanded Chiang's power for the duration of the Northern Expedition although his direct control of the military remained partial owing to its regional composition and divided loyalties
On April Wang Jingwei resigned his posts and announced he would travel abroad he left for France secretly on May
Bubnov was recalled to Russia the same month
Wang finally returned in April of the next year invited by Borodin to counter Chiang's success
Zhou Enlai removed from his posts in Guangzhou travelled to Shanghai where he organized strikes by hundreds of thousands of factory workers in February and March
The Communists denied that there was any plot against Chiang and that his actions were simply intended to remove the left-wing Wang Jingwei from influence over the army and Guangzhou's important military academy
Historians disagree on whether the incident was plotted by Chiang Kai-shek was a Communist plot to kidnap him and remove him to Vladivostok or whether the whole affair was merely a series of miscommunications misunderstandings faulty telephone connections and personal rivalries among junior staff
