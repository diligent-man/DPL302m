Haloperidol sold under the brand name Haldol among others is a typical antipsychotic medication
Haloperidol is used in the treatment of schizophrenia tics in Tourette syndrome mania in bipolar disorder delirium agitation acute psychosis and hallucinations from alcohol withdrawal
It may be used by mouth or injection into a muscle or a vein
A long-acting formulation may be used as an injection every four weeks by people with schizophrenia or related illnesses who either forget or refuse to take the medication by mouth
Haloperidol may result in a movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia which may be permanent
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and QT interval prolongation may occur
In older people with psychosis due to dementia it results in an increased risk of death
When taken during pregnancy it may result in problems in the infant
It should not be used by people with Parkinson's disease
Haloperidol was discovered in by Paul Janssen prepared as part of a structure-activity relationship investigation into analogs of pethidine meperidine
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines
It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic
In it was the th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than one million prescriptions
Haloperidol is used in the control of the symptoms of
Acute psychosis such as drug-induced psychosis caused by amphetamines ketamine and phencyclidine and psychosis associated with high fever or metabolic disease
Some evidence however has found haloperidol to worsen psychosis due to psilocybin
Adjunctive treatment of alcohol and opioid withdrawal
Agitation and confusion associated with cerebral sclerosis
Hyperactive delirium to control the agitation component of delirium
Otherwise uncontrollable severe behavioral disorders in children and adolescents
Therapeutic trial in personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder
Treatment of neurological disorders such as tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome and chorea
Treatment of severe nausea and emesis in postoperative and palliative care especially for palliating adverse effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in oncology
Also used as a first line antiemetic for acute Cannabis Hyperemesis SyndromeHaloperidol was considered indispensable for treating psychiatric emergency situations although the newer atypical drugs have gained a greater role in a number of situations as outlined in a series of consensus reviews published between and
In a comparison of antipsychotics in schizophrenia haloperidol demonstrated standard effectiveness
It was more effective than ziprasidone chlorpromazine and asenapine approximately as effective as quetiapine and aripiprazole and less effective than paliperidone
A systematic review compared haloperidol to placebo in schizophrenia
Data from animal experiments indicate haloperidol is not teratogenic but is embryotoxic in high doses
Reports in pregnant women revealed possible damage to the fetus although most of the women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy
In addition reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery such as agitation hypertonia hypotonia tremor somnolence respiratory distress and feeding disorder
Following accepted general principles haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk
A few studies have examined the impact of haloperidol exposure on breastfed infants and in most cases there were no adverse effects on infant growth and development
During long-term treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders the daily dose should be reduced to the lowest level needed for maintenance of remission
Sometimes it may be indicated to terminate haloperidol treatment gradually
In addition during long-term use routine monitoring including measurement of BMI blood pressure fasting blood sugar and lipids is recommended due to the risk of side effects
Other forms of therapy psychotherapy occupational therapyergotherapy or social rehabilitation should be instituted properly
PET imaging studies have suggested low doses are preferable
Clinical response was associated with at least occupancy of D receptors while greater than was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over associated with extrapyramidal side effects
Doses of haloperidol greater than mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy
Patients responded with doses under even mg in first-episode psychosis
For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about every months until a minimal maintenance dose is established
Depot forms are also available these are injected deeply intramuscularly at regular intervals
The depot forms are not suitable for initial treatment but are suitable for patients who have demonstrated inconsistency with oral dosagesThe decanoate ester of haloperidol haloperidol decanoate trade names Haldol decanoate Halomonth Neoperidole has a much longer duration of action so is often used in people known to be noncompliant with oral medication
A dose is given by intramuscular injection once every two to four weeks
The IUPAC name of haloperidol decanoate is --chlorophenyl----fluorophenyl--oxobutylpiperidin--yl decanoate
Topical formulations of haloperidol should not be used as treatment for nausea because research does not indicate this therapy is more effective than alternatives
Sources for the following lists of adverse effects
As haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic it tends to produce significant extrapyramidal side effects
According to a meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic drugs it was the most prone of the for causing extrapyramidal side effects
With more than months of use percent of users gain weight
Anticholinergic side effects such as These adverse effects are less common than with lower-potency typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine
Somnolence which is not a particularly prominent side effect as is supported by the results of the aforementioned meta-analysisUnknown frequency
Severe intoxication with alcohol or other central depressant drugs
Known allergy against haloperidol or other butyrophenones or other drug ingredients
Known heart disease when combined will tend towards cardiac arrestA multiple-year study suggested this drug and other neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs commonly given to people with Alzheimer's with mild behavioral problems often make their condition worse and its withdrawal was even beneficial for some cognitive and functional measures
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis analysis of trials showed the risk of death in this group of patients was to times that of placebo-treated patients
Most of the causes of death were either cardiovascular or infectious in nature
It is not clear to what extent this observation is attributed to antipsychotic drugs rather than the characteristics of the patients
The drug bears a boxed warning about this risk
Impaired liver function as haloperidol is metabolized and eliminated mainly by the liver
In patients with hyperthyroidism the action of haloperidol is intensified and side effects are more likely
IV injections risk of hypotension or orthostatic collapse
Patients at special risk for the development of QT prolongation hypokalemia concomitant use of other drugs causing QT prolongation
Patients with a history of leukopenia a complete blood count should be monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of the drug should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in white blood cells
Pre-existing Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodiesAmiodarone Q-Tc interval prolongation potentially dangerous change in heart rhythm
Amphetamine and methylphenidate counteracts increased action of norepinephrine and dopamine in patients with narcolepsy or ADDADHD
Epinephrine action antagonized paradoxical decrease in blood pressure may result
Lithium rare cases of the following symptoms have been noted encephalopathy early and late extrapyramidal side effects other neurologic symptoms and coma
Methyldopa increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects and other unwanted central effects
Other central depressants alcohol tranquilizers narcotics actions and side effects of these drugs sedation respiratory depression are increased
In particular the doses of concomitantly used opioids for chronic pain can be reduced by
Other drugs metabolized by the CYPA enzyme system inducers such as carbamazepine phenobarbital and rifampicin decrease plasma levels and inhibitors such as quinidine buspirone and fluoxetine increase plasma levels
Tricyclic antidepressants metabolism and elimination of tricyclics significantly decreased increased toxicity noted anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects lowering of seizure thresholdThe British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse
Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea vomiting and loss of appetite
Other symptoms may include restlessness increased sweating and trouble sleeping
Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning numbness or muscle pains
Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time
There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis
It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated
Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped
Symptoms are usually due to side effects
Anticholinergic side effects dry mouth constipation paralytic ileus difficulties in urinating decreased perspiration
Coma in severe cases accompanied by respiratory depression and massive hypotension shock
Rarely serious ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes with or without prolonged QT-time
Severe extrapyramidal side effects with muscle rigidity and tremors akathisia etcTreatment is mostly symptomatic and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions
In early detected cases of oral overdose induction of emesis gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal can be tried
In the case of a severe overdose antidotes such as bromocriptine or ropinirole may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol acting as dopamine receptor agonists
ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures
An overdose of haloperidol can be fatal but in general the prognosis after overdose is good provided the person has survived the initial phase
Haloperidol is a typical butyrophenone type antipsychotic that exhibits high affinity dopamine D receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics
It has effects similar to the phenothiazines
The drug binds preferentially to D and α receptors at low dose ED = and mgkg respectively and -HT receptors at a higher dose ED = mgkg
Given that antagonism of D receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of -HT receptors on the negative symptoms this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis
Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H receptors and muscarinic M acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation weight gain and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms
σ irreversible inactivation by haloperidol metabolite HPP nM
NRNRB subunit containing NMDA receptor antagonist ifenprodil site IC nMThe bioavailability of oral haloperidol ranges from
However there is a wide variance in reported mean Tmax and T in different studies ranging from to hours and to hours respectively
The drug is well and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability when injected intramuscularly
The Tmax is minutes in healthy individuals and minutes in patients with schizophrenia
The decanoate injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and is not intended to be used intravenously
The plasma concentrations of haloperidol decanoate reach a peak at about six days after the injection falling thereafter with an approximate half-life of three weeks
The bioavailability is in intravenous IV injection and the very rapid onset of action is seen within seconds
The apparent volume of distribution is between and Lkg
The duration of action is four to six hours
Plasma levels of five to micrograms per liter are typically seen for therapeutic response Ulrich S et al
The determination of plasma levels is rarely used to calculate dose adjustments but can be useful to check compliance
The concentration of haloperidol in brain tissue is about -fold higher compared to blood levels
It is slowly eliminated from brain tissue which may explain the slow disappearance of side effects when the medication is stopped
Haloperidol is heavily protein bound in human plasma with a free fraction of only to
It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine
The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation primarily by CYPA
It was developed in at the Belgian company Janssen Pharmaceutica and submitted to the first of clinical trials in Belgium later that year
Food and Drug Administration FDA on April it was later marketed in the US
and other countries under the brand name Haldol by McNeil Laboratories
Haloperidol is relatively inexpensive being up to fold less expensive than newer antipsychotics
