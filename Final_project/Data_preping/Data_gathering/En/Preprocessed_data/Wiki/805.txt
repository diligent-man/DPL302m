Stretching over more than three kilometres in the narrow and tortuous Corr ze valley Tulle spreads its old quarters on the hillside overlooking the river while the Notre Dame cathedral emerges from the heart of the town Known sometimes as the town on seven hills Tulle rose to prominence through the development of its manufacturing sector
Tulle is the third largest town in Limousin behind Limoges and Brive la Gaillarde It is situated in a very deep part of the river Corr ze valley at its confluence with several of its tributaries the Solane and the C ronne on the right bank and the Saint Bonnette and the Montane on the left bank It stretches along a very narrow strip several kilometres long from the north east to the south west

The origins of the town are still subject to debate today but it would seem that the present puy Saint Clair a rocky spur with steep slopes separating the Corr ze valley from that of the Solane was an ideal location for the establishment of a Gallic oppidum For a long time it seems that the town has been an important crossroads on the road between Armorique and the Mediterranean Sea and on the road between Aquitaine and the Rhone Valley both of which crossed the Corr ze at this point by a ford
With the Roman occupation the place would have been converted into a necropolis and a temple in honour of Tutela a Roman divine power to whom the protection of people things and especially places was entrusted would have been built It is from this Roman goddess protector of the travellers who used to use the ford that the name of the city would come from The temple of Tutela must have been located in the Trech district whose name refers to the crossing of a river The real urban centre of the region moved a few kilometres north to the commune of Naves and the site of Tintignac which became a crossroads between the Roman roads that followed the ancient routes of the Celtic period
The Merovingian period would have seen the Christianization of the city and the establishment of three places of worship dedicated to St Martin St Peter and St Julian The city officially entered history only with the transformation in the th century of the church dedicated to Saint Martin into a monastery under the impetus of Calmine already founder of the monastery of Mozat in Auvergne Around the places of worship began to gather the inhabitants of the country and Tulle became once again an urban centre a status lost since the Roman conquest
The town was plundered several times by the Vikings despite being several hundred kilometres from the sea and it was during one of these sackings in that the first monastery was destroyed To warn the inhabitants of the town of the arrival of the Vikings a watchtower was built on a rocky promontory at Cornil a few kilometres downstream from the Corr ze The place was nevertheless considered safe by many churches on the Atlantic coast who had sent their relics there to preserve them from looting notably those of Saint Clair Saint L and Saint Baumard The monastery was later rebuilt but disappeared in the th century In excavations under the nave of the present cathedral uncovered the remains of an apsidiole dating from the Carolingian period as well as a poly lobed portal of Mozarabic influence
New constructions are undertaken for the abbey now dedicated to Saint Martin and converted to Benedictine rule in the th century On a visit to Tulle in Pope Urban II granted it his protection The first stone of the new abbey church was laid in but the building was not completed until two centuries later The spire of the th century culminates at a height of metres making it the highest in Limousin In during construction in the vicinity of the cathedral excavations uncovered the north wall of the medieval church of Saint Julien the discovery of a cemetery and three granite sarcophagi dating from the High Middle Ages In addition the Gothic cloister is the last one preserved in Limousin
In Pope John XXII created the diocese of Tulle by detaching fifty two parishes from the diocese of Limoges and the abbey church became a cathedral During the Hundred Years' War the English took the city in before being driven out of it a month later by the Count of Armagnac suffering in quick succession two trying sieges during which the inhabitants were reduced to famine In the city sided with the King of France Charles V which earned it tax exemption and the ennoblement of several bourgeois families But in the Duke of Lancaster appeared before the city and demanded that the gates be opened to him and in the absence of any command a representative assembly of the population was convened and decided to carry out a new sacking The pardon of the King of France for this betrayal took place in
The Black Death hit the city in and on the evening of June in despair the city authorities decided to march behind a statue of Saint John to stop what was considered a divine scourge The plague ceased shortly afterwards and the Tullists promised to renew this procession every year It is still perpetuated today and is called the Procession of the Lunade
At the beginning of the th century the town fell victim to the so called roadmen brigands such as Jean de La Roche who set fire to the town in or Rodrigue de Villandrando to whom the town had to pay a large ransom in order to be spared in In the bishop recognised the power of thirty four prud'hommes also called boniviri who had military and financial powers but who had in fact been dealing with the affairs of the community unofficially since the th century In Charles VII convened the Estates General of Bas Limousin in Tulle
The town was then divided between l'Enclos the district around the abbey church where the nobles bourgeois and clerics lived and the upper town where most of the population lived around the castle located on the puy Saint Clair and which is still characterized today by its narrow steep streets sometimes with stairs In the th century several noble families Saint Martial de Puy de Val Rodarel de Seilliac began to extend the town on the left bank of the Corr ze opposite the Cathedral in the Alverge district on the road towards Auvergne In the th century the city expanded outside its ramparts in suburbs along the roads towards Aquitaine and the South la Barri re and le Pilou to Limoges and Paris la Barussie le Trech le Fouret la Rivi re and towards Auvergne l'Alverge and le Canton
