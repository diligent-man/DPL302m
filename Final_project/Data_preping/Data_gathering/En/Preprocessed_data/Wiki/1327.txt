The connection between left leaning ideologies and LGBT rights struggles has a long and mixed history Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include Edward Carpenter Oscar Wilde Harry Hay Bayard Rustin Emma Goldman and Daniel Guérin among others
The first currents of modern socialist thought emerged in Europe in the early th century They are now often described with the phrase utopian socialism Gender and sexuality were significant concerns for many of the leading thinkers such as Charles Fourier and Henri de Saint Simon in France and Robert Owen in Britain as well as their followers many of whom were women For Fourier for example true freedom could only occur without masters without the ethos of work and without suppressing passions the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual but to society as a whole Writing before the advent of the term 'homosexuality' Fourier recognized that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives including same sex sexuality and androgénité He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that affirming one's difference can actually enhance social integration
Alongside other prominent thinkers at the time Fourier believed scientific understanding to be a standard of any society to live up to Émile Durkheim is known for being one of the first people to provide the idea of having to understand utopian socialism with the rise of social sciences However through further evaluation of these thinkings Fourier and Saint Simon were not seen as heads of the emerging scientific socialist movement With integration of scientific thought into a social perspective there would be further discourse within the topics of family education and especially sexuality Fourier in particular had a doctrine specifically detailing complexities surrounding the full expression of human passions The doctrine that Fourier expresses some of these views is known in French as Nouveau monde amoureux which means New World in Love The ideas expressed by early utopian socialists would help influence many woman to become a part of the movement and were quite instrumental towards the emergence of the feminist movement The idea of social reshaping was matching the thinking of utopian socialism In fact the reemergence of Fouriers works in the s would contribute further to the rising movements of feminism and LGBT because of interest in sexual liberties Durkheim was known to show concern through a more scientific approach rather than a political one He was also very adamant about the significance of the study of Sociology as it was believed to shape the humanist subjects of philosophy history and psychology Durkheim is also known for establishing L'Année Sociologique which is the first journal of social science in France in
From the earliest European homosexual rights movements activists such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and Magnus Hirschfeld approached the Left for support During the s Ulrichs wrote to Karl Marx and sent him a number of books on Uranian homosexualtransgender emancipation and in Marx passed one of Ulrichs' books on to Friedrich Engels Engels responded with disgust to Marx in a private letter lashing out at pederasts who are extremely against nature and described Ulrichs' platform of homosexual rights as turning smut into theory He worried that things would go badly for heterosexuals like himself should homosexual rights be gained
Both Marx and Engels have tangled with the idea of liberty pertaining to love and have made these ideas public A small time after the death of Marx Engels had said that with every great revolutionary movement the question of 'free love' comes to the foreground This is due to the known rejection of the family institution for the purpose of that free love notion as described by Engels This would in turn spark much opposition towards the socialist movement by the German government by instituting laws from the mid to late s outlawing any attack whether physical or verbal on the institution of family Much of this work pushed by Marx and Engels was influential to the leader of the socialist women's movement in the late s It is from the work with Marx and the work produced after the death of Marx that Engels had been able to influence a plethora of socialist thinkers as well as those who belong to feminist thinking The work consisting of the family dynamic had Marx and Engels express their concerns under three main points which were showing the hypocrisy surrounding the institution of the family especially within bourgeois the historical context surrounding the beginning of families and look into the future of families under a communist state Most thinkers belonging to Marxism would then realize that Marx and Engels were set on dismantling the institution of the family In Marx had been introduced to these ideas surrounding the institution of families in Paris because of fellow socialist thinkers such as Charles Fourier that had immense influence among social thinkers in France Fourier had also previously published writings specifying his stance on families and the favoring of replacing monogamous marriages in order to suit what Fourier called a Greater latitude of sexual passions'' and this work producing such notions was in a piece named Oeuvres Completes its first volume published in This would also in turn promote some influence for future socialist thinkers who happen to be a part of pro LGBT movements across the world
Known to both Ulrichs and Marx was the case of Jean Baptista von Schweitzer an important labor organizer who had been charged with attempting to solicit a teenage boy in a park in Social democratic leader Ferdinand Lassalle defended Schweitzer on the grounds that while he personally found homosexuality to be dirty the labor movement needed the leadership of Schweitzer too much to abandon him and that a person's sexual tastes had absolutely nothing to do with a man's political character Marx on the other hand suggested that Engels use this incident to smear Schweitzer You must arrange for a few jokes about him to reach Siebel for him to hawk around to the various papers However Schweitzer would go on to become President of the German Labor Union and the first Social Democrat elected to a parliament in Europe
August Bebel's Woman under Socialism the single work dealing with sexuality most widely read by rank and file members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany SPD can be seen as another example of the ambiguous position towards homosexuality in the German labor movement On the one hand Bebel warned socialists of the dangers of same sex love Bebel attributed this crime against nature in both men and women to sexual indulgence and excess describing it as an upper class metropolitan and foreign vice On the other hand he did publicly support the efforts to legalize homosexuality For example he signed the first petition of the Wissenschaftlich humanitärer Kreis a study group led by Magnus Hirschfeld trying to explain homosexuality from a scientific point of view and pushing for decriminalization In an article for Gay News in John Lauritsen considers August Bebel as the first important politician to speak out in public debate in the favor of gay rights since he attacked the criminalization of homosexuality in a Reichstag debate in
The leading figure of the LGBT movement in Germany from the turn of the th century until the Nazi government came to power in was undoubtedly Magnus Hirschfeld Hirschfeld who was also a socialist and supporter of the Women's Movement formed the Scientific Humanitarian Committee to campaign against German Penal Code Section which outlawed male male sex Hirschfeld's organization did a deal with the SPD of which Lassalle and Schweitzer had been members to get them to put forward a bill in the Reichstag in but it was opposed in the Reichstag and failed to pass Most of Hirschfeld's circle of homosexual activists had socialist politics including Kurt Hiller Richard Linsert Johanna Elberskirchen and Bruno Vogel After the toppling of the German monarchy the struggle against § was continued by some social democrats The German Minister of Justice Gustav Radbruch member of the Social Democratic Party tried to erase the paragraph from the German penal law However his efforts were to no avail Also some Queer cinema began to emerge to show what life for a gay individual was like in West Germany These characters are also distrustful of Bourgeoisie but hold these feelings of sexual nature dearly The use of this piece of cinema in the 's proved to be effective through influential advertisement of ideas It was actually after these films took place in that the first gay rights organization was formed in west Berlin While there was still separation of eastern and western sides of Berlin the east has proven to be much more lenient on the matter of gay rights This comes with major reforms through legislation and repealing of Nazi era anti sodomy laws
In Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man Under Socialism he advocates for an egalitarian society where wealth is shared by all while warning of the dangers of authoritarian socialism that would crush individuality He later commented I think I am rather more than a Socialist I am something of an Anarchist I believe In August Wilde wrote to his lover Lord Alfred Douglas to tell of a dangerous adventure He had gone out sailing with two lovely boys Stephen and Alphonso and they were caught in a storm We took five hours in an awful gale to come back And we did not reach pier till eleven o'clock at night pitch dark all the way and a fearful sea All the fishermen were waiting for usTired cold and wet to the skin the three men immediately flew to the hotel for hot brandy and water But there was a problem The law stood in the way As it was past ten o'clock on a Sunday night the proprietor could not sell us any brandy or spirits of any kind So he had to give it to us The result was not displeasing but what lawsWilde finishes the story Both Alphonso and Stephen are now anarchists I need hardly say
In the earlier days of England men were being arrested for passing as members of the opposite sex and were widely stigmatized for cross dressing because they were thought to be prostitutes A certain case pertaining to this would be one in the year when Frederick Park Fanny and Ernest Boulton Stella were arrested for being men in women's clothing and framed for committing crimes One of the earliest places of LGBT persuasions or gatherings would be a place in north Yorkshire called Cataractonium and has presented a grave sight discovered by Archeologists It is said that this grave is dated back to BC and was known as a male that had apparently self castrated and committed to cross dressing to please a priestessgoddess by the name of Cybele This was the ritual expected from a Roman Gallus at the time Another instance had occurred in London around when a young man named John Rykener had been arrested for having sexual relations dressed as a woman John would be accused of committing the unspeakable of that time When speaking to the authorities John had specified how he would prostitute as a man in womens clothes This would be a significant instance in which gender nonconformity was happening in medieval times of England
Edward Carpenter was a leading figure in late th and early th century Britain being instrumental in the foundation of the Fabian Society and the Labour Party The s saw Carpenter in a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation He strongly believed that same sex attraction was a natural orientation for people of a third sex His book on the subject The Intermediate Sex would become a foundational text of the LGBT movements of the th century The Intermediate Sex A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women expressed his views on homosexuality Carpenter argues that uranism as he terms homosexuality was on the increase marking a new age of sexual liberation He continued to work in the early part of the th century composing works on the Homogenic question The publication in of his groundbreaking anthology of poems Ioläus An Anthology of Friendship was a huge underground success leading to a more advanced knowledge of homoerotic culture In April Carpenter and his friend Laurence Houseman founded the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology Some of the topics addressed in lecture and publication by the society included the promotion of the scientific study of sex a more rational attitude towards sexual conduct and problems and questions connected with sexual psychology from medical juridical and sociological aspects birth control abortion sterilization venereal diseases and all aspects of prostitution
In Europe and North America the free love movement combined ideas revived from utopian socialism with anarchism and feminism to attack the hypocritical sexual morality of the Victorian era and the institutions of marriage and the family that were alleged to enslave women Free lovers advocated voluntary sexual unions with no state interference and affirmed the right to sexual pleasure for both women and men sometimes explicitly supporting the rights of homosexuals and prostitutes For a few decades adherence to free love became widespread among European and American anarchists but these views were opposed at the time by Marxists and social democrats Radical feminist and socialist Victoria Woodhull was expelled from the International Workingmen's Association in for her involvement in the free love and associated movements Indeed with Marx's support the American branch of the organization was purged of its pacifist anti racist and feminist elements which were accused of putting too much emphasis on issues unrelated to class struggle and were therefore seen to be incompatible with scientific socialism
The Verband Fortschrittlicher Frauenvereine League of Progressive Women's Associations a turn of the th century left wing organization led by Lily Braun campaigned for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Germany and aimed at organizing prostitutes into labour unions The broader labour movement either attacked the League saying they were utopians or ignored it and Braun was driven out of the international Marxist movement Helene Stöcker another German activist from the left wing of the women's movement became heavily involved in the sexual reform movement in after World War I and served on the board of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft She also campaigned to protect single mothers and their children from economic and moral persecution Anarcho syndicalist writer Ulrich Linse wrote about a sharply outlined figure of the Berlin individualist anarchist cultural scene around the precocious Johannes Holzmann known as Senna Hoy an adherent of free love Hoy celebrated homosexuality as a 'champion of culture' and engaged in the struggle against Paragraph The young Hoy born published these views in his weekly magazine Kampf in English Struggle from which reached a circulation of the following year German anarchist psychotherapist Otto Gross also wrote extensively about same sex sexuality in both men and women and argued against its discrimination Heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the s in his German language journal Der arme Teufel Detroit

Anarchism's foregrounding of individual freedoms made for a natural marriage with homosexuality in the eyes of many both inside and outside of the Anarchist movement Emil Szittya in Das Kuriositäten Kabinett wrote about homosexuality that very many anarchists have this tendency Thus I found in Paris a Hungarian anarchist Alexander Sommi who founded a homosexual anarchist group on the basis of this idea His view is confirmed by Magnus Hirschfeld in his book Die Homosexualität des Mannes und des Weibes In the ranks of a relatively small party the anarchist it seemed to me as if proportionately more homosexuals and effeminates are found than in others Italian anarchist Luigi Bertoni who Szittya also believed to be gay said that Anarchists demand freedom in everything thus also in sexuality Homosexuality leads to a healthy sense of egoism for which every anarchist should strive

Whilst these pro homosexual stances had begun to surface many members of the anarchist movement of the time still believed that naturea divine Creator had provided a perfect answer to human relationships an editorial in an influential Spanish anarchist journal from argued that an Anarchist must even avoid any relationship with homosexuals If you are an anarchist that means that you are more morally upright and physically strong than the average man And he who likes inverts is no real man and is therefore no real anarchist However despite that view many present day anarchists accept homosexuality
McCarthyism in the US believed a homosexual underground was abetting the communist conspiracy which was sometimes called the Homintern A number of homosexual rights groups came into being during this period These groups now known as the homophile movement often had left wing or socialist politics such as the communist Mattachine Society and the Dutch COC which originated on the left In the context of the highly politicized Cold War environment homosexuality became framed as a dangerous contagious social disease that posed a potential threat to state security This era also witnessed the establishment of widely spread FBI surveillance intended to identify homosexual government employees Harry Hay who is seen by many as the father of the modern gay rights movement in the United States was originally a trade union activist In he organized an important day long workers' strike of the port of San Francisco with his lover actor Will Geer He was an active member of the Communist Party Hay and the Mattachine Society were among the first to argue that gay people were not just individuals but in fact represented a cultural minority They even called for public marches of homosexuals predicting later gay pride parades Hay's concept of the cultural minority came directly from his Marxist studies and the rhetoric that he and his colleague Charles Rowland employed often reflected the militant Communist tradition The Communist Party did not officially allow gays to be members claiming that homosexuality was a 'deviation' perhaps more important was the fear that a member's usually secret homosexuality would leave them open to blackmail and made them a security risk in an era of red baiting Concerned to save the party difficulties as he put more energy into the Mattachine Society Hay himself approached the CP's leaders and recommended his own expulsion However after much soul searching the CP clearly reeling at the loss of a respected member and theoretician of years' standing refused to expel Hay as a homosexual instead expelling him under the more convenient ruse of 'security risk' while ostentatiously announcing him to be a 'Lifelong Friend of the People' The Mattachine Society was the second gay rights organization that Hay established the first being 'Bachelors for Wallace in support of Henry Wallace's progressive presidential candidacy The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality reports that As Marxists the founders of the group believed that the injustice and oppression which they suffered stemmed from relationships deeply embedded in the structure of American society

The lowest point in the history of the relationship between socialism and homosexuality begins with the rise of Joseph Stalin in the USSR after Lenin's death and continues through the era of state socialism in the Soviet Union East Germany China and North Korea In all cases the conditions of sexual minorities and transgender people worsened in communist states after the arrival of Stalin Hundreds of thousands of homosexuals were interned in gulags during the Great Purge where many were beaten to death Some Western intellectuals withdrew their support of Communism after seeing the severity of repression in the USSR including the gay writer André Gide

During the emergence of the new social movements of the s and s the socialist left began to review its relationship to gender sexuality and identity politics The writings of the French bisexual anarchist Daniel Guérin offer an insight into the tension sexual minorities among the Left have often felt He was a leading figure in the French Left from the s until his death in After coming out in he spoke about the extreme hostility toward homosexuality that permeated the left throughout much of the th century Not so many years ago to declare oneself a revolutionary and to confess to being homosexual were incompatible Guérin wrote in In Guérin was widely attacked for his study of the Kinsey Reports in which he also detailed the oppression of homosexuals in France The harshest criticisms came from marxists who tend seriously to underestimate the form of oppression which is antisexual terrorism I expected it of course and I knew that in publishing my book I was running the risk of being attacked by those to whom I feel closest on a political level After coming out publicly in Guérin was abandoned by the Left and his papers on sexual liberation were censored or refused publication in left wing journals From the s Guérin moved away from Marxism Leninism and toward a synthesis of anarchism and marxism close to platformism which allowed for individualism while rejecting capitalism Guérin was involved in the uprising of May and was a part of the French Gay Liberation movement that emerged after the events Decades later Frédéric Martel described Guérin as the grandfather of the French homosexual movement Meanwhile in the United States late in his career the influential anarchist thinker Paul Goodman came out as bisexual The freedom with which he revealed in print and in public his romantic and sexual relations with men notably in a late essay Being Queer proved to be one of the many important cultural springboards for the emerging gay liberation movement of the early s
Emerging from a number of events such as the May insurrection in France the anti Vietnam war movement in the US and the Stonewall riots of militant Gay Liberation organizations began to spring up around the world Many saw their roots in left radicalism more than in the established homophile groups of the time such as British and American Gay Liberation Front the British Gay Left Collective the Italian Fuori the French FHAR the German Rotzschwule and the Dutch Red Faggots
The then styled Gay Lib leaders and writers also came from a left wing background such as Dennis Altman Martin Duberman Steven Ault Brenda Howard John D'Emilio David Fernbach writing in the English language Pierre Hahn and Guy Hocquenghem in French and the Italian Mario Mieli Some were inspired by Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization which attempts to synthesise the ideas of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud s and s radical Angela Davis who officially came out as a lesbian in had studied under Marcuse and was greatly influenced by him In France gay activist and political theorist Guy Hocquenghem like many others developed a commitment to socialism through participating in the May insurrection A former member of the French Communist Party he later joined the Front homosexuel d'action révolutionnaire FHAR formed by radical lesbians who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France in including the left ecofeminist Françoise d'Eaubonne That same year the FHAR became the first homosexual group to demonstrate publicly in France when they joined Paris's annual May Day march held by trade unions and left wing parties
In the United Kingdom the s saw increased LGBT rights opposition from the right wing Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher who introduced Section in in order to prevent what they saw as the promotion of homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle in schools However the Conservatives' main opposition the Labour Party did little to address the issue of LGBT rights ignoring calls from left wingers such as Ken Livingstone to do so Meanwhile the popular right wing press featured pejorative references to lesbians supposedly especially associated with the all female anti nuclear protest camp at Greenham Common and individuals such as Peter Tatchell the Labour candidate in the Bermondsey by election However the growing commercialisation of the western gay subculture in the late th and early st centuries the pink pound has come under heavy criticism from socialists Hannah Dee remarked that it had reached the point that London Pride once a militant demonstration in commemoration of the Stonewall riots has become a corporate sponsored event far removed from any challenge to the ongoing injustices that we the LGBT community face At the same time an anti war coalition between Muslims many organized through mosques and the Socialist Workers Party led a leading member Lindsey German to reject the use of gay rights as a shibboleth that would automatically rule out such alliances
The American Revolutionary Communist Party's policy that struggle will be waged to eliminate homosexuality and reform homosexuals wasn't abandoned until The RCP now strongly supports gay liberation Meanwhile the American Socialist Workers Party SWP in the US released a memo stating that gay oppression had less social weight than black and women's struggles and prohibited members from being involved in gay political organizations They also believed that too close an association with gay liberation would give the SWP an exotic image and alienate it from the masses
As the gay liberation movement began to gain ground socialist organizations' policies evolved and many groups actively campaigned for gay rights Notable examples are the feminist Freedom Socialist Party the Party for Socialism and Liberation the International Socialist Organization Socialist Alternative United States and the Socialist Party USA The Socialist Party USA was the first American political party to nominate an openly gay man for President running David McReynolds in
