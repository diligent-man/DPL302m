christian communism is a theological view that the teachings of jesus christ compel christians to support religious communism as the ideal social system
although there is no universal agreement on the exact dates when communistic ideas and practices in christianity began many christian communists claim that evidence from the bible suggests that the first christians including the apostles established their own small communist society in the years following jesus death and resurrection
as such many advocates of christian communism argue that it was taught by jesus and practiced by the apostles themselves
some historians confirm its existence
there are those who view that the early christian church such as that one described in the acts of the apostles was an early form of communism and religious socialism
the view is that communism was just christianity in practice and jesus was the first communist
this link was highlighted in one of karl marx s early writings which stated that a s christ is the intermediary unto whom man unburdens all his divinity all his religious bonds so the state is the mediator unto which he transfers all his godlessness all his human liberty
christian communism was based on the concept of koinonia which means common or shared life it was not an economic doctrine but an expression of agape love
it was the voluntary sharing of goods amongst the community
acts records that in the early church in jerusalem n o one claimed that any of their possessions was their own but shared everything in common which likely was a means for the early christians to survive after the destruction of jerusalem although the pattern would later disappear from church history except within monasticism
the early church fathers like their non abrahamic predecessors maintained that human society had declined to its current state from a now lost egalitarian social order
some historians view the early christian church as described in the acts of the apostles specifically in acts and acts as an early form of communism
among christian communists the view is that communism was just christianity in practice and jesus christ was himself a communist
later historians have supported the reading of early church communities as communistic in structure
from the high middle ages in europe various groups supporting christian communist and communalist ideas were occasionally adopted by reformist christian sects
an early th century proto protestant group originating in lyon known as the waldensians held their property in common in accordance with the book of acts but were persecuted by the catholic church and retreated to piedmont
around the apostolic brethren in northern italy were taken over by fra dolcino who formed a sect known as the dulcinians which advocated ending feudalism dissolving hierarchies in the church and holding all property in common
the peasants revolt in england has been an inspiration for the medieval ideal of primitive communism with the priest john ball of the revolt being an inspirational figure to later revolutionaries and having allegedly declared things cannot go well in england nor ever will until all goods are held in common christian socialism was one of the founding threads of the british labour party and is claimed to begin with the uprising of john ball and wat tyler in the th century ce
in christian europe communists were believed to have adopted atheism
in protestant england communism was too close to the roman catholic communion rite hence socialist was the preferred term
friedrich engels argued that in when the communist manifesto was published socialism was respectable in europe while communism was not
the teachings of jesus were frequently described as socialist especially by christian socialists
the owenites in england and the fourierists in france were considered respectable socialists while working class movements that proclaimed the necessity of total social change denoted themselves communists
this branch of socialism produced the communist work of tienne cabet in france and wilhelm weitling in germany
in the th century english writer thomas more who is venerated in the catholic church as saint thomas more portrayed a society based on common ownership of property in his treatise utopia whose leaders administered it through the application of reason
several groupings in the english civil war supported this idea but especially the diggers who espoused clear communistic and agrarian ideals
oliver cromwell and the grandees attitude to these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile
thomas m ntzer in th century germany led a large anabaptist communist movement during the german peasants war which friedrich engels analysed in the peasant war in germany
the marxist ethos that aims for unity reflects the christian universalist teaching that humankind is one and that there is only one god who does not discriminate among people
criticism of the idea of private property continued into the enlightenment era of the th century through such thinkers as the deeply religious jean jacques rousseau
raised a calvinist rousseau was influenced by the jansenist movement within the roman catholic church
the jansenist movement originated from the most orthodox roman catholic bishops who tried to reform the roman catholic church in the th century to stop secularization and protestantism
one of the main jansenist aims was democratizing to stop the aristocratic corruption at the top of the church hierarchy
the participants of the taiping rebellion who founded the taiping heavenly kingdom a syncretic christian shenic theocratic kingdom are viewed by the chinese communist party as proto communists
soong ching ling was a methodist who held the highest positions in the communist people s republic of china
the hutterites believed in strict adherence to biblical principles church discipline and practiced a form of communism
the hutterites established in their communities a rigorous system of ordnungen which were codes of rules and regulations that governed all aspects of life and ensured a unified perspective
as an economic system christian communism was attractive to many of the peasants who supported social revolution in sixteenth century central europe such as the german peasants war and friedrich engels thus came to view anabaptists as proto communists
in the earliest years of the mormon movement joseph smith promoted the law of consecration and the concept of the united order
today some fundamentalist groups still apply this principle
pehr g trek translated the communist manifesto into swedish the same year it was published in german but made changes in it from his christian influence such as changing the now famous quote workers of the world unite to folkets r st guds r st i e
vox populi vox dei or people s voice is god s voice
he also wrote several works criticising the developing capitalist society from a christian perspective
christian communists typically regard biblical texts in acts and as evidence that the first christians lived in a communist society
this was likely based on an understanding of luke where christ commands his disciples to sell what they have and give alms and luke where he says that no one can be his disciple who has not forsaken all his possessions
this conclusion is bolstered by the fact that acts was also written by luke
montero offers anthropological evidence that the practices recounted in acts were historical and were practiced widely and taken seriously during at least the first two centuries of christianity
other biblical evidence of anti capitalistic belief systems include matthew no one can serve two masters
either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other
you cannot serve both god and money the slogan each according to his abilities has biblical origins too
acts states then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea the phrase to each according to his needs also has a biblical basis in acts stating to the emissaries to distribute to each according to his need
preaching by thomas wharton collens describes biblical sources supporting a common property society
christian communism does not depend merely on the principles of the early apostles
in fact christian communists claim that anti capitalist ideals are deeply rooted in the christian faith
while modern capitalism had not yet formed in the time of christ his message was overwhelmingly against the love of money greed and in support of the poor
christian communists see the principles of christ as staunchly anti capitalist in nature
since the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil timothy it seems natural for christians to oppose a social system founded as christian communists claim entirely on the love of money
capitalism is heavily based in the collection of usury which was condemned for centuries by the church based in numerous scriptures
in fact christian opposition to the emergence of such an interest based system largely delayed capitalist development and capitalism did not gather popular support until john calvin endorsed capitalist practice from a religious perspective

society of separatists of zoarboth christian communism and liberation theology stress orthopraxis over orthodoxy
a narrative of the nature of contemporary social struggles is developed via materialist analysis utilizing historiographic concepts developed by karl marx
a concrete example are the paraguayan sin tierra i e
landless movement who engage in direct land seizures and the establishment of socialized agricultural cooperative production in asentamientos
the contemporary paraguayan sin tierra operate in a very similar manner as that of the reformation era diggers
for camilo torres the founder of the colombian guerrilla group eln developing this orthopraxis meant celebrating the catholic eucharist only among those engaged in armed struggle against the army of the colombian state while fighting alongside them
the democratic socialist social gospel advocate martin luther king jr
made an assertion that no christian can be a communist
he claimed that basic philosophy of christianity is unalterably opposed to the basic philosophy of communism citing what he saw as rampant secularism and materialism in communism as proof that communism leaves out god
he further claimed that for the communist there is no divine government or no absolute moral order there are no fixed immutable principles nevertheless king acknowledged that although communism can never be accepted by a christian it emphasizes many essential truths that must forever challenge us as christians he adds
christian communists may or may not agree with various parts of marxism such as on the way a socialist or communist society should be organized
however christian communists also share some of the political goals of marxists for example replacing capitalism with socialism which should in turn be followed by communism at a later point in the future
thomas approached the communist party but was rejected
he approached the church institution but was rejected
