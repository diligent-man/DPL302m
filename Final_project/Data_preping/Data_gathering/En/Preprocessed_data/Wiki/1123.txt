many styles of indian martial arts were banned by the colonial authorities during the period of british rule in india which led to a decline in their popularity
some such as kalaripayattu did not undergo such declines since they were mostly practised in areas of the indian subcontinent outside direct british control
other indian martial art such as silambam while not widely practiced in india continue to be practiced in other countries in the indian cultural sphere such as indonesia and malaysia
many other indian martial arts such as mardhani khel and paika akhada survived by practitioners practicing the art in secret or by telling the colonial authorities that it was a form of dance
while many regional indian martial arts forms are fading into obscurity martial arts such as gatka and kalaripayattu are experiencing a gradual resurgence
testing or evaluation is important to martial artists of many disciplines who wish to determine their progression or own level of skill in specific contexts
students often undergo periodic testing and grading by their own teacher in order to advance to a higher level of recognized achievement such as a different belt color or title
the type of testing used varies from system to system but may include forms or sparring
various forms and sparring are commonly used in martial art exhibitions and tournaments
some competitions pit practitioners of different disciplines against each other using a common set of rules these are referred to as mixed martial arts competitions
rules for sparring vary between art and organization but can generally be divided into light contact medium contact and full contact variants reflecting the amount of force that should be used on an opponent
these types of sparring restrict the amount of force that may be used to hit an opponent in the case of light sparring this is usually to touch contact e g
a punch should be pulled as soon as or before contact is made
in medium contact sometimes referred to as semi contact the punch would not be pulled but not hit with full force
as the amount of force used is restricted the aim of these types of sparring is not to knock out an opponent a point system is used in competitions
a referee acts to monitor for fouls and to control the match while judges mark down scores as in boxing
particular targets may be prohibited certain techniques may be forbidden such as headbutting or groin hits and fighters may be required to wear protective equipment on their head hands chest groin shins or feet
some grappling arts such as aikido use a similar method of compliant training that is equivalent to light or medium contact
in some styles such as fencing and some styles of taekwondo sparring competitors score points based on the landing of a single technique or strike as judged by the referee whereupon the referee will briefly stop the match award a point then restart the match
alternatively sparring may continue with the point noted by the judges
some critics of point sparring feel that this method of training teaches habits that result in lower combat effectiveness
lighter contact sparring may be used exclusively for children or in other situations when heavy contact would be inappropriate such as beginners medium contact sparring is often used as training for full contact
full contact sparring or competition where strikes or techniques are not pulled but used with full force as the name implies has a number of tactical differences from light and medium contact sparring
it is considered by some to be requisite in learning realistic unarmed combat
in full contact sparring the aim of a competitive match is to knock out the opponent or to force the opponent to submit
where scoring takes place it may be a subsidiary measure only used if no clear winner has been established by other means in some competitions such as the ufc there was no scoring though most now use some form of judging as a backup
due to these factors full contact matches tend to be more aggressive in character but rule sets may still mandate the use of protective equipment or limit the techniques allowed
nearly all mixed martial arts organizations such as ufc pancrase shooto use a form of full contact rules as do professional boxing organizations and k
kyokushin karate requires advanced practitioners to engage in bare knuckled full contact sparring allowing kicks knees and punching although punching to the head is disallowed while wearing only a karate gi and groin protector
brazilian jiu jitsu and judo matches do not allow striking but are full contact in the sense that full force is applied in the permitted grappling and submission techniques
competitions held by world taekwondo requires the use of headgear and padded vest but are full contact in the sense that full force is applied to strikes to the head and body and win by knockout is possible
martial arts have crossed over into sports when forms of sparring become competitive becoming a sport in its own right that is dissociated from the original combative origin such as with western fencing
the summer olympic games includes judo taekwondo western archery boxing javelin wrestling and fencing as events while chinese wushu recently failed in its bid to be included but is still actively performed in tournaments across the world
practitioners in some arts such as kickboxing and brazilian jiu jitsu often train for sport matches whereas those in other arts such as aikido generally spurn such competitions
some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners and gives a sense of good sportsmanship
others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have diminished the combat effectiveness of martial arts or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than a focus such as cultivating a particular moral character
the question of which is the best martial art has led to inter style competitions fought with very few rules allowing a variety of fighting styles to enter with few limitations
this was the origin of the first ultimate fighting championship tournament later renamed ufc the beginning in the usa inspired by the brazilian vale tudo tradition and along with other minimal rule competitions most notably those from japan such as shooto and pancrase have evolved into the combat sport of mixed martial arts mma
some martial artists compete in non sparring competitions such as breaking or choreographed routines of techniques such as poomse kata and aka or modern variations of the martial arts which include dance influenced competitions such as tricking
martial traditions have been influenced by governments to become more sport like for political purposes the central impetus for the attempt by the people s republic of china in transforming chinese martial arts into the committee regulated sport of wushu was suppressing what they saw as the potentially subversive aspects of martial training especially under the traditional system of family lineages
martial arts training aims to result in several benefits to trainees such as their physical mental emotional and spiritual health
through systematic practice in the martial arts a person s physical fitness may be boosted strength stamina speed flexibility movement coordination etc as the whole body is exercised and the entire muscular system is activated
beyond contributing to physical fitness martial arts training also has benefits for mental health contributing to self esteem self control emotional and spiritual well being
for this reason a number of martial arts schools have focused purely on therapeutic aspects de emphasizing the historical aspect of self defense or combat completely
according to bruce lee martial arts also have the nature of an art since there is emotional communication and complete emotional expression
some traditional martial concepts have seen new use within modern military training
perhaps the most recent example of this is point shooting which relies on muscle memory to more effectively utilize a firearm in a variety of awkward situations much the way an iaidoka would master movements with their sword
during the world war ii era william e
fairbairn and eric a
sykes were recruited by the special operations executive soe to teach their martial art of defendu itself drawing on western boxing and jujutsu and pistol shooting to uk us and canadian special forces
the book kill or get killed written by colonel rex applegate was based on the defendu taught by sykes and fairbairn
both fairbairn s get tough and appelgate s kill or get killed became classic works on hand to hand combat
traditional hand to hand knife and spear techniques continue to see use in the composite systems developed for today s wars
examples of this include european unifight the us army s combatives system developed by matt larsen the israeli army s kapap and krav maga and the us marine corps s marine corps martial arts program mcmap
unarmed dagger defenses identical to those found in the manual of fiore dei liberi and the codex wallerstein were integrated into the u s
army s training manuals in

the rifle mounted bayonet which has its origin in the spear has seen use by the united states army the united states marine corps and the british army as recently as the iraq war

asian martial arts experienced a surge of popularity in the west during the s and the rising demand resulted in numerous low quality or fraudulent schools
fueled by fictional depictions in martial arts movies this led to the ninja craze of the s in the united states
there were also numerous fraudulent ads for martial arts training programs inserted into comic books circa the s and s which were read primarily by adolescent boys
in the seventies lower ranks kyu began to be given colorful belts to show progress
