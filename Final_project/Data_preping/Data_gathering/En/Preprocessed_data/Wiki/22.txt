the west bank arabic romanized a iffah al arbiyyah hebrew romanized hagadah hama aravit also referred to by some israelis as judea and samaria yehuda veshomron is a landlocked territory near the coast of the mediterranean in western asia
it is bordered by jordan and the dead sea to the east and by israel see green line to the south west and north
under an israeli military occupation since its area is split into palestinian islands that are under partial civil administration by the palestinian national authority pna and israeli settlements into which israeli law is pipelined
the west bank s borders also include the lands that comprise east jerusalem
it initially emerged as a jordanian occupied territory after the arab israeli war before being annexed outright by jordan in and was given its name during this time based on its location on the left bank of the jordan river
the territory remained under jordanian rule until when it was captured by israel during the six day war
the oslo accords signed between the palestine liberation organization and israel created administrative districts with varying levels of palestinian autonomy in specific areas area a which is administered exclusively by the pna area b which is administered by both the pna and israel and area c which is administered exclusively by israel
area c accounts for over of the west bank s territory
the west bank including east jerusalem has a land area of km plus a water area of km consisting of the northwestern quarter of the dead sea
it has an estimated population of palestinians and over israeli settlers live in the west bank of which live in east jerusalem
the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem to be illegal under international law though israel disputes this
a advisory ruling by the international court of justice concluded that events that came after the capture of the west bank by israel including the jerusalem law the israel jordan peace treaty and the oslo accords did not change the status of the west bank and east jerusalem as israeli occupied territory
alongside the self governing gaza strip the israeli occupied west bank and east jerusalem are claimed by the state of palestine as its sovereign territory and thus remain a flashpoint of the israeli palestinian conflict
the name west bank is a translation of the arabic term a iffah al arbiyyah which designates the territory situated on the western side of the jordan river that was occupied in and subsequently annexed in by the hashemite kingdom of jordan
this annexation was widely considered to be illegal and was recognized only by iraq pakistan and the united kingdom
the neo latin name cisjordan or cis jordan lit on this side of the river jordan is the usual name for the territory in the romance languages and in hungarian
the name west bank however has become the standard usage for this geopolitical entity in english and some of the other germanic languages since its inception following the jordanian capture
the analogous transjordan lit on the other side of the river jordan has historically been used to designate the region now roughly comprising the hashemite kingdom of jordan which lies to the east of the jordan river
from through the area now known as the west bank was under turkish rule as part of ottoman syria
at the san remo conference the victorious allies of world war i allocated the area to the british mandate of palestine
the san remo resolution adopted on april incorporated the balfour declaration of
it and article of the covenant of the league of nations were the basic documents upon which the british mandate of palestine was constructed
the united kingdom proclaimed abdullah i as emir of the emirate of transjordan on april he declared it an independent hashemite kingdom on may
under the united nations in it was subsequently designated as part of a proposed arab state by the partition plan for palestine
resolution recommended the splitting of the british mandate into a jewish state an arab state and an internationally administered enclave of jerusalem a broader region of the modern day west bank was assigned to the arab state
the resolution designated the territory described as the hill country of samaria and judea the area now known as the west bank as part of the proposed arab state but following the arab israeli war this area was captured by transjordan
the armistice agreements defined the interim boundary between israel and jordan essentially reflecting the battlefield after the war
following the december jericho conference transjordan annexed the area west of the jordan river in naming it west bank or cisjordan and designated the area east of the river as east bank or transjordan
jordan as it was now known ruled over the west bank from until
jordan s annexation was never formally recognized by the international community with the exception of the united kingdom and iraq
a two state option dividing palestine as opposed to a binary solution arose during the period of the british mandate in the area
the united nations partition plan had envisaged two states one jewish and the other arab palestinian but in the wake of the war only one emerged at the time
during the war israel occupied parts of what was designated in the un partition plan as palestine
king abdullah of jordan had been crowned king of jerusalem by the coptic bishop on november
palestinian arabs in the west bank and east jerusalem were granted jordanian citizenship and half of the jordanian parliament seats
many refugees continued to live in camps and relied on unrwa assistance for sustenance
palestinian refugees constituted more than a third of the kingdom s population of million
the last jordanian elections in which west bank residents would vote were those of april but their parliamentary representatives would continue in office until when west bank seats were finally abolished
palestinians enjoyed equal opportunities in all sectors of the state without discrimination
agriculture remained the primary activity of the territory
the west bank despite its smaller area contained half of jordan s agricultural land
in of the labor force of worked in agriculture and km were under cultivation
in workers were employed in industry producing of the gnp
this number fell after the war and would not be surpassed until
the tourism industry also played an important role
branches of arab banks were present
the jordanian dinar became legal tender and remains so there today
of jordan s fruit growing land and of its vegetables lay in the west bank and with the onset of the occupation the area could no longer produce export earnings
on the eve of occupation the west bank accounted for of jordanian gnp between and of its agricultural output and almost half of its manpower though only a third of jordanian investment was allocated to it and mainly to the private housing construction sector
though its per capita product was times greater than that of the west bank the israeli economy on the eve of occupation had experienced two years of a sharp recession
immediately after the occupation from to the economy boomed
in the palestinian economy had a gross domestic product of per capita for a million people with the west bank population at of whom were refugees and was growing annually by
west bank growth compared to gaza had lagged due to the effect of mass emigration of west bankers seeking employment in jordan
as agriculture gave way to industrial development in israel in the west bank the former still generated of domestic product and industry a mere
the growth rate of the west bank economy in the period of the jordanian rule of the west bank before israeli occupation had ticked along at an annual rate of
this rate of growth was indispensable if the post war west bank were to achieve economic self reliance
of jordan s fruit growing land and of its vegetables lay in the west bank and with the onset of the occupation the area could no longer produce export earnings
in june the west bank and east jerusalem were captured by israel as a result of the six day war
with the exception of east jerusalem and the former israeli jordanian no man s land the west bank was not annexed by israel it remained under israeli military control until
although the arab league summit resolution at rabat designated the palestinian liberation organization plo as the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to the area until when it severed all administrative and legal ties with the west bank and eventually stripped west bank palestinians of jordanian citizenship
in as a result of the israeli egyptian peace treaty the direct military rule was transformed into a semi civil authority operating directly under the israeli ministry of defense thus taking control of civil matters of palestinians from the idf to civil servants in the ministry of defense
the israeli settlements were on the other hand administered subsequently as judea and samaria area directly by israel
since the oslo accords the palestinian authority officially controls a geographically non contiguous territory comprising approximately of the west bank known as area a which remains subject to israeli incursions
area b approximately is subject to joint israeli palestinian military and palestinian civil control
area c approximately is under full israeli control
though nations refer to the west bank including east jerusalem as occupied palestinian territory the state of israel quotes the un that only territories captured in war from an established and recognized sovereign are considered occupied territories
after the split between fatah and hamas the west bank areas under palestinian control are an exclusive part of the palestinian authority while the gaza strip is ruled by hamas
the jordanians neglected to invest much in the area during their time governing the area although there was some investment in the immediate vicinity of jerusalem
soon after the war yigal allon produced the allon plan which would have annexed a strip along the jordan river valley and excluded areas closer to the pre border which had a high density of palestinians
moshe dayan proposed a plan which gershom gorenberg likens to a photo negative of allon s the allon plan evolved over a period of time to include more territory
the final draft dating from would have annexed about half of the west bank
israel had no overall approach for integrating the west bank
the early occupation set severe limits on public investment and comprehensive development programmes in the territories
british and arab commercial banks operating in the west bank were closed down soon after israel assumed power there
bank leumi then opened nine branches without successfully replacing the earlier system
farmers could get loans but palestinian businessmen avoided taking out loans from them since they charged compared to interest in jordan
by june only a third of west bank land had been registered under jordan s settlement of disputes over land and water law and in israel moved to cancel the possibility of registering one s title with the jordanian land register
ian lustick states that israel virtually prevented palestinian investment in local industry and agriculture
at the same time israel encouraged arab labour to enter into israel s economy and regarded them as a new expanded and protected market for israeli exports
limited export of palestinian goods to israel was allowed
expropriation of prime agricultural land in an economy where two thirds of the workforce had farmed is believed to account for the flight of labourers to work in israel
as much as of the workforce commuted to israel on a daily basis finding only poorly paid menial employment
remittances from labourers earning a wage in israel were the major factor in palestinian economic growth during the boom years but the migration of workers from the territories had a negative impact on local industry by creating an internal labour scarcity in the west bank and consequent pressure for higher wages there the contrast between the quality of their lives and israelis growing prosperity stoked resentment
attempting to impose governmental authority israel established a licensing system according to which no industrial plant could be built without obtaining a prior israeli permit
with military order no
june the local commander was given the power and authority to block any construction if in his evaluation the building might pose a danger to israel s security
the overall effect was to obstruct manufacturing development and subordinate any local industrial activity to the exigencies of israel s economy or to block the creation of industries that might compete with israel s
for example entrepreneurs were denied a permit for a cement factory in hebron
in order to protect israeli farmers melon production was forbidden imports of grapes and dates were banned and limits were set to how many cucumbers and tomatoes could be produced
israeli milk producers exerted pressure on the ministry for industry and trade to stop the establishment of a competitive dairy in ramallah
the sum effect after two decades was that of all palestinian firms in the west bank and gaza employing over eight people and with seven or less were prohibited from selling their products in israel
israeli protectionist policies thus distorted wider trade relations to the point that by of all west bank imports came from israel with consumers paying more than they would for comparable products had they been able to exercise commercial autonomy
from to the west bank was part of the ottoman empire
turkey successor state to the ottoman empire renounced its territorial claims in signing the treaty of lausanne and the area now called the west bank became an integral part of the british mandate for palestine
during the mandate period britain had no right of sovereignty which was held by the people under the mandate
nevertheless britain as custodians of the land implemented the land tenure laws in palestine which it had inherited from the ottoman turks as defined in the ottoman land code of applying these laws to both arab and jewish legal tenants or otherwise
in the un general assembly recommended that the area that became the west bank become part of a future arab state but this proposal was opposed by the arab states at the time
in jordan occupied the west bank and annexed it in
in israel captured the west bank from jordan in the six day war
un security council resolution followed calling for withdrawal return to the armistice lines from territories occupied in the conflict in exchange for peace and mutual recognition
since the united nations security council the united nations general assembly the united states the eu the international court of justice and the international committee of the red cross refer to the west bank including east jerusalem as occupied palestinian territory or the occupied territories
general assembly resolution may affirmed that the palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over the area
the international court of justice and the supreme court of israel have ruled that the status of the west bank is that of military occupation
in its advisory opinion the international court of justice concluded that
in the same vein the israeli supreme court stated in the beit sourik case that
the executive branch of the israeli government through the ministry of foreign affairs has defined the west bank as disputed instead of occupied territory whose status can only be determined through negotiations
the ministry says that occupied territories are territories captured in war from an established and recognized sovereign and that since the west bank wasn t under the legitimate and recognized sovereignty of any state prior to the six day war it shouldn t be considered an occupied territory
the international court of justice ruling of july however found that the west bank including east jerusalem is territory held by israel under military occupation regardless of its status prior to it coming under israeli occupation and that the fourth geneva convention applies de jure
the international community regards the west bank including east jerusalem as territories occupied by israel
international law article of the fourth geneva convention prohibits transfers of the population of an occupying power to occupied territories incurring a responsibility on the part of israel s government to not settle israeli citizens in the west bank
as of february of the member states of the united nations have recognised the state of palestine within the palestinian territories which are recognized by israel to constitute a single territorial unit and of which the west bank is the core of the would be state
the future status of the west bank together with the gaza strip on the mediterranean shore has been the subject of negotiation between the palestinians and israelis although the road map for peace proposed by the quartet comprising the united states russia the european union and the united nations envisions an independent palestinian state in these territories living side by side with israel see also proposals for a palestinian state
however the road map states that in the first phase palestinians must end all attacks on israel whereas israel must dismantle all outposts
the palestinian authority believes that the west bank ought to be a part of their sovereign nation and that the presence of israeli military control is a violation of their right to palestinian authority rule
the united nations calls the west bank and gaza strip israeli occupied territories
the united states state department also refers to the territories as occupied
in the united states ambassador to israel daniel c
kurtzer expressed u s
support for the retention by israel of major israeli population centres in the west bank as an outcome of negotiations reflecting president bush s statement a year earlier that a permanent peace treaty would have to reflect demographic realities on the west bank
in may us president barack obama officially stated us support for a future palestinian state based on borders prior to the war allowing for land swaps where they are mutually agreeable between the two sides
obama was the first us president to formally support the policy but he stated that it had been one long held by the us in its middle east negotiations
in december a resolution was adopted by united nations security council that condemned israel s settlement activity as a flagrant violation of international law with no legal validity
it demands that israel stop such activity and fulfill its obligations as an occupying power under the fourth geneva convention
the united states abstained from the vote
in president donald trump unveiled a peace plan radically different from previous peace plans
the plan failed to gain support
palestinian public opinion opposes israeli military and settler presence on the west bank as a violation of their right to statehood and sovereignty
israeli opinion is split into a number of views
complete or partial withdrawal from the west bank in hopes of peaceful coexistence in separate states sometimes called the land for peace position in a poll of israelis supported a peace agreement based on that principle
maintenance of a military presence in the west bank to reduce palestinian terrorism by deterrence or by armed intervention while relinquishing some degree of political control
annexation of the west bank while considering the palestinian population with palestinian authority citizenship with israeli residence permit as per the elon peace plan
annexation of the west bank and assimilation of the palestinian population to fully fledged israeli citizens
transfer of the east jerusalem palestinian population a poll at the height of the al aqsa intifada found of israelis favoring palestinian transfer of jerusalem residents the west bank has an area of square kilometres sq mi which comprises of former mandatory palestine excluding jordan and has generally rugged mountainous terrain
the total length of the land boundaries of the region are kilometres miles
the terrain is mostly rugged dissected upland some vegetation in the west but somewhat barren in the east
the elevation span between the shoreline of the dead sea at m to the highest point at mount nabi yunis at m ft above sea level
the area of west bank is landlocked highlands are main recharge area for israel s coastal aquifers
there are few natural resources in the area except the highly arable land which comprises of the land area of the region
it is mostly used as permanent pastures of arable land and seasonal agricultural uses
forests and woodland comprise just with no permanent crops
the climate in the west bank is mostly mediterranean slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline west to the area
in the east the west bank includes the judean desert and the shoreline of the dead sea both with dry and hot climate
the oslo accords declared the final status of the west bank to be subject to a forthcoming settlement between israel and the palestinian leadership
following these interim accords israel withdrew its military rule from some parts of the west bank which was divided into three administrative divisions of the oslo accords
area a full civil control of the palestinian authority comprises palestinian towns and some rural areas away from israeli settlements in the north between jenin nablus tubas and tulkarm the south around hebron and one in the center south of salfit
area b adds other populated rural areas many closer to the center of the west bank
area c contains all the israeli settlements excluding settlements in east jerusalem roads used to access the settlements buffer zones near settlements roads strategic areas and israel and almost all of the jordan valley and the judean desert
areas a and b are themselves divided among separate areas of which are smaller than square kilometers sq mi that are separated from one another by israeli controlled area c
areas a b and c cross the governorates used as administrative divisions by the palestinian national authority israel and the idf and named after major cities
the mainly open areas of area c which contains all of the basic resources of arable and building land water springs quarries and sites of touristic value needed to develop a viable palestinian state were to be handed over to the palestinians by under the oslo accords as part of a final status agreement
this agreement was never achieved
according to b tselem while the vast majority of the palestinian population lives in areas a and b the vacant land available for construction in dozens of villages and towns across the west bank is situated on the margins of the communities and defined as area c
less than of area c is designated for use by palestinians who are also unable to legally build in their own existing villages in area c due to israeli authorities restrictions
an assessment by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in found that approximately of the west bank was taken up by israeli infrastructure
the infrastructure consisting of settlements the barrier military bases and closed military areas israeli declared nature reserves and the roads that accompany them is off limits or tightly controlled to palestinians
in june the independent commission for human rights published a report that found that palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip were subjected in to an almost systematic campaign of human rights abuse by the palestinian authority and hamas as well as by israeli authorities with the security forces of the pa and hamas being responsible for torture arrests and arbitrary detentions
through the jerusalem law israel extended its administrative control over east jerusalem
this has often been interpreted as tantamount to an official annexation though ian lustick in reviewing the legal status of israeli measures has argued that no such annexation ever took place
the palestinian residents have legal permanent residency status
rejecting the jerusalem law the un security council passed un security council resolution declaring that the law was null and void
although permanent residents are permitted if they wish to receive israeli citizenship if they meet certain conditions including swearing allegiance to the state and renouncing any other citizenship most palestinians did not apply for israeli citizenship for political reasons
there are various possible reasons as to why the west bank had not been annexed to israel after its capture in
the government of israel has not formally confirmed an official reason however historians and analysts have established a variety of such most of them demographic
among those most commonly cited have been
reluctance to award its citizenship to an overwhelming number of a potentially hostile population whose allies were sworn to the destruction of israel
to ultimately exchange land for peace with neighbouring states
fear that the population of ethnic arabs including israeli citizens of palestinian ethnicity would outnumber the jewish israelis west of the jordan river
the disputed legality of annexation under the fourth geneva conventionthe importance of demographic concerns to some significant figures in israel s leadership was illustrated when avraham burg a former knesset speaker and former chair of the jewish agency for israel wrote in the guardian in september
between the jordan and the mediterranean there is no longer a clear jewish majority
and so fellow citizens it is not possible to keep the whole thing without paying a price
we cannot keep a palestinian majority under an israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the middle east
there cannot be democracy without equal rights for all who live here arab as well as jew
we cannot keep the territories and preserve a jewish majority in the world s only jewish state not by means that are humane and moral and jewish as of there are over israeli settlers living in israeli settlements in the west bank excluding east jerusalem with an additional jewish settlers residing in settlements in east jerusalem
in addition there are over israeli outposts in the west bank that are not recognized and are therefore illegal even under israeli law but that are nevertheless been provided with infrastructure water sewage and other services by the authorities
they are colloquially known as illegal outposts
as a result of the application of israeli law in the settlements enclave law large portions of israeli civil law are applied to israeli settlements and to israelis living in the israeli occupied territories
the international consensus is that all israeli settlements on the west bank are illegal under international law
in particular the european union as a whole considers all settlements to be illegal
significant portions of the israeli public similarly oppose the continuing presence of jewish israelis in the west bank and have supported the settlement relocation
the majority of legal scholars also hold the settlements to violate international law however individuals including julius stone and eugene rostow have argued that they are legal under international law
immediately after the war theodor meron legal counselor of israel s foreign ministry advised israeli ministers in a top secret memo that any policy of building settlements across occupied territories violated international law and would contravene the explicit provisions of the fourth geneva convention
the un security council has issued several non binding resolutions addressing the issue of the settlements
typical of these is un security council resolution which states that the practices of israel in establishing settlements in the palestinian and other arab territories occupied since have no legal validity and it calls on israel as the occupying power to abide scrupulously by the fourth geneva convention
the conference of high contracting parties to the fourth geneva convention held in geneva on december called upon the occupying power to fully and effectively respect the fourth geneva convention in the occupied palestinian territory including east jerusalem and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the convention the high contracting parties reaffirmed the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof
on december israeli prime minister ehud olmert issued an order requiring approval by both the israeli prime minister and israeli defense minister of all settlement activities including planning in the west bank
the change had little effect with settlements continuing to expand and new ones being established
on august israel announced it was appropriating hectares of land in the west bank to eventually house israel families
the appropriation was described as the largest in more than years
according to reports on israel radio the development is a response to the kidnapping and murder of israeli teenagers
the haaretz newspaper published an article in december about demolition of palestinian outposts in bil in
the demolitions sparked a political debate as according to peacenow it was a double standard after what happened today in bil in there is no reason that the state should defend its decision to continue the construction credited to michael sfard
in january the european union approved the area c and palestinian state building report
the report said palestinian presence in area c has been continuously undermined by israel and that state building efforts in area c of the palestinian authority pa and the eu were of utmost importance in order to support the creation of a contiguous and viable palestinian state
the eu will support various projects to support the palestinian people and help maintain their presence
in may a petition was filed to the israeli supreme court about the legality of more palestinian outposts and palestinian building in area c
the cases were filed by regavim
the petition was one of different petitions with the common ground of illegal land takeover and illegal construction and use of natural resources
some of the petitions had been set for trials and the majority received a verdict
ynet news stated on january that a group of palestinians with unknown number of foreign activists created an outpost named bab al shams gate of the sun contains tents
ynet news stated on january that palestinian activists built an outpost on a disputed area in beit iksa where israel plans to construct part of the separation fence in the jerusalem vicinity while the palestinians claim that the area belongs to the residents of beit iksa
named bab al krama
the israeli west bank barrier is a physical barrier ordered for construction by the israeli government consisting of a network of fences with vehicle barrier trenches surrounded by an on average meters ft wide exclusion area and up to meters ft high concrete walls although in most areas the wall is not nearly that high
it is located mainly within the west bank partly along the armistice line or green line between the west bank and israel
the length of the barrier as approved by the israeli government is kilometers mi long
as of approximately kilometers mi have been constructed
the space between the barrier and the green line is a closed military zone known as the seam zone cutting off of the west bank and encompassing dozens of villages and tens of thousands of palestinians
the barrier generally runs along or near the jordanian israeli armistice green line but diverges in many places to include on the israeli side several of the highly populated areas of jewish settlements in the west bank such as east jerusalem ariel gush etzion immanuel karnei shomron givat ze ev oranit and maale adumim
supporters of the barrier claim it is necessary for protecting israeli civilians from palestinian attacks which increased significantly during the al aqsa intifada it has helped reduce incidents of terrorism by from to over a reduction in terror attacks in the six years ending in though israel s state comptroller has acknowledged that most of the suicide bombers crossed into israel through existing checkpoints
its supporters claim that the onus is now on the palestinian authority to fight terrorism
opponents claim the barrier is an illegal attempt to annex palestinian land under the guise of security violates international law has the intent or effect to pre empt final status negotiations and severely restricts palestinian livelihoods particularly limiting their freedom of movement within and from the west bank thereby undermining their economy
after the signing of the oslo accords the west bank was divided into governorates under the jurisdiction of the palestinian national authority
since there are two governments claiming to be the legitimate government of the palestinian national authority one based in the west bank and one based in the gaza strip
the west bank is further divided into administrative regions menashe jenin area habik a jordan valley shomron shechem area known in arabic as nablus efrayim tulkarm area binyamin ramallah al bireh area maccabim maccabim area etzion bethlehem area and yehuda hebron area
allenby bridge or king hussein bridge is the main port for the palestinian in the west bank to the jordanian borders
this crossing point is controlled by israel since
it was inaugurated on december under the military order entitled an order concerning transition station
later order was issued which annexed the damia bridge crossing point to the allenby bridge as a commercial crossing point only
goods were exported to jordan while the import was banned for security purposes
in the palestinian national authority according to oslo accord assigned by plo and the israeli government became a partial supervisor over the rafah border crossing to gaza strip
the palestinian authority was responsible for issuing passports to palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip
however israel remained the major responsible party for this crossing point
according to the agreement israel has the right to independently inspect luggage and to maintain security
in addition it can prevent anyone from using the crossing
as of the early st century the economy of the palestinian territories is chronically depressed with unemployment rates constantly over since in the west bank in first half of
according to a world bank report israeli restrictions hinder palestinian economic development in area c of the west bank
a world bank report calculates that if the interim agreement was respected and restrictions lifted a few key industries alone would produce us billion per annum more or of palestinian gdp and reduce by some us million the palestinian authority s deficit the employment would increase by
amnesty international has criticized the way that the israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources
israeli settlers in the west bank have seized dozens of wells from palestinians
the wells are privately owned by palestinians and the settlers forcibly took them gave them hebrew names and with the assistance of the israeli military prevent arab people including the wells owners from using the wells and the pools the wells feed
israel ratified the international basel convention treaty on israel on december according to which any transfer of waste must be performed with an awareness of the dangers posed to the disempowered occupied people
it forbids the creation among them of environmental sacrifice zones israel it is argued uses the west bank as a sacrifice zone for placing waste treatment plants which are there under less stringent rules that those required in israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment
the military authorities do not render public the details of these operations
these materials consist of such things as sewage sludge infectious medical waste used oils solvents metals electronic waste and batteries
in it was estimated that mcm a year of all wastewater flowing into the west bank derived from settlements and jerusalem
of the settlements surveyed had wastewater treatment plant much of it inadequate or subject to breakdown with much sewage flowing into lowland streams and terrain where palestinian villages are located
only of indictments for waste pollution were made over the years from to whereas in israel the laws are strictly applied and in alone enforcements for the same abuse were enforced
at the same time of palestinian wastewater was not treated with only of israeli plants built in the s to that purpose functioning and the neglect to improve the infrastructure is attributed to israeli budgetary problems
after the oslo accords the global community earmarked for west bank wastewater infrastructure
israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to israeli settlements which neither the donors nor palestinians accepted
most of the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by idf military operations
the pa did raise funds from germany for plants but only managed to build one at al bireh within area b though even there israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of psagot though refusing to pay fees for the treatment
palestinian towns like salfit have been deeply affected by sewage overflow channeled past the town from the settlement of ariel
unlike the data available for sewage treatment within israel the israeli water commission refuses to provide public reports on million cubic metres of sewage flowing from israeli settlements in the west bank
it claims is treated adequately but independent israeli studies suggest that only met israeli treatment standards while was either not treated adequastely or discharged raw
since then some improvements have been implemented
the landfill near al jiftlik in the jericho governorate built on absentee palestinian property without planning or an environment impact analysis is for the exclusive use of waste tons per day produced by israeli settlements and cities within israel
palestinians are restricted to landfills and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage
even if a permit is given without this agreement settler waste under military escort is still dumped there
israel has been accused of engaging in warfare ecology in the west bank
in response to local opposition in israel to waste treatment plants and the high cost of meeting stringent environment laws in that country
it has been argued that israel had used the area of the west bank as a sacrifice zone where its waste can be dumped
many waste treatment facilities in the west bank were built for processing waste generated inside israeli sovereign territory according to b tselem israel s leading human rights organization for monitoring the west bank
at least waste treatment plants operate in the west bank and most of the waste they process is brought over from within the green line inside israel proper
of these facilities six process hazardous waste including infectious medical waste used oils and solvents metals batteries and electronic industry byproducts and one facility that processes sewage sludge
the israel government requires no reporting by these west bank facilities of the amount of waste they process or the risks they pose to the local population and applies less rigorous regulatory standards to these facilities than it does to solid waste treatment facilities in israel
b tselem israel s leading independent human rights organization for monitoring human rights in the west bank has observed that any transfer of waste to the west bank is a breach of international law which israel is dutybound to uphold because according to international law an occupied territory or its resources may not be used for the benefit of the occupying power s own needs experts have also warned that some of these facilities are garbage dumps that endanger the purity of the mountain aquifer which is one of the largest sources of water in the region
in the palestinian water authority pwa was established by a presidential decree
one year later its functions objectives and responsibilities were defined through a by law giving the pwa the mandate to manage water resources and execute the water policy
about of the palestinians in the territories had access to improved sanitation in
cesspits were used by of households while access to the sewer network increased to in up from in
in the west bank only out of m of wastewater were treated in five municipal wastewater treatment plants in hebron jenin ramallah tulkarem and al bireh
the al bireh plant was constructed in with funding by the german aid agency kfw
according to the world bank report the other four plants perform poorly concerning efficiency and quality
based on the number of quarries per km in areas a and b it is calculated that were israel to lift restrictions a further quarries could be opened in area c
the world bank estimates that israel s virtual ban on issuing palestinians permits for quarries there costs the palestinian economy at least us million per year
in international law drawing on the hague conventions article it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets and that the usufruct must benefit the people under occupation
the oslo accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the palestinian authority
israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the west bank and they sell of their material to israel which arguably constitutes depletion and pays royalties to its west bank military government and settlement municipalities
thus the german cement firm quarrying at nahal raba paid out in taxes to the samaria regional council in alone
the israeli high court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after decades israeli law must adapt to the realities on the ground
the state did undertake not to open more quarries
as an illustrative example a human rights watch report contrasts the difference between a palestinian owned quarry company in beit fajar and that of a european one working on what israeli considers its state land
the european company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone whereas israel refuses permits for most of the roughly beit fajar quarries or nearly any other palestinian owned quarry in the west bank under israeli administration
israel had denied palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the west bank
