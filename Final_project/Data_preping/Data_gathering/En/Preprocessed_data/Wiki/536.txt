The Perry Hall Improvement Association (PHIA) is the oldest and largest civic organization in northeastern Baltimore County, Maryland
 Since Perry Hall is not incorporated, the PHIA is the dominant communitywide coalition in the area.
An early version of the PHIA operated during the Second World War when Perry Hall residents organized a Health Committee to help veterans purchase wheelchairs, crutches, and other equipment
 After the war ended, many of these leaders decided to create a permanent organization
 The first meeting of the Perry Hall Improvement Association was held on July 31, 1945.
After World War II, there was a wave of growth in northeastern Baltimore County
 The PHIA defeated plans for a cemetery on the South Farm, a racetrack on Forge Road, and a drive-in movie theater near St
Joseph's Roman Catholic Church
 The PHIA also lobbied for lights along Joppa, Forge, and Cross Roads and Schroeder and Bauer Avenues
 The PHIA pressured Baltimore County officials to fund road improvements and build new schools
 Its most significant accomplishment came on September 8, 1963, when Baltimore County Executive Spiro Agnew and other officials dedicated the new Perry Hall library on Belair Road.
The PHIA worked on civic activities as well, starting a Community Christmas Party in 1946 and a Halloween Parade in 1949
In 1976, the PHIA helped form a Bicentennial Committee that hosted events at the old Perry Hall School
By the 1970s and 1980s, however, leaders spent much of their time dealing with development
 The most symbolic loss for the community was the development of Lassahn Field, long used for soccer games, carnivals, and Easter egg hunts.
By the early 1990s, the community celebrated the opening of the Seven Oaks Senior Center and two new elementary schools, Seven Oaks and Joppa View
 In 1994, the PHIA provided critical local support for the Honeygo Plan, a blueprint for developing Perry Hall's rural northeast.
With the Honeygo Plan adopted and much of the community now built-out, the PHIA focused in the late 1990s on some of the civic activities that had been abandoned years earlier
 In 2000, Perry Hall celebrated its 225th birthday
 The PHIA worked with other groups to restart the Halloween Parade and begin a summer concert series, the centerpiece of which was a performance by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra
 Also, that year, the PHIA worked with other groups and elected officials to preserve the Perry Hall Mansion
 The mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980
In November 2001, Baltimore County leaders announced plans to purchase the property.
Between 1996 and 2009, the PHIA membership grew from 200 members to more than 2,000
Recently, the PHIA has focused on construction of a new Perry Hall Schools, completion of several new parks, stopping overdevelopment, and strategies to reduce school overcrowding.
The PHIA is governed by an executive board that includes Jack Amrhein, president; Kevin Leary, vice-president; Tom Benisch, treasurer; Renee Papavasiliou, secretary; and several members-at-large members.
