Girona Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral of Saint Mary of Girona (in Catalan: Catedral de Santa Maria de Girona or simply Catedral de Girona), is a Roman Catholic church located in Girona, Catalonia, Spain
It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Girona
The cathedral's interior includes the widest Gothic nave in the world, with a width of 23 metres (75 ft), and the second-widest of any church after that of St
Peter's Basilica (for comparison, the width of the nave of Reims Cathedral is 14.65 m, Saint-Étienne de Sens, 15.25 m and 12 m, in Notre Dame de Paris)
Its construction was begun in the 11th century in the Romanesque architectural style, and continued in the 13th century in the Gothic style
Of the original Romanesque edifice only the 12th-century cloister and a bell tower remain
The second bell tower was completed in the 18th century.
A primitive Christian church existed here before the Islamic conquest of Iberia, after which it was converted into a mosque, in 717
The Franks reconquered the city in 785 under Charlemagne and the church was reconsecrated in 908.
In 1015, the church was in poor condition
Bishop Peter Roger, son of Count Roger I of Carcassonne, restored it with the money obtained by selling the church of the St
Daniel to his brother-in-law, Count Ramon Borrell of Barcelona
The church and its cloister were built until 1064, in Romanesque style
The bell tower was completed in 1117.
The complex was redesigned by Pere Sacoma in 1312
After some years of indecisiveness, Guillem Bofill and Antoni Canet started the project in 1416
The new design consisted of a large Gothic nave, the widest Gothic nave in the world—22.98 m—and the second-widest nave of all styles after St
Peter's Basilica in Rome
The elevation in the vault is 35 metres (115 ft).
The church has a Baroque main façade (begun in 1606, with the upper part finished in 1961), preceded by a large staircase completed in 1607
The sculptures decorating the three orders of the façade were executed by local sculptors in the 1960s
Other exterior features include the Gothic portal of St
Michael, on the northern façade, and the southern portico of the Apostles, from the 14th century
The latter originally featured sculptures of the Twelve Apostles, executed by Antoni Claperós in the 1460s, which have mostly been lost, aside from two depicting St
Peter and St
Paul, now in the church's chapter house.
The church has two bell towers
The oldest one, named after Charlemagne, is the surviving one of the two originally flanking the first Romanesque church (the other ceased to exist in the 14th century)
Begun in the early 11th century, it has a square plan with six levels separated by friezes with Lombard bands and double mullioned windows
The new bell tower (70 m high) started in 1590 and completed (with a modified design) in the 18th century, has an octagonal plan
It houses six bells, the oldest one dating to 1574.
The interior's single nave is surmounted by cross vaults, supported by Gothic buttresses
The side walls feature a triforium with pointed-arch stained glass windows
The apse is separated from the nave by a wall reaching to the vaulted ceiling and perforated with openings, namely one enormous ogive or pointed arch in the center framing the high altar, flanked by two smaller pointed arches as entrances to the ambulatory at the apse
The upper reaches of the wall bear a large central rose window (1705, dedicated to the Archangel St
Michael) flanked by two smaller ones
The polygonal apse is in turn flanked by two short galleries, with ogive or pointed arches as entrances, which correspond to the original aisles of the Romanesque building and are located at the starting point of the ambulatory
The latter is divided by piers aligned with the rays of the apse's trapezoidal vaults, forming ten radial chapels.
The high altar, in white marble, dates to the 11th century
Other artworks include the Gothic sarcophagus of Berenguer d'Anglesola (died 1418), by Pere Oller, in the chapel of Isabella of Portugal, the Chapel of All Saints (1376)
The Romanesque cloister is notable, featuring a series of columns with sculpted capitals: they depict fantastic figures and animals, and vegetable motifs
The frieze has instead scenes from the New Testament
Among the sculptors who worked at the cloister is Arnau Cadell, also author of the cloister of the Monastery of Sant Cugat
Also in the cloister is the Chapel of Our Lady of Gràcia i de Bell-Ull, which was originally a gate to the cloister, renovated in the Gothic period; its tympanum has an image of the Virgin by Master Bartomeu (13th century)
The cloister's galleries are home to numerous tombs of rich members of the monastery, dating to the 14th to 18th centuries, one also by Master Bartomeu (1273).
The museum's main attraction is the Tapestry of Creation, an 11th- or early-12th-century piece considered amongst the master works of Romanesque tapestry.
