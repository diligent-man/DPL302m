Federal elections were held in Germany on March after the Nazi seizure of power on January and just six days after the Reichstag fire
Nazi stormtroopers had unleashed a widespread campaign of violence against the Communist Party KPD left-wingers trade unionists the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Centre Party
They were the last multi-party all-German elections until
The election followed the previous year's two elections July and November and Hitler's appointment as Chancellor
In the months before the election brownshirts and SS displayed terror repression and propaganda across the land and Nazi organizations monitored the vote process
In Prussia members of the SS SA and Der Stahlhelm were ordered to monitor the votes by acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring as auxiliary police
The Nazi Party officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party or in German NSDAP registered a large increase in votes in and gained a Reichstag majority together with its coalition partner the German National People's Party DNVP
This was the first time since that a governing coalition had held a parliamentary majority
However despite waging a campaign of terror against their opponents the Nazis only tallied percent of the vote on their own well short of a majority to govern alone
This would be the last contested election held in Germany before World War II
Despite now holding a bare working majority in the Reichstag Hitler wanted more
Two weeks after the election he was able to pass an Enabling Act on March with the support of all non-left wing parties which effectively gave Hitler dictatorial powers
Within months the Nazis banned all other parties and turned the Reichstag into a rubberstamp legislature comprising only Nazis and pro-Nazi guests
The Nazi seizure of power commenced on January when President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor who immediately urged the dissolution of the Reichstag and the calling of new elections
On his second day as Chancellor Hitler opened his campaign with a nationwide radio address pledging to save the nation from the left-wing which he castigated as political nihilism In early February the Nazis unleashed a campaign of violence and terror that dwarfed anything seen so far
Sturmabteilung stormtroopers began attacking trade union and Communist Party KPD offices and the homes of left-wingers
In the second half of February the violence was extended to the Social Democrats with gangs of brownshirts breaking up Social Democrat meetings and beating up their speakers and audiences
Issues of Social Democratic newspapers were banned
Twenty newspapers of the Centre Party a party of Catholic Germans were banned in mid-February for criticising the new government
Government officials known to be Centre Party supporters were dismissed from their offices and stormtroopers violently attacked party meetings in Westphalia
Only the Nazi Party and the German National People's Party were allowed to campaign untouched
Six days before the scheduled election date the German parliament building was set alight in the Reichstag fire allegedly by the Dutch Communist Marinus van der Lubbe
That event reduced the popularity of the KPD and enabled Hitler to persuade Hindenburg to pass the Reichstag Fire Decree as an emergency decree according to Article of the Weimar Constitution
The emergency law removed many civil liberties and allowed the arrest of Ernst Thlmann and other leaders and members of the KPD shortly before the election suppressing the Communist vote and consolidating the position of the Nazis
Although Hitler could have banned the KPD outright he opted not to do so
He feared a violent Communist uprising in the event of a ban and he also believed the KPD's presence on the ballot could siphon off votes away from the Social Democrats
Instead he opted to simply have Communists functionaries jailed by the thousands
The courts and prosecutors both already hostile to the KPD long before obligingly agreed with the line that since the Reichstag fire was a Communist plot KPD membership was an act of treason
As a result for all intents and purposes the KPD was outlawed on the day the Reichstag Fire Decree took effect and completely banned as of the day of the election
While the Social Democrats SPD were then not as heavily oppressed as the Communists the Social Democrats were also restricted in their actions as the party's leadership had already fled to Prague and many members were acting only from the underground
Hence the Reichstag fire is widely believed to have had a major effect on the outcome of the election
As a replacement parliament building and for years to come the new parliament used the Kroll Opera House for its meetings
The resources of big business and the state were thrown behind the Nazis' campaign to achieve saturation coverage all over Germany
Brownshirts and SS patrolled and marched menacingly through the streets of cities and towns
A combination of terror repression and propaganda was mobilized in every
community large and small across the land
Irene von Goetz wrote In a decree issued on February Göring ordered the Prussian police force to make unrestrained use of firearms in operations against political opponents the so-called Schießerlass or shooting decree
To ensure a Nazi majority in the vote Nazi organisations also monitored the vote process
In Prussia members of the SS SA and Der Stahlhelm were ordered to monitor the votes as so-called deputy sheriffs or auxiliary police Hilfspolizei in another decree by acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring
Despite achieving a much better result than in the November election the Nazis did not do as well as Hitler had hoped
In spite of massive violence and voter intimidation the Nazis won only of the vote rather than the majority that he had expected
Therefore Hitler was forced to maintain his coalition with the DNVP to control the majority of seats
The Communists KPD lost about a quarter of their votes and the Social Democrats suffered only moderate losses
Although the KPD had not been formally banned it was a foregone conclusion that the KPD deputies would never be allowed to take their seats
Within a few days all KPD representatives had been placed under arrest or gone into hiding
Although the Nazi-DNVP coalition had enough seats to conduct the basic business of government Hitler needed a two-thirds majority to pass the Enabling Act which allowed the Cabinet effectively the Chancellor to enact laws without the approval of the Reichstag for four years
With certain exceptions such laws could deviate from the Weimar Constitution
Leaving nothing to chance the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all Communist deputies and to keep several Social Democrats out of the chamber
Hitler then obtained the necessary supermajority by persuading the Centre Party to vote with him with regard to the Enabling Act
The bill was passed on March with votes for and against
Only the Social Democrats led by Otto Wels opposed the measure which came into effect on March
The bill's provisions turned the government into a de facto legal dictatorship
Within four months the other parties had been shuttered by outright banning or Nazi terror and Germany had become formally a one-party state
Although three more elections were held during the Nazi era voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and guest candidates and voting was not secret
