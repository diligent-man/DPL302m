in victorian times passengers could recognise the owner and the route of an omnibus latin for everyone only by its livery and its line name with painted signs on the sides showing the two termini to indicate the route
then in george samuel dicks of the london motor omnibus company decided that as the line name vanguard had proved to be very popular he would name all lines vanguard and number the company s five routes through to
other operators soon saw the advantage in that a unique route number was easier for the travelling public to remember and so the practice of using route numbers soon spread
bus routes run by london transport were grouped as follows
the london traffic act imposed numbering known as the bassom scheme named after superintendent later chief constable arthur ernest bassom of the metropolitan police who devised it
for many decades variant and short workings used letter suffixes e g
the numbers reflected the company that operated the route
the numbering was revised in after london transport was formed
all routes operate in both directions unless detailed
the majority of buses numbered between and are school services running once on each weekday peak period during school term time
the exception to this is route a limited stop express route
route numbers from to represent mobility buses these provide a once a week return journey to a local shopping centre from relatively low density neighbourhoods where there is no alternative route in the main bus network
the number of mobility buses routes has declined because low floor and wheelchair accessible buses run on all london buses routes
night bus routes are often related to the day numerical equivalent normally running the same route but with an extension at either end of the service
this is normally to provide a night service to destinations served by tube or train during the day
however there are a few n prefixed route numbers that have no relation to their daytime equivalents the n n and n all operate in a different part of london to their respective day routes and the n and n which provide night service on parts of the dlr network have no corresponding daytime routes
there are also hour routes which run day and night but usually with a lower frequency during the night hours
the vast majority run the same route at all times
with the introduction of the night tube some day routes have been extended to run during friday and saturday nights to serve the stations
these bus routes are not contracted to tfl and are therefore not london buses
all but three run from villages and towns outside greater london to destinations within the exception being which runs entirely within the boundary
they are painted in a colour chosen by the operator so are not necessarily red like london buses and most of them do not accept oyster cards
these routes are operated with a london service permit issued by tfl so they are recognised by tfl bus maps and appear on tfl bus stops
there are three special tfl express routes which only run during the notting hill carnival x x and x
route a operates on one day per year to imber using heritage vehicles
