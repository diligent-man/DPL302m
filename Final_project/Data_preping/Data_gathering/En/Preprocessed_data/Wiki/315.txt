jean jacques rousseau uk ru so us ru so french ak uso june july was a genevan philosopher writer and composer
his political philosophy influenced the progress of the enlightenment throughout europe as well as aspects of the french revolution and the development of modern political economic and educational thought
his discourse on inequality and the social contract are cornerstones in modern political and social thought
rousseau s sentimental novel julie or the new heloise was important to the development of preromanticism and romanticism in fiction
his emile or on education is an educational treatise on the place of the individual in society
rousseau s autobiographical writings the posthumously published confessions composed in which initiated the modern autobiography and the unfinished reveries of the solitary walker composed exemplified the late th century age of sensibility and featured an increased focus on subjectivity and introspection that later characterized modern writing
rousseau befriended fellow philosopher denis diderot in and would later write about diderot s romantic troubles in his confessions
during the period of the french revolution rousseau was the most popular of the philosophers among members of the jacobin club
he was interred as a national hero in the panth on in paris in years after his death
rousseau was born in geneva which was at the time a city state and a protestant associate of the swiss confederacy now a canton of switzerland
since geneva had been a huguenot republic and the seat of calvinism
five generations before rousseau his ancestor didier a bookseller who may have published protestant tracts had escaped persecution from french catholics by fleeing to geneva in where he became a wine merchant
rousseau was proud that his family of the moyen order or middle class had voting rights in the city
throughout his life he generally signed his books jean jacques rousseau citizen of geneva
geneva in theory was governed democratically by its male voting citizens
the citizens were a minority of the population when compared to the immigrants referred to as inhabitants whose descendants were called natives and continued to lack suffrage
in fact rather than being run by vote of the citizens the city was ruled by a small number of wealthy families that made up the council of two hundred these delegated their power to a member executive group from among them called the little council
there was much political debate within geneva extending down to the tradespeople
much discussion was over the idea of the sovereignty of the people of which the ruling class oligarchy was making a mockery
in a democratic reformer named pierre fatio protested this situation saying a sovereign that never performs an act of sovereignty is an imaginary being
he was shot by order of the little council
jean jacques rousseau s father isaac was not in the city at this time but jean jacques s grandfather supported fatio and was penalized for it
rousseau s father isaac rousseau followed his grandfather father and brothers into the watchmaking business
he also taught dance for a short period
isaac notwithstanding his artisan status was well educated and a lover of music
rousseau wrote that a genevan watchmaker is a man who can be introduced anywhere a parisian watchmaker is only fit to talk about watches
in isaac ran into political difficulty by entering a quarrel with visiting english officers who in response drew their swords and threatened him
after local officials stepped in it was isaac who was punished as geneva was concerned with maintaining its ties to foreign powers
rousseau s mother suzanne bernard rousseau was from an upper class family
she was raised by her uncle samuel bernard a calvinist preacher
he cared for suzanne after her father jacques who had run into trouble with the legal and religious authorities for fornication and having a mistress died in his early s
in suzanne had to answer charges that she had attended a street theater disguised as a peasant woman so she could gaze upon m
vincent sarrasin whom she fancied despite his continuing marriage
after a hearing she was ordered by the genevan consistory to never interact with him again
she married rousseau s father at the age of
isaac s sister had married suzanne s brother eight years earlier after she had become pregnant and they had been chastised by the consistory
the child died at birth
the young rousseau was told a fabricated story about the situation in which young love had been denied by a disapproving patriarch but later prevailed resulting in two marriages uniting the families on the same day
rousseau never learnt the truth
rousseau was born on june and he would later relate i was born almost dying they had little hope of saving me
he was baptized on july in the great cathedral
his mother died of puerperal fever nine days after his birth which he later described as the first of my misfortunes
he and his older brother fran ois were brought up by their father and a paternal aunt also named suzanne
when rousseau was five his father sold the house that the family had received from his mother s relatives
while the idea was that his sons would inherit the principal when grown up and he would live off the interest in the meantime in the end the father took most of the substantial proceeds
with the selling of the house the rousseau family moved out of the upper class neighborhood and moved into an apartment house in a neighborhood of craftsmen silversmiths engravers and other watchmakers
growing up around craftsmen rousseau would later contrast them favorably to those who produced more aesthetic works writing those important persons who are called artists rather than artisans work solely for the idle and rich and put an arbitrary price on their baubles
rousseau was also exposed to class politics in this environment as the artisans often agitated in a campaign of resistance against the privileged class running geneva
rousseau had no recollection of learning to read but he remembered how when he was five or six his father encouraged his love of reading
rousseau s reading of escapist stories such as l astr e by honor d urf had an effect on him he later wrote that they gave me bizarre and romantic notions of human life which experience and reflection have never been able to cure me of
after they had finished reading the novels they began to read a collection of ancient and modern classics left by his mother s uncle
of these his favorite was plutarch s lives of the noble greeks and romans which he would read to his father while he made watches
rousseau saw plutarch s work as another kind of novel the noble actions of heroes and he would act out the deeds of the characters he was reading about
in his confessions rousseau stated that the reading of plutarch s works and the conversations between my father and myself to which it gave rise formed in me the free and republican spirit
witnessing the local townsfolk participate in militias made a big impression on rousseau
throughout his life he would recall one scene where after the volunteer militia had finished its manoeuvres they began to dance around a fountain and most of the people from neighboring buildings came out to join them including him and his father
rousseau would always see militias as the embodiment of popular spirit in opposition to the armies of the rulers whom he saw as disgraceful mercenaries
when rousseau was ten his father an avid hunter got into a legal quarrel with a wealthy landowner on whose lands he had been caught trespassing
to avoid certain defeat in the courts he moved away to nyon in the territory of bern taking rousseau s aunt suzanne with him
he remarried and from that point jean jacques saw little of him
jean jacques was left with his maternal uncle who packed him along with his own son abraham bernard away to board for two years with a calvinist minister in a hamlet outside geneva
here the boys picked up the elements of mathematics and drawing
rousseau who was always deeply moved by religious services for a time even dreamed of becoming a protestant minister
virtually all our information about rousseau s youth has come from his posthumously published confessions in which the chronology is somewhat confused though recent scholars have combed the archives for confirming evidence to fill in the blanks
at age rousseau was apprenticed first to a notary and then to an engraver who beat him
at he ran away from geneva on march after returning to the city and finding the city gates locked due to the curfew
in adjoining savoy he took shelter with a roman catholic priest who introduced him to fran oise louise de warens age
she was a noblewoman of protestant background who was separated from her husband
as professional lay proselytizer she was paid by the king of piedmont to help bring protestants to catholicism
they sent the boy to turin the capital of savoy which included piedmont in what is now italy to complete his conversion
this resulted in his having to give up his genevan citizenship although he would later revert to calvinism to regain it
in converting to catholicism both de warens and rousseau were likely reacting to calvinism s insistence on the total depravity of man
leo damrosch writes an eighteenth century genevan liturgy still required believers to declare that we are miserable sinners born in corruption inclined to evil incapable by ourselves of doing good
de warens a deist by inclination was attracted to catholicism s doctrine of forgiveness of sins
finding himself on his own since his father and uncle had more or less disowned him the teenage rousseau supported himself for a time as a servant secretary and tutor wandering in italy piedmont and savoy and france
during this time he lived on and off with de warens whom he idolized and called his maman
flattered by his devotion de warens tried to get him started in a profession and arranged formal music lessons for him
at one point he briefly attended a seminary with the idea of becoming a priest
when rousseau reached de warens took him as her lover while intimate also with the steward of her house
the sexual aspect of their relationship a m nage trois confused rousseau and made him uncomfortable but he always considered de warens the greatest love of his life
a rather profligate spender she had a large library and loved to entertain and listen to music
she and her circle comprising educated members of the catholic clergy introduced rousseau to the world of letters and ideas
rousseau had been an indifferent student but during his s which were marked by long bouts of hypochondria he applied himself in earnest to the study of philosophy mathematics and music
at he came into a small inheritance from his mother and used a portion of it to repay de warens for her financial support of him
at he took a job as a tutor in lyon
in rousseau moved to paris to present the acad mie des sciences with a new system of numbered musical notation he believed would make his fortune
his system intended to be compatible with typography is based on a single line displaying numbers representing intervals between notes and dots and commas indicating rhythmic values
believing the system was impractical the academy rejected it though they praised his mastery of the subject and urged him to try again
he befriended denis diderot that year connecting over the discussion of literary endeavors
from to rousseau had an honorable but ill paying post as a secretary to the comte de montaigue the french ambassador to venice
this awoke in him a lifelong love for italian music particularly opera
rousseau s employer routinely received his stipend as much as a year late and paid his staff irregularly
after months rousseau quit taking from the experience a profound distrust of government bureaucracy
returning to paris the penniless rousseau befriended and became the lover of th r se levasseur a seamstress who was the sole support of her mother and numerous ne er do well siblings
at first they did not live together though later rousseau took th r se and her mother in to live with him as his servants and himself assumed the burden of supporting her large family
according to his confessions before she moved in with him th r se bore him a son and as many as four other children there is no independent verification for this number
rousseau wrote that he persuaded th r se to give each of the newborns up to a foundling hospital for the sake of her honor
her mother who feared the inconvenience of a brat came to my aid and she th r se allowed herself to be overcome confessions
in his letter to madame de francueil in he first pretended that he wasn t rich enough to raise his children but in book ix of the confessions he gave the true reasons of his choice i trembled at the thought of intrusting them to a family ill brought up to be still worse educated
the risk of the education of the foundling hospital was much less
ten years later rousseau made inquiries about the fate of his son but no record could be found
when rousseau subsequently became celebrated as a theorist of education and child rearing his abandonment of his children was used by his critics including voltaire and edmund burke as the basis for arguments ad hominem
beginning with some articles on music in rousseau contributed numerous articles to diderot and d alembert s great encyclop die the most famous of which was an article on political economy written in
rousseau s ideas were the result of an almost obsessive dialogue with writers of the past filtered in many cases through conversations with diderot
in rousseau was paying daily visits to diderot who had been thrown into the fortress of vincennes under a lettre de cachet for opinions in his lettre sur les aveugles that hinted at materialism a belief in atoms and natural selection
according to science historian conway zirkle rousseau saw the concept of natural selection as an agent for improving the human species
rousseau had read about an essay competition sponsored by the acad mie de dijon to be published in the mercure de france on the theme of whether the development of the arts and sciences had been morally beneficial
he wrote that while walking to vincennes about three miles from paris he had a revelation that the arts and sciences were responsible for the moral degeneration of mankind who were basically good by nature
rousseau s discourse on the arts and sciences was awarded the first prize and gained him significant fame
rousseau continued his interest in music
he wrote both the words and music of his opera le devin du village the village soothsayer which was performed for king louis xv in
the king was so pleased by the work that he offered rousseau a lifelong pension
to the exasperation of his friends rousseau turned down the great honor bringing him notoriety as the man who had refused a king s pension
he also turned down several other advantageous offers sometimes with a brusqueness bordering on truculence that gave offense and caused him problems
the same year the visit of a troupe of italian musicians to paris and their performance of giovanni battista pergolesi s la serva padrona prompted the querelle des bouffons which pitted protagonists of french music against supporters of the italian style
rousseau as noted above was an enthusiastic supporter of the italians against jean philippe rameau and others making an important contribution with his letter on french music
on returning to geneva in rousseau reconverted to calvinism and regained his official genevan citizenship
in rousseau completed his second major work the discourse on the origin and basis of inequality among men the discourse on inequality which elaborated on the arguments of the discourse on the arts and sciences
he also pursued an unconsummated romantic attachment with the year old sophie d houdetot which partly inspired his epistolary novel julie ou la nouvelle h lo se also based on memories of his idyllic youthful relationship with mme de warens
sophie was the cousin and houseguest of rousseau s patroness and landlady madame d pinay whom he treated rather high handedly
he resented being at mme
d pinay s beck and call and detested the insincere conversation and shallow atheism of the encyclop distes whom he met at her table
wounded feelings gave rise to a bitter three way quarrel between rousseau and madame d pinay her lover the journalist grimm and their mutual friend diderot who took their side against rousseau
diderot later described rousseau as being false vain as satan ungrateful cruel hypocritical and wicked
he sucked ideas from me used them himself and then affected to despise me
rousseau s break with the encyclop distes coincided with the composition of his three major works in all of which he emphasized his fervent belief in a spiritual origin of man s soul and the universe in contradistinction to the materialism of diderot la mettrie and d holbach
during this period rousseau enjoyed the support and patronage of charles ii fran ois fr d ric de montmorency luxembourg and the prince de conti two of the richest and most powerful nobles in france
these men truly liked rousseau and enjoyed his ability to converse on any subject but they also used him as a way of getting back at louis xv and the political faction surrounding his mistress madame de pompadour
even with them however rousseau went too far courting rejection when he criticized the practice of tax farming in which some of them engaged
rousseau s page novel of sentiment julie ou la nouvelle h lo se was published in to immense success
the book s rhapsodic descriptions of the natural beauty of the swiss countryside struck a chord in the public and may have helped spark the subsequent nineteenth century craze for alpine scenery
in rousseau published du contrat social principes du droit politique in english literally of the social contract principles of political right in april
even his friend antoine jacques roustan felt impelled to write a polite rebuttal of the chapter on civil religion in the social contract which implied that the concept of a christian republic was paradoxical since christianity taught submission rather than participation in public affairs
rousseau helped roustan find a publisher for the rebuttal
rousseau published emile or on education in may
a famous section of emile the profession of faith of a savoyard vicar was intended to be a defense of religious belief
rousseau s choice of a catholic vicar of humble peasant background plausibly based on a kindly prelate he had met as a teenager as a spokesman for the defense of religion was in itself a daring innovation for the time
the vicar s creed was that of socinianism or unitarianism as it is called today
because it rejected original sin and divine revelation both protestant and catholic authorities took offense
moreover rousseau advocated the opinion that insofar as they lead people to virtue all religions are equally worthy and that people should therefore conform to the religion in which they have been brought up
this religious indifferentism caused rousseau and his books to be banned from france and geneva
he was condemned from the pulpit by the archbishop of paris his books were burned and warrants were issued for his arrest
former friends such as jacob vernes of geneva could not accept his views and wrote violent rebuttals
a sympathetic observer david hume professed no surprise when he learned that rousseau s books were banned in geneva and elsewhere
rousseau he wrote has not had the precaution to throw any veil over his sentiments and as he scorns to dissemble his contempt for established opinions he could not wonder that all the zealots were in arms against him
the liberty of the press is not so secured in any country
as not to render such an open attack on popular prejudice somewhat dangerous
after rousseau s emile had outraged the french parliament an arrest order was issued by parliament against him causing him to flee to switzerland
subsequently when the swiss authorities also proved unsympathetic to him condemning both emile and also the social contract voltaire issued an invitation to rousseau to come and reside with him commenting that i shall always love the author of the vicaire savoyard whatever he has done and whatever he may do let him come here to ferney he must come i shall receive him with open arms
he shall be master here more than i
i shall treat him like my own son
rousseau later expressed regret that he had not replied to voltaire s invitation
in july after rousseau was informed that he could not continue to reside in bern d alembert advised him to move to the principality of neuch tel ruled by frederick the great of prussia
subsequently rousseau accepted an invitation to reside in m tiers fifteen miles from neuch tel
on july rousseau wrote to frederick describing how he had been driven from france from geneva and from bern and seeking frederick s protection
he also mentioned that he had criticized frederick in the past and would continue to be critical of frederick in the future stating however your majesty may dispose of me as you like frederick still in the middle of the seven years war then wrote to the local governor of neuch tel marischal keith who was a mutual friend of theirs
rousseau touched by the help he received from frederick stated that from then onwards he took a keen interest in frederick s activities
as the seven years war was about to end rousseau wrote to frederick again thanking him for the help received and urging him to put an end to military activities and to endeavor to keep his subjects happy instead
frederick made no known reply but commented to keith that rousseau had given him a scolding
for more than two years rousseau lived at m tiers spending his time in reading and writing and meeting visitors such as james boswell december
in the meantime the local ministers had become aware of the apostasies in some of his writings and resolved not to let him stay in the vicinity
the neuch tel consistory summoned rousseau to answer a charge of blasphemy
he wrote back asking to be excused due to his inability to sit for a long time due to his ailment
subsequently rousseau s own pastor fr d ric guillaume de montmollin started denouncing him publicly as the antichrist
in one inflammatory sermon montmollin quoted proverbs the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight this was interpreted by everyone to mean that rousseau s taking communion was detested by the lord
the ecclesiastical attacks inflamed the parishioners who proceeded to pelt rousseau with stones when he would go out for walks
around midnight of september stones were thrown at the house rousseau was staying in and some glass windows were shattered
when a local official martinet arrived at rousseau s residence he saw so many stones on the balcony that he exclaimed my god it s a quarry at this point rousseau s friends in m tiers advised him to leave the town
since he wanted to remain in switzerland rousseau decided to accept an offer to move to a tiny island the le de st pierre having a solitary house
although it was within the canton of bern from where he had been expelled two years previously he was informally assured that he could move into this island house without fear of arrest and he did so september
here despite the remoteness of his retreat visitors sought him out as a celebrity
however on october the senate of bern ordered rousseau to leave the island and all bernese territory within fifteen days
he replied requesting permission to extend his stay and offered to be incarcerated in any place within their jurisdiction with only a few books in his possession and permission to walk occasionally in a garden while living at his own expense
the senate s response was to direct rousseau to leave the island and all bernese territory within twenty four hours
on october he left the le de st pierre and moved to strasbourg
at this point he subsequently decided to accept hume s invitation to go to england
on december having secured a passport from the french government to come to paris rousseau left strasbourg for paris where he arrived after a week and lodged in a palace of his friend the prince of conti
here he met hume and also numerous friends and well wishers and became a very conspicuous figure in the city
at this time hume wrote one significant meeting could have taken place at this time diderot wanted to reconcile and make amends with rousseau
however both diderot and rousseau wanted the other person to take the initiative so the two did not meet
on january grimm wrote a report to his clientele in which he included a letter said to have been written by frederick the great to rousseau
this letter had actually been composed by horace walpole as a playful hoax
walpole had never met rousseau but he was well acquainted with diderot and grimm
the letter soon found wide publicity hume is believed to have been present and to have participated in its creation
on february hume wrote to the marquise de brabantane the only pleasantry i permitted myself in connection with the pretended letter of the king of prussia was made by me at the dinner table of lord ossory this letter was one of the reasons for the later rupture in hume s relations with rousseau
on january rousseau left paris with hume the merchant de luze an old friend of rousseau and rousseau s pet dog sultan
after a four day journey to calais where they stayed for two nights the travelers embarked on a ship to dover
on january they arrived in london
soon after their arrival david garrick arranged a box at the drury lane theatre for hume and rousseau on a night when the king and queen also attended
garrick was himself performing in a comedy by himself and also in a tragedy by voltaire
rousseau became so excited during the performance that he leaned too far and almost fell out of the box hume observed that the king and queen were looking at rousseau more than at the performance
afterwards garrick served supper for rousseau who commended garrick s acting sir you have made me shed tears at your tragedy and smile at your comedy though i scarce understood a word of your language
at this time hume had a favorable opinion of rousseau in a letter to madame de brabantane hume wrote that after observing rousseau carefully he had concluded that he had never met a more affable and virtuous person
according to hume rousseau was gentle modest affectionate disinterested of extreme sensitivity
initially hume lodged rousseau in the house of madam adams in london but rousseau began receiving so many visitors that he soon wanted to move to a quieter location
an offer came to lodge him in a welsh monastery and he was inclined to accept it but hume persuaded him to move to chiswick
rousseau now asked for th r se to rejoin him
meanwhile james boswell then in paris offered to escort th r se to rousseau
boswell had earlier met rousseau and th r se at motiers he had subsequently also sent th r se a garnet necklace and had written to rousseau seeking permission to occasionally communicate with her hume foresaw what was going to happen i dread some event fatal to our friend s honor boswell and th r se were together for more than a week and as per notes in boswell s diary they consummated the relationship having intercourse several times
on one occasion th r se told boswell don t imagine you are a better lover than rousseau
since rousseau was keen to relocate to a more remote location richard davenport a wealthy and elderly widower who spoke french offered to accommodate th r se and rousseau at wootton hall in staffordshire
on march rousseau and th r se set forth for wootton against hume s advice
hume and rousseau would never meet again
initially rousseau liked his new accommodation at wootton hall and wrote favorably about the natural beauty of the place and how he was feeling reborn forgetting past sorrows
on april a daily newspaper published the letter constituting horace walpole s hoax on rousseau without mentioning walpole as the actual author that the editor of the publication was hume s personal friend compounded rousseau s grief
gradually articles critical of rousseau started appearing in the british press rousseau felt that hume as his host ought to have defended him
moreover in rousseau s estimate some of the public criticism contained details to which only hume was privy
further rousseau was aggrieved to find that hume had been lodging in london with fran ois tronchin son of rousseau s enemy in geneva
about this time voltaire anonymously published his letter to dr
pansophe in which he gave extracts from many of rousseau s prior statements which were critical of life in england the most damaging portions of voltaire s writeup were reprinted in a london periodical
rousseau now decided that there was a conspiracy afoot to defame him
a further cause for rousseau s displeasure was his concern that hume might be tampering with his mail
the misunderstanding had arisen because rousseau tired of receiving voluminous correspondence whose postage he had to pay
hume offered to open rousseau s mail himself and to forward the important letters to rousseau this offer was accepted
however there is some evidence of hume intercepting even rousseau s outgoing mail
after some correspondence with rousseau which included an eighteen page letter from rousseau describing the reasons for his resentment hume concluded that rousseau was losing his mental balance
on learning that rousseau had denounced him to his parisian friends hume sent a copy of rousseau s long letter to madame de boufflers
she replied stating that in her estimate hume s alleged participation in the composition of horace walpole s faux letter was the reason for rousseau s anger
when hume learnt that rousseau was writing the confessions he assumed that the present dispute would feature in the book
adam smith turgot marischal keith horace walpole and mme de boufflers advised hume not to make his quarrel with rousseau public however many members of d holbach s coterie particularly d alembert urged him to reveal his version of the events
in october hume s version of the quarrel was translated into french and published in france in november it was published in england
grimm included it in his correspondance ultimately after the dispute became public due in part to comments from notable publishers like andrew millar walpole told hume that quarrels such as this only end up becoming a source of amusement for europe
diderot took a charitable view of the mess i knew these two philosophers well
i could write a play about them that would make you weep and it would excuse them both amidst the controversy surrounding his quarrel with hume rousseau maintained a public silence but he resolved now to return to france
to encourage him to do so swiftly th r se advised him that the servants at wootton hall sought to poison him
on may rousseau and th r se embarked from dover for calais
on may rousseau reentered france even though an arrest warrant against him was still in place
he had taken an assumed name but was recognized and a banquet in his honor was held by the city of amiens
french nobles offered him a residence at this time
initially rousseau decided to stay in an estate near paris belonging to mirabeau
subsequently on june he moved to a chateau of the prince of conti in trie
around this time rousseau started developing feelings of paranoia anxiety and of a conspiracy against him
most of this was just his imagination at work but on january the theatre at geneva was destroyed through burning and voltaire mendaciously accused rousseau of being the culprit
in june rousseau left trie leaving th r se behind and went first to lyon and subsequently to bourgoin
he now invited th r se to this place and married her under his alias renou in a faux civil ceremony in bourgoin on august
in january rousseau and th r se went to live in a farmhouse near grenoble
here he practiced botany and completed the confessions
at this time he expressed regret for placing his children in an orphanage
on april rousseau and th r se left for lyon where he befriended horace coignet a fabric designer and amateur musician
at rousseau s suggestion coignet composed musical interludes for rousseau s prose poem pygmalion this was performed in lyon together with rousseau s romance the village soothsayer to public acclaim
on june rousseau and th r se left lyon for paris they reached paris on june
in paris rousseau and th r se lodged in an unfashionable neighborhood of the city the rue platri re now called the rue jean jacques rousseau
he now supported himself financially by copying music and continued his study of botany
at this time also he wrote his letters on the elements of botany
these consisted of a series of letters rousseau wrote to mme delessert in lyon to help her daughters learn the subject
these letters received widespread acclaim when they were eventually published posthumously
it s a true pedagogical model and it complements emile commented goethe
in order to defend his reputation against hostile gossip rousseau had begun writing the confessions in
in november these were completed and although he did not wish to publish them at this time he began to offer group readings of certain portions of the book
between december and may rousseau made at least four group readings of his book with the final reading lasting seventeen hours
a witness to one of these sessions claude joseph dorat wrote after may there were no more group readings because madame d pinay wrote to the chief of police who was her friend to put a stop to rousseau s readings so as to safeguard her privacy
the police called on rousseau who agreed to stop the readings
the confessions were finally published posthumously in
in rousseau was invited to present recommendations for a new constitution for the polish lithuanian commonwealth resulting in the considerations on the government of poland which was to be his last major political work
also in rousseau began writing his dialogues rousseau judge of jean jacques which was another attempt to reply to his critics
he completed writing it in
the book is in the form of three dialogues between two characters a frenchman and rousseau who argue about the merits and demerits of a third character an author called jean jacques
it has been described as his most unreadable work in the foreword to the book rousseau admits that it may be repetitious and disorderly but he begs the reader s indulgence on the grounds that he needs to defend his reputation from slander before he dies
in rousseau had impressed hume with his physical prowess by spending ten hours at night on the deck in severe weather during the journey by ship from calais to dover while hume was confined to his bunk
when all the seamen were almost frozen to death he caught no harm he is one of the most robust men i have ever known hume noted
by rousseau s urinary disease had also been greatly alleviated after he stopped listening to the advice of doctors
at that time notes damrosch it was often better to let nature take its own course rather than subject oneself to medical procedures
his general health had also improved
however on october as he was walking on a narrow street in paris a nobleman s carriage came rushing by from the opposite direction flanking the carriage was a galloping great dane belonging to the nobleman
rousseau was unable to dodge both the carriage and the dog and was knocked down by the great dane
he seems to have suffered a concussion and neurological damage
his health began to decline rousseau s friend corancez described the appearance of certain symptoms which indicate that rousseau started suffering from epileptic seizures after the accident
in rousseau received a royal visitor when the holy roman emperor joseph ii came to meet him
his free entry to the opera had been renewed by this time and he would go there occasionally
at this time also he composed one of his finest works reveries of a solitary walker
in the spring of the marquis girardin invited rousseau to live in a cottage in his ch teau at ermenonville
rousseau and th r se went there on may
rousseau spent his time at the ch teau in collecting botanical specimens and teaching botany to girardin s son
he ordered books from paris on grasses mosses and mushrooms and made plans to complete his unfinished emile and sophie and daphnis and chloe
on july a visitor commented that men are wicked to which rousseau replied with men are wicked yes but man is good in the evening there was a concert in the ch teau in which rousseau played on the piano his own composition of the willow song from othello
on this day also he had a hearty meal with girardin s family the next morning as he was about to go teach music to girardin s daughter he died of cerebral bleeding resulting in an apoplectic stroke
it is now believed that repeated falls including the accident involving the great dane may have contributed to rousseau s stroke
following his death grimm madame de sta l and others spread the false news that rousseau had committed suicide according to other gossip rousseau was insane when he died
all those who met him in his last days agree that he was in a serene frame of mind at this time
on july rousseau was buried on the le des peupliers fr which became a place of pilgrimage for his many admirers
on october his remains were moved to the panth on where they were placed near the remains of voltaire
rousseau later noted that when he read the question for the essay competition of the academy of dijon which he would go on to win has the rebirth of the arts and sciences contributed to the purification of the morals he felt that the moment i read this announcement i saw another universe and became a different man
the essay he wrote in response led to one of the central themes of rousseau s thought which was that perceived social and cultural progress had in fact led only to the moral degradation of humanity
his influences to this conclusion included montesquieu fran ois f nelon michel de montaigne seneca the younger plato and plutarch
rousseau based his political philosophy on contract theory and his reading of thomas hobbes
reacting to the ideas of samuel von pufendorf and john locke was also driving his thought
all three thinkers had believed that humans living without central authority were facing uncertain conditions in a state of mutual competition
in contrast rousseau believed that there was no explanation for why this would be the case as there would have been no conflict or property
rousseau especially criticized hobbes for asserting that since man in the state of nature
has no idea of goodness he must be naturally wicked that he is vicious because he does not know virtue
on the contrary rousseau holds that uncorrupted morals prevail in the state of nature
in common with other philosophers of the day rousseau looked to a hypothetical state of nature as a normative guide
in the original condition humans would have had no moral relations with or determinate obligations to one another
because of their rare contact with each other differences between individuals would have been of little significance
living separately there would have been no feelings of envy or distrust and no existence of property or conflict
according to rousseau humans have two traits in common with other animals the amour de soi which describes the self preservation instinct and piti which is empathy for the rest of one s species both of which precede reason and sociability
only humans who are morally deprived would care only about their relative status to others leading to amour propre or vanity
he did not believe humans to be innately superior to other species
however human beings did have the unique ability to change their nature through free choice instead of being confined to natural instincts
another aspect separating humans from other animals is the ability of perfectability which allows humans to choose in a way which improves their condition
these improvements could be lasting leading not only to individual but also collective change for the better
together with human freedom the ability to improve makes possible the historic evolution of humanity
however there is no guarantee that this evolution will be for the better
rousseau asserted that the stage of human development associated with what he called savages was the best or optimal in human development between the less than optimal extreme of brute animals on the one hand and the extreme of decadent civilization on the other
n othing is so gentle as man in his primitive state when placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes and the fatal enlightenment of civil man
this has led some critics to attribute to rousseau the invention of the idea of the noble savage which arthur lovejoy claimed misrepresents rousseau s thought
according to rousseau as savages had grown less dependent on nature they had instead become dependent on each other with society leading to the loss of freedom through the misapplication of perfectability
when living together humans would have gone from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled one leading to the invention of private property
however the resulting inequality was not a natural outcome but rather the product of human choice
rousseau s ideas of human development were highly interconnected with forms of mediation or the processes that individual humans use to interact with themselves and others while using an alternate perspective or thought process
according to rousseau these were developed through the innate perfectibility of humanity
these include a sense of self morality pity and imagination
rousseau s writings are purposely ambiguous concerning the formation of these processes to the point that mediation is always intrinsically part of humanity s development
an example of this is the notion that an individual needs an alternative perspective to come to the realization that he or she is a self
as long as differences in wealth and status among families were minimal the first coming together in groups was accompanied by a fleeting golden age of human flourishing
the development of agriculture metallurgy private property and the division of labour and resulting dependency on one another however led to economic inequality and conflict
as population pressures forced them to associate more and more closely they underwent a psychological transformation they began to see themselves through the eyes of others and came to value the good opinion of others as essential to their self esteem
as humans started to compare themselves with each other they began to notice that some had qualities differentiating them from others
however only when moral significance was attached to these qualities did they start to create esteem and envy and thereby social hierarchies
rousseau noted that whereas the savage lives within himself sociable man always outside himself can only live in the opinion of others
this then resulted in the corruption of humankind producing combinations fatal to innocence and happiness
following the attachment of importance to human difference they would have started forming social institutions according to rousseau
metallurgy and agriculture would have subsequently increased the inequalities between those with and without property
after all land had been converted into private properties a zero sum game would have resulted in competition for it leading to conflict
this would have led to the creation and perpetuation of the hoax of the political system by the rich which perpetuated their power
according to rousseau the original forms of government to emerge monarchy aristocracy democracy were all products of the differing levels of inequality in their societies
however they would always end up with ever worse levels of inequality until a revolution would have overthrown it and new leaders would have emerged with further extremes of injustice
nevertheless the human capacity for self improvement remained
as the problems of humanity were the product of political choice they could also be improved by a better political system
the social contract outlines the basis for a legitimate political order within a framework of classical republicanism
published in it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the western tradition
it developed some of the ideas mentioned in an earlier work the article conomie politique discourse on political economy featured in diderot s encyclop die
in the book rousseau sketched the image of a new political system for regaining human freedom
rousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperation
as society developed the division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law
in the degenerate phase of society man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them
this double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom
according to rousseau by joining together into civil society through the social contract and abandoning their claims of natural right individuals can both preserve themselves and remain free
this is because submission to the authority of the general will of the people as a whole guarantees individuals against being subordinated to the wills of others and also ensures that they obey themselves because they are collectively the authors of the law
although rousseau argues that sovereignty or the power to make the laws should be in the hands of the people he also makes a sharp distinction between the sovereign and the government
the government is composed of magistrates charged with implementing and enforcing the general will
the sovereign is the rule of law ideally decided on by direct democracy in an assembly
rousseau opposed the idea that the people should exercise sovereignty via a representative assembly book iii chapter xv
he approved the kind of republican government of the city state for which geneva provided a model or would have done if renewed on rousseau s principles
france could not meet rousseau s criterion of an ideal state because it was too big
much subsequent controversy about rousseau s work has hinged on disagreements concerning his claims that citizens constrained to obey the general will are thereby rendered free
the notion of the general will is wholly central to rousseau s theory of political legitimacy
it is however an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion
some commentators see it as no more than the dictatorship of the proletariat or the tyranny of the urban poor such as may perhaps be seen in the french revolution
such was not rousseau s meaning
this is clear from the discourse on political economy where rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass not to require them to be sacrificed to it
he is of course sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others
it is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme although not exclusive commitment by everyone not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place
a remarkable peculiarity of social contract is its logical rigor which rousseau had learned in his twenties from mathematics
rousseau offers a wealth of economic thought in his writings especially the discourse on inequality discourse on political economy the social contract as well as his constitutional projects for corsica and poland
rousseau s economic theory has been criticised as sporadic and unrigorous by later economists such as joseph schumpeter but has been praised by historians of economic thought for its nuanced view of finance and mature thought on development
scholars generally accept that rousseau offers a critique of modern wealth and luxury
moreover rousseau s economic thought is associated with agrarianism and autarkism
historian istvan hont modifies this reading however by suggesting that rousseau is both a critic and a thinker of commerce leaving room for well regulated commerce within a well governed civil space
political theorists ryan hanley and hansong li further argue that as a modern legislator rousseau seeks not to reject but to tame utility self love and even trade finance and luxury to serve the health of the republic
rousseau s philosophy of education concerns itself not with particular techniques of imparting information and concepts but rather with developing the pupil s character and moral sense so that he may learn to practice self mastery and remain virtuous even in the unnatural and imperfect society in which he will have to live
a hypothetical boy mile is to be raised in the countryside which rousseau believes is a more natural and healthy environment than the city under the guardianship of a tutor who will guide him through various learning experiences arranged by the tutor
today we would call this the disciplinary method of natural consequences
rousseau felt that children learn right and wrong through experiencing the consequences of their acts rather than through physical punishment
the tutor will make sure that no harm results to mile through his learning experiences
rousseau became an early advocate of developmentally appropriate education his description of the stages of child development mirrors his conception of the evolution of culture
he divides childhood into stages
the first to the age of about when children are guided by their emotions and impulses
during the second stage from to about reason starts to develop
finally the third stage from the age of onwards when the child develops into an adultrousseau recommends that the young adult learn a manual skill such as carpentry which requires creativity and thought will keep him out of trouble and will supply a fallback means of making a living in the event of a change of fortune the most illustrious aristocratic youth to have been educated this way may have been louis xvi whose parents had him learn the skill of locksmithing
the sixteen year old is also ready to have a companion of the opposite sex
although his ideas foreshadowed modern ones in many ways in one way they do not rousseau was a believer in the moral superiority of the patriarchal family on the antique roman model
sophie the young woman mile is destined to marry as his representative of ideal womanhood is educated to be governed by her husband while mile as his representative of the ideal man is educated to be self governing
this is not an accidental feature of rousseau s educational and political philosophy it is essential to his account of the distinction between private personal relations and the public world of political relations
the private sphere as rousseau imagines it depends on the subordination of women for both it and the public political sphere upon which it depends to function as rousseau imagines it could and should
rousseau anticipated the modern idea of the bourgeois nuclear family with the mother at home taking responsibility for the household and for childcare and early education
feminists beginning in the late th century with mary wollstonecraft in have criticized rousseau for his confinement of women to the domestic sphere unless women were domesticated and constrained by modesty and shame he feared men would be tyrannized by women
for given the ease with which women arouse men s senses men would finally be their victims his contemporaries saw it differently because rousseau thought that mothers should breastfeed their children
marmontel wrote that his wife thought one must forgive something she said in one who has taught us to be mothers
rousseau s ideas have influenced progressive child centered education
john darling s book child centered education and its critics portrays the history of modern educational theory as a series of footnotes to rousseau a development he regards as bad
the theories of educators such as rousseau s near contemporaries pestalozzi mme
de genlis and later maria montessori and john dewey which have directly influenced modern educational practices have significant points in common with those of rousseau
having converted to roman catholicism early in life and returned to the austere calvinism of his native geneva as part of his period of moral reform rousseau maintained a profession of that religious philosophy and of john calvin as a modern lawgiver throughout the remainder of his life
unlike many of the more agnostic enlightenment philosophers rousseau affirmed the necessity of religion
his views on religion presented in his works of philosophy however may strike some as discordant with the doctrines of both catholicism and calvinism
rousseau s strong endorsement of religious toleration as expounded in mile was interpreted as advocating indifferentism a heresy and led to the condemnation of the book in both calvinist geneva and catholic paris
although he praised the bible he was disgusted by the christianity of his day
rousseau s assertion in the social contract that true followers of christ would not make good citizens may have been another reason for his condemnation in geneva
he also repudiated the doctrine of original sin which plays a large part in calvinism
in his letter to beaumont rousseau wrote there is no original perversity in the human heart
in the th century many deists viewed god merely as an abstract and impersonal creator of the universe likened to a giant machine
rousseau s deism differed from the usual kind in its emotionality
he saw the presence of god in the creation as good and separate from the harmful influence of society
rousseau s attribution of a spiritual value to the beauty of nature anticipates the attitudes of th century romanticism towards nature and religion
historians notably william everdell graeme garrard and darrin mcmahon have additionally situated rousseau within the counter enlightenment rousseau was upset that his deism was so forcefully condemned while those of the more atheistic philosophers were ignored
he defended himself against critics of his religious views in his letter to mgr de beaumont the archbishop of paris in which he insists that freedom of discussion in religious matters is essentially more religious than the attempt to impose belief by force
rousseau was a moderately successful composer of music who wrote seven operas as well as music in other forms and contributed to music theory
as a composer his music was a blend of the late baroque style and the emergent classical fashion i e
galant and he belongs to the same generation of transitional composers as christoph willibald gluck and c p e
one of his more well known works is the one act opera the village soothsayer
it contains the duet non colette n est point trompeuse which was later rearranged as a standalone song by beethoven and the gavotte in scene no
is the source of the tune of the folk song go tell aunt rhody
he also composed several noted motets some of which were sung at the concert spirituel in paris
rousseau s aunt suzanne was passionate about music and heavily influenced rousseau s interest in music
in his confessions rousseau claims he is indebted to her for his passion of music
rousseau took formal instruction in music at the house of fran oise louise de warens
she housed rousseau on and off for about years giving him jobs and responsibilities
in rousseau developed a system of musical notation that was compatible with typography and numbered
he presented his invention to the academie des sciences but they rejected it praising his efforts and pushing him to try again
in rousseau wrote his first opera les muses galantes fr which was first performed in
rousseau and jean philippe rameau argued over the superiority of italian music over french
rousseau argued that italian music was superior based on the principle that melody must have priority over harmony
rameau argued that french music was superior based on the principle that harmony must have priority over melody
rousseau s plea for melody introduced the idea that in art the free expression of a creative person is more important than the strict adherence to traditional rules and procedures
this is now known today as a characteristic of romanticism
rousseau argued for musical freedom and changed people s attitudes towards music
his works were acknowledged by composers such as christoph willibald gluck and wolfgang amadeus mozart
after composing the village soothsayer in rousseau felt he could not go on working for the theater because he was a moralist who had decided to break from worldly values

le printemps de vivaldi rousseau s idea of the volont g n rale general will was not original but rather belonged to a well established technical vocabulary of juridical and theological writings in use at the time
the phrase was used by diderot and also by montesquieu and by his teacher the oratorian friar nicolas malebranche
it served to designate the common interest embodied in legal tradition as distinct from and transcending people s private and particular interests at any particular time
it displayed a rather democratic ideology as it declared that the citizens of a given nation should carry out whatever actions they deem necessary in their own sovereign assembly
the concept was also an important aspect of the more radical th century republican tradition of spinoza from whom rousseau differed in important respects but not in his insistence on the importance of equality
robespierre and saint just during the reign of terror regarded themselves to be principled egalitarian republicans obliged to do away with superfluities and corruption in this they were inspired most prominently by rousseau
according to robespierre the deficiencies in individuals were rectified by upholding the common good which he conceptualized as the collective will of the people this idea was derived from rousseau s general will
the revolutionaries were also inspired by rousseau to introduce deism as the new official civil religion of france
rousseau s influence on the french revolution was noted by edmund burke who critiqued rousseau in reflections on the revolution in france and this critique reverberated throughout europe leading catherine the great to ban his works
this connection between rousseau and the french revolution especially the terror persisted through the next century
as fran ois furet notes that we can see that for the whole of the nineteenth century rousseau was at the heart of the interpretation of the revolution for both its admirers and its critics
according to some scholars rousseau exercised minimal influence on the founding fathers of the united states despite similarities between their ideas
they shared beliefs regarding the self evidence that all men are created equal and the conviction that citizens of a republic be educated at public expense
a parallel can be drawn between the united states constitution s concept of the general welfare and rousseau s concept of the general will
further commonalities exist between jeffersonian democracy and rousseau s praise of switzerland and corsica s economies of isolated and independent homesteads and his endorsement of a well regulated civic militia such as a navy for corsica and the militia of the swiss cantons
however will and ariel durant have opined that rousseau had a definite political influence on america
according to them one of rousseau s most important american followers was textbook writer noah webster who was influenced by rousseau s ideas on pedagogy in emile
webster structured his speller in accord with rousseau s ideas about the stages of a child s intellectual development
rousseau s writings perhaps had an indirect influence on american literature through the writings of wordsworth and kant whose works were important to the new england transcendentalist ralph waldo emerson as well as on unitarians such as theologian william ellery channing
the last of the mohicans and other american novels reflect republican and egalitarian ideals present alike in thomas paine and in english romantic primitivism
the first to criticize rousseau were his fellow philosophes above all voltaire
according to jacques barzun voltaire was annoyed by the first discourse and outraged by the second
voltaire s reading of the second discourse was that rousseau would like the reader to walk on all fours befitting a savage
samuel johnson told his biographer james boswell i think him one of the worst of men a rascal who ought to be hunted out of society as he has been
jean baptiste blanchard was his leading catholic opponent
blanchard rejects rousseau s negative education in which one must wait until a child has grown to develop reason
the child would find more benefit from learning in his earliest years
he also disagreed with his ideas about female education declaring that women are a dependent lot
so removing them from their motherly path is unnatural as it would lead to the unhappiness of both men and women
historian jacques barzun states that contrary to myth rousseau was no primitivist for him the model man is the independent farmer free of superiors and self governing
this was cause enough for the philosophes hatred of their former friend
rousseau s unforgivable crime was his rejection of the graces and luxuries of civilized existence
voltaire had sung the superfluous that most necessary thing for the high bourgeois standard of living rousseau would substitute the middling peasant s
it was the country versus the city an exasperating idea for them as was the amazing fact that every new work of rousseau s was a huge success whether the subject was politics theater education religion or a novel about love as early as madame de sta l published her letters on the works and character of j j
rousseau
in in his famous speech on ancient and modern liberty the political philosopher benjamin constant a proponent of constitutional monarchy and representative democracy criticized rousseau or rather his more radical followers specifically the abb de mably for allegedly believing that everything should give way to collective will and that all restrictions on individual rights would be amply compensated by participation in social power
fr d ric bastiat severely criticized rousseau in several of his works most notably in the law in which after analyzing rousseau s own passages he stated that
and what part do persons play in all this they are merely the machine that is set in motion
in fact are they not merely considered to be the raw material of which the machine is made thus the same relationship exists between the legislator and the prince as exists between the agricultural expert and the farmer and the relationship between the prince and his subjects is the same as that between the farmer and his land
how high above mankind then has this writer on public affairs been placed bastiat believed that rousseau wished to ignore forms of social order created by the people viewing them as a thoughtless mass to be shaped by philosophers
bastiat who is considered by thinkers associated with the austrian school of economics to be one of the precursors of the spontaneous order presented his own vision of what he considered to be the natural order in a simple economic chain in which multiple parties might interact without necessarily even knowing each other cooperating and fulfilling each other s needs in accordance with basic economic laws such as supply and demand
in such a chain to produce clothing multiple parties have to act independently e g
farmers to fertilize and cultivate land to produce fodder for the sheep people to shear them transport the wool turn it into cloth and another to tailor and sell it
those persons engage in economic exchange by nature and don t need to be ordered to nor do their efforts need to be centrally coordinated
such chains are present in every branch of human activity in which individuals produce or exchange goods and services and together naturally create a complex social order that does not require external inspiration central coordination of efforts or bureaucratic control to benefit society as a whole
this according to bastiat is a proof that humanity itself is capable of creating a complex socioeconomic order that might be superior to an arbitrary vision of a philosopher
bastiat also believed that rousseau contradicted himself when presenting his views concerning human nature if nature is sufficiently invincible to regain its empire why then would it need philosophers to direct it back to a natural state conversely he believed that humanity would choose what it would have without philosophers to guide it in accordance with the laws of economy and human nature itself
another point of criticism bastiat raised was that living purely in nature would doom mankind to suffer unnecessary hardships
the marquis de sade s justine or the misfortunes of virtue partially parodied and used as inspiration rousseau s sociological and political concepts in the discourse on inequality and the social contract
concepts such as the state of nature civilization being the catalyst for corruption and evil and humans signing a contract to mutually give up freedoms for the protection of rights particularly referenced
the comte de gernande in justine for instance after th r se asks him how he justifies abusing and torturing women states the necessity mutually to render one another happy cannot legitimately exist save between two persons equally furnished with the capacity to do one another hurt and consequently between two persons of commensurate strength such an association can never come into being unless a contract un pacte is immediately formed between these two persons which obligates each to employ against each other no kind of force but what will not be injurious to either
w hat sort of a fool would the stronger have to be to subscribe to such an agreement edmund burke formed an unfavorable impression of rousseau when the latter visited england with hume and later drew a connection between rousseau s egoistic philosophy and his personal vanity saying rousseau entertained no principle
but vanity
with this vice he was possessed to a degree little short of madness
charles dudley warner wrote about rousseau in his essay equality rousseau borrowed from hobbes as well as from locke in his conception of popular sovereignty but this was not his only lack of originality
his discourse on primitive society his unscientific and unhistoric notions about the original condition of man were those common in the middle of the eighteenth century
in irving babbitt founder of a movement called the new humanism wrote a critique of what he called sentimental humanitarianism for which he blamed rousseau
babbitt s depiction of rousseau was countered in a celebrated and much reprinted essay by a o
lovejoy in
in france conservative theorist charles maurras founder of action fran aise had no compunctions in laying the blame for both romantisme et r volution firmly on rousseau in
during the cold war rousseau was criticized for his association with nationalism and its attendant abuses for example in jacob leib talmon the origins of totalitarian democracy
this came to be known among scholars as the totalitarian thesis
political scientist j s
maloy states that the twentieth century added nazism and stalinism to jacobinism on the list of horrors for which rousseau could be blamed
rousseau was considered to have advocated just the sort of invasive tampering with human nature which the totalitarian regimes of mid century had tried to instantiate but he adds that the totalitarian thesis in rousseau studies has by now been discredited as an attribution of real historical influence arthur melzer however while conceding that rousseau would not have approved of modern nationalism observes that his theories do contain the seeds of nationalism insofar as they set forth the politics of identification which are rooted in sympathetic emotion
melzer also believes that in admitting that people s talents are unequal rousseau therefore tacitly condones the tyranny of the few over the many
others counter however that rousseau was concerned with the concept of equality under the law not equality of talents
for stephen t
engel on the other hand rousseau s nationalism anticipated modern theories of imagined communities that transcend social and religious divisions within states
on similar grounds one of rousseau s strongest critics during the second half of the th century was political philosopher hannah arendt
using rousseau s thought as an example arendt identified the notion of sovereignty with that of the general will
according to her it was this desire to establish a single unified will based on the stifling of opinion in favor of public passion that contributed to the excesses of the french revolution
the book rousseau and revolution by will and ariel durant begins with the following words about rousseau the german writers goethe schiller and herder have stated that rousseau s writings inspired them
herder regarded rousseau to be his guide and schiller compared rousseau to socrates
goethe in stated emile and its sentiments had a universal influence on the cultivated mind
the elegance of rousseau s writing is held to have inspired a significant transformation in french poetry and drama freeing them from rigid literary norms
other writers who were influenced by rousseau s writings included leopardi in italy pushkin and tolstoy in russia wordsworth southey coleridge byron shelley keats and blake in england and hawthorne and thoreau in america
according to tolstoy at sixteen i carried around my neck instead of the usual cross a medallion with rousseau s portrait
rousseau s discourse on the arts and sciences emphasizing individualism and repudiating civilization was appreciated by among others thomas paine william godwin shelley tolstoy and edward carpenter
rousseau s contemporary voltaire appreciated the section in emile titled profession of faith of the savoyard vicar
modern admirers of rousseau include john dewey and claude l vi strauss
according to matthew josephson rousseau has remained controversial for more than two centuries and has continued to gain admirers and critics down to the present time
however in their own way both critics and admirers have served to underscore the significance of the man while those who have evaluated him with fairness have agreed that he was the finest thinker of his time on the question of civilization
