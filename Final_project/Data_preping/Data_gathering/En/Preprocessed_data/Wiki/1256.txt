vishnu v n sanskrit lit the pervader vi u also known as narayana and hari is one of the principal deities of hinduism
he is the supreme being within vaishnavism one of the major traditions within contemporary hinduism
vishnu is known as the preserver within the trimurti the triple deity of supreme divinity that includes brahma and shiva
in vaishnavism tradition vishnu is the supreme being who creates protects and transforms the universe
in the shaktism tradition the goddess or devi is described as one of the supreme yet vishnu is revered along with shiva and brahma
a goddess is stated to be the energy and creative power shakti of each with lakshmi the equal complementary partner of vishnu
he is one of the five equivalent deities in panchayatana puja of the smarta tradition of hinduism
according to the vaishnavism sect the highest form of ishvar is with qualities saguna and have certain form but is limitless transcendent and unchanging absolute brahman and the primal atman self of the universe
there are many both benevolent and fearsome depictions of vishnu
in benevolent aspects he is depicted as an omniscient sleeping on the coils of the serpent adishesha who represents time floating in the primeval ocean of milk called kshira sagara with consort lakshmi
whenever the world is threatened with evil chaos and destructive forces vishnu descends in the form of an avatar incarnation to restore the cosmic order and protect dharma
dashavatara are the ten primary avatars incarnations of vishnu
out of the ten rama and krishna avatars are most important
vishnu or vi u sanskrit means all pervasive and according to medh tith c ce one who is everything and inside everything
vedanga scholar yaska th century bce in the nirukta defines vishnu as vi ur vi vater v vya noter v one who enters everywhere also adding atha yad vi ito bhavati tad vi nurbhavati that which is free from fetters and bondage is vishnu
in the tenth part of the padma purana th century ce danta son of bh ma and king of vidarbha lists names of vishnu
these include the ten primary avatars see dashavarara below and descriptions of the qualities attributes or aspects of god
the garuda purana chapter xv and the anushasana parva of the mahabharata both list over names for vishnu each name describing a quality attribute or aspect of god
known as the vishnu sahasranama vishnu here is defined as the omnipresent
other notable names in this list include
hari remover of sins
lakshmikanta the husband of lakshmi
jagannatha lord of the universe
janardana
govinda omnipresent ruler of the indriya supreme being who can be known through the vedas protector of cows
hrishikesha
padmanabha
mukundavishnu iconography shows him with dark blue blue gray or black coloured skin and as a well dressed jewelled man
he is typically shown with four arms but two armed representations are also found in hindu texts on artworks
the historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell shankha named panchajanya between the first two fingers of one hand left back a chakra war discus named sudarshana in another right back
the conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil
one of his arms sometimes carries a gada club mace named kaumodaki which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge
in the fourth arm he holds a lotus flower padma which symbolizes purity and transcendence
the items he holds in various hands varies giving rise to twenty four combinations of iconography each combination representing a special form of vishnu
each of these special forms is given a special name in texts such as the agni purana and padma purana
these texts however are inconsistent
rarely vishnu is depicted bearing the bow sharanga or the sword nandaka
he is depicted with the kaustubha gem in a necklace and wearing vaijayanti a garland of forest flowers
the shrivatsa mark is depicted on his chest in the form of a curl of hair
he generally wears yellow garments
vishnu iconography show him either in standing pose seated in a yoga pose or reclining
a traditional depiction of vishnu is that of him reclining on the coils of the serpent shesha accompanied by his consort lakshmi as he dreams the universe into reality
particularly in vaishnavism the so called trimurti also known as the hindu triad or great trinity represents the three fundamental forces gu as through which the universe is created maintained and destroyed in cyclic succession
each of these forces is represented by a hindu deity
brahma presiding deity of rajas passion creation
vishnu presiding deity of sattva goodness preservation
shiva presiding deity of tamas darkness destruction the trimurti themselves are beyond three gunas and are not affected by it
in hindu tradition the trio is often referred to as brahma vishnu mahesh
all have the same meaning of three in one different forms or manifestations of one person the supreme being
the concept of the avatar or incarnation within hinduism is most often associated with vishnu the preserver or sustainer aspect of god within the hindu trimurti
the avatars of vishnu descend to empower the good and to destroy evil thereby restoring dharma and relieving the burden of the earth
an oft quoted passage from the bhagavad gita describes the typical role of an avatar of vishnu
vedic literature in particular the puranas ancient similar to encyclopedias and itihasa chronicle history legend narrate numerous avatars of vishnu
the most well known of these avatars are krishna most notably in the vishnu purana bhagavata purana and mahabharata the latter encompassing the bhagavad gita and rama most notably in the ramayana
krishna in particular is venerated in vaishnavism as the ultimate primeval transcendental source of all existence including all the other demigods and gods such as vishnu
in the mahabharata vishnu as narayana states to narada that he will appear in the following ten incarnations
specified avatars of vishnu are listed against some of the puranas in the table below
however this is a complicated process and the lists are unlikely to be exhaustive because
not all puranas provide lists per se e g
the agni purana dedicates entire chapters to avatars and some of these chapters mention other avatars within them
a list may be given in one place but additional avatars may be mentioned elsewhere e g
the bhagavata purana lists avatars in canto but mentions others elsewhere
manava purana the only upa purana listed avatars of vishnu
a personality in one purana may be considered an avatar in another e g
narada is not specified as an avatar in the matsya purana but is in the bhagavata purana
some avatars consist of two or more people considered as different aspects of a single incarnation e g
nara narayana rama and his three brothers the dashavatara is a list of the so called vibhavas or primary avatars of vishnu
the agni purana varaha purana padma purana linga purana narada purana garuda purana and skanda purana all provide matching lists
the same vibhavas are also found in the garuda purana saroddhara a commentary or extracted essence written by navanidhirama about the garuda purana i e
not the purana itself with which it seems to be confused
apparent disagreements concerning the placement of either the buddha or balarama in the dashavarara seems to occur from the dashavarara list in the shiva purana the only other list with ten avatars including balarama in the garuda purana substitutes vamana not buddha
regardless both versions of the dashavarara have a scriptural basis in the canon of authentic vedic literature but not from the garuda purana saroddhara
thirumal tamil also known as perumal or perumaal tamil or maayon as described in the tamil scriptures was appropriated as manifestation of vishnu in later hinduism is a popular hindu deity among tamilans in tamil nadu as well among the tamil diaspora
vishnu is a rigvedic deity but not a prominent one when compared to indra agni and others
just out of hymns of the rigveda are dedicated to vishnu although he is mentioned in other hymns
vishnu is mentioned in the brahmana layer of text in the vedas thereafter his profile rises and over the history of indian mythology states jan gonda vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank one equivalent to the supreme being
though a minor mention and with overlapping attributes in the vedas he has important characteristics in various hymns of rig veda such as and
in these hymns the vedic mythology asserts that vishnu resides in that highest home where departed atman self reside an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in hindu soteriology
he is also described in the vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth
in the vedic hymns vishnu is invoked alongside other deities especially indra whom he helps in killing the symbol of evil named vritra
his distinguishing characteristic in vedas is his association with light
two rigvedic hymns in mandala refer to vishnu
in section of the rigveda vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth a characteristic he shares with indra
in the vedic texts the deity or god referred to as vishnu is surya or savitr sun god who also bears the name suryanarayana
again this link to surya is a characteristic vishnu shares with fellow vedic deities named mitra and agni wherein different hymns they too bring men together and cause all living beings to rise up and impel them to go about their daily activities
in hymn of rigveda indra vishnu is equivalent and produce the sun with the verses asserting that this sun is the source of all energy and light for all
in other hymns of the rigveda vishnu is a close friend of indra
elsewhere in rigveda atharvaveda and upanishadic texts vishnu is equivalent to prajapati both are described as the protector and preparer of the womb and according to klaus klostermaier this may be the root behind the post vedic fusion of all the attributes of the vedic prajapati unto the avatars of vishnu
in the yajurveda taittiriya aranyaka narayana sukta narayana is mentioned as the supreme being
the first verse of narayana suktam mentions the words paramam padam which literally mean highest post and may be understood as the supreme abode for all selfs
this is also known as param dhama paramapadam or vaikuntha
rigveda also mentions the same paramam padam
in the atharvaveda the mythology of a boar who raises goddess earth from the depths of cosmic ocean appears but without the word vishnu or his alternate avatar names
in post vedic mythology this legend becomes one of the basis of many cosmogonic myth called the varaha legend with varaha as an avatar of vishnu
several hymns of the rigveda repeat the mighty deed of vishnu called the trivikrama which is one of the lasting mythologies in hinduism since the vedic times
it is an inspiration for ancient artwork in numerous hindu temples such as at the ellora caves which depict the trivikrama legend through the vamana avatar of vishnu
trivikrama refers to the celebrated three steps or three strides of vishnu
starting as a small insignificant looking being vishnu undertakes a herculean task of establishing his reach and form then with his first step covers the earth with second the ether and the third entire heaven
the vishnu sukta of rigveda says that the first and second of vishnu s strides those encompassing the earth and air are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals
the trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes stating vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life
the shatapatha brahmana elaborates this theme of vishnu as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the asuras after they had usurped the three worlds and thus vishnu is the saviour of the mortals and the immortals devas
the shatapatha brahmana contains ideas which vaishnavism tradition of hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of vishnu as supreme he as the essence in every being and everything in the empirically perceived universe
in this brahmana states klaus klostermaier purusha narayana vishnu asserts all the worlds have i placed within mine own self and my own self has i placed within all the worlds the text equates vishnu to all knowledge there is vedas calling the essence of everything as imperishable all vedas and principles of universe as imperishable and that this imperishable which is vishnu is the all
vishnu is described to be permeating all object and life forms states s
giora shoham where he is ever present within all things as the intrinsic principle of all and the eternal transcendental self in every being
the vedic literature including its brahmanas layer while praising vishnu do not subjugate others gods and goddesses
they present an inclusive pluralistic henotheism
according to max muller although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small the young and the old rig veda this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others
it would be easy to find in the numerous hymns of the veda passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute
the vaishnava upanishads are minor upanishads of hinduism related to vishnu theology
there are vaishnava upanishads in the muktika anthology of upanishads
it is unclear when these texts were composed and estimates vary from the st century bce to th century ce for the texts
these upanishads highlight vishnu narayana rama or one of his avatars as the supreme metaphysical reality called brahman in hinduism
they discuss a diverse range of topics from ethics to the methods of worship
vishnu is the primary focus of the vaishnavism focused puranas genre of hindu texts
of these according to ludo rocher the most important texts are the bhagavata purana vishnu purana n radeya purana garuda purana and vayu purana
the purana texts include many versions of cosmologies mythologies encyclopedic entries about various aspects of life and chapters that were medieval era regional vishnu temples related tourist guides called mahatmyas
one version of the cosmology for example states that vishnu s eye is at the southern celestial pole from where he watches the cosmos
in another version found in section of the vayu purana he is the hiranyagarbha or the golden egg from which were simultaneously born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe
the vishnu purana presents vishnu as the central element of its cosmology unlike some other puranas where shiva or brahma or goddess shakti are
the reverence and the worship of vishnu is described in chapters of the first part of vishnu purana along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of vishnu such as hari janardana madhava achyuta hrishikesha and others
the vishnu purana also discusses the hindu concept of supreme reality called brahman in the context of the upanishads a discussion that the theistic vedanta scholar ramanuja interprets to be about the equivalence of the brahman with vishnu a foundational theology in the sri vaishnavism tradition
vishnu is equated with brahman in the bhagavata purana such as in verse as learned transcendentalists who know the absolute truth call this non dual substance as brahman paramatma and bhagavan
the bhagavata purana has been the most popular and widely read purana texts relating to vishnu avatar krishna it has been translated and available in almost all indian languages
like other puranas it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology genealogy geography mythology legend music dance yoga and culture
as it begins the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent devas deities and evil asuras demons and now rule the universe
truth re emerges as the vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons understands them and then creatively defeats them bringing back hope justice freedom and good a cyclic theme that appears in many legends
the bhagavata purana is a revered text in vaishnavism
the puranic legends of vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals particularly through performance arts such as the sattriya manipuri dance odissi kuchipudi kathakali kathak bharatanatyam bhagavata mela and mohiniyattam
some versions of the purana texts unlike the vedic and upanishadic texts emphasize vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend
vishnu for example is the source of creator deity brahma in the vaishnavism focussed purana texts
vishnu s iconography typically shows brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel who then is described as creating all the forms in the universe but not the primordial universe itself
in contrast the shiva focussed puranas describe brahma and vishnu to have been created by ardhanarishvara that is half shiva and half parvati or alternatively brahma was born from rudra or vishnu shiva and brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons kalpa
in some vaishnava puranas vishnu takes the form of rudra or commands rudra to destroy the world thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time everything is reabsorbed back into vishnu
the universe is then recreated from vishnu all over again starting a new kalpa
for this the bhagavata purana employs the metaphor of vishnu as a spider and the universe as his web
other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into shiva
the agama scripture called the pancharatra describes a mode of worship of vishnu
the sangam literature refers to an extensive regional collection in the tamil language mostly from the early centuries of the common era
these tamil texts revere vishnu and his avatars such as krishna and rama as well as other pan indian deities such as shiva muruga durga indra and others
vishnu is described in these texts as mayon or one who is dark or black in color in north india the equivalent word is krishna
other terms found for vishnu in these ancient tamil genre of literature include mayavan mamiyon netiyon mal and mayan
krishna as vishnu avatar is the primary subject of two post sangam tamil epics silappadikaram and manimekalai each of which was probably composed about the th century ce
these tamil epics share many aspects of the story found in other parts of india such as those related to baby krishna such as stealing butter and teenage krishna such as teasing girls who went to bathe in a river by hiding their clothes
ideas about vishnu in the mid st millennium ce were important to the bhakti movement theology that ultimately swept india after the th century
the alvars which literally means those immersed in god were tamil vaishnava poet saints who sang praises of vishnu as they traveled from one place to another
they established temple sites such as srirangam and spread ideas about vaishnavism
their poems compiled as alwar arulicheyalgal or divya prabhandham developed into an influential scripture for the vaishnavas
the bhagavata purana s references to the south indian alvar saints along with its emphasis on bhakti have led many scholars to give it south indian origins though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that bhakti movement had parallel developments in other parts of india
the bhagavata purana summarizes the vaishnava theology wherein it frequently discusses the merging of the individual self with the absolute brahman ultimate reality supreme truth or the return of brahman into his own true nature a distinctly advaitic or non dualistic philosophy of shankara
the concept of moksha is explained as ekatva oneness and sayujya absorption intimate union wherein one is completely lost in brahman self supreme being one s true nature
this states rukmini is proclamation of return of the individual self to the absolute and its merging into the absolute which is unmistakably advaitic in its trend
in the same passages the bhagavata includes a mention of bhagavan as the object of concentration thereby presenting the bhakti path from the three major paths of hindu spirituality discussed in the bhagavad gita
the theology in the bhagavad gita discusses both the sentient and the non sentient the self and the matter of existence
it envisions the universe as the body of vishnu krishna state harold coward and daniel maguire
vishnu in gita s theology pervades all selfs all matter and time
in sri vaishnavism sub tradition vishnu and sri goddess lakshmi are described as inseparable that they pervade everything together
both together are the creators who also pervade and transcend their creation
the bhagavata purana in many passages parallels the ideas of nirguna brahman and non duality of adi shankara
for example
scholars describe the vaishnava theology as built on the foundation of non dualism speculations in upanishads and term it as advaitic theism the bhagavata purana suggests that vishnu and the self atman in all beings is one
bryant states that the monism discussed in bhagavata purana is certainly built on the vedanta foundations but not exactly the same as the monism of adi shankara
the bhagavata asserts according to bryant that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities and manifestations of the same oneness just like heat and light are real but different manifestations of sunlight
in the bhakti tradition of vaishnavism vishnu is attributed with numerous qualities such as omniscience energy strength lordship vigour and splendour
the vaishnava tradition started by madhvacharya considers vishnu in the form of krishna to be the supreme creator personal god all pervading all devouring one whose knowledge and grace leads to moksha
in madhvacharya vaishnava theology the supreme vishnu and the selfs of living beings are two different realities and nature dualism while in ramanuja s sri vaishnavism they are different but share the same essential nature qualified non dualism
lakshmi the hindu goddess of wealth fortune and prosperity both material and spiritual is the wife and active energy of vishnu
she is also called sri
when vishnu incarnated on the earth as the avatars rama and krishna lakshmi incarnated as his respective consorts sita rama s wife and rukmini krishna s wife
various regional beliefs consider lakshmi manifested as various goddesses who are considered vishnu s wives
in many southern indian culture lakshmi is seen in two forms shridevi and bhudevi
at tirupati venkateshwara identified as an avatar of vishnu is depicted with consorts lakshmi and padmavathi
vishnu s mount vahana is garuda the eagle
vishnu is commonly depicted as riding on his shoulders
garuda is also considered as vedas on which vishnu travels
garuda is a sacred bird in vaishnavism
in garuda purana garuda carries vishnu to save the elephant gajendra
vishvaksena also known as senadhipathi both meaning army chief is the commander in chief of the army of vishnu
shiva and vishnu are both viewed as the ultimate form of god in different hindu denominations
harihara is a composite of half vishnu and half shiva mentioned in literature such as the vamana purana chapter and in artwork found from mid st millennium ce such as in the cave and cave of the th century badami cave temples
another half vishnu half shiva form which is also called harirudra is mentioned in mahabharata
vishnu is referred to as gorakh in the scriptures of sikhism
for example in verse of japji sahib the guru teacher is praised as who gives the word and shows the wisdom and through whom the awareness of immanence is gained
guru nanak according to shackle and mandair teaches that the guru are shiva isar vishnu gorakh brahma barma and mother parvati parbati yet the one who is all and true cannot be described
the chaubis avtar lists the avatars of vishnu including krishna rama and buddha
similarly the dasam granth includes vishnu mythology that mirrors that found in the vaishnav tradition
the latter is of particular importance to sanatan sikhs including udasis nirmalas nanakpanthis sahajdhari and keshdhari khalsa sects of sikhism however the khalsa sikhs disagree with the sanatan sikhs
according to sanatan sikh writers the gurus of sikhism were avatars of vishnu because the gurus brought light in the age of darkness and saved people in a time of evil mughal era persecution
while some hindus consider buddha as an incarnation of vishnu buddhists in sri lanka venerate vishnu as the custodian deity of sri lanka and protector of buddhism
vishnu is also known as upulvan or upalavar meaning blue lotus coloured
some postulate that uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with vishnu while another belief is that utpalavar was an early form of vishnu before he became a supreme deity in puranic hinduism
according to the chronicles of mah va sa c ava sa and folklore in sri lanka buddha himself handed over the custodianship to vishnu
others believe that buddha entrusted this task to sakra indra who delegated this task of custodianship to vishnu
many buddhist and hindu shrines are dedicated to vishnu in sri lanka
in addition to specific vishnu kovils or devalayas all buddhist temples necessarily house shrine rooms devalayas closer to the main buddhist shrine dedicated to vishnu
john holt states that vishnu was one of the several hindu gods and goddesses who were integrated into the sinhala buddhist religious culture such as the th and th century lankatilaka and gadaladeniya buddhist temples
he states that the medieval sinhala tradition encouraged visnu worship puja as a part of theravada buddhism just like hindu tradition incorporated the buddha as an avatar of vishnu but contemporary theravada monks are attempting to purge the vishnu worship practice from buddhist temples
according to holt the veneration of vishnu in sri lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries to reiterate and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own
though the vishnu cult in ceylon was formally endorsed by kandyan kings in the early s holt states that vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital polonnaruwa
vishnu iconography such as statues and etchings have been found in archaeological sites of southeast asia now predominantly of the theravada buddhist tradition
in thailand for example statues of four armed vishnu have been found in provinces near malaysia and dated to be from the th to th century and this mirror those found in ancient india
similarly vishnu statues have been discovered from the th to th century eastern prachinburi province and central phetchabun province of thailand and southern ng th p province and an giang province of vietnam
krishna statues dated to the early th century to th century have been discovered in tak o province and other provinces of cambodia
archeological studies have uncovered vishnu statues on the islands of indonesia and these have been dated to the th century and thereafter
in addition to statues inscriptions and carvings of vishnu such as those related to the three steps of vishnu trivikrama have been found in many parts of buddhist southeast asia
in some iconography the symbolism of surya vishnu and buddha are fused
in japanese buddhist pantheon vishnu is known as bich ten and he appears in japanese texts such as the th century compositions of nichiren
vishnu is an asteroid discovered by eleanor f
helin
vishnu rocks are a type of volcanic sediment found in the grand canyon arizona usa
consequently mass formations are known as vishnu s temples

some of the earliest surviving grand vishnu temples in india have been dated to the gupta empire period
the sarvatobhadra temple in jhansi uttar pradesh for example is dated to the early th century and features the ten avatars of vishnu
its design based on a square layout and vishnu iconography broadly follows the st millennium hindu texts on architecture and construction such as the brihat samhita and visnudharmottarapurana
archaeological evidence suggest that vishnu temples and iconography probably were already in existence by the st century bce
the most significant vishnu related epigraphy and archaeological remains are the two st century bce inscriptions in rajasthan which refer to temples of sankarshana and vasudeva the besnagar garuda column of bce which mentions a bhagavata temple another inscription in naneghat cave in maharashtra by a queen naganika that also mentions sankarshana vasudeva along with other major hindu deities and several discoveries in mathura relating to vishnu all dated to about the start of the common era
