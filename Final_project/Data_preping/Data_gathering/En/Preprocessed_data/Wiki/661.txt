James Riddick Partington June October was a British chemist and historian of chemistry who published multiple books and articles in scientific magazines His most famous works were An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry five volumes and A History of Chemistry four volumes for which he received the Dexter Award and the George Sarton Medal
Partington was a fellow and council member of the Chemical Society of London as well as the first president of the
Society for History of Alchemy and Early Chemistry when it was founded in The society founded the Partington Prize in his memory in He was president of the British Society for the History of Science from to
Partington was born on June in the small village of Middle Hulton south of Bolton Lancashire His mother from whom he took his middle name was a Scottish tailoress and his father was a book keeper His family moved to Southport when he was young allowing him to attend the Southport Science and Art School In when he was his family moved back to Bolton and Partington worked at several jobs before getting accepted into the University of Manchester in In Manchester he attained a bachelor's degree in science followed by a master's degree in chemistry While attending the University he was made a University Scholar and earned his teaching certificate He was awarded an Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of and worked with Walther Nernst in Berlin for several years where they studied the specific heat of gases In Partington returned to Manchester to lecture on chemistry
It was there that Partington met a student named Marian Jones whom he taught and supervised for a master's degree in supersaturated solutions Partington married her after the war on September She went on to become a chemistry teacher before giving birth to two daughters and one son who also became a chemist
Partington joined the army in as World War I began in Eastern Europe He was first assigned to work with Eric Rideal on the purification of water for troops on the Somme Later the two chemists turned to the question of the oxidation of nitrogen to form nitric acid and investigated the Haber Bosch process that the Germans were pursuing Thus he was transferred to a group led by Frederick G Donnan which worked on the production of nitric acid for munitions Captain Partington was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire MBE in the Military Division for this latter work Outside his war work for the government Partington managed to continue with thermodynamics joining the Faraday Society in In he presented a major review of the literature on the dilution law to the Faraday Society to whose Council he was elected that same year
After the war came to an end in he returned to the University of Manchester to get his doctorate and was appointed professor of chemistry at Queen Mary College London which he remained until
While teaching studied the theories of strong electrolytes as well the temperature dependence of specific heats He also began writing several articles and books on the subject that were later published
With the outbreak of World War II in Partington's department was evacuated to Cambridge Partington spent his war days studying and reading at the university's copyright library Although accommodations had been made for families of staff his wife stayed at their home in Wembley She committed suicide in March and Partington was a widower for the remainder of his life
After the war Partington returned to London where he devoted his time to complete his most famous works the five volume An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry and the four volume A History of Chemistry Professor Partington collected a considerable library of works on the history of alchemy and chemistry which is preserved in the John Rylands Library
He retired in to a house in Mill Road Cambridge and was looked after by an aged housekeeper The house was filled with books from cellar to roof According to Joseph Needham he became something of a recluse rarely stirring from his writing desk In Partington received the Dexter Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry from the American Chemical Society for his numerous articles and books on the history of chemistry particularly his multi volume A History of Chemistry In he was awarded the George Sarton Medal the most prestigious award of the History of Science Society
At the end of following his housekeeper's retirement unable to look after himself he joined relatives in the salt mining town of Northwich in Cheshire where he died on October
His extensive library and collections were donated to the Manchester University Library
Partington was a key figure in the fields of history of science and chemistry in the beginning half of the th century He regularly published multiple papers a year on a variety of topics including inorganic and physical chemistry He worked meticulously to get everything as close to perfect as possible in his experiments as well as his writings Many describe him as a highly gifted scholar who had an encyclopedic mind that gave excellent training to his students from around the world His works remain useful as they laid the groundwork for physical chemistry moving forward after both World Wars
