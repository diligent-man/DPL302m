after the war came to an end in he returned to the university of manchester to get his doctorate and was appointed professor of chemistry at queen mary college london which he remained until
while teaching studied the theories of strong electrolytes as well the temperature dependence of specific heats
he also began writing several articles and books on the subject that were later published
with the outbreak of world war ii in partington s department was evacuated to cambridge
partington spent his war days studying and reading at the university s copyright library

at the end of following his housekeeper s retirement unable to look after himself he joined relatives in the salt mining town of northwich in cheshire where he died on october
his extensive library and collections were donated to the manchester university library
partington was a key figure in the fields of history of science and chemistry in the beginning half of the th century
he regularly published multiple papers a year on a variety of topics including inorganic and physical chemistry
he worked meticulously to get everything as close to perfect as possible in his experiments as well as his writings
many describe him as a highly gifted scholar who had an encyclopedic mind that gave excellent training to his students from around the world
his works remain useful as they laid the groundwork for physical chemistry moving forward after both world wars
