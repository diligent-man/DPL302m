after graduating from loyola high school a roman catholic jesuit prep school in towson maryland in suburban baltimore county ryan attended boston college graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in economics with a strong minor in history and was a rower
he commissioned as a second lieutenant in the united states marine corps via the usmc officer candidates school
while waiting for the corps to assign him he passed the certified public accountant exam
after officer training at marine corps base quantico in quantico virginia ryan went on to serve briefly as a marine infantry platoon leader
however his military career was cut short at the age of when his platoon s helicopter a ch sea knight crashed during a nato exercise over the greek island of crete
the crash badly injured ryan s back
surgeons at the national naval medical center in bethesda maryland inadequately repaired his back
this led to a lengthy recovery process during which he became addicted to pain medications after which complete with a permanent disability and wearing a back brace he left the marines
he passed his stockbroker s exam and took a position with wall street investment firm merrill lynch s baltimore office
ryan s parents died in a plane crash at chicago midway international airport months after his crash in crete
he developed a fear of flying that persisted for years
the film version of the hunt for red october changed ryan s educational background to being a graduate of the united states naval academy
as red october is sailing into the penobscot river in maine ryan says he grew up in that area
in the film it is also said the helicopter crash happened in his third year at the academy and he finished his senior year from his hospital bed
the film version of patriot games also implies that he is a graduate of annapolis by briefly showing a certificate on the wall of their home
in the amazon prime television series jack ryan ryan s ph d
is in economics rather than history
while managing clients portfolios ryan began to invest his own money banking on a tip he had received from an uncle about the workers takeover of the chicago and north western railway making about million off his initial investment
he did so well that one of merrill lynch s senior vice presidents joe muller came to baltimore to have dinner with him with the objective of inviting him to the firm s new york city headquarters near wall street
also present is muller s daughter caroline nicknamed cathy then a senior medical student at the johns hopkins university school of medicine
they immediately fall in love and get engaged
one night while having dinner with his fianc e ryan throws out his back
cathy takes him directly to dr
stanley rabinowitz professor of neurosurgery at famed johns hopkins hospital in baltimore to be evaluated
rabinowitz later operates on ryan s back and cures his chronic pain in relatively short order
in a later novel the surgeon is credited as sam rosen a doctor introduced in without remorse ryan subsequently persuades the government to terminate his disability checks
cathy later becomes an ophthalmic surgeon at the wilmer eye institute of the johns hopkins university school of medicine and a professor of surgery at johns hopkins
after creating a net worth of million ryan left the firm after four years and enrolled at georgetown university in washington d c
for six doctoral courses in history
he does a brief stint at the center for strategic and international studies then accepts a position at the u s
naval academy as a civilian professor of history
in addition he has also written books on naval history options and decisions doomed eagles and fighting sailor a biography of world war ii admiral william bull halsey in which he justifies halsey s actions during the battle of leyte gulf
following a recommendation from father tim o riley a jesuit priest and professor at georgetown university in washington d c to a central intelligence agency contact ryan was asked to work as a consultant for the agency although officially employed by the mitre corporation
he agreed and spent several months at agency headquarters in langley virginia where he wrote a paper entitled agents and agencies in which he maintained that state sponsored terrorism is an act of war
he also invented the canary trap a method for exposing an information leak which involves giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of a group of suspects and seeing which version is leaked
by ensuring that each copy of the document differs slightly in its wording if any copy is leaked then it is possible to determine the informant s identity
these accomplishments come to the attention of u s
navy vice admiral james greer the cia s deputy director for intelligence
the expertise of ryan s report plus the application persuaded greer to offer him a permanent job in the cia but ryan declined
while in london with his family ryan stumbles upon a kidnapping attempt on the prince of wales and his family in the movie sir holmes a cousin of the queen which is orchestrated by irish terrorist group ulster liberation army
he foils the attack by killing one gunman while injuring another and gets wounded in the process
ryan is later knighted by queen elizabeth ii as an honorary knight commander of the royal victorian order in the books some british characters call him sir john even though honorary knights are not permitted to use the style of sir
sean miller the irish gunman ryan wounded was sentenced to life imprisonment but is freed by his ula compatriots
embittered over the failure of the kidnapping attempt and particularly the death of his brother at ryan s hands in that attempt he exacts revenge on ryan by attacking his wife and daughter
after pleas by greer ryan agrees to join the cia in a permanent position as an analyst originally to gather intelligence on the ula
later miller and his men stage another kidnapping attempt on the prince and princess of wales who are visiting the ryan family in their maryland home however they are overpowered by the combined efforts of ryan his friend robert robby jackson and the prince as well as law enforcement and naval officers who are nearby
after the ordeal ryan s second child jack ryan jr
was born
ryan s first cia assignment is to london as a member of a liaison group to the british secret intelligence service
initially called in to assess the soviet government and economy ryan is later tasked to assist in the defection of a kgb communications officer who has discovered that his boss yuri andropov had ordered pope john paul ii s assassination
although ryan and a small team of british sis agents helps the rabbit and his family get to the west they fail to prevent the attack on the pope which actually happened in real life in
nevertheless the pope is only wounded and his would be assassin captured while the british execute his bulgarian handler
rabbit s defection proves to be a major coup for both the american and british intelligence agencies
ryan soon afterward suggests a nonmilitary long term strategy to help hasten the soviet union s collapse and the end of the cold war
captain first rank marko ramius the soviet navy s top submarine commander takes command of the krasny oktyabr or in english red october the newest typhoon class ballistic missile submarine with which he plans to defect with his officers
having briefly met captain ramius at an embassy function several years before ryan is asked by admiral greer to brief the president s national security adviser jeffrey pelt and his staff in his first trip to the white house on ramius background and the deadly new capabilities of red october s secret revolutionary silent jet propulsion drive system
ryan recognizes that the renegade ethnic lithuanian captain may want to defect rather than attack the west
ryan works to establish contact with him and support contingency efforts of the tailing american submarine uss dallas
ryan seeks to get ramius and members of his crew along with the submarine secretly into the u s eventually succeeding
ryan is reassigned to the cia headquarters at langley and becomes admiral greer s special assistant
he is sent to moscow as part of the american nuclear weapons reduction start team and later engineers the extraction of cardinal cia s highest agent in place from the country
along the way he also forces kgb chairman nikolay gerasimov to defect due to his anti american nature which could jeopardize the arms reduction talks once he becomes general secretary
his plan involves a disinformation campaign that shows himself under sec investigation for insider trading which provides an opening for gerasimov to help ryan defect to the soviet union and work for the kgb
ryan is promoted to acting ddi when greer is hospitalized with cancer
despite this he is not made aware of a highly covert and illegal cia operation encouraged by the president claiming domestic drug abuse was a clear and present danger to american security and approved by corrupt national security advisor admiral cutter
this operation targets colombian drug lords in south america using light infantry troops of hispanic descent and occasional precision air strikes with sophisticated smartbombs in what is usually considered a law enforcement area
ryan works with the federal bureau of investigation fbi to rescue a small group of american soldiers cut off in colombia forcing him to miss greer s funeral
also in this operation he first met the u s
government operative john clark with whom he would become friends
around this time ryan also runs afoul of elizabeth elliot international affairs advisor to then presidential candidate governor of ohio j
robert fowler and one of cathy ryan s former professors
ryan reaches his highest post at the cia deputy director of central intelligence
his career is jeopardized when fowler becomes president and elizabeth elliott fowler s lover manipulator becomes national security advisor
they not only deny ryan any credit for an innovative middle east peace plan basically turning jerusalem into a vatican like city co ruled by three christian jewish and arab muslim mayors but also panic when palestinian and former east german terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb in denver during the super bowl and nearly plunge the world into a soviet american nuclear war
ryan defuses the nuclear crisis by commandeering the washington moscow hot line and convincing the soviet premier through his friend golovko that the crisis is a setup
he then refuses to confirm fowler s order to launch a nuclear missile at qom thus preventing the attack where the iranian ayatollah lives
the crisis and elliot scandal drives fowler to resign
on this note ryan retires from the cia and flies to riyadh in saudi arabia to witness the execution of the surviving terrorists and is then honored by the u s s middle eastern allies by being presented with the sword used to execute the terrorists
the film again departs from the novel by presenting a younger unmarried ryan an intelligent mistress free fowler a greer like cabot and the nuclear bomb is detonated over the city baltimore instead of denver
the film also changes the identity of the terrorists from arabs to neo nazis
after a brief stint as a stockbroker ryan returns to government service as the national security advisor restoring honor to the job that cutter and elliot disgraced
it has been two and a half years since fowler resigned and his vice president roger durling is now well into his own term
jack and the administration must deal with a second war between the u s
and japan as well as an attack on america s economic infrastructure
after a clean sweep of japan s forces in the south pacific vice president ed kealty is forced to resign after a sex scandal and president durling taps ryan for the job
ryan accepts the job on the condition that he will only serve until the end of durling s term and sees this as a way of ending his public life
only minutes after congress confirms ryan though a japanese airline pilot deliberately crashes a into the u s
capitol building during congress joint session killing most of the people inside decapitating the u s
government and elevating ryan to the presidency
the reluctant yet determined ryan administration emerges as ryan slowly rebuilds the government
he is faced with kealty s political trickery as the former vice president disputes his legitimacy as the nation s chief executive by publicly stating that he never actually resigned when in fact a member of his staff had secretly taken the resignation letter from the office of the now dead secretary of state and destroyed it
initially the lone voice of opposition to ryan s policies on live television he later enlists disaffected cia intelligence officials affected by the reduction in force at the agency in favor of more field operatives to procure classified information on ryan from his time in the cia
he then suborns nbc news anchor and fellow ryan critic tom donner into ambushing him with questions about his cia career in a televised interview
donner later realizes his mistake and publicly apologizes to president ryan while kealty s challenge eventually fails in court
along the way ryan also has to deal with the dictator of the new united islamic republic a coalition of iran and iraq the ayatollah mahmoud haji daryaei
the ayatollah regards him as a weakling and seizes the opportunity to stage a multi pronged attack on the country a biological attack using a weaponized strain of the ebola virus a kidnapping attempt on his youngest daughter katie and an assassination attempt on himself through an iranian sleeper agent disguised as a secret service bodyguard with the u s
overwhelmed by a multitude of crises he believes that he can invade saudi arabia with little military opposition from the u s
while the attempt on katie was swiftly averted by the fbi and the secret service the ebola epidemic causes ryan to declare martial law and enforce a travel ban that becomes instrumental in killing the virus since it cannot survive in the american environment due to its fragile nature
he later deploys what is left of the american military to assist saudi and kuwaiti forces in repelling the uir military which also becomes successful
the would be assassin is later arrested on the spot by the fbi after attempting to kill president ryan inside the oval office
at the end of executive orders ryan in the tradition of presidents monroe truman carter and reagan issues a foreign policy doctrine which largely defines his administration s international perspective
the ryan doctrine states that the u s
will no longer tolerate attacks on our territory our possessions or our citizens and will hold whoever orders such attacks accountable
this statement comes soon after the ebola attack on the u s
ordered by daryaei
ryan announces the new doctrine on television momentarily cutting away to show daryaei and his uir advisors being incinerated by laser guided bombs launched from two f s on ryan s orders
therefore the ryan doctrine supersedes the executive order put in place by president ford which forbids the assassination of foreign heads of state
ryan however believes it is a more ethical alternative than total war since it punishes the person responsible for the attack instead of the people he rules
within the books the ryan doctrine is not officially invoked after daryaei s death although ryan threatens to use it on the chinese leadership in the bear and the dragon should anything happen to american citizens living in china as a consequence of the siberian war
ryan has completed durling s term as president and has campaigned for the next election which he wins
he retains most of his emergency cabinet and has robby jackson as vice president
he has to deal with the attempted assassination of golovko who is now head of russia s foreign intelligence service formerly the kgb
this turns out to be an attempt to sow confusion in the russian government because of china s designs to annex eastern siberia where geologists had recently discovered a large amount of oil and gold
these events lead to the inclusion of russia into nato and the assistance of u s
forces in the sino russian conflict although attacks on nato members outside the atlantic should not trigger article v
when the chinese begin losing the war u s
forces target their strategic assets
a u s
submarine sinks a chinese ballistic missile submarine causing the chinese politburo to panic and increase the readiness of their land based icbms
forces do not have the ability to destroy the silos as they could only use deep penetrating bombs which had all been used to destroy chinese bridges to disrupt the people s liberation army s pla logistical support
this causes the u s
and russia to send a joint rainbow spetsnaz team to destroy the silos
they destroy of the icbms but one of them manages to launch and head towards washington dc and with ryan taking a command initiative at an aegis missile cruiser the icbm is intercepted by abms from the uss gettysburg
with the pla s looming defeat in siberia which they were about to learn about via live uav broadcasts from the cia through the internet student demonstrators in beijing raid a politburo meeting causing reformist minister fang gan to take control and arrest the war s perpetrators making peace negotiations with the u s
and russia and beginning china s transition to democracy
following this ryan apparently completes his term and refuses to run for a second elected term
robby jackson thus campaigns to become the first african american president but he is assassinated by the ku klux klan on a trip to the south enabling kealty his opponent to become the next president by default
before ryan leaves office he creates the campus a covert counter terrorism organization that fronts as hendley associates a financial trading firm
he also writes presidential pardons for its members with attorney general pat martin s assistance
in his retirement ryan is living easy with a net worth of over million
he is working on two versions of his memoirs one for immediate release and another detailing his cia career to be published twenty years after his death
while he is at first publicly silent about his opinion on president kealty s policies he becomes increasingly frustrated with the direction in which he is taking the country
ultimately he announces that he will come out of retirement to run for a second full term as a republican presidential candidate
despite not being originally involved in the campus s activities due to his high profile status he gradually becomes more directly linked to the campus s operations aiding them from behind the scenes on occasion
here ryan learns his son jack jr is a field operative of the campus a fact which he reluctantly accepts
ryan campaigns against kealty facing off against him in various televised debates
it becomes apparent that ryan will win the election as the majority of americans had never entirely accepted kealty
despite the efforts of paul laska a high profile czech billionaire and a devout enemy of ryan and key members of the kealty administration who labelled ryan s longtime friend john clark a fugitive in an effort to expose the campus as well as tying ryan to it by association ryan narrowly wins the election overcoming all of kealty s efforts to harm him
soon after returning to the presidency ryan deals with a developing crisis in china where president wei zhen lin has declared his intentions to annex hong kong macau and taiwan and expand his country s territory into the south china sea in a desperate attempt to recoup his country s economic losses
in reality pla chairman su ke qiang has been manipulating president wei for his expansionist policies secretly sanctioning cyber attacks on america s infrastructure that compromises the nation s national security apparatus
president ryan decides to take action by supporting taiwan along with india vietnam indonesia and the philippines which would also be affected by an expansion of china s territory
the campus later tracks down the nerve center of china s cyberattacks on the u s
to an office building in guangzhou
president ryan orders the destruction of the building decapitating china s cyberwarfare abilities
he makes contact with wei and warns him that the cyber attacks are considered an act of war on china s part
after realizing that he has been used by su for his own gain wei intentionally divulges information on chairman su s whereabouts which ryan interprets as a request from the chinese president to assassinate the military leader
the campus with aid from a local rebel force and the fsb later carry out a false flag attack on chairman su s motorcade outside beijing
ryan announces a blockade of china s oil supplies until the war effort is abandoned calling upon wei and the politburo to accept defeat
a cornered wei later commits suicide eventually ending the conflict between the united states and china
the ryan administration then contends with newly elected russian president valeri volodin who is a dedicated communist seeking to restore russia to its former glory
volodin had merged the svr and the fsb into one entity to be led by enigmatic fsb head roman talanov and later decides to invade ukraine all the way to the capital of kyiv
president ryan sends american military forces to counter russia s advance into kyiv
ryan later finds out that talanov is zenith a kgb assassin from the cold war
volodin had been his control officer and together they had been employed by rogue elements within the kgb who had an exit strategy in mind with the imminent fall of communism in the late s by siphoning off billions of dollars from soviet programs
volodin then double crossed his co conspirators by ordering talanov as zenith to kill them all as well as the bankers involved in order to prevent exposure to the rest of the kgb
in addition talanov was planted by his boss into russian crime organization seven strong men rising in ranks to become its eventual leader and turning it into a tool for volodin s policies
ryan uses this information to blackmail the russian president into stopping the russian army s advance into kyiv
talanov resigns and is later murdered
president ryan deals with north korean dictator choi ji hoon who attempts to start production at a rare earth mineral deposit found in their territory and then use the resulting billions of dollars in profit to purchase nuclear weapons technology
choi decides to order the assassination of the american leader with the aid of a mexican drug cartel and an arab bomb maker in order to stop his persistent interference
during a state visit to mexico city ryan barely survives the attempt on his life
the campus later uncovers choi s involvement in the incident which leads to the dictator being deposed from power and later executed
ryan squares off with volodin once again as he observes that a series of seemingly isolated attacks in europe correspond with an increase in russia s oil profit
he tries to convince nato but they dispute his theory fearing the consequences of an all out war
nevertheless he sends the united states navy to dispatch its russian counterpart in the baltic sea
volodin is later assassinated by the siloviki after his gambit of a covert violent offensive in an effort to recoup russia s economic losses fails
president ryan faces a crisis where american military and intelligence personnel are being targeted by isis
the specificity of the target packages make it clear that a massive intelligence breach has occurred
president ryan finds himself pressured by the media and some of his government advisers to send troops into the middle east to fight the islamic state terrorists but he resists and gathers more intelligence
the culprit was later revealed to be a romanian hacker who had obtained an old copy of a database containing personal information on military and intelligence personnel
after footage of terrorist attacks released by isis inspires a wave of copycat attacks in the united states president ryan orders the bombing of the headquarters of islamic state s propaganda wing
ryan then appears in point of contact as he attends a funeral for his son jack junior s colleague in hendley associates paul brown who was revealed as a former cia officer who had helped avert a north korean plot to crash the asian stock market
ryan deals with the chinese once again as a series of seemingly unrelated attacks in asia europe and africa show their involvement
the campus later discovers that a secret cabal composed of hardliners within the chinese government are plotting to depose current president zhao chengzhi for his moderate stance on several issues of importance
the cabal plans to make zhao look reckless provoking ryan to invoke the ryan doctrine and have him killed
jack ryan jr
later prevents an assassination attempt on his father and president zhao in the g summit in tokyo and the conspirators are later arrested for treason
ryan briefly appears in the next released novel line of sight where he orders the destruction of a building in bosnia containing stolen thermobaric warheads to be launched by serb extremists on a serbian orthodox church event nearby as a false flag attack to provoke war between nato and the russians in the balkans
president ryan is faced with a multitude of crises
a flu epidemic as well as spring floods occur in the southeast united states and ryan has to deal with his political rival senator michelle chadwick who has been attacking him using bot planted fake news stories
he sends the secret service to protect her from imminent assassination and an attempt by russian foreign intelligence was thwarted
president ryan later delivers a presidential address showing the dangers of fake news
overseas ryan has to deal with russia plotting to invade ukraine yet again disguised as a military exercise as well as the siege of the united states embassy in cameroon by the cameroonian government eager on arresting its opposition leader
president ryan expresses caution over a series of protests in iran favorably dubbed the persian spring
his suspicion was proven true when it was revealed that the leader of the dissidents reza kazem was a proxy made by the iranian government on behalf of rogue elements in the russian government who have stolen nuclear weapons and are intent on launching them on american military bases in or near iran
kazem reneges on his deal and plots to launch the missiles into low earth orbit creating space junk that would destroy several satellites in its path
ryan orders the destruction of the nuclear defense facility in mashhad containing one of the missiles the other is launched into space but fails to reach its destination at the last minute
ryan then appears in the next jack ryan jr
novel enemy contact
he deals with u s
senator deborah dixon s stonewalling of his proposed foreign policy initiative which includes building a u s
military base in poland to counter russian aggression to the east
when it was revealed that senator dixon s son has unsavory connections to the chinese president ryan blackmails her into passing an anticorruption bill
president ryan receives a cryptic text message from his friend and former cia colleague father pat west
he warns him of a next generation ai program named calliope which could be used by the chinese military to start a conflict with the united states
the jesuit priest had been imprisoned by indonesian police for trumped up charges of blasphemy against islam when in fact he had earlier witnessed the murder of an american software engineer who first told him about calliope
the chief executive discreetly orders the campus to investigate father west s text
then he calls on the indonesian president to release his friend to no avail
undeterred he makes a state visit to indonesia eventually informing the indonesian president of china s sinister plans
father west is eventually released from prison
