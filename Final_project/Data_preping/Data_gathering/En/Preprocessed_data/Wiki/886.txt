sutton signwriting simply signwriting system writing sign languages
highly featural visually iconic shape character abstract picture hand face body spatial arrangement page doe follow sequential order like letter make written english words
wa developed valerie sutton dancer two year earlier developed dancewriting
newer standardized form known international sign writing alphabet iswa
sutton wa teaching dancewriting royal danish ballet lars von der lieth wa research sign language university copenhagen thought would useful use similar notation recording sign languages
sutton based signwriting dancewriting finally expanded system complete repertoire movementwriting
although first writing system sign language see stokoe notation signwriting first adequately represent facial expression shift posture accommodate representation series sign longer compound word short phrases
system regular use used example publish college newsletter american sign language ha used captioning youtube videos
sutton note signwriting ha used investigated country every inhabited continent
brazil feneis national association deaf annual meeting association voted accept signwriting preferred method transcribing lingua brasileira de sinai libra written form
strong recommendation brazilian government association wa signwriting taught deaf schools
currently signwriting taught academic level federal university santa catarina part brazilian sign language curriculum
signwriting also used recently published brazilian sign language dictionary containing sign used deaf paulo published university paulo direction prof
fernando capovilla ej brazilian sign language lexicography technology dictionary digital encyclopedia chereme-based sign retrieval quadriplegic deaf communication systems
initial study found deaf community prefer video writing system dominant language however claim ha disputed work steve dianne parkhurst spain found initial resistance later renewed interest finally pride
deaf people learn read write signing system increase self-esteem say dianne parkhurst
adopted many country among brazil ethiopia france germany italy portugal saudi arabia slovenia tunisia united states
signwriting international sign writing alphabet iswa ha proposed manual equivalent international phonetic alphabet
however researcher argue signwriting phonemic orthography doe one-to-one map phonological form written forms
although claim disputed ha recommended country adapt sign language-by-language basis
two doctoral dissertation study promote application signwriting specific sign language
maria galea wrote using signwriting write maltese sign language
also claudia savina bianchini wrote doctoral dissertation implementation signwriting write italian sign language
signwriting combination iconic symbol handshapes orientation body location facial expression contact movement used represent word sign language
since signwriting featural script represents actual physical formation sign rather meaning phonemic semantic analysis language required write it
person ha learned system feel unfamiliar sign way english speaking person sound unfamiliar word written latin alphabet without even needing know sign means
number symbol extensive often provides multiple way write single sign
took many century english spelling become standardized spelling signwriting yet standardized sign language
however almost publication use point view signer assume right hand dominant
sutton originally designed script written horizontally left-to-right like english point view observer later changed vertical top-to-bottom point view signer conform wish deaf writers
hollow outline white glyph indicates one facing palm hand filled black glyph indicates one facing back hand split shading indicates one seeing hand side
although reality wrist may turn intermediate position four orientation palm back either side represented signwriting enough represent sign languages
unbroken glyph used hand placed vertical wall face plane front signer occurs finger spelling
band erased across glyph knuckle show hand lie horizontal plane parallel floor
one basic hand-shape glyph used simple square circle band break two however line finger extended base become detached base base remains intact
diagram left show ba-hand flat hand six orientations
three vertical orientation left side hand held front signer finger pointing upward
three glyph rotated like hand clock show finger pointing angle side downward
three horizontal orientation right side diagram hand held outward finger pointing away signer presumably toward viewer
also rotated show finger pointing side toward signer
although indefinite number orientation represented way practice eight used planethat multiple found
hundred glyph hand shape one used asl based five basic elements
square represents closed fist knuckle flexed finger bent finger touch palm thumb lie fingers
modified described indicates least one four finger touch palm hand
circle represents open fist hand thumb finger flexed touch tips
modified indicates least one finger touch thumb way
pentagon triangle atop rectangle illustration used orientation section represents flat hand finger straight contact
similar b hand fingerspelling though without thumb crossing palm
'c' shape represents hand thumb finger curved enough touch
used c hand fingerspelling modified show finger spread apart
angled shape like fat l show four finger flat straight contact bent plane palm
doe occur simple shape must include indication thumb either side touching tip fingersa line halfway across square pentagon show thumb across palm
basic shape modified line jutting face corner represent finger positioned described above
straight line represent straight finger may angle indicate line palm point toward away signer diamond shape tip curved line curved cupped finger hooked line hooked finger right-angle line finger bent one joint crossed line crossed finger shown chart right
pentagon c modified show finger spread rather contact angle modified show whether thumb touch finger tip jut side
although generalization made dozen glyph based circle square detail somewhat idiosyncratic need memorized
solid bullet represents flexing middle joint finger finger hollow bullet represents straightening flexed finger
'd' hand solid bullet mean becomes 'x' hand 'x' hand hollow bullet mean becomes 'd' hand
example square closed fist 's' hand double solid bullet sign 'milk' iconically squeezing udder
downward-pointing chevron represents flexing knuckle upward-pointing chevron show knuckle straighten
'u' hand chevron becomes 'n' hand 'n' hand chevron becomes 'u' hand
zigzag like two chevron joined together mean finger flex repeatedly sync
hundred arrow various sort used indicate movement hand space
movement notation get quite complex exact need one sign language different people may choose write sign different ways
movement left hand shaped arrowhead hollow white movement right hand solid black
orientation movement arrow distinguish two plane movement vertical plane represented arrow double stem bottom diagram left single-stemmed arrow represent movement parallel floor fro
addition movement diagonal plane us modified double-stemmed arrow cross bar stem indicates motion away well solid dot indicates approaching motion
fro movement also go something us modified single-stemmed arrow part arrow representing near motion thicker rest
straight movement one eight direction either plane eight principal direction compass
long straight arrow indicates movement elbow short arrow cross bar behind indicates motion wrist simple short arrow indicates small movement
doubled opposite direction show nodding wrist secondary curved arrow crossing main arrow show arm twist moves
doubled opposite direction show shaking hand arrow turn curve zigzag loop-the-loop
six contact glyph show hand contact location sign
handshape glyph located side face together contact glyph indicates hand touch side face
circle dot inside brushing along place leaving it
spiral may approximated rubbing place leaving additional arrow understood circle and
two bar either side contact symbol indicate contact happens element place contact usually finger inside circular hand shape
contact basic asterisk rarely used barsif signing hand located hand symbol one hand shape above
additional symbol used represent sign location face body part hands
symbol represent facial movement used various sign language including eye eyebrow nose movement cheek mouth movement breathing changes
also symbol indicate speed movement whether movement simultaneous alternating punctuation
various punctuation symbol exist correspond comma period question exclamation mark punctuation symbol scripts
written sign line break sign following punctuation symbol
one unusual characteristic signwriting use two-dimensional layout within invisible 'sign box'
relative position symbol within box iconically represent location hand part body involved sign represented
obvious linear relationship symbol within sign box unlike sequence character within word script spoken languages
also unlike sign language script arrange symbol linearly spoken languages
however since sign language many phonetic parameter articulated simultaneously script require arbitrary convention specifying order different parameter handshape location motion etc
although signwriting doe convention symbol arranged relative within sign two-dimensional layout result le arbitrariness iconicity sign language scripts
outside sign however script linear reflecting temporal order signs
sign commonly written vertical column although formerly written horizontally
sign box arranged top bottom within column interspersed punctuation symbol column progress left right across page
within column sign may written center shifted left right 'lanes' indicate side-to-side shift body
sutton order sign ten group based finger extended dominant hand
group subdivided according actual hand shape subdivided according plane hand vertical horizontal according basic orientation hand palm side back
ordering system ha proposed using beginning example american sign language brazilian sign language libras
current system ordering signwriting called sign symbol sequence parsed creator sign recorded on-line dictionary
system allows internal ordering feature including handshape orientation speed location clustered feature found spoken dictionaries
advantage signwriting compared writing system sign language are
iconicity make easy learn read particular iconicity result layout two dimension instead one
ha adapted use many different sign languageshowever ha disadvantage well
sheer size symbol set fine detail written create challenge learning write
also mean written form largely situational inventive different people may write sign different way single person may alternate transcriptions
two-dimensional spatial layout signwriting symbol within sign although iconic linear layout come cost
signwriting currently requires special software signwriting cannot used ordinary text within normal word processor application software
work-around software signmaker rand keyboard available signwriting website allows sign assembled special signwriting software copied easily graphic image word processing desktop publishing softwaresignpuddle plain-text ascii string representation signs
stored plain text anywhere replaced sign special program signwriting icon server
rfc standard draft ha proposed later evolved stricter draft standard known formal signwriting fsw
also experimental truetype font us sil graphite technology automatically turn sequence signs
signwriting first writing system sign language included unicode standard
character added sutton signwriting unicode block unicode version released june
set character based signwriting's standardized symbol set defined character encoding model
historically software ha recorded position using cartesian x-y coordinate symbol
since unicode focus symbol make sense one-dimensional plain-text context number character required two-dimensional placement included unicode proposal
current software record sign string character either ascii unicode
older software may use xml custom binary format represent sign
formal signwriting us ascii character define two-dimensional layout within sign simple structures
would possible fully define sign unicode seventeen additional characters
either character set unicode ascii spelling sign produce word efficiently processed regular expressions
sutton ha released international signwriting alphabet sil open font license
signwriting font project githubgoogle ha release open type font called noto sans signwriting support signwriting unicode uni specification modifying character facial diacritics
