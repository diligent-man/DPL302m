sutton signwriting or simply signwriting is a system of writing sign languages
it is highly featural and visually iconic both in the shapes of the characters which are abstract pictures of the hands face and body and in their spatial arrangement on the page which does not follow a sequential order like the letters that make up written english words
it was developed in by valerie sutton a dancer who had two years earlier developed dancewriting
some newer standardized forms are known as the international sign writing alphabet iswa
as sutton was teaching dancewriting to the royal danish ballet lars von der lieth who was doing research on sign language at the university of copenhagen thought it would be useful to use a similar notation for the recording of sign languages
sutton based signwriting on dancewriting and finally expanded the system to the complete repertoire of movementwriting
however only signwriting and dancewriting have been widely used
although not the first writing system for sign languages see stokoe notation signwriting is the first to adequately represent facial expressions and shifts in posture and to accommodate representation of series of signs longer than compound words and short phrases
it is the only system in regular use used for example to publish college newsletters in american sign language and has been used for captioning of youtube videos
sutton notes that signwriting has been used or investigated in over countries on every inhabited continent
however it is not clear how widespread its use is in each country
in brazil during the feneis national association of the deaf annual meeting in the association voted to accept signwriting as the preferred method of transcribing lingua brasileira de sinais libras into a written form
the strong recommendation to the brazilian government from that association was that signwriting be taught in all deaf schools
currently signwriting is taught on an academic level at the federal university of santa catarina as part of its brazilian sign language curriculum
signwriting is also being used in the recently published brazilian sign language dictionary containing more than signs used by the deaf of s o paulo published by the university of s o paulo under the direction of prof
fernando capovilla ej brazilian sign language lexicography and technology dictionary digital encyclopedia chereme based sign retrieval and quadriplegic deaf communication systems
abstracted from educational resources information center
some initial studies found that deaf communities prefer video or writing systems for the dominant language however this claim has been disputed by the work of steve and dianne parkhurst in spain where they found initial resistance later renewed interest and finally pride
if deaf people learn to read and write in their own signing system that increases their self esteem says dianne parkhurst
as of signwriting is widely used at international sign forums
it is adopted in as many as countries among which are brazil ethiopia france germany italy portugal saudi arabia slovenia tunisia and the united states
signwriting as the international sign writing alphabet iswa has been proposed as the manual equivalent to the international phonetic alphabet
however some researchers argue that the signwriting is not a phonemic orthography and does not have a one to one map from phonological forms to written forms
although such a claim is disputed it has been recommended that countries adapt this sign on a language by language basis
there are two doctoral dissertations that study and promote the application of signwriting to a specific sign language
maria galea wrote about using signwriting to write maltese sign language
also claudia savina bianchini wrote her doctoral dissertation on the implementation of signwriting to write italian sign language
in signwriting a combination of iconic symbols for handshapes orientation body locations facial expressions contacts and movement are used to represent words in sign language
since signwriting as a featural script represents the actual physical formation of signs rather than their meaning no phonemic or semantic analysis of a language is required to write it
a person who has learned the system can feel out an unfamiliar sign in the same way an english speaking person can sound out an unfamiliar word written in the latin alphabet without even needing to know what the sign means
the number of symbols is extensive and often provides multiple ways to write a single sign
just as it took many centuries for english spelling to become standardized spelling in signwriting is not yet standardized for any sign language
words may be written from the point of view of the signer or the viewer
however almost all publications use the point of view of the signer and assume the right hand is dominant
sutton originally designed the script to be written horizontally left to right like english and from the point of view of the observer but later changed it to vertical top to bottom and from the point of view of the signer to conform to the wishes of deaf writers
the orientation of the palm is indicated by filling in the glyph for the hand shape
a hollow outline white glyph indicates that one is facing the palm of the hand a filled black glyph indicates that one is facing the back of the hand and split shading indicates that one is seeing the hand from the side
although in reality the wrist may turn to intermediate positions only the four orientations of palm back and either side are represented in signwriting as they are enough to represent sign languages
if an unbroken glyph is used then the hand is placed in the vertical wall or face plane in front of the signer as occurs when finger spelling
a band erased across the glyph through the knuckles shows that the hand lies in the horizontal plane parallel to the floor
if one of the basic hand shape glyphs is used such as the simple square or circle this band breaks it in two however if there are lines for fingers extended from the base then they become detached from the base but the base itself remains intact
the diagram to the left shows a ba hand flat hand in six orientations
for the three vertical orientations on the left side the hand is held in front of the signer fingers pointing upward
all three glyphs can be rotated like the hands of a clock to show the fingers pointing at an angle to the side or downward
for the three horizontal orientations on the right side of the diagram the hand is held outward with the fingers pointing away from the signer and presumably toward the viewer
they can also be rotated to show the fingers pointing to the side or toward the signer
although an indefinite number of orientations can be represented this way in practice only eight are used for each plane that is only multiples of are found
there are over a hundred glyphs for hand shapes but all the ones used in asl are based on five basic elements
a square represents a closed fist with the knuckles of the flexed fingers bent so that the fingers touch the palm and the thumb lies over the fingers
unadorned this square represents the s hand of fingerspelling
modified as described below it indicates that at least one of the four fingers touches the palm of the hand
a circle represents an open fist a hand where the thumb and fingers are flexed so as to touch at their tips
unadorned this is the o hand of fingerspelling
modified it indicates that at least one finger touches the thumb this way
a pentagon triangle atop a rectangle as in the illustration used for the orientation section above represents a flat hand where all fingers are straight and in contact
this is similar to the b hand of fingerspelling though without the thumb crossing over the palm
a c shape represents a hand where the thumb and fingers are curved but not enough to touch
this is used for the c hand of fingerspelling and can be modified to show that the fingers are spread apart
an angled shape like a fat l shows that the four fingers are flat straight and in contact but bent at from the plane of the palm
it does not occur as a simple shape but must include an indication of where the thumb is either out to the side or touching the tips of the fingers a line halfway across the square or pentagon shows the thumb across the palm
these are the e b and with spread fingers hands of fingerspelling
these basic shapes are modified with lines jutting from their faces and corners to represent fingers that are not positioned as described above
straight lines represent straight fingers these may be at an angle to indicate that they are not in line with the palm if they point toward or away from the signer they have a diamond shape at the tip curved lines for curved cupped fingers hooked lines for hooked fingers right angle lines for fingers bent at only one joint and crossed lines for crossed fingers as shown in the chart at right
the pentagon and c are only modified to show that the fingers are spread rather than in contact the angle is only modified to show whether the thumb touches the finger tips or juts out to the side
although there are some generalizations which can be made for the dozens of other glyphs which are based on the circle and square the details are somewhat idiosyncratic and each needs to be memorized
there are only a few symbols for finger movement
they may be doubled to show that the movement is repeated
a solid bullet represents flexing the middle joint of a finger or fingers and a hollow bullet represents straightening a flexed finger
that is a d hand with a solid bullet means that it becomes an x hand while an x hand with a hollow bullet means that it becomes a d hand
if the fingers are already flexed then a solid bullet shows that they squeeze
for example a square closed fist s hand with double solid bullets is the sign for milk iconically squeezing an udder
a downward pointing chevron represents flexing at the knuckles while an upward pointing chevron shows that the knuckles straighten
that is a u hand with a down chevron becomes an n hand while and n hand with an up chevron becomes a u hand
a zigzag like two chevrons joined together means that the fingers flex repeatedly and in sync
a double line zigzag means that the fingers wriggle or flutter out of sync
hundreds of arrows of various sorts are used to indicate movement of the hands through space
movement notation gets quite complex and because it is more exact than it needs to be for any one sign language different people may choose to write the same sign in different ways
for movement with the left hand the shaped arrowhead is hollow white for movement with the right hand it is solid black
when both hands move as one an open shaped arrowhead is used
as with orientation movement arrows distinguish two planes movement in the vertical plane up down is represented by arrows with double stems as at the bottom of the diagram at left while single stemmed arrows represent movement parallel to the floor to fro
in addition movement in a diagonal plane uses modified double stemmed arrows a cross bar on the stem indicates that the motion is away as well up or down and a solid dot indicates approaching motion
to fro movement that also goes over or under something uses modified single stemmed arrows with the part of the arrow representing near motion thicker than the rest
these are iconic but conventionalized and so need to be learned individually
straight movements are in one of eight directions for either plane as in the eight principal directions of a compass
a long straight arrow indicates movement from the elbow a short arrow with a cross bar behind it indicates motion from the wrist and a simple short arrow indicates a small movement
doubled in opposite directions these can show nodding from the wrist a secondary curved arrow crossing the main arrow shows that the arm twists while it moves
doubled in opposite directions these can show shaking of the hand arrows can turn curve zigzag and loop the loop
arrows on the face at the eyes show the direction of gaze
six contact glyphs show hand contact with the location of the sign
that is a handshape glyph located at the side of the face together with a contact glyph indicates that the hand touches the side of the face
the choice of the contact glyph indicates the manner of the contact
an asterisk or for simply touching the place
a plus sign for grasping the place usually the other hand
a pound hash sign for striking the place
a circle with a dot inside for brushing along the place and then leaving it
a spiral or may be approximated with for rubbing the place and not leaving if there is no additional arrow this is understood to be in circles and
two bars on either side of a contact symbol to indicate the contact happens between elements of the place of contact usually between fingers or inside a circular hand shape
a contact other than the basic asterisk is rarely used between bars if the signing hand is located at the other hand the symbol for it is one of the hand shapes above
in practice only a subset of the more simple hand shapes occurs
additional symbols are used to represent sign locations at the face or body parts other than the hands
a circle shows the head
there are symbols to represent facial movements that are used in various sign languages including eyes eyebrows nose movements cheeks mouth movements and breathing changes
the direction of head movement and eyegaze can also be shown
shoulders are shown with a horizontal line
small arrows can be added to show shoulder and torso movement
arms and even legs can be added if necessary
there are also symbols that indicate speed of movement whether movement is simultaneous or alternating and punctuation
various punctuation symbols exist that correspond to commas periods question and exclamation marks and other punctuation symbols of other scripts
these are written between signs and lines do not break between a sign and its following punctuation symbol
one of the unusual characteristics of signwriting is its use of two dimensional layout within an invisible sign box
the relative positions of the symbols within the box iconically represent the locations of the hands and other parts of the body involved in the sign being represented
as such there is no obvious linear relationship between the symbols within each sign box unlike the sequence of characters within each word in most scripts for spoken languages
this is also unlike other sign language scripts which arrange symbols linearly as in spoken languages
however since in sign languages many phonetic parameters are articulated simultaneously these other scripts require arbitrary conventions for specifying the order of different parameters of handshape location motion etc
although signwriting does have conventions for how symbols are to be arranged relative to each other within a sign the two dimensional layout results in less arbitrariness and more iconicity than other sign language scripts
outside of each sign however the script is linear reflecting the temporal order of signs
signs are most commonly now written in vertical columns although formerly they were written horizontally
sign boxes are arranged from top to bottom within the column interspersed with punctuation symbols and the columns progress left to right across the page
within a column signs may be written down the center or shifted left or right in lanes to indicate side to side shifts of the body
sutton orders signs in ten groups based on which fingers are extended on the dominant hand
these are equivalent to the numerals one through ten in asl
each group is then subdivided according to the actual hand shape and then subdivided again according to the plane the hand is in vertical then horizontal then again according to the basic orientation of the hand palm side back
an ordering system has been proposed using this beginning and examples from both american sign language and brazilian sign language libras
the current system of ordering for signwriting is called the sign symbol sequence which is parsed by the creator of each sign as recorded into the on line dictionary
this system allows for internal ordering by features including handshape orientation speed location and other clustered features not found in spoken dictionaries
some of the advantages of signwriting compared to other writing systems for sign languages are
its iconicity makes it easy to learn to read in particular the iconicity that results from layout in two dimensions instead of just one
it has detailed mechanisms for representing facial expression and other non manuals
it has been adapted for use with many different sign languages however it has a few disadvantages as well
the sheer size of its symbol set and the fine details which can be written create a challenge in learning how to write
it also means that the written form is largely situational and inventive different people may write the same sign different ways and a single person may alternate between transcriptions
the two dimensional spatial layout of signwriting symbols within each sign although it is more iconic than a linear layout comes at a cost
signwriting currently requires special software signwriting cannot be used as ordinary text within normal word processors or other application software
as a work around software signmaker and rand keyboard is available on the signwriting website which allows a sign once assembled with special signwriting software to be copied easily as a graphic image into word processing or desktop publishing software signpuddle is a plain text ascii string representation of signs
it can be stored as plain text anywhere and be replaced by signs with special programs such as the signwriting icon server
an rfc standard draft for it has been proposed which later evolved into a stricter draft standard known as formal signwriting fsw
it can also use unicode characters instead of ascii escapes
there is also an experimental truetype font that uses the sil graphite technology to automatically turn these sequences into signs
signwriting is the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the unicode standard
characters were added in the sutton signwriting unicode block of unicode version released in june
this set of characters is based on signwriting s standardized symbol set and defined character encoding model
the unicode standard only covers the symbol set
it does not address layout the positioning of the symbols in two dimensions
historically software has recorded position using cartesian x y coordinates for each symbol
since unicode focuses on symbols that make sense in a one dimensional plain text context the number characters required for two dimensional placement were not included in the unicode proposal
the unicode block for sutton signwriting is u d u daaf
current software records each sign as a string of characters in either ascii or unicode
older software may use xml or a custom binary format to represent a sign
formal signwriting uses ascii characters to define the two dimensional layout within a sign and other simple structures
it would be possible to fully define a sign in unicode with seventeen additional characters
with either character set unicode or ascii the spelling of a sign produces a word that the can be efficiently processed with regular expressions
these sets are isomorphic
sutton has released the international signwriting alphabet under the sil open font license
the symbols of the iswa are available as individual svg or as truetype fonts
signwriting fonts project on githubgoogle has release an open type font called noto sans signwriting that supports the signwriting in unicode uni specification with modifying characters and facial diacritics
signwriting is enabled on wikimedia incubator with the javascript based signwriting keyboard for use on wikimedia and throughout the web by yair rand
test wikis include the asl wikipedia on incubator and the other test wikis of sign languages
the sutton signwriting signmaker sutton signwriting signmaker is a sign editor that can be accessed directly embedded in an iframe and downloaded
it uses both formal signwriting in ascii fsw and signwriting in unicode swu character sets along with the associated style string
see draft slevinski formal signwriting for detailed specification
