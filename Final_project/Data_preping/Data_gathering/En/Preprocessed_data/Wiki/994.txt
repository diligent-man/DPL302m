The M light tank officially Light Tank M was an American pre World War II light tank which saw limited use during World War II The most common model the MA was equipped with one mm in M gun and five cal M Browning machine guns
It was originally developed from the prototype T light tank built by Rock Island Arsenal which had a Vickers type leaf spring suspension The suspension was replaced by the superior vertical volute system in the TE series of This was put into production with minor modifications as the MA in with ten produced The main pre war version was the MA with produced becoming the main tank in the US Army infantry units in the interwar period The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective This led to the MA with a mm gun as the main armament A total of were delivered the last ten as late as April
Its only combat use in American units was with the US Marine Corps st Tank Battalion during the Pacific War in However it is believed that MAs served in Burma and India with the British th Hussars and nd Royal Tank Regiment during their engagements with the Imperial Japanese Army's th Tank Regiment
The MA light tank led to the development of the M Stuart light tank and the M Tractor artillery prime mover The M Stuart saw widespread use throughout the war
US Army infantry tank design started with the light tank T during the s which developed into a series of experimental designs which did not enter production The T concept starting five years later incorporated several design lessons from the T but used a new suspension system copied from the British Vickers six ton tank The first prototype was delivered in
The Defense Act of had defined tanks to be used in support of the infantry Through the s a number of theorists outlined an independent role for the tank that required it to move at high speed into the rear areas a modern version of the cavalry The British referred to these designs as cruiser tanks but similar high speed designs were developed under a variety of names As the Defense Act limited tank development to the infantry the United States Cavalry began tank development under the name combat car In keeping with the high speed role the new T combat car introduced the new vertical volute spring suspension VVSS system which proved clearly superior to the Vickers leaf spring system
This led to a second prototype of the T the TE in April adopting the VVSS from the T The TE was armed with one cal mm and one inch mm Browning machine gun mounted in a fixed turret another cal Browning was mounted on the hull front The TE was selected for production in as the M which mounted only the M Browning in a small one man turret and the cal in the hull
After only units were delivered the Infantry Branch decided to switch to a twin turret configuration in the ME with a caliber mm machine gun in a second turret These early twin turret tanks were given the nickname Mae West by the troops after the popular busty movie star The twin turret layout was inefficient but was a common feature of s light tanks derived from the Vickers such as the Soviet T and Polish TP Further refinements to the MA produced the A model which incorporated a modified suspension system that reduced the tank's ground pressure The weight increased to tons
Following the Spanish Civil War most armies including the US Army realized that they needed tanks armed with cannon and not merely with machine guns The Cavalry had already opted for a single larger turret on its nearly identical M combat car In December OCM No directed that a single MA be removed from the assembly line and modified with heavier armor and weapons to meet the standards of the US Infantry This vehicle after conversion was re designated as the MA It was equipped with an M mm main gun inch mm thick armor and a seven cylinder gasoline engine Other upgrades included improved suspension improved transmission and better engine cooling Production of the MA began in May at the American Car and Foundry Company and continued through March an additional ten MAs were assembled in April for a total production run of MA light tanks The US Army sent out press photos still showing the MA being assembled in July after the assembly line had been changed over to the M
The M light tank led to the US M series and M series light tanks The Ordnance Department viewed the MA as a stopgap tank work to improve it further began in June The first M Stuart tanks began to be produced in March the original riveted Ms closely resembled the MA and the two types occasionally served in the same units an easy recognition feature was the rear idler wheel On the MA the idler was raised on the M it trailed on the ground increasing the flotation of the heavier vehicle The M retained the same Continental W engine but incorporated ½ inch thicker ½ inch total thickness armor with weight increased to tons The tank initially kept the same mm gun and the forward firing hull machine guns but the turret incorporated improvements Eventually over examples of all variants were produced
By December the MA MA and MA were used for training only The majority of MAs which went to the US Army were also used only for training between and The US Marine Corps ordered M Stuart tanks to outfit its armored units in but as the new tank was not yet in production it received MAs after which point production of the M had come on line Many of these tanks were deployed during the Battle of Guadalcanal while assigned to A Company st Tank Battalion where they and M Stuarts were typically spread out among infantry units Their use was generally limited to providing mobile fire support to the Marines either in disabling Japanese bunkers or using canister shot against Japanese attacks In defensive engagements the MAs and Stuarts would deploy in pairs so they could cover each other with machine gun fire against Japanese soldiers armed with satchel charges
Ultimately the Marine Corps determined that the mm guns of the Ms and Ms were not powerful enough to defeat Japanese bunkers and so they would be replaced with tanks armed with mm guns Following the end of the Guadalcanal campaign A Company returned to Australia where the MAs were replaced with the new M Shermans in preparation for the Battle of Cape Gloucester in December They remained in service in some areas of the Pacific Theater until After they served in the Pacific they were used for training
Britain ordered MAs in early After of them were delivered the order was canceled in favor of an improved M Stuart The fate of these vehicles is unclear There is evidence that indicates those MAs were shipped off from North Africa as part of the British Army's th Hussars and nd Royal Tank Regiment fighting in the India and Burma campaigns against the Japanese th Tank Regiment However according to historian Mike Green the tanks were never issued to combat units
Besides the machine gun mounted coaxially to the main gun there were three cal machine guns in the hull One was mounted in a ball mount in front of the bow gunner The other two were mounted in fixed sponson mounts These machine guns were fired by the driver they were aimed by pointing the entire tank at the desired target Another cal machine gun was normally mounted on the top of the turret for anti aircraft defense
The mm M gun had a manually operated breechblock The tank commander doubled as loader like many other tanks of the time There was no turret basket in the MA light tank the commander stood on the right side while the gunner stood on the left side The commander turned the turret onto the general direction of target The gunner would then bring the target into the M telescopic sight The M combination mount had ° of traverse this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or with the gears disengaged free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest
Initial production type with single fixed turret containing one cal machine gun Seventeen units were produced
Twin turrets with single M Browning machine gun in its left turret and an MA machine gun in its right turret the turrets partly obstructed each other limiting fields of fire Dubbed Mae West units produced from to
Twin turrets with two machine guns thicker armor slightly lengthened hull improved engine access increased gear ratios better engine cooling improved suspension and other minor detail changes units produced
Single turret with mm gun Thicker armor units produced Orders went to the American Car Foundry in October upon request by the Ordnance Department Used in the early Pacific campaigns and training Only service was in Guadalcanal Used for training after December
An M chassis with the turret removed and replaced with a mm automatic gun The gun penetration was deemed poor and canceled in The MA was ft in m long ft in m wide ft in m high and weighed t lb It had a vertical volute spring suspension and had a speed of mph kmh and had a range of mi km It had one M mm gun with rounds and five cal MA Browning machine guns with rounds with to mm of armor It had a hp kW Continental W A seven cylinder radial engine The vehicle was operated by a crew of four commandergunner loader driver and co driver
