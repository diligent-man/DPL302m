the m light tank officially light tank m was an american pre world war ii light tank which saw limited use during world war ii
the most common model the m a was equipped with one mm in m gun and five cal m browning machine guns
it was originally developed from the prototype t light tank built by rock island arsenal which had a vickers type leaf spring suspension
the suspension was replaced by the superior vertical volute system in the t e series of
this was put into production with minor modifications as the m a in with ten produced
the main pre war version was the m a with produced becoming the main tank in the us army infantry units in the interwar period
the spanish civil war showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective
this led to the m a with a mm gun as the main armament
a total of were delivered the last ten as late as april
its only combat use in american units was with the us marine corps st tank battalion during the pacific war in
however it is believed that m a s served in burma and india with the british th hussars and nd royal tank regiment during their engagements with the imperial japanese army s th tank regiment
the m a light tank led to the development of the m stuart light tank and the m tractor artillery prime mover
the m stuart saw widespread use throughout the war
us army infantry tank design started with the light tank t during the s which developed into a series of experimental designs which did not enter production
the t concept starting five years later incorporated several design lessons from the t but used a new suspension system copied from the british vickers six ton tank
the first prototype was delivered in
the defense act of had defined tanks to be used in support of the infantry
through the s a number of theorists outlined an independent role for the tank that required it to move at high speed into the rear areas a modern version of the cavalry
the british referred to these designs as cruiser tanks but similar high speed designs were developed under a variety of names
as the defense act limited tank development to the infantry the united states cavalry began tank development under the name combat car
in keeping with the high speed role the new t combat car introduced the new vertical volute spring suspension vvss system which proved clearly superior to the vickers leaf spring system
this led to a second prototype of the t the t e in april adopting the vvss from the t
the t e was armed with one cal mm and one inch mm browning machine gun mounted in a fixed turret another cal browning was mounted on the hull front
the t e was selected for production in as the m which mounted only the m browning in a small one man turret and the cal in the hull
after only units were delivered the infantry branch decided to switch to a twin turret configuration in the m e with a caliber mm machine gun in a second turret
these early twin turret tanks were given the nickname mae west by the troops after the popular busty movie star
the twin turret layout was inefficient but was a common feature of s light tanks derived from the vickers such as the soviet t and polish tp
further refinements to the m a produced the a model which incorporated a modified suspension system that reduced the tank s ground pressure
the weight increased to tons
following the spanish civil war most armies including the u s
army realized that they needed tanks armed with cannon and not merely with machine guns
the cavalry had already opted for a single larger turret on its nearly identical m combat car
in december ocm no
directed that a single m a be removed from the assembly line and modified with heavier armor and weapons to meet the standards of the u s
infantry
this vehicle after conversion was re designated as the m a
it was equipped with an m mm main gun inch mm thick armor and a seven cylinder gasoline engine
other upgrades included improved suspension improved transmission and better engine cooling
production of the m a began in may at the american car and foundry company and continued through march an additional ten m a s were assembled in april for a total production run of m a light tanks
the us army sent out press photos still showing the m a being assembled in july after the assembly line had been changed over to the m
the m light tank led to the us m series and m series light tanks
the ordnance department viewed the m a as a stopgap tank work to improve it further began in june
the first m stuart tanks began to be produced in march the original riveted m s closely resembled the m a and the two types occasionally served in the same units an easy recognition feature was the rear idler wheel
on the m a the idler was raised on the m it trailed on the ground increasing the flotation of the heavier vehicle
the m retained the same continental w engine but incorporated inch thicker inch total thickness armor with weight increased to tons
the tank initially kept the same mm gun and the forward firing hull machine guns but the turret incorporated improvements
eventually over examples of all variants were produced
by december the m a m a and m a were used for training only
the majority of m a s which went to the us army were also used only for training between and
the us marine corps ordered m stuart tanks to outfit its armored units in but as the new tank was not yet in production it received m a s after which point production of the m had come on line
many of these tanks were deployed during the battle of guadalcanal while assigned to a company st tank battalion where they and m stuarts were typically spread out among infantry units
their use was generally limited to providing mobile fire support to the marines either in disabling japanese bunkers or using canister shot against japanese attacks
in defensive engagements the m a s and stuarts would deploy in pairs so they could cover each other with machine gun fire against japanese soldiers armed with satchel charges
ultimately the marine corps determined that the mm guns of the m s and m s were not powerful enough to defeat japanese bunkers and so they would be replaced with tanks armed with mm guns
following the end of the guadalcanal campaign a company returned to australia where the m a s were replaced with the new m shermans in preparation for the battle of cape gloucester in december
they remained in service in some areas of the pacific theater until
after they served in the pacific they were used for training
britain ordered m a s in early
after of them were delivered the order was canceled in favor of an improved m stuart
the fate of these vehicles is unclear
there is evidence that indicates those m a s were shipped off from north africa as part of the british army s th hussars and nd royal tank regiment fighting in the india and burma campaigns against the japanese th tank regiment
however according to historian mike green the tanks were never issued to combat units
besides the machine gun mounted coaxially to the main gun there were three cal
machine guns in the hull
one was mounted in a ball mount in front of the bow gunner
the other two were mounted in fixed sponson mounts
these machine guns were fired by the driver they were aimed by pointing the entire tank at the desired target
another cal machine gun was normally mounted on the top of the turret for anti aircraft defense
the mm m gun had a manually operated breechblock
the tank commander doubled as loader like many other tanks of the time
there was no turret basket in the m a light tank the commander stood on the right side while the gunner stood on the left side
the commander turned the turret onto the general direction of target
the gunner would then bring the target into the m telescopic sight
the m combination mount had of traverse this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism
depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or with the gears disengaged free through movement of the gunner s shoulder rest
initial production type with single fixed turret containing one cal machine gun
seventeen units were produced
twin turrets with single m browning machine gun in its left turret and an m a machine gun in its right turret the turrets partly obstructed each other limiting fields of fire
dubbed mae west
units produced from to
twin turrets with two machine guns thicker armor slightly lengthened hull improved engine access increased gear ratios better engine cooling improved suspension and other minor detail changes

orders went to the american car foundry in october upon request by the ordnance department
used in the early pacific campaigns and training
only service was in guadalcanal
used for training after december
an m chassis with the turret removed and replaced with a mm automatic gun
the gun penetration was deemed poor and canceled in the m a was ft in m long ft in m wide ft in m high and weighed t lb
it had a vertical volute spring suspension and had a speed of mph km h and had a range of mi km
it had one m mm gun with rounds and five cal m a browning machine guns with rounds with to mm of armor
it had a hp kw continental w a seven cylinder radial engine
the vehicle was operated by a crew of four commander gunner loader driver and co driver
