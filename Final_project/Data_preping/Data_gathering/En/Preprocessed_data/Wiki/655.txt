echo chamber hollow enclosure used produce reverberation usually recording purposes
example producer television radio program might wish produce aural illusion conversation taking place large room cave effect accomplished playing recording conversation inside echo chamber accompanying microphone catch reverberation
nowadays effect unit widely used create effect echo chamber still used today famous echo chamber capitol studios
music use acoustic echo reverberation effect ha taken many form date back many hundred years
medieval renaissance sacred music relied heavily composers' extensive understanding use complex natural reverberation echo inside church cathedrals
early acoustical knowledge informed design opera house concert hall centuries
architect designed create internal reflection would enhance project sound stage day electrical amplification
sometimes echo effect unintentional side effect architectural engineering design hamilton mausoleum scotland ha one longest reverberation time building
development electronics early centuryspecifically invention amplifier microphoneled creation first artificial echo chamber built radio recording studios
echo reverberation typically created combination electrical physical methods
acoustically speaking classic novel echo chamber creates echo way created church cavesthey simply large enclosed empty space floor wall made hard material polished stone concrete reflect sound wave well
basic purpose chamber add colour depth original sound simulate rich natural reverberation feature large concert halls
development artificial echoreverberation chamber wa important sound recording limitation early recording systems
except case live performance commercial popular recording made specially constructed studios
room heavily insulated exclude external noise internally somewhat anechoicthat designed produce internal echo sound reverberation
virtually every sound everyday life complex mixture direct sound source echo reverberation audience naturally found totally 'dry' reverberation-free sound early recording unappealing
consequently record producer engineer quickly came effective method adding 'artificial' echo reverberation expert could control remarkable degree accuracy
signal studio mixing desksuch voice instrumentis fed large high-fidelity loudspeaker located one end chamber
one microphone placed along length room pick sound speaker reflection wall chamber
farther away loudspeaker echo reverberation microphone pick louder reverberation becomes relation source
signal microphone line fed back mixing desk echoreverberation-enhanced sound blended original 'dry' input
example physical effect heard david bowie song hero album name
song produced tony visconti wa recorded large concert hall hansa recording studio berlin visconti ha since much praised striking sound achieved bowie's vocals
visconti placed three microphone interval along length hall one close bowie one halfway hall third far end hall
recording bowie sang verse progressively louder last increased volume verse visconti opened three microphone turn closest farthest
thus first verse bowie's voice sound close warm present end song visconti ha mixed large amount signal three microphone giving bowie's voice strikingly reverberant sound
original echo chamber emi's abbey road studio wa improved clive robinson site foreman time construction
construction engineering team perfected echo booth abbey road studio london
wa one first studio world specially built recording purpose wa established remains place prime example early -century electro-acoustic echo chamber
building church church hall ballroom often chosen recording site classical music rich natural echo reverberation characteristics
famous example include sir george martin's air studio lyndhurst hall belsize park london large vaulted -century building originally constructed church missionary school
eustache favoured recording venue montreal symphony orchestra many others much sought classical recording unique acoustic characteristics
distinctive reverberation early hit record bill haley comet wa created recording band domed ceiling decca's studio new york city located former ballroom called pythian temple
recording company many small independent label could afford large purpose-built echo chamber abbey road chamber enterprising producer engineer often made use large reverberant space
corridor lift-wells stairwell tiled bathroom used substitute echo chambers
many famous soul music rb music recording released new york-based atlantic record feature echo reverb effect produced simply placing speaker microphone office bathrooma process also used producerengineer bruce botnick recording door album la
development magnetic audio tape technology made possible duplicate physical echo reverberation effect entirely electronically
watkins copicat designed built renowned british electronics engineer charlie watkins late typical kind electronic delay device
tape echo unit use endless loop magnetic tape drawn across series recording playback heads
signal voice instrument fed machine record signal onto tape loop passed record head
tape advance newly recorded signal picked series playback head mounted line record head
play sound back signal pass head turn creating classic rippling cascading echo typical tape echo units
number playback head determines number repeat physical distance playback head determines ratio delay repeat sound usually fraction second
actual length delay repeat varied pitch control alters speed tape loop across heads
typically playback head tape echo machine also connected control allow user determine volume echo relative original signal
another control sometimes called regeneration allows signal playback head fed back variably mixed original input signal creating distinctive feedback effect add noise loop repeat
fully activated control ultimately produce continuous feedback loop pure noise
roland manufactured various model magnetic tape echo reverb sound effect machine introduction digital sound effect machines
tape echo ha repeat short delay repeat often referred slapback echo
distinctive sound one key sonic characteristic rock roll rockabilly heard classic mid-s sun record recording elvis presley others
effect wa result unintentional combination recording monitoring tape head physically located inch apart playback created gap inadvertently produced iconic slap-back effect
advent digital signal processing digital audio technology became possible simulate almost every echo chamber effect processing signal digitally
digital device able simulate almost limitless variety real reverberant space well replicate classic tape-based echo effect physical echo chamber fell disuse
however noted naturally reverberant space church continue used recording venue classical form acoustic music
