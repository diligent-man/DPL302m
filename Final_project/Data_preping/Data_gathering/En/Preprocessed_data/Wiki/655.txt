an echo chamber is a hollow enclosure used to produce reverberation usually for recording purposes
for example the producers of a television or radio program might wish to produce the aural illusion that a conversation is taking place in a large room or a cave these effects can be accomplished by playing the recording of the conversation inside an echo chamber with an accompanying microphone to catch the reverberation
nowadays effects units are more widely used to create such effects but echo chambers are still used today such as the famous echo chambers at capitol studios
in music the use of acoustic echo and reverberation effects has taken many forms and dates back many hundreds of years
medieval and renaissance sacred music relied heavily on the composers extensive understanding and use of the complex natural reverberation and echoes inside churches and cathedrals
this early acoustical knowledge informed the design of opera houses and concert halls in the th th and th centuries
architects designed these to create internal reflections that would enhance and project sound from the stage in the days before electrical amplification
sometimes echo effects were the unintentional side effect of the architectural or engineering design such as for the hamilton mausoleum in scotland which has one of the longest reverberation times of any building
developments in electronics in the early th century specifically the invention of the amplifier and the microphone led to the creation of the first artificial echo chambers built for radio and recording studios
until the s echo and reverberation were typically created by a combination of electrical and physical methods
acoustically speaking the classic novel echo chamber creates echoes in the same way as they are created in churches or caves they are all simply large enclosed empty spaces with floors and walls made of hard materials such as polished stone or concrete that reflect sound waves well
the basic purpose of such chambers is to add colour and depth to the original sound and to simulate the rich natural reverberation that is a feature of large concert halls
the development of artificial echo reverberation chambers was important for sound recording because of the limitations of early recording systems
except in the case of live performances most commercial popular recordings were made in specially constructed studios
these rooms were both heavily insulated to exclude external noises and internally somewhat anechoic that is they were designed not to produce any internal echoes or sound reverberation
because virtually every sound in everyday life is a complex mixture of direct sound from the source and its echoes and reverberations audiences naturally found the totally dry and reverberation free sound of early recordings unappealing
consequently record producers and engineers quickly came up with an effective method of adding artificial echo and reverberation that experts could control with a remarkable degree of accuracy
producing echo and reverberation in this form of echo chamber is simple
a signal from the studio mixing desk such as a voice or instrument is fed to a large high fidelity loudspeaker located at one end of the chamber
one or more microphones are placed along the length of the room and these pick up both the sound from the speaker and its reflections off the walls of the chamber
the farther away from the loudspeaker the more echo and reverberation the microphone s picks up and the louder the reverberation becomes in relation to the source
the signal from the microphone line is then fed back to the mixing desk where the echo reverberation enhanced sound can be blended with the original dry input
an example of this physical effect can be heard on the david bowie song heroes from the album of the same name
the song produced by tony visconti was recorded in the large concert hall in the hansa recording studio in berlin and visconti has since been much praised for the striking sound he achieved on bowie s vocals
visconti placed three microphones at intervals along the length of the hall one very close to bowie one halfway down the hall and the third at the far end of the hall
during the recording bowie sang each verse progressively louder than the last and as he increased volume in each verse visconti opened up each of the three microphones in turn from closest to farthest
thus in the first verse bowie s voice sounds close warm and present by the end of the song visconti has mixed in a large amount of signal from all three microphones giving bowie s voice a strikingly reverberant sound
the original echo chamber at emi s abbey road studios was improved by clive robinson site foreman at the time of construction
his construction and engineering team perfected the echo booth at abbey road studios in london
it was one of the first studios in the world to be specially built for recording purposes when it was established in it remains in place and is a prime example of the early th century electro acoustic echo chamber
buildings such as churches church halls and ballrooms have often been chosen as recording sites for classical and other music because of their rich natural echo and reverberation characteristics
famous examples include sir george martin s air studios at lyndhurst hall in belsize park london a large vaulted th century building originally constructed as a church and missionary school
montreal s church of st
eustache is the favoured recording venue of the montreal symphony orchestra and many others and is much sought after for classical recordings because of its unique acoustic characteristics
the distinctive reverberation on the early hit records by bill haley his comets was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of decca s studio in new york city located in a former ballroom called the pythian temple
some recording companies and many small independent labels could not afford large purpose built echo chambers such as the abbey road chamber so enterprising producers and engineers often made use of any large reverberant space
corridors lift wells stairwells tiled bathrooms were all used as substitute echo chambers
many famous soul music and r b music recordings released by the new york based atlantic records feature echo and reverb effects produced by simply placing a speaker and microphone in the office bathroom a process also used by producer engineer bruce botnick while recording the doors for their album l a

in the s and s the development of magnetic audio tape technology made it possible to duplicate physical echo and reverberation effects entirely electronically
the watkins copicat designed and built by renowned british electronics engineer charlie watkins in the late s is typical of this kind of electronic delay device
tape echo units use an endless loop of magnetic tape which is drawn across a series of recording and playback heads
when a signal from a voice or instrument is fed into the machine it records the signal onto the tape loop as it passed over the record head
as the tape advances the newly recorded signal is then picked up by a series of playback heads mounted in line with the record head
these play the sound back as the signal passes over each head in turn creating the classic rippling or cascading echoes that are typical of tape echo units
the number of playback heads determines the number of repeats and the physical distance between each playback head determines the ratio of delay between each repeat of the sound usually some fraction of a second
the actual length of the delay between each repeat can be varied by a pitch control that alters the speed of the tape loop across the heads
typically the playback heads of tape echo machines are also connected to controls that allow the user to determine the volume of each echo relative to the original signal
another control sometimes called regeneration allows the signal from the playback heads to be fed back into and variably mixed with the original input signal creating a distinctive feedback effect that adds more and more noise to the loop with each repeat
if fully activated this control ultimately produces a continuous feedback loop of pure noise
roland manufactured various models of magnetic tape echo and reverb sound effect machines from until the introduction of digital sound effect machines
tape echo that has few repeats and a very short delay between each repeat is often referred to as slapback echo
this distinctive sound is one of the key sonic characteristics of s rock and roll and rockabilly and can be heard on the classic mid s sun records recordings by elvis presley and others
this effect was a result of the unintentional combination of the recording and monitoring tape heads physically located a few inches apart which on playback created a gap that inadvertently produced the iconic slap back effect
with the advent of digital signal processing and other digital audio technologies it became possible to simulate almost every echo chamber effect by processing the signal digitally
because digital devices are able to simulate an almost limitless variety of real reverberant spaces as well as replicate the classic tape based echo effects physical echo chambers fell into disuse
however as noted above naturally reverberant spaces such as churches continue to be used as recording venues for classical and other forms of acoustic music
