a yawn is a reflex consisting of the simultaneous inhalation of air and the stretching of the eardrums followed by an exhalation of breath
many animal species including birds and fish experience yawning
the study of yawning is called chasmology
yawning oscitation most often occurs in adults immediately before and after sleep during tedious activities and as a result of its contagious quality
it is commonly associated with tiredness stress sleepiness boredom or even hunger
in humans yawning is often triggered by the perception that others are yawning for example seeing a person yawning or talking to someone on the phone who is yawning
this is a typical example of positive feedback
this contagious yawning has also been observed in chimpanzees dogs cats birds and reptiles and can occur between members of different species
approximately twenty psychological reasons for yawning have been proposed by scholars but there is little agreement on the primacy of any one
during a yawn muscles around the airway are fully stretched including chewing and swallowing muscles
due to these strong repositioning muscle movements the airway lungs and throat dilates to three or four times its original size
the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear contracts which creates a rumbling noise perceived as coming from within the head however the noise is due to mechanical disturbance of the hearing apparatus and is not generated by the motion of air
yawning is sometimes accompanied in humans and other animals by an instinctive act of stretching several parts of the body including the arms neck shoulders and back
english yawn continues a number of middle english forms
yanen from old english nian and yenen yonen from old english frequentatives inian ionian from a germanic root g n
the germanic root has indo european cognates from a root g h i
found also with n suffix in greek to yawn and without the n in english gap compare the figura etymologica in norse ginnunga gap gum palate and gasp via old norse latin hi hiatus and greek chasm chaos
the latin term used in medicine is oscitatio anglicized as oscitation from the verb oscito to open the mouth
pandiculation is the act of yawning and stretching simultaneously
there are a number of theories that attempt to explain why humans and other animals yawn
one study states that yawning occurs when one s blood contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide and therefore becomes in need of the influx of oxygen or expulsion of carbon dioxide that a yawn can provide
yawning may reduce oxygen intake compared to normal respiration however the frequency of yawning is not decreased by providing more oxygen or reducing carbon dioxide in the air
animals subject to predation or other dangers must be ready to physically exert themselves at any given moment
at least one study suggests that yawning especially psychological contagious yawning may have developed as a way of keeping a group of animals alert
if an animal is drowsy or bored it will be less alert than when fully awake and less prepared to spring into action
contagious yawning could be an instinctual signal between group members to stay alert
nervousness which often indicates the perception of an impending need for action has also been suggested as a cause
anecdotal evidence suggests that yawning helps increase a person s alertness
paratroopers have been noted to yawn during the moments before they exit their aircraft and athletes often yawn just before intense exertions
another notion states that yawning is the body s way of controlling brain temperature
in researchers including a professor of psychology from the suny albany us proposed yawning may be a means to keep the brain cool
mammalian brains operate best within a narrow temperature range
in two experiments subjects with cold packs attached to their foreheads and subjects asked to breathe strictly nasally exhibited reduced contagious yawning when watching videos of people yawning
a similar hypothesis suggests yawning is used for regulation of body temperature
similarly guttmann and dopart found that when a subject wearing earplugs yawns the air moving between the subject s ear and the environment causes a breeze to be heard
guttmann and dopart determined that a yawn causes one of three possible situations to occur the brain cools down due to an influx or outflux of oxygen pressure in the brain is reduced by an outflux of oxygen or the pressure of the brain is increased by an influx of air caused by increased cranial space
one review hypothesized that yawning s goal is to periodically stretch the muscles of the throat which may be important for efficient vocalization swallowing chewing and also keeping the airway wide
yawning behavior may be altered as a result of medical issues such as diabetes stroke or adrenal conditions
excessive yawning is seen in immunosuppressed patients such as those with multiple sclerosis
a professor of clinical and forensic neuropsychology at bournemouth university has demonstrated that cortisol levels rise during yawning
with respect to a possible evolutionary advantage yawning might be a herd instinct
theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood in gregarious animals similar to howling in a wolf pack
it signals fatigue among members of a group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods
research by garrett norris involving monitoring the behaviour of students kept waiting in a reception area indicates a connection supported by neuro imaging research between empathic ability and yawning
we believe that contagious yawning indicates empathy
it indicates an appreciation of other peoples behavioral and physiological state says norris
the yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious
in erasmus wrote one man s yawning makes another yawn and the french proverbialized the idea to un bon b illeur en fait b iller sept one good gaper makes seven others gape
often if one person yawns this may cause another person to empathetically yawn
observing another person s yawning face especially his her eyes reading or thinking about yawning or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn
the proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific same species and occasionally interspecific organisms activates the same regions in the brain
mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for imitation which lies at the root of much human learning such as language acquisition
yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse
a study found that young children with autism spectrum disorders do not increase their yawning frequency after seeing videos of other people yawning in contrast to neurotypical children
in fact the autistic children actually yawned less during the videos of yawning than during the control videos
the relationship between yawn contagion and empathy is strongly supported by a behavioural study conducted by ivan norscia and elisabetta palagi university of pisa italy
the study revealed that among other variables such as nationality gender and sensory modality only social bonding predicted the occurrence frequency and latency of yawn contagion
as with other measures of empathy the rate of contagion was found to be greatest in response to kin then friends then acquaintances and lastly strangers
related individuals r showed the greatest contagion in terms of both occurrence of yawning and frequency of yawns
strangers and acquaintances showed a longer delay in the yawn response latency compared to friends and kin
hence yawn contagion appears to be primarily driven by the emotional closeness between individuals
the social asymmetry in contagious yawning with contagious yawning being more frequent between familiar subjects than between strangers remains when only yawns that are heard but not seen are considered
this finding makes it unlikely that visual attentional biases are at the basis of the social asymmetry observed in contagious yawning
two classes of yawning have been observed among primates
in some cases the yawn is used as a threat gesture as a way of maintaining order in the primates social structure
specific studies were conducted on chimpanzees and stumptail macaques
a group of these animals was shown a video of other members of their own species yawning both species yawned as well
this helps to partly confirm a yawn s contagiousness
the discovery channel s show mythbusters also tested this concept
in their small scale informal study they concluded that yawning is contagious although elsewhere the statistical significance of this finding has been disputed
gordon gallup who hypothesizes that yawning may be a means of keeping the brain cool also hypothesizes that contagious yawning may be a survival instinct inherited from our evolutionary past
during human evolutionary history when we were subject to predation and attacks by other groups if everybody yawns in response to seeing someone yawn the whole group becomes much more vigilant and much better at being able to detect danger
a study by the university of london has suggested that the contagiousness of yawns by a human will pass to dogs
the study observed that of dogs yawned when a stranger yawned in front of them but did not yawn when the stranger only opened his mouth
helt and eigsti showed that dogs like humans develop a susceptibility to contagious yawning gradually and that while dogs above seven months catch yawns from humans younger dogs are immune to contagion
the study also indicated that nearly half of the dogs responded to the human s yawn by becoming relaxed and sleepy suggesting that the dogs copied not just the yawn but also the physical state that yawns typically reflect
in a study involving gelada baboons yawning was contagious between individuals especially those that were socially close
this suggests that emotional proximity rather than spatial proximity is an indicator of yawn contagion
evidence for the occurrence of contagious yawning linked to empathy is rare outside of primates
it has been studied in canidae species such as the domestic dog and wolf
domestic dogs have shown the ability to yawn contagiously in response to human yawns
domestic dogs have demonstrated they are skilled at reading human communication behaviours
this ability makes it difficult to ascertain whether yawn contagion among domestic dogs is deeply rooted in their evolutionary history or is a result of domestication
in a study wolves were observed in an effort to answer this question
the results of the study showed that wolves are capable of yawn contagion
this study also found that the social bond strength between individuals affected the frequency of contagious yawning in wolves supporting previous research which ties contagious yawning to emotional proximity
some evidence for contagious yawning has also been found in budgerigars melopsittacus undulatus a species of social parrots
this indicates that contagious yawning may have evolved several times in different lineages
in budgerigars contagious yawning does not seem to be related to social closeness
in certain neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism the patient has an impaired ability to infer the mental states of others
in such cases yawn contagion can be used to evaluate their ability to infer or empathize with others
autism spectrum disorder asd is a developmental disorder which severely affects social and communicative development including empathy
the results of various studies have showed a diminished susceptibility to contagious yawn compared to the control group of typically developing children
since atypical development of empathy is reported in autism spectrum disorder results support the claim that contagious yawning and the capacity of empathy share common neural and cognitive mechanisms
similarly patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia have shown an impaired ability to empathize with others
contagious yawning is one means of evaluating such disorders
the canadian psychiatrist heinz lehmann claimed that increases in yawning could predict recovery in schizophrenia
the impairment of contagious yawning can provide greater insight into its connection to the underlying causes of empathy
there is still substantial disagreement in the existing literature about whether or not yawn contagion is related to empathy at all
empathy is a notoriously difficult trait to measure and the literature on the subject is confused with the same species sometimes displaying a connection between contagious yawning and social closeness and sometimes apparently not
different experimenters typically use slightly different measures of empathy making comparisons between studies difficult and there may be a publication bias where studies which find a significant correlation between the two tested variables are more likely to be published than studies which do not
by revising in critical way the literature for and against yawn contagion as an empathy related phenomenon a review has shown that the social and emotional relevance of the stimulus based on who the yawner is can be related to the levels of yawn contagion as suggested by neurobiological ethological and psychological findings
therefore the discussion over the issue remains open
mammals birds and other vertebrates yawn
in animals yawning can serve as a warning signal
charles darwin s book the expression of the emotions in man and animals mentions that baboons yawn to threaten their enemies possibly by displaying large canine teeth
similarly siamese fighting fish yawn only when they see a conspecific same species or their own mirror image and their yawn often accompanies aggressive attack
guinea pigs also yawn in a display of dominance or anger displaying their impressive incisor teeth
this is often accompanied by teeth chattering purring and scent marking
adelie penguins employ yawning as part of their courtship ritual
penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an ecstatic display opening their beaks and pointing their faces skyward
this trait has also been seen among emperor penguins
researchers have been attempting to discover why these two different species share this trait despite not sharing a habitat
snakes yawn both to realign their jaws after a meal and for respiratory reasons as their trachea can be seen to expand when they do this
dogs and occasionally cats often yawn after seeing people yawn and when they feel uncertain
dogs demonstrate contagious yawning when exposed to human yawning
dogs are very adept at reading human communication actions so it is unclear if this phenomenon is rooted in evolutionary history or a result of domestication
fish can also yawn and they will increase this behavior when experiencing a lack of oxygen
socially contagious yawning has been observed in budgerigars and anecdotally when tired in other parrot species
some cultures lend yawning moral or spiritual significance
an open mouth has been associated with letting good immaterial things such as the soul escape or letting bad ones evil spirits enter and yawning may have been thought to increase these risks
covering the mouth when yawning may have been a way to prevent such transmission
exorcists believe yawning can indicate that a demon or possessive spirit is leaving its human host during the course of an exorcism
thus covering one s mouth has been conceived as a protective measure against this
yawning has also been described as disrespectful when done before others or improper when done alone
for example in his commentary on al bukhari s hadith collection ibn hajar an islamic theologian mentions that yawning in addition to its risks of letting demons enter or take hold of one s body is unbefitting for humans as it makes them look and sound like dogs by crooking men s upright posture and making them howl
superstitions regarding the act of yawning may have arisen from concerns over public health
polydore vergil c in his de rerum inventoribus writes that it was customary to make the sign of the cross over one s mouth since alike deadly plague was sometime in yawning wherefore men used to fence themselves with the sign of the cross
which custom we retain at this day
yawning is often perceived as implying boredom and yawning conspicuously in another s presence has historically been a faux pas
in francis hawkins advised in yawning howl not and thou shouldst abstain as much as thou can to yawn especially when thou speakest
george washington said if you cough sneeze sigh or yawn do it not loud but privately and speak not in your yawning but put your handkerchief or hand before your face and turn aside these customary beliefs persist in the modern age
one of mason cooley s aphorisms is a yawn is more disconcerting than a contradiction a loud yawn may even lead to penalties for contempt of court
