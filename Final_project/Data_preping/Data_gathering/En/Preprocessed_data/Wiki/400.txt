chi-squared test also chi-square test statistical hypothesis test valid perform test statistic chi-squared distributed null hypothesis specifically pearson's chi-squared test variant thereof
pearson's chi-squared test used determine whether statistically significant difference expected frequency observed frequency one category contingency table
standard application test observation classified mutually exclusive classes
null hypothesis difference class population true test statistic computed observation follows frequency distribution
purpose test evaluate likely observed frequency would assuming null hypothesis true
also test testing null hypothesis independence pair random variable based observation pairs
chi-squared test often refers test distribution test statistic approach distribution asymptotically meaning sampling distribution null hypothesis true test statistic approximates chi-squared distribution closely sample size increase
century statistical analytical method mainly applied biological data analysis wa customary researcher assume observation followed normal distribution sir george airy mansfield merriman whose work criticized karl pearson paper
end century pearson noticed existence significant skewness within biological observations
order model observation regardless normal skewed pearson series article published devised pearson distribution family continuous probability distribution includes normal distribution many skewed distribution proposed method statistical analysis consisting using pearson distribution model observation performing test goodness fit determine well model
pearson published paper test considered one foundation modern statistics
suppose n observation random sample population classified k mutually exclusive class respective observed number xi k null hypothesis give probability pi observation fall ith class
pearson proposed circumstance null hypothesis correct n limiting distribution quantity given distribution
pearson dealt first case expected number mi large enough known number cell assuming every xi may taken normally distributed reached result limit n becomes large x follows distribution k degree freedom
however pearson next considered case expected number depended parameter estimated sample suggested notation mi true expected number mi estimated expected number difference
conclusion pearson argued regarded x also distributed distribution k degree freedom error approximation would affect practical decisions
conclusion caused controversy practical application wa settled year fisher's papers
one test statistic follows chi-squared distribution exactly test variance normally distributed population ha given value based sample variance
test uncommon practice true variance population usually unknown
however several statistical test chi-squared distribution approximately valid
exact test used place chi-squared test independence see fisher's exact test
exact test used place chi-squared test goodness fit see binomial test
likelihood-ratio test general statistical modelling testing whether evidence need move simple model complicated one simple model nested within complicated oneusing chi-squared distribution interpret pearson's chi-squared statistic requires one assume discrete probability observed binomial frequency table approximated continuous chi-squared distribution
reduce error approximation frank yates suggested correction continuity adjusts formula pearson's chi-squared test subtracting absolute difference observed value expected value contingency table
sample size n taken population normal distribution result see distribution sample variance allows test made whether variance population ha pre-determined value
example manufacturing process might stable condition long period allowing value variance determined essentially without error
suppose variant process tested giving rise small sample n product item whose variation tested
test statistic instance could set sum square sample mean divided nominal value variance ie
example sample size acceptance region significance level and
suppose city resident four neighborhood b c d
random sample resident city taken occupation recorded white collar blue collar collar
null hypothesis person's neighborhood residence independent person's occupational classification
let u take sample living neighborhood estimate proportion whole live neighborhood a
assumption independence hypothesis expect number white-collar worker neighborhood be
null hypothesis sum ha approximately chi-squared distribution whose number degree freedom is
test statistic improbably large according chi-squared distribution one reject null hypothesis independence
suppose instead giving every resident four neighborhood equal chance inclusion sample decide advance many resident neighborhood include
resident ha chance chosen resident neighborhood resident different neighborhood would different probability chosen four sample size proportional population four neighborhoods
question whether proportion blue-collar white-collar no-collar worker four neighborhood same
cryptanalysis chi-squared test used compare distribution plaintext possibly decrypted ciphertext
lowest value test mean decryption wa successful high probability
bioinformatics chi-squared test used compare distribution certain property gene eg genomic content mutation rate interaction network clustering etc belonging different category eg disease gene essential gene gene certain chromosome etc
