Chen Yuan (Chinese: 陈元, born in January 1945) is a Chinese economist who served as the Chairman of the China Development Bank from March 1998 to April 2013
Chen Yuan then served as Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 2013 to 2018
He is the eldest son of former Vice Premier Chen Yun.
Chen Yuan graduated with a master's degree in Industrial Economics from the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, where he studied under the supervision of economists Yu Guangyuan and Ma Hong
He was appointed secretary of the Xicheng District Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and director-general of the Beijing Municipal Commerce and Trade Department in August 1982.
He assumed the post of deputy secretary of the leading party members' group and vice governor of the People's Bank of China in March 1988
Chen's leadership at the People's Bank of China was noteworthy
It was a time when China was just opening up trading with the West
Prior to 1988 when Chen joined PBOC, there were almost no international reserves
However, by 1992, as trade increased, the foreign reserves also started to grow as a result of the international trade to over US$10 billion
Thus, Chen was charged with helping to turn the People's Bank of China into a modern central bank
As one of the key things he did, he brought in outside advisors such as William Lawton, a noted fixed income and currency expert who was a Senior Vice President in charge of global fixed income at Trust Company of the West, a well known international asset management company headquartered in Los Angeles
Chen oversaw the implementation under Lawton's supervision of risk guidelines for the Bank, utilization of research models such as the Lawton Bond Model, and upgrading of the computer and trading systems
 It was under Chen's leadership and foresight that PBOC was put on a firm footing to become the world's largest central bank in a little over a decade.
He has been the Chairman of the China Finance 40 Forum (CF40) since its founding in 2008.
His father was Chen Yun, who was one of the Eight Elders of the Chinese Communist Party
In the 1980s and 1990s, Chen Yun was regarded as the second most powerful person in China after paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
