Since the station has been a considered a mouthpiece for the Fidesz KDNP coalition government After the station was sold by ProSiebenSat Media to the station's then managing directors Zsolt Simon and Yvonne Dederick with a loan of million forints to pay the station's debts opposition media began commenting that K roly Fony the owner of a company associated with Lajos Simicska a former pro Fidesz media mogul who by then was critical of the government's plan to impose an advertising tax to competitor RTL Klub resulting on a long term dispute was attempting to buy the station from both managing directors in exchange of the payment of the aforementioned million forints As a result Simon and Dederick began reorganising parent company MTM SBS Kft with both managers creating their respective holding companies namely D D Kft and CCA V zi Kft and later making a joint venture to manage the TV channels This joint venture later evolved into the current TV M dia Csoport Kft established by the merger of both holding companies in the summer of
At the same time Andy Vajna with the assistance of Prime Minister Viktor Orb n and state owned lender Eximbank began negotiating with Simon and Dederick for the acquisition of the TV M dia Csoport holding company This led to a high stakes acquisition process which eventually became sided in favour of Vajna On October Fony submitted its bid for the TV group of channels which was quickly followed by Vajna's bid for the broadcaster to which Simon and Dederick would succumb almost immediately Vajna quickly dismissed both executives being replaced by the former managing director of RTL Klub Dirk Gerkens dismissed from the channel after the heavy controversy caused by the aforementioned ad tax proposal The editorial team of the T nyek newscast was also fully replaced with Vivien Szalai the former editor in chief of the tabloid and pro government Story newsmagazine becoming the chief news director and N ra Kunfalvi former H r TV anchor becoming the station's lead anchor
After the Vajna takeover the TV group of channels rapidly grew from only four channels to channels Most of these channels launched within three months causing scepticism from many media insiders even declaring that this massive rollout would completely reshape the Hungarian media market Most of these new channels became focused on niche genres with a focus on local productions for example gastronomy and Hungarian cuisine movies music lifestyle and even cartoons That same year TV won nearly a fifth of state advertising spending four times more than RTL Klub according to the independent Hungarian watchdog M rt k Media Monitor
After Vajna's death J zsef Vida the chairman of savings bank Takar kbank took over the TV Group through his Abraham Goldmann Investment Trust Vida has a close relationship with pro Orb n businessman L rinc M sz ros After taking over the group Gerkens stepped down as CEO and Mikl s Vaszily took over in the same position He was later joined by French Bulgarian media professional Pavel Stanchev who has retained the station's political positions in favour of the government However he began to leverage the station's transition to a digital first environment by renaming the niche channels to make them more in line with the mother channel and launching a centralized streaming portal TV Play where alongside catch up programming previous programs and series can be watched
Vida also negotiated the station's expansion to other countries In October TV bought the Slovenian commercial network Planet TV from Telekom Slovenije The channel had suffered from financial problems and struggling ratings dating back to its launch in The merger generated heavy concerns about the station's independence as well as the increasing influence of pro Orb n businessmen in Slovenian media and its growing links with prime minister Janez Jan a
