A biography Charmed Life The Phenomenal World of Philip Sassoon by Damian Collins his successor as Member of Parliament for Hythe provides a great deal of additional information about Sassoon A summary by The Guardian includes this comment Sassoon enjoyed witty gossip but was never spiteful He spoke with a clipped sibilant lisp and liked to relax in a blue silk smoking jacket with slippers of zebra hide He had fickle moody fascinations with young men with whom he soon grew bored but was loyally appreciative of female friends and kept an inner court of elderly cultivated ironical bachelors His sexuality was central to his character and activities but there is never any hint of sexual activity in the many memories of him One hates to think that he was as sublimated as he sounds His restlessness and fatalism which were notorious among his friends killed him at the age of in although his physicians ordered bed rest after a viral infection he hurtled about in unnecessary gaieties until his body was beyond recovery Sassoon served as private secretary to Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig during the First World War from to Sassoon was present at the meeting on December at the Chateau Demont at Merville in France when King George V and Edward Prince of Wales met with Raymond Poincar President of France and the Generals Joseph Joffre Ferdinand Foch and Sir Henry Rawlinson The allies showed their determination to fight Germany and the Central Powers Because of his numerous social and political connections Sassoon at that time a second lieutenant in the Royal East Kent Yeomanry was in attendance A square bronze plaque commemorating the occasion was auctioned in
He was Unionist Member of Parliament MP for Hythe from succeeding his father initially as the Baby of the House As an MP he advocated aviation and bought his own aeroplane in In his role as undersecretary in the air ministry he promoted civilian air travel
Sassoon was Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Lloyd George in Between and and again from until he served as Under Secretary of State for Air and gained much prominence in political circles He was appointed a Privy Councillor in the Dissolution Honours In he became First Commissioner of Works a post which he held until his death aged fifty two years later
He idolised the Prince of Wales and supported the King during the abdication crisis of According to a review of the biography he wanted international peace at any cost and convinced himself that Hitler's promises were dependable
He had a reputation for being one of the greatest hosts in Britain Although he owned a house at Park Lane Sassoon arranged for Herbert Baker to design another home for him in Port Lympne in Kent Decades later it became the Port Lympne Wild Animal Park It was a unique building Italianate and Moorish in its influence built for a voluptuary of the senses who wanted his rooms to be a rapturous medley of strong exotic colours and filled with the luscious fragrance of flowers The formal grounds at Port Lympne were like a Hollywood version of Tuscany according to a summary of his biography
He also owned Trent Park and hired Philip Tilden to largely rebuild that mansion located in Cockfosters Stylistic differences between the two houses illustrate changes in taste among members of British high society of the period Trent Park possessed a landscape designed by Humphrey Repton but the existing house was Victorian and undistinguished Sassoon had the Victorian additions demolished or altered except for the west service wing between and The projecting wings were added to the entrance south front These modifications led to a large mansion in early Georgian style It became one of the houses of the age according to one report a dream of another world the white coated footmen serving endless courses of rich but delicious food the Duke of York coming in from golf Winston Churchill arguing over the teacups with George Bernard Shaw Lord Balfour dozing in an armchair Rex Whistler absorbed in his painting while Philip himself flitted from group to group an alert watchful influential but unobtrusive stage director all set against a background of mingled luxury simplicity and informality brilliantly contrived
This atmosphere as Clive Aslet has suggested represented a complete about face from Sassoon's earlier extravagance at Port Lympne to what Aslet called an appreciation of English reserve In the words of Christopher Hussey at Trent Sassoon caught that indefinable and elusive quality the spirit of a country house an essence of cool flowery chintzy elegant unobtrusive rooms that rises in the mind when we are thinking of country houses
Sassoon conducted excavations of Camlet Moat at Trent Park in the s and was reported to have found oak beams which formed the basis of a drawbridge Roman shoes and daggers as well as mosaic tiles depicting a knight mounted on a white horse The foundations of a large stone building were also found English Heritage refilled the excavations in
Neither the eye popping interiors nor the extravagant gardens at Port Lympne Mansion could be described as in any way reserved or even English In fact one reviewer of a bio about Sassoon described it as a sybaritic mansion Mark Girouard has written of the quiet good taste expected of a country gentleman against which Philip may have chafed in his younger years apparently torn between the standards of Country Life and Metro Goldwyn Mayer His Ballets Russes inspired dining room at Port Lympne with its lapis walls opalescent ceiling gilt winged chairs with jade green cushions all surmounted by a frieze of scantily clad Africans suggests the outsider confidence of a Rothschild and of an openly gay man
Philip Tilden added a bachelor's wing with Moorish courtyard which Lady Honor Channon wife of Chips unkindly likened to a Spanish brothel to accommodate young airmen from nearby Romney Marsh flying field among his other enthusiasms Sir Philip was himself an aviator and Tilden's twin swimming pools and monumentally classical garden staircase were in much the same theatrical spirit
One frequent guest was Lawrence of Arabia
As Secretary of State for Air Sassoon was Honorary Air Commodore of No County of London Squadron The squadron was nicknamed The Millionaires Squadron because it was reported to have six millionaire members In he was enthusiastic about the new Percival Gull monoplane and ordered his own model powered by a Napier Javelin six cylinder engine with the interior finished in red leather In this luxurious Gull Four G ACGR currently on display at the Brussels Military Museum he competed in the King s Cup and the Folkestone Aero Trophy Race He later became the owner of the first Percival Petrel two engine monoplane completed in As Under secretary of State for Air Sassoon carried out the first general inspection of British overseas air stations flying the Blackburn Iris Afterwards he wrote The Third Route published by Heinemann in recounting the story of the development of the air route from England to India

He was Chairman of the Trustees of the National Gallery from to and as Minister for Works in the s he was responsible for embellishing many of London's monuments and parks As a collector Philip Sassoon was like many of the Rothschilds drawn mainly to the English and French th century but he also collected contemporary artists such as John Singer Sargent and William Orpen A Mamuluk glass mosque lamp once belonging to Sassoon can be found in the collection of the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon Portugal
Sassoon was said to have lived an openly homosexual life According to a reviewer of a biography of Sassoon his personal life was something that he shut away from the world There was only a single intimate letter among his personal papers to Jack a travel companion The reviewer adds despite his many gay and bisexual friends away from 'bohemian circles' it was still a taboo subject homosexual acts were illegal Sassoon was consequently regarded as an enigmatic solitary figure Another reviewer offered that His sexuality was central to his character and activities but there is never any hint of sexual activity in the many memories of him
Sassoon died on June aged of complications from influenza He left an estate valued at equivalent to in on which death duty of close on was paid Hannah Gubbay the widow of David Gubbay was the main beneficiary inheriting Port Lympne Trent Park and an annuity of equivalent to in
After Sassoon's death he was described by his friend No l Coward as a phenomenon that would never recur According to biographer Damian Collins I think because he died just three months before the Second World War started he became part of that lost golden era war had closed a chapter on that
