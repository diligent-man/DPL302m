william whiston december august was an english theologian historian natural philosopher and mathematician a leading figure in the popularisation of the ideas of isaac newton
he is now probably best known for helping to instigate the longitude act in and his attempts to win the rewards that it promised and his important translations of the antiquities of the jews and other works by josephus which are still in print
he was a prominent exponent of arianism and wrote a new theory of the earth
whiston succeeded his mentor newton as lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge
in he lost the professorship and was expelled from the university as a result of his unorthodox religious views
whiston rejected the notion of eternal torment in hellfire which he viewed as absurd cruel and an insult to god
what especially pitted him against church authorities was his denial of the doctrine of the trinity which he believed had pagan origins
whiston was born to josiah whiston and katherine rosse at norton juxta twycross in leicestershire where his father was rector
his mother was daughter of the previous rector at norton juxta twycross gabriel rosse
josiah whiston was a presbyterian but retained his rectorship after the stuart restoration in
william whiston was educated privately for his health and so that he could act as amanuensis to his blind father
he studied at queen elizabeth grammar school at tamworth staffordshire
after his father s death he entered clare college cambridge as a sizar in
he applied himself to mathematical study was awarded the degree of bachelor of arts ba and am and was elected fellow in and probationary senior fellow in
william lloyd ordained whiston at lichfield in
in claiming ill health he resigned his tutorship at clare to richard laughton chaplain to john moore the bishop of norwich and swapped positions with him
he now divided his time between norwich cambridge and london
in moore gave him the living of lowestoft where he became rector
in he resigned his fellowship of clare college and left to marry
whiston first met isaac newton in and attended some of his lectures though he first found them by his own admission incomprehensible
encouraged after reading a paper by david gregory on newtonian philosophy he set out to master newton s principia mathematica thereafter
he and newton became friends
in whiston resigned his living to become isaac newton s substitute giving the lucasian lectures at cambridge
he succeeded newton as lucasian professor in
there followed a period of joint research with roger cotes appointed with whiston s patronage to the plumian professorship in
students at the cotes whiston experimental philosophy course included stephen hales william stukeley and joseph wasse
in whiston was boyle lecturer this lecture series was at the period a significant opportunity for newton s followers including richard bentley and samuel clarke to express their views especially in opposition to the rise of deism
the newtonian line came to include with bentley clarke and whiston in particular a defence of natural law by returning to the definition of augustine of hippo of a miracle a cause of human wonderment rather than the prevailing concept of a divine intervention against nature which went back to anselm
this move was intended to undermine arguments of deists and sceptics
the boyle lectures dwelt on the connections between biblical prophecies dramatic physical events such as floods and eclipses and their explanations in terms of science
on the other hand whiston was alive to possible connections of prophecy with current affairs the war of the spanish succession and later the jacobite rebellions
whiston supported a qualified biblical literalism the literal meaning should be the default unless there was a good reason to think otherwise
this view again went back to augustine
newton s attitude to the cosmogony of thomas burnet reflected on the language of the genesis creation narrative as did whiston s alternative cosmogony
moses as author of genesis was not necessarily writing as a natural philosopher nor as a law giver but for a particular audience
the new cosmogonies of burnet whiston and john woodward were all criticised for their disregard of the biblical account by john arbuthnot john edwards and william nicolson in particular
the title for whiston s boyle lectures was the accomplishment of scripture prophecies
rejecting typological interpretation of biblical prophecy he argued that the meaning of a prophecy must be unique
his views were later challenged by anthony collins
there was a more immediate attack by nicholas clagett in
one reason prophecy was topical was the camisard movement that saw french exiles french prophets in england
whiston had started writing on the millenarianism that was integral to the newtonian theology and wanted to distance his views from theirs and in particular from those of john lacy
meeting the french prophets in whiston developed the view that the charismatic gift of revelation could be demonic possession
it is no longer assumed that whiston s memoirs are completely trustworthy on the matter of his personal relations with newton
one view is that the relationship was never very close bentley being more involved in whiston s appointment to the lucasian chair and that it deteriorated as soon as whiston began to write on prophecy publishing essay on the revelation of st john
this work proclaimed the millennium for the year
whiston s edition of newton s arithmetica universalis did nothing to improve matters
newton himself was heavily if covertly involved in the edition nominally due to john machin making many changes
in whiston was engaging thomas tenison and john sharp as archbishops in debates on the trinity
there is evidence from hopton haynes that newton reacted by pulling back from publication on the issue his antitrinitarian views from the s were finally published in as an historical account of two notable corruptions of scripture
whiston was never a fellow of the royal society
in conversation with edmond halley he blamed his reputation as a heretick
also though he claimed newton had disliked having an independent minded disciple and was unnaturally cautious and suspicious by nature
whiston s route to rejection of the nicene creed the historical orthodox position against arianism began early in his tenure of the lucasian chair as he followed hints from samuel clarke
he read also in louis ellies dupin and the explication of gospel theism of richard brocklesby
his study of the apostolic constitutions then convinced him that arianism was the creed of the early church
the general election of brought the tories solid political power for a number of years up to the hanoverian succession of
their distrust of theological innovation had a direct impact on whiston as well as others of similar views
his heterodoxy was notorious
in he was deprived of his professorship and expelled from the university
the matter was not allowed to rest there whiston tried to get a hearing before convocation
he did have defenders even in the high church ranks such as george smalridge
for political reasons this development would have been divisive at the time
queen anne made a point of twice losing the papers in the case
after her death in the intended hearing was allowed to drop
the party passions of these years found an echo in henry sacheverell s attempt to exclude whiston from his church of st andrew s holborn taking place in
whiston founded a society for promoting primitive christianity lecturing in support of his theories in halls and coffee houses at london bath and tunbridge wells
those he involved included thomas chubb thomas emlyn john gale benjamin hoadley arthur onslow and thomas rundle
there were meetings at whiston s house from to hoadley avoided coming as did samuel clarke though invited
a meeting with clarke hoadley john craig and gilbert burnet the younger had left these leading latitudinarians unconvinced about whiston s reliance on the apostolical constitutions
franz wokenius wrote a latin work on whiston s view of primitive christianity
his challenge to the teachings of athanasius meant that whiston was commonly considered heretical on many points
on the other hand he was a firm believer in supernatural aspects of christianity
he defended prophecy and miracle
he supported anointing the sick and touching for the king s evil
his dislike of rationalism in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents of hoadley s plain account of the nature and end of the sacrament
he was fervent in his views of ecclesiastical government and discipline derived from the apostolical constitutions
around when his clergyman began to read the athanasian creed which whiston did not believe in he physically left the church and the anglican communion becoming a baptist
by the s some dissenters and early unitarians viewd whiston as a role model
whiston began lecturing on natural philosophy in london
he gave regular courses at coffee houses particularly button s and also at the censorium a set of riverside meeting rooms in london run by richard steele
at button s he gave courses of demonstration lectures on astronomical and physical phenomena and francis hauksbee the younger worked with him on experimental demonstrations
his passing remarks on religious topics were sometimes objected to for example by henry newman writing to steele
his lectures were often accompanied by publications
in he published with john senex a chart of the solar system showing numerous paths of comets
in he lectured on the total solar eclipse of may which fell in april old style in england whiston lectured on it at the time in covent garden and later as a natural event and as a portent
by whiston had also become adept at newspaper advertising
he frequently lectured to the royal society
in he was instrumental in the passing of the longitude act which established the board of longitude
in collaboration with humphrey ditton he published a new method for discovering the longitude both at sea and land which was widely referenced and discussed
for the next forty years he continued to propose a range of methods to solve the longitude reward which earned him widespread ridicule particularly from the group of writers known as the scriblerians
in one proposal for using magnetic dip to find longitude he produced one of the first isoclinic maps of southern england in and
in he proposed using the eclipses of jupiter s satellites
whiston s a new theory of the earth from its original to the consummation of all things was an articulation of creationism and flood geology
it held that the global flood of noah had been caused by a comet
the work obtained the praise of john locke who classed the author among those who if not adding much to our knowledge at least bring some new things to our thoughts he was an early advocate along with edmond halley of the periodicity of comets he also held that comets were responsible for past catastrophes in earth s history
in he caused widespread anxiety among london s citizens when he predicted the world would end on october that year because a comet would hit the earth
william wake as archbishop of canterbury officially denied this prediction to calm the public
there was no consensus within the newtonians as to how far mechanical causes could be held responsible for key events of sacred history john keill was at the opposite extreme to whiston in minimising such causes
as a natural philosopher whiston s speculations respected no boundary with his theological views
he saw the creation of man as an intervention in the natural order
he picked up on arthur ashley sykes s advice to samuel clarke to omit an eclipse and earthquake mentioned by phlegon of tralles from future editions of clarke s boyle lectures these events being possibly synchronous with christ s crucifixion
whiston published the testimony of phlegon vindicated in
the series of moyer lectures often made whiston s unorthodox views a particular target
whiston held that song of solomon was apocryphal and that the book of baruch was not
he modified the biblical ussher chronology setting the creation at bce
he challenged newton s system of the chronology of ancient kingdoms amended
westfall absolves whiston of the charge that he pushed for the posthumous publication of the chronology just to attack it commenting that the heirs were in any case looking to publish manuscripts of newton who died in
whiston s advocacy of clerical monogamy is referenced in oliver goldsmith s novel the vicar of wakefield
his last famous discovery or rather revival of dr giles fletcher the elder s which he mentions in his autobiography was the identification of the tatars with the lost tribes of israel
whiston married ruth daughter of george antrobus his headmaster at tamworth school
he had a happy family life and died in lyndon hall rutland at the home of his son in law samuel barker on august
he was survived by his children sarah william george and john
whiston s later life was spent in continual controversy theological mathematical chronological and miscellaneous
he vindicated his estimate of the apostolical constitutions and the arian views he had derived from them in his primitive christianity revived vols
in he produced a reformed liturgy
his life of samuel clarke appeared in
in he published a two volume work called authentik record belonging to the old and new testament
this was a collection of translations and essays on various deuterocanonical books pseudepigrapha and other essays with a translation if relevant
his translation of the works of josephus with notes and dissertations was often reprinted
the text on which whiston s translation of josephus works is based is reputedly one which had many errors in transcription
in he published his primitive new testament on the basis of codex bezae and codex claromontanus
whiston left memoirs vols
these do not contain the account of the proceedings taken against him at cambridge for his antitrinitarianism which was published separately at the time
