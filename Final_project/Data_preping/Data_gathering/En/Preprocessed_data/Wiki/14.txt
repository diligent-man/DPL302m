english is a west germanic language of the indo european language family originally spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval england
it is named after the angles one of the ancient germanic peoples that migrated from anglia a peninsula on the baltic sea not to be confused with east anglia in england to the area of great britain later named after them england
the closest living relatives of english include scots followed by the low saxon and frisian languages
while english is genealogically west germanic its vocabulary is also distinctively influenced by old norman french and latin as well as by old norse a north germanic language
speakers of english are called anglophones
the earliest forms of english collectively known as old english evolved from a group of west germanic ingvaeonic dialects brought to great britain by anglo saxon settlers in the th century and further mutated by norse speaking viking settlers starting in the th and th centuries
middle english began in the late th century after the norman conquest of england when considerable french especially old norman and latin derived vocabulary was incorporated into english over some three hundred years
early modern english began in the late th century with the start of the great vowel shift and the renaissance trend of borrowing further latin and greek words and roots into english concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to london
this era notably culminated in the king james bible and plays of william shakespeare
modern english has spread around the world since the th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the british empire and the united states of america
through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries english has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science navigation and law
modern english grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical indo european dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed subject verb object word order
modern english relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses aspect and mood as well as passive constructions interrogatives and some negation
english is the most spoken language in the world if chinese is divided into variants and the third most spoken native language in the world after standard chinese and spanish
it is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in sovereign states
there are more people who have learned english as a second language than there are native speakers
as of it was estimated that there were over billion speakers of english
english is the majority native language in the united kingdom the united states canada australia new zealand see anglosphere and the republic of ireland and is widely spoken in some areas of the caribbean africa south asia southeast asia and oceania
it is a co official language of the united nations the european union and many other world and regional international organisations
it is the most widely spoken germanic language accounting for at least of speakers of this indo european branch
there is much variability among the many accents and dialects of english used in different countries and regions in terms of phonetics and phonology and sometimes also vocabulary idioms grammar and spelling but it does not typically prevent understanding by speakers of other dialects and accents although mutual unintelligibility can occur at extreme ends of the dialect continuum
english is an indo european language and belongs to the west germanic group of the germanic languages
old english originated from a germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the frisian north sea coast whose languages gradually evolved into the anglic languages in the british isles and into the frisian languages and low german low saxon on the continent
the frisian languages which together with the anglic languages form the anglo frisian languages are the closest living relatives of english
low german low saxon is also closely related and sometimes english the frisian languages and low german are grouped together as the ingvaeonic north sea germanic languages though this grouping remains debated
old english evolved into middle english which in turn evolved into modern english
particular dialects of old and middle english also developed into a number of other anglic languages including scots and the extinct fingallian and forth and bargy yola dialects of ireland
like icelandic and faroese the development of english in the british isles isolated it from the continental germanic languages and influences and it has since diverged considerably
english is not mutually intelligible with any continental germanic language differing in vocabulary syntax and phonology although some of these such as dutch or frisian do show strong affinities with english especially with its earlier stages
unlike icelandic and faroese which were isolated the development of english was influenced by a long series of invasions of the british isles by other peoples and languages particularly old norse and norman french
these left a profound mark of their own on the language so that english shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either
some scholars have argued that english can be considered a mixed language or a creole a theory called the middle english creole hypothesis
although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of modern english is widely acknowledged most specialists in language contact do not consider english to be a true mixed language
english is classified as a germanic language because it shares innovations with other germanic languages such as dutch german and swedish
these shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called proto germanic
some shared features of germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes the use of modal verbs and the sound changes affecting proto indo european consonants known as grimm s and verner s laws
english is classified as an anglo frisian language because frisian and english share other features such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in proto germanic see phonological history of old english palatalization
the earliest form of english is called old english or anglo saxon c
old english developed from a set of west germanic dialects often grouped as anglo frisian or north sea germanic and originally spoken along the coasts of frisia lower saxony and southern jutland by germanic peoples known to the historical record as the angles saxons and jutes
from the th century the anglo saxons settled britain as the roman economy and administration collapsed
by the th century the germanic language of the anglo saxons became dominant in britain replacing the languages of roman britain common brittonic a celtic language and latin brought to britain by the roman occupation
england and english originally nglaland and nglisc are named after the angles
old english was divided into four dialects the anglian dialects mercian and northumbrian and the saxon dialects kentish and west saxon
through the educational reforms of king alfred in the th century and the influence of the kingdom of wessex the west saxon dialect became the standard written variety
the epic poem beowulf is written in west saxon and the earliest english poem c dmon s hymn is written in northumbrian
modern english developed mainly from mercian but the scots language developed from northumbrian
a few short inscriptions from the early period of old english were written using a runic script
by the th century a latin alphabet was adopted written with half uncial letterforms
it included the runic letters wynn and thorn and the modified latin letters eth and ash
old english is essentially a distinct language from modern english and is virtually impossible for st century unstudied english speakers to understand
its grammar was similar to that of modern german and its closest relative is old frisian
nouns adjectives pronouns and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms and word order was much freer than in modern english
modern english has case forms in pronouns he him his and has a few verb inflections speak speaks speaking spoke spoken but old english had case endings in nouns as well and verbs had more person and number endings
the translation of matthew from shows examples of case endings nominative plural accusative plural genitive singular and a verb ending present plural
foxas habba holu and heofonan fuglas nest
fox as habb a hol u and heofon an fugl as nest
fox nom pl have prs pl hole acc pl and heaven gen sg bird nom pl nest acc pl
foxes have holes and the birds of heaven nests from the th to the th century old english gradually transformed through language contact into middle english
middle english is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of england by william the conqueror in but it developed further in the period from to
first the waves of norse colonisation of northern parts of the british isles in the th and th centuries put old english into intense contact with old norse a north germanic language
norse influence was strongest in the north eastern varieties of old english spoken in the danelaw area around york which was the centre of norse colonisation today these features are still particularly present in scots and northern english
however the centre of norsified english seems to have been in the midlands around lindsey and after ce when lindsey was reincorporated into the anglo saxon polity norse features spread from there into english varieties that had not been in direct contact with norse speakers
an element of norse influence that persists in all english varieties today is the group of pronouns beginning with th they them their which replaced the anglo saxon pronouns with h hie him hera
with the norman conquest of england in the now norsified old english language was subject to contact with old french in particular with the old norman dialect
the norman language in england eventually developed into anglo norman
because norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles while the lower classes continued speaking anglo saxon english the main influence of norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics legislation and prestigious social domains
middle english also greatly simplified the inflectional system probably in order to reconcile old norse and old english which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar
the distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns the instrumental case was dropped and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession
the inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms and gradually simplified the system of agreement making word order less flexible
in the wycliffe bible of the s the verse matthew was written foxis han dennes and briddis of heuene han nestis here the plural suffix n on the verb have is still retained but none of the case endings on the nouns are present
by the th century middle english was fully developed integrating both norse and french features it continued to be spoken until the transition to early modern english around
middle english literature includes geoffrey chaucer s the canterbury tales and malory s le morte d arthur
in the middle english period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as chaucer
the next period in the history of english was early modern english
early modern english was characterised by the great vowel shift inflectional simplification and linguistic standardisation
the great vowel shift affected the stressed long vowels of middle english
it was a chain shift meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system
mid and open vowels were raised and close vowels were broken into diphthongs
for example the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today
the great vowel shift explains many irregularities in spelling since english retains many spellings from middle english and it also explains why english vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages
english began to rise in prestige relative to norman french during the reign of henry v
around the court of chancery in westminster began using english in its official documents and a new standard form of middle english known as chancery standard developed from the dialects of london and the east midlands
in william caxton introduced the printing press to england and began publishing the first printed books in london expanding the influence of this form of english
literature from the early modern period includes the works of william shakespeare and the translation of the bible commissioned by king james i
even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from modern english for example the consonant clusters kn n sw in knight gnat and sword were still pronounced
many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of early modern english
in the king james version of the bible written in early modern english matthew says the foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests this exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure replacement with subject verb object word order and the use of of instead of the non possessive genitive and the introduction of loanwords from french ayre and word replacements bird originally meaning nestling had replaced oe fugol
by the late th century the british empire had spread english through its colonies and geopolitical dominance
commerce science and technology diplomacy art and formal education all contributed to english becoming the first truly global language
english also facilitated worldwide international communication
england continued to form new colonies and these later developed their own norms for speech and writing
english was adopted in parts of north america parts of africa australasia and many other regions
when they obtained political independence some of the newly independent nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using english as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others
in the th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the united states and its status as a superpower following the second world war has along with worldwide broadcasting in english by the bbc and other broadcasters caused the language to spread across the planet much faster
in the st century english is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been
as modern english developed explicit norms for standard usage were published and spread through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications
in samuel johnson published his a dictionary of the english language which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms
in noah webster published the american dictionary of the english language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing american english that was independent of the british standard
within britain non standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes
in modern english the loss of grammatical case is almost complete it is now only found in pronouns such as he and him she and her who and whom and svo word order is mostly fixed
some changes such as the use of do support have become universalised
earlier english did not use the word do as a general auxiliary as modern english does at first it was only used in question constructions and even then was not obligatory
now do support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised the use of progressive forms in ing appears to be spreading to new constructions and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common
regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues e g
dreamed instead of dreamt and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common e g
more polite instead of politer
british english is also undergoing change under the influence of american english fuelled by the strong presence of american english in the media and the prestige associated with the us as a world power
as of million people spoke english as their first language and billion spoke it as a secondary language
english is the largest language by number of speakers
english is spoken by communities on every continent and on islands in all the major oceans
the countries where english is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how english is used in each country
the inner circle countries with many native speakers of english share an international standard of written english and jointly influence speech norms for english around the world
english does not belong to just one country and it does not belong solely to descendants of english settlers
english is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of english
it has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world
the indian linguist braj kachru distinguished countries where english is spoken with a three circles model
in his model
the inner circle countries have large communities of native speakers of english
outer circle countries have small communities of native speakers of english but widespread use of english as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes and
expanding circle countries are countries where many people learn english as a foreign language kachru based his model on the history of how english spread in different countries how users acquire english and the range of uses english has in each country
the three circles change membership over time
countries with large communities of native speakers of english the inner circle include britain the united states australia canada ireland and new zealand where the majority speaks english and south africa where a significant minority speaks english
the countries with the most native english speakers are in descending order the united states at least million the united kingdom million canada million australia at least million south africa million ireland million and new zealand million
in these countries children of native speakers learn english from their parents and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn english to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces
the inner circle countries provide the base from which english spreads to other countries in the world
estimates of the numbers of second language and foreign language english speakers vary greatly from million to more than billion depending on how proficiency is defined
linguist david crystal estimates that non native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of to
in kachru s three circles model the outer circle countries are countries such as the philippines jamaica india pakistan singapore malaysia and nigeria with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of english but much use of english as a second language for education government or domestic business and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government
those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an english based creole to a more standard version of english
they have many more speakers of english who acquire english as they grow up through day to day use and listening to broadcasting especially if they attend schools where english is the medium of instruction
varieties of english learned by non native speakers born to english speaking parents may be influenced especially in their grammar by the other languages spoken by those learners
most of those varieties of english include words little used by native speakers of english in the inner circle countries and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner circle varieties as well
the standard english of the inner circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of english in the outer circle countries
in the three circles model countries such as poland china brazil germany japan indonesia egypt and other countries where english is taught as a foreign language make up the expanding circle
the distinctions between english as a first language as a second language and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time
for example in the netherlands and some other countries of europe knowledge of english as a second language is nearly universal with over percent of the population able to use it and thus english is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education
in these countries although english is not used for government business its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the outer circle and expanding circle
english is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of english as a second or foreign language
many users of english in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle so that interaction with native speakers of english plays no part in their decision to use the language
non native varieties of english are widely used for international communication and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties
very often today a conversation in english anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of english at all even while including speakers from several different countries
this is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences
english is a pluricentric language which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language
spoken english for example english used in broadcasting generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation
international broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written english
the norms of standard written english are maintained purely by the consensus of educated english speakers around the world without any oversight by any government or international organisation
american listeners generally readily understand most british broadcasting and british listeners readily understand most american broadcasting
most english speakers around the world can understand radio programmes television programmes and films from many parts of the english speaking world
both standard and non standard varieties of english can include both formal or informal styles distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non technical registers
the settlement history of the english speaking inner circle countries outside britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of english in south africa australia and new zealand
the majority of immigrants to the united states without british ancestry rapidly adopted english after arrival
now the majority of the united states population are monolingual english speakers and english has been given official or co official status by of the state governments as well as all five territorial governments of the us though there has never been an official language at the federal level
english has ceased to be an english language in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically english
use of english is growing country by country internally and for international communication
most people learn english for practical rather than ideological reasons
many speakers of english in africa have become part of an afro saxon language community that unites africans from different countries
as decolonisation proceeded throughout the british empire in the s and s former colonies often did not reject english but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies
for example the view of the english language among many indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress and english continues to be an official language of india
english is also widely used in media and literature and the number of english language books published annually in india is the third largest in the world after the us and uk
however english is rarely spoken as a first language numbering only around a couple hundred thousand people and less than of the population speak fluent english in india
david crystal claimed in that combining native and non native speakers india now has more people who speak or understand english than any other country in the world but the number of english speakers in india is very uncertain with most scholars concluding that the united states still has more speakers of english than india
modern english sometimes described as the first global lingua franca is also regarded as the first world language
english is the world s most widely used language in newspaper publishing book publishing international telecommunications scientific publishing international trade mass entertainment and diplomacy
english is by international treaty the basis for the required controlled natural languages seaspeak and airspeak used as international languages of seafaring and aviation
english used to have parity with french and german in scientific research but now it dominates that field
it achieved parity with french as a language of diplomacy at the treaty of versailles negotiations in
by the time of the foundation of the united nations at the end of world war ii english had become pre eminent and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations
it is one of six official languages of the united nations
many other worldwide international organisations including the international olympic committee specify english as a working language or official language of the organisation
many regional international organisations such as the european free trade association association of southeast asian nations asean and asia pacific economic cooperation apec set english as their organisation s sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native english speakers
while the european union eu allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the union in practice english is the main working language of eu organisations
although in most countries english is not an official language it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language
in the countries of the eu english is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty five member states where it is not an official language that is the countries other than ireland and malta
in a official eurobarometer poll conducted when the uk was still a member of the eu percent of the eu respondents outside the countries where english is an official language said they could speak english well enough to have a conversation in that language
the next most commonly mentioned foreign language french which is the most widely known foreign language in the uk and ireland could be used in conversation by percent of respondents a working knowledge of english has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine and computing
english has become so important in scientific publishing that more than percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by chemical abstracts in were written in english as were percent of all articles in natural science publications by and percent of articles in humanities publications by
international communities such as international business people may use english as an auxiliary language with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest
this has led some scholars to develop the study of english as an auxiliary language
the trademarked globish uses a relatively small subset of english vocabulary about words designed to represent the highest use in international business english in combination with the standard english grammar
other examples include simple english
the increased use of the english language globally has had an effect on other languages leading to some english words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages
this influence of english has led to concerns about language death and to claims of linguistic imperialism and has provoked resistance to the spread of english however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that english provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives
although some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of english dialects into mutually unintelligible languages most think a more likely outcome is that english will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world
english is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world
thus english has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language including esperanto
the phonetics and phonology of the english language differ from one dialect to another usually without interfering with mutual communication
phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes i e
speech sounds that distinguish meaning and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes
this overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the united kingdom and the united states received pronunciation rp and general american ga
see dialects accents and varieties below
the phonetic symbols used below are from the international phonetic alphabet ipa
most english dialects share the same consonant phonemes
the consonant inventory shown below is valid for california english and for rp
conventionally transcribed r
in the table when obstruents stops affricates and fricatives appear in pairs such as p b t d and s z the first is fortis strong and the second is lenis weak
fortis obstruents such as p t s are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants such as b d z and are always voiceless
lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances and fully voiced between vowels
fortis stops such as p have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects they are aspirated p when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable often unaspirated in other cases and often unreleased p or pre glottalised p at the end of a syllable
in a single syllable word a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel phonetically but not phonemically than nib n b see below
lenis stops bin b n about ba t nib n b
fortis stops pin p n spin sp n happy h pi nip n p or n p in rp the lateral approximant l has two main allophones pronunciation variants the clear or plain l as in light and the dark or velarised as in full
ga has dark l in most cases
clear l rp light la t
dark l rp and ga full f ga light a t all sonorants liquids l r and nasals m n devoice when following a voiceless obstruent and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word
voiceless sonorants clay kl e snow rp sn ga sn o
syllabic sonorants paddle pad l button b t n the pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker s accent
the table below lists the vowel phonemes in received pronunciation rp and general american ga with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists
the vowels are represented with symbols from the international phonetic alphabet those given for rp are standard in british dictionaries and other publications
in rp vowel length is phonemic long vowels are marked with a triangular colon in the table above such as the vowel of need ni d as opposed to bid b d
in ga vowel length is non distinctive
in both rp and ga vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable like t t f but not before lenis consonants like d d v or in open syllables thus the vowels of rich r t neat nit and safe se f are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge r d need ni d and save se v and the vowel of light la t is shorter than that of lie la
because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis
the vowel only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem final positions
some dialects do not contrast and in unstressed positions so that rabbit and abbot rhyme and lenin and lennon are homophonous a dialect feature called weak vowel merger
ga r and r are realised as an r coloured vowel as in further f phonemically f r r which in rp is realised as f phonemically f
an english syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound
syllable onset and coda start and end are optional
a syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds as in sprint spr nt and end with up to five as in for some dialects angsts a ksts
this gives an english syllable the following structure ccc v ccccc where c represents a consonant and v a vowel the word strengths str k s is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in english
the consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted as is the order in which they may appear
onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters a stop and approximant as in play a voiceless fricative and approximant as in fly or sly s and a voiceless stop as in stay and s a voiceless stop and an approximant as in string
clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas
clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited
furthermore several consonants have limited distributions h can only occur in syllable initial position and only in syllable final position
stress plays an important role in english
certain syllables are stressed while others are unstressed
stress is a combination of duration intensity vowel quality and sometimes changes in pitch
stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not
some words primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non stressed position within a sentence
stress in english is phonemic and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress
for instance the word contract is stressed on the first syllable k ntr kt kon trakt when used as a noun but on the last syllable k n tr kt k n trakt for most meanings for example reduce in size when used as a verb
here stress is connected to vowel reduction in the noun contract the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel but in the verb contract the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to
stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases so that a compound word receives a single stress unit but the corresponding phrase has two e g
a burnout b rna t versus to burn out b rn a t and a hotdog h td versus a hot dog h t d
in terms of rhythm english is generally described as a stress timed language meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal
stressed syllables are pronounced longer but unstressed syllables syllables between stresses are shortened
vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality vowel reduction
varieties of english vary the most in pronunciation of vowels
the best known national varieties used as standards for education in non english speaking countries are british bre and american ame
countries such as canada australia ireland new zealand and south africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally
some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table varieties of standard english and their features
english has undergone many historical sound changes some of them affecting all varieties and others affecting only a few
most standard varieties are affected by the great vowel shift which changed the pronunciation of long vowels but a few dialects have slightly different results
in north america a number of chain shifts such as the northern cities vowel shift and canadian shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents
some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties
some conservative varieties like scottish english have a voiceless sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced w in wine but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced w a dialect feature called wine whine merger
the unvoiced velar fricative sound x is found in scottish english which distinguishes loch l x from lock l k
accents like cockney with h dropping lack the glottal fricative h and dialects with th stopping and th fronting like african american vernacular and estuary english do not have the dental fricatives but replace them with dental or alveolar stops t d or labiodental fricatives f v
other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod dropping yod coalescence and reduction of consonant clusters
general american and received pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical r after a vowel at the end of a syllable in the syllable coda
ga is a rhotic dialect meaning that it pronounces r at the end of a syllable but rp is non rhotic meaning that it loses r in that position
english dialects are classified as rhotic or non rhotic depending on whether they elide r like rp or keep it like ga
there is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels
these four vowels are only distinguished in rp australia new zealand and south africa
in ga these vowels merge to three and in canadian english they merge to two
in addition the words that have each vowel vary by dialect
the table dialects and open vowels shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur
as is typical of an indo european language english follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment
unlike other indo european languages though english has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions
only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class
english distinguishes at least seven major word classes verbs nouns adjectives adverbs determiners including articles prepositions and conjunctions
some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators and add the class of interjections
english also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs such as have and do expressing the categories of mood and aspect
questions are marked by do support wh movement fronting of question words beginning with wh and word order inversion with some verbs
some traits typical of germanic languages persist in english such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut i e
changing the vowel of the stem as in the pairs speak spoke and foot feet and weak stems inflected through affixation such as love loved hand hands
vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system he him who whom and in the inflection of the copula verb to be
the seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence
english nouns are only inflected for number and possession
new nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding
they are semantically divided into proper nouns names and common nouns
common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns
most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix s but a few nouns have irregular plural forms
mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier e g
one loaf of bread two loaves of bread
regular plural formation
singular cat dog
plural cats dogsirregular plural formation
singular man woman foot fish ox knife mouse
plural men women feet fish oxen knives micepossession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic s also traditionally called a genitive suffix or by the preposition of
historically the s possessive has been used for animate nouns whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns
today this distinction is less clear and many speakers use s also with inanimates
orthographically the possessive s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe
if the noun is plural formed with s the apostrophe follows the s
possessive constructions
with s the woman s husband s child
with of the child of the husband of the womannouns can form noun phrases nps where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners quantifiers conjunctions or adjectives
noun phrases can be short such as the man composed only of a determiner and a noun
they can also include modifiers such as adjectives e g
red tall all and specifiers such as determiners e g
the that
but they can also tie together several nouns into a single long np using conjunctions such as and or prepositions such as with e g
the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles this np uses conjunctions prepositions specifiers and modifiers
regardless of length an np functions as a syntactic unit
for example the possessive enclitic can in cases which do not lead to ambiguity follow the entire noun phrase as in the president of india s wife where the enclitic follows india and not president
the class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one
a definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known
quantifiers which include one many some and all are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number
the noun must agree with the number of the determiner e g
one man sg but all men pl
determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase
adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents
in english adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners
in modern english adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify as adjectives in most other indo european languages do
for example in the phrases the slender boy and many slender girls the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun
some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison with the positive degree unmarked the suffix er marking the comparative and est marking the superlative a small boy the boy is smaller than the girl that boy is the smallest
some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms such as good better and best
other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions with the adverb more marking the comparative and most marking the superlative happier or more happy the happiest or most happy
there is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form
english pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection
the personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons i me he him she her we us they them as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular distinguishing it from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular distinguishing between she her feminine they them neuter and he him masculine
the subjective case corresponds to the old english nominative case and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case for a patient or direct object of a transitive verb and of the old english dative case for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb
the subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause otherwise the objective is used
while grammarians such as henry sweet and otto jespersen noted that the english cases did not correspond to the traditional latin based system some contemporary grammars for example huddleston pullum retain traditional labels for the cases calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively
possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun as in my chair while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun e g
the chair is mine
the english system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address the old second person singular familiar pronoun thou acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned
both the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular
plural and singular are always identical you your yours in the second person except in the reflexive form yourself yourselves in most dialects
some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns such as y all found in southern american english and african american vernacular english youse found in australian english or ye in hiberno english
in the third person the they them series of pronouns they them their theirs themselves are used in both plural and singular and are the only pronouns available for the plural
in the singular the they them series sometimes with the addition of the singular specific reflexive form themself serve as a gender neutral set of pronouns alongside the feminine she her series and the masculine he him series pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically
a deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation for example the pronoun i identifies the speaker and the pronoun you the addressee
anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience for example in the sentence i already told you that
the reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase e g
he sent it to himself or she braced herself for impact
prepositional phrases pp are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns e g
with the dog for my friend to school in england
prepositions have a wide range of uses in english
they are used to describe movement place and other relations between different entities but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs
for example in the phrase i gave it to him the preposition to marks the recipient or indirect object of the verb to give
traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form with her to me for us
but some contemporary grammars such as that of huddleston pullum no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases
english verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present tense third person singular subject
only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects
auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive past or progressive forms
they form complex tenses aspects and moods
auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence
most verbs have six inflectional forms
the primary forms are a plain present a third person singular present and a preterite past form
the secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive a gerund participle and a past participle
the copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject
the first person present tense form is am the third person singular form is is and the form are is used in the second person singular and all three plurals
the only verb past participle is been and its gerund participle is being
english has two primary tenses past preterite and non past
the preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb which for the regular verbs includes the suffix ed and for the strong verbs either the suffix t or a change in the stem vowel
the non past form is unmarked except in the third person singular which takes the suffix s
english does not have future verb forms
the future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall
many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to going to future
further aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs primarily have and be which show the contrast between a perfect and non perfect past tense i have run vs
i was running and compound tenses such as preterite perfect i had been running and present perfect i have been running
for the expression of mood english uses a number of modal auxiliaries such as can may will shall and the past tense forms could might would should
there are also subjunctive and imperative moods both based on the plain form of the verb i e
without the third person singular s for use in subordinate clauses e g
subjunctive it is important that he run every day imperative run
an infinitive form that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause
finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form
in clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause
for example he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive or in a complement clause such as i saw him leave where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form and leave is in the infinitive
english also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb
the phrase then functions as a single predicate
in terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb but in writing it is written as a separate word
examples of phrasal verbs are to get up to ask out to back up to give up to get together to hang out to put up with etc
the phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement e g
lay off meaning terminate someone s employment
in spite of the idiomatic meaning some grammarians including huddleston pullum do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term phrasal verb
instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement i e
he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent
the function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs
many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix ly
for example in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly is derived in this way from the adjective quick
some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms such as good which has the adverbial form well
modern english syntax language is moderately analytic
it has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning
auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions negative polarity the passive voice and progressive aspect
english word order has moved from the germanic verb second v word order to being almost exclusively subject verb object svo
the combination of svo order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence such as he had hoped to try to open it
in most sentences english only marks grammatical relations through word order
the subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it
the example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb
an exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun in which case it is doubly marked both by word order and by case inflection where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form
the example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun
indirect objects io of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction s v io o such as i gave jane the book or in a prepositional phrase such as i gave the book to jane
in english a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases e g
noun phrases verb phrases and prepositional phrases
a clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents such as any nps and pps
within a sentence there is always at least one main clause or matrix clause whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause
subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause
for example in the phrase i think that you are lying the main clause is headed by the verb think the subject is i but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause that you are lying
the subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause but it is often omitted
relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause for example in the sentence i saw the letter that you received today the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter the object of the main clause
relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who whose whom and which as well as by that which can also be omitted in contrast to many other germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses
english syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense aspect and mood
auxiliary verbs form main clauses and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb
for example in the sentence the dog did not find its bone the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not
subject auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions including focus negation and interrogative constructions
the verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences where it usually serves to add emphasis as in i did shut the fridge however in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above it is used because the rules of english syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present
modern english does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb as in i know not it can only be added to an auxiliary or copular verb hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required the auxiliary do is used to produce a form like i do not don t know
the same applies in clauses requiring inversion including most questions inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb so it is not possible to say know you him grammatical rules require do you know him
negation is done with the adverb not which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb
a contracted form of not n t can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be
just as with questions many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do support thus in modern english i don t know him is the correct answer to the question do you know him but not i know him not although this construction may be found in older english
passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs
a passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase
they are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get although not all varieties of english allow the use of passives with get
for example putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen by her or he gets seen by her
both yes no questions and wh questions in english are mostly formed using subject auxiliary inversion am i going tomorrow where can we eat which may require do support do you like her where did he go
in most cases interrogative words wh words e g
what who where when why how appear in a fronted position
for example in the question what did you see the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence
when the wh word is the subject or forms part of the subject no inversion occurs who saw the cat prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question s theme e g
to whose house did you go last night
the personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case with the variant whom serving as the objective case form although this form may be going out of use in many contexts
while english is a subject prominent language at the discourse level it tends to use a topic comment structure where the known information topic precedes the new information comment
because of the strict svo syntax the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence
in cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means
one way of doing this is through a passive construction the girl was stung by the bee
another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there e g
it was the girl that the bee stung there was a girl who was stung by a bee
dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs e g it is raining or in existential clauses there are many cars on the street
through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects english is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a svo syntax
focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent
for example the girl was stung by a bee emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her or the girl was stung by a bee contrasting with another possibility for example that it was the boy
topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause
for example that girl over there she was stung by a bee emphasises the girl by preposition but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition she was stung by a bee that girl over there where reference to the girl is established as an afterthought
cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora e g
that is exactly what i mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event
discourse markers such as oh so or well also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion
discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences
discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said for example no way is that true the idiomatic marker no way expressing disbelief or boy i m hungry the marker boy expressing emphasis
while discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of english they are also used in written and formal registers
it is generally stated that english has around words or if obsolete words are counted this estimate is based on the last full edition of the oxford english dictionary from
over half of these words are nouns a quarter adjectives and a seventh verbs
there is one count that puts the english vocabulary at about million words but that count presumably includes words such as latin species names scientific terminology botanical terms prefixed and suffixed words jargon foreign words of extremely limited english use and technical acronyms
due to its status as an international language english adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources
early studies of english vocabulary by lexicographers the scholars who formally study vocabulary compile dictionaries or both were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good quality linguistic corpora collections of actual written texts and spoken passages
many statements published before the end of the th century about the growth of english vocabulary over time the dates of first use of various words in english and the sources of english vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available
english forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes
one of the most productive processes in english is conversion using a word with a different grammatical role for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun
another productive word formation process is nominal compounding producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick
a process more common in old english than in modern english but still productive in modern english is the use of derivational suffixes hood ness ing ility to derive new words from existing words especially those of germanic origin or stems especially for words of latin or greek origin
formation of new words called neologisms based on greek and or latin roots for example television or optometry is a highly productive process in english and in most modern european languages so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated
for this reason lexicographer philip gove attributed many such words to the international scientific vocabulary isv when compiling webster s third new international dictionary
another active word formation process in english are acronyms words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases e g
nato laser
english besides forming new words from existing words and their roots also borrows words from other languages
this adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages but english has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last years
the most commonly used words in english are west germanic
the words in english learned first by children as they learn to speak particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts are mainly the germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of old english
but one of the consequences of long language contact between french and english in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of english has a very high percentage of latinate words derived from french especially and also from other romance languages and latin
french words from various periods of the development of french now make up one third of the vocabulary of english
linguist anthony lacoudre estimated that over english words are of french origin and may be understood without orthographical change by french speakers
words of old norse origin have entered the english language primarily from the contact between old norse and old english during colonisation of eastern and northern england
many of these words are part of english core vocabulary such as egg and knife
english has also borrowed many words directly from latin the ancestor of the romance languages during all stages of its development
many of these words had earlier been borrowed into latin from greek
latin or greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences philosophy and mathematics
english continues to gain new loanwords and calques loan translations from languages all over the world and words from languages other than the ancestral anglo saxon language make up about of the vocabulary of english
english has formal and informal speech registers informal registers including child directed speech tend to be made up predominantly of words of anglo saxon origin while the percentage of vocabulary that is of latinate origin is higher in legal scientific and academic texts
english has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages
the influence of english comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the english language the role of english as a world lingua franca and the large number of books and films that are translated from english into other languages
that pervasive use of english leads to a conclusion in many places that english is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies
among varieties of english it is especially american english that influences other languages
some languages such as chinese write words borrowed from english mostly as calques while others such as japanese readily take in english loanwords written in sound indicating script
dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of english influence on languages in europe
since the ninth century english has been written in a latin alphabet also called roman alphabet
earlier old english texts in anglo saxon runes are only short inscriptions
the great majority of literary works in old english that survive to today are written in the roman alphabet
the modern english alphabet contains letters of the latin script a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z which also have capital forms a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
the spelling system or orthography of english is multi layered and complex with elements of french latin and greek spelling on top of the native germanic system
further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace
compared to european languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms english has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced
there are also systematic spelling differences between british and american english
these situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in english
although letters and speech sounds do not have a one to one correspondence in standard english spelling spelling rules that take into account syllable structure phonetic changes in derived words and word accent are reliable for most english words
moreover standard english spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling for example the words photograph photography and photographic or the words electricity and electrical
while few scholars agree with chomsky and halle that conventional english orthography is near optimal there is a rationale for current english spelling patterns
the standard orthography of english is the most widely used writing system in the world
standard english spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word
readers of english can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds
the letters b d f h j k l m n p r s t v w y z represent respectively the phonemes b d f h d k l m n p r s t v w j z
the letters c and g normally represent k and but there is also a soft c pronounced s and a soft g pronounced d
the differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard english spelling
digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for t sh for th for or ng for qu for kw and ph for f in greek derived words
the single letter x is generally pronounced as z in word initial position and as ks otherwise
there are exceptions to these generalisations often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of modern english to follow the spelling patterns of latin for english words of germanic origin
for the vowel sounds of the english language however correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular
there are many more vowel phonemes in english than there are single vowel letters a e i o u w y
as a result some long vowels are often indicated by combinations of letters like the oa in boat the ow in how and the ay in stay or the historically based silent e as in note and cake
the consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in english
it can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of english than of many other languages including italian spanish and german
nonetheless there is an advantage for learners of english reading in learning the specific sound symbol regularities that occur in the standard english spellings of commonly used words
such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in english
making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in english may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write english
english writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world
the purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud
dialectologists identify many english dialects which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar vocabulary and pronunciation
the pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents
the major native dialects of english are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of british english bre and north american english nae
there also exists a third common major grouping of english varieties southern hemisphere english the most prominent being australian and new zealand english
since the english language first evolved in britain and ireland the archipelago is home to the most diverse dialects particularly in england
within the united kingdom the received pronunciation rp an educated dialect of south east england is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the british dialects
the spread of rp also known as bbc english through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural england to recede as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects
at the time of the survey of english dialects grammar and vocabulary differed across the country but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary and in fact only percent of the english population actually speak rp the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of rp influence
there is also variability within rp particularly along class lines between upper and middle class rp speakers and between native rp speakers and speakers who adopt rp later in life
within britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class and some traits though exceedingly common are considered non standard and are associated with lower class speakers and identities
an example of this is h dropping which was historically a feature of lower class london english particularly cockney and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of england yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of british society english in england can be divided into four major dialect regions southwest english south east english midlands english and northern english
within each of these regions several local subdialects exist within the northern region there is a division between the yorkshire dialects and the geordie dialect spoken in northumbria around newcastle and the lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in liverpool scouse and manchester mancunian
having been the centre of danish occupation during the viking invasions northern english dialects particularly the yorkshire dialect retain norse features not found in other english varieties
since the th century southeastern england varieties have centred on london which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects
in london the cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes and it was long a socially stigmatised variety
the spread of cockney features across the south east led the media to talk of estuary english as a new dialect but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that london had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history
traits that have spread from london in recent decades include the use of intrusive r drawing is pronounced drawring dr r t glottalisation potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as po er po and the pronunciation of th as f thanks pronounced fanks or v bother pronounced bover
scots is today considered a separate language from english but it has its origins in early northern middle english and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources particularly scots gaelic and old norse
scots itself has a number of regional dialects
and in addition to scots scottish english comprises the varieties of standard english spoken in scotland most varieties are northern english accents with some influence from scots
in ireland various forms of english have been spoken since the norman invasions of the th century
in county wexford in the area surrounding dublin two extinct dialects known as forth and bargy and fingallian developed as offshoots from early middle english and were spoken until the th century
modern irish english however has its roots in english colonisation in the th century
today irish english is divided into ulster english the northern ireland dialect with strong influence from scots and various dialects of the republic of ireland
like scottish and most north american accents almost all irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by rp
north american english is fairly homogeneous compared to british english
today american accent variation is often increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level though most americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents known collectively as general american ga with differences hardly noticed even among americans themselves such as midland and western american english
in most american and canadian english dialects rhoticity or r fulness is dominant with non rhoticity r dropping becoming associated with lower prestige and social class especially after world war ii this contrasts with the situation in england where non rhoticity has become the standard
separate from ga are american dialects with clearly distinct sound systems historically including southern american english english of the coastal northeast famously including eastern new england english and new york city english and african american vernacular english all of which are historically non rhotic
canadian english except for the atlantic provinces and perhaps quebec may be classified under ga as well but it often shows the raising of the vowels a and a before voiceless consonants as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation standards
in southern american english the most populous american accent group outside of ga rhoticity now strongly prevails replacing the region s historical non rhotic prestige
southern accents are colloquially described as a drawl or twang being recognised most readily by the southern vowel shift initiated by glide deleting in the a vowel e g
pronouncing spy almost like spa the southern breaking of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables e g
pronouncing the word press almost like pray us the pin pen merger and other distinctive phonological grammatical and lexical features many of which are actually recent developments of the th century or later
today spoken primarily by working and middle class african americans african american vernacular english aave is also largely non rhotic and likely originated among enslaved africans and african americans influenced primarily by the non rhotic non standard older southern dialects
a minority of linguists contrarily propose that aave mostly traces back to african languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or creole english to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins
aave s important commonalities with southern accents suggests it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the th or early th century
aave is commonly stigmatised in north america as a form of broken or uneducated english as are white southern accents but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of english with their own norms shared by a large speech community
since english has been spoken in oceania and australian english has developed as a first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the australian continent its standard accent being general australian
the english of neighbouring new zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language
australian and new zealand english are each other s closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics followed by south african english and the english of southeastern england all of which have similarly non rhotic accents aside from some accents in the south island of new zealand
australian and new zealand english stand out for their innovative vowels many short vowels are fronted or raised whereas many long vowels have diphthongised
australian english also has a contrast between long and short vowels not found in most other varieties
australian english grammar aligns closely to british and american english like american english collective plural subjects take on a singular verb as in the government is rather than are
new zealand english uses front vowels that are often even higher than in australian english
the first significant exposure of the philippines to the english language occurred in when the british occupied manila during the seven years war but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence
english later became more important and widespread during american rule between and and remains an official language of the philippines
today the use of english is ubiquitous in the philippines from street signs and marquees government documents and forms courtrooms the media and entertainment industries the business sector and other aspects of daily life
one such usage that is also prominent in the country is in speech where most filipinos from manila would use or have been exposed to taglish a form of code switching between tagalog and english
a similar code switching method is used by urban native speakers of visayan languages called bislish
english is spoken widely in southern africa and is an official or co official language in several countries
in south africa english has been spoken since co existing with afrikaans and various african languages such as the khoe and bantu languages
today about percent of the south african population speaks south african english sae as a first language
sae is a non rhotic variety which tends to follow rp as a norm
it is alone among non rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r
there are different l varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers
most phonological differences from rp are in the vowels
consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce p t t k without aspiration e g
pin pronounced p n rather than as p n as in most other varieties while r is often pronounced as a flap instead of as the more common fricative
nigerian english is a dialect of english spoken in nigeria
it is based on british english but in recent years because of influence from the united states some words of american english origin have made it into nigerian english
additionally some new words and collocations have emerged from the language which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation e g

several varieties of english are also spoken in the caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of britain including jamaica and the leeward and windward islands and trinidad and tobago barbados the cayman islands and belize
each of these areas is home both to a local variety of english and a local english based creole combining english and african languages
the most prominent varieties are jamaican english and jamaican creole
in central america english based creoles are spoken in on the caribbean coasts of nicaragua and panama
locals are often fluent both in the local english variety and the local creole languages and code switching between them is frequent indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between creole and standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the creole forms serving as basilect and the more rp like forms serving as the acrolect the most formal register
most caribbean varieties are based on british english and consequently most are non rhotic except for formal styles of jamaican english which are often rhotic
jamaican english differs from rp in its vowel inventory which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in standard english
the diphthongs ei and ou are monophthongs e and o or even the reverse diphthongs ie and uo e g
bay and boat pronounced b e and b o t
often word final consonant clusters are simplified so that child is pronounced t ail and wind win
as a historical legacy indian english tends to take rp as its ideal and how well this ideal is realised in an individual s speech reflects class distinctions among indian english speakers
indian english accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as t and d often pronounced with retroflex articulation as and and the replacement of and with dentals t and d
sometimes indian english speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent h found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an indian voiced aspirated stop
