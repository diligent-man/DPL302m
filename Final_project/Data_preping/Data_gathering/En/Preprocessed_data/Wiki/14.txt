english verb inflected tense aspect marked agreement present-tense third-person singular subject
copula verb still inflected agreement plural first second person subjects
auxiliary verb paired verb infinitive past progressive forms
auxiliary verb differ verb followed negation occur first constituent question sentence
primary form plain present third-person singular present preterite past form
secondary form plain form used infinitive gerund-participle past participle
copula verb verb retain original conjugation take different inflectional form depending subject
first-person present-tense form third person singular form form used second-person singular three plurals
english ha two primary tense past preterite non-past
preterite inflected using preterite form verb regular verb includes suffix ed strong verb either suffix change stem vowel
non-past form unmarked except third person singular take suffix s
future tense expressed periphrastically one auxiliary verb shall
many variety also use near future constructed phrasal verb going going-to future
aspectual distinction shown auxiliary verb primarily show contrast perfect non-perfect past tense run vs
wa running compound tense preterite perfect running present perfect running
expression mood english us number modal auxiliary may shall past tense form could might would should
also subjunctive imperative mood based plain form verb ie
without third person singular use subordinate clause eg
infinitive form us plain form verb preposition used verbal clause syntactically subordinate finite verbal clause
finite verbal clause formed around verb present preterite form
clause auxiliary verb finite verb main verb treated subordinate clause
example ha go auxiliary verb inflected time main verb go infinitive complement clause saw leave main verb see preterite form leave infinitive
english also make frequent use construction traditionally called phrasal verb verb phrase made verb root preposition particle follows verb
term intonation preposition fused verb writing written separate word
example phrasal verb get ask back give get together hang put etc
phrasal verb frequently ha highly idiomatic meaning specialised restricted simply extrapolated combination verb preposition complement eg
spite idiomatic meaning grammarian including huddleston pullum consider type construction form syntactic constituent hence refrain using term phrasal verb
instead consider construction simply verb prepositional phrase syntactic complement ie
function adverb modify action event described verb providing additional information manner occurs
example phrase woman walked quickly adverb quickly derived way adjective quick
commonly used adjective irregular adverbial form good ha adverbial form well
ha developed feature modal verb word order resource conveying meaning
auxiliary verb mark construction question negative polarity passive voice progressive aspect
english word order ha moved germanic verb-second v word order almost exclusively subject-verb-object svo
combination svo order use auxiliary verb often creates cluster two verb centre sentence hoped try open it
subject constituent precedes verb object constituent follows it
example demonstrates grammatical role constituent marked position relative verb
exception found sentence one constituent pronoun case doubly marked word order case inflection subject pronoun precedes verb take subjective case form object pronoun follows verb take objective case form
example demonstrates double marking sentence object subject represented third person singular masculine pronoun
indirect object io ditransitive verb placed either first object double object construction v io gave jane book prepositional phrase gave book jane
english sentence may composed one clause may turn composed one phrase eg
clause built around verb includes constituent np pps
within sentence always least one main clause matrix clause whereas clause subordinate main clause
subordinate clause may function argument verb main clause
example phrase think lying main clause headed verb think subject object phrase subordinate clause lying
subordinating conjunction show clause follows subordinate clause often omitted
relative clause clause function modifier specifier constituent main clause example sentence saw letter received today relative clause received today specifies meaning word letter object main clause
relative clause introduced pronoun whose well also omitted contrast many germanic language major difference word order main subordinate clauses
english syntax relies auxiliary verb many function including expression tense aspect mood
auxiliary verb form main clause main verb function head subordinate clause auxiliary verb
example sentence dog find bone clause find bone complement negated verb not
subject-auxiliary inversion used many construction including focus negation interrogative constructions
verb used auxiliary even simple declarative sentence usually serf add emphasis shut fridge however negated inverted clause referred used rule english syntax permit construction auxiliary present
modern english doe allow addition negating adverb ordinary finite lexical verb know notit added auxiliary copular verb hence auxiliary present negation required auxiliary used produce form like know
applies clause requiring inversion including questionsinversion must involve subject auxiliary verb possible say know grammatical rule require know him
negation done adverb precedes main verb follows auxiliary verb
contracted form n't used enclitic attaching auxiliary verb copula verb be
question many negative construction require negation occur do-support thus modern english know correct answer question know know although construction may found older english
passive construction rephrases active construction way object active phrase becomes subject passive phrase subject active phrase either omitted demoted role oblique argument introduced prepositional phrase
formed using past participle either auxiliary verb get although variety english allow use passive get
example putting sentence see passive becomes seen get seen her
yes-no question wh-questions english mostly formed using subject-auxiliary inversion going tomorrow eat may require do-support like go
example question see word appears first constituent despite grammatical object sentence
wh-word subject form part subject inversion occurs saw cat prepositional phrase also fronted question's theme eg
personal interrogative pronoun interrogative pronoun still show inflection case variant serving objective case form although form may going use many contexts
english subject-prominent language discourse level tends use topic-comment structure known information topic precedes new information comment
strict svo syntax topic sentence generally ha grammatical subject sentence
case topic grammatical subject sentence often promoted subject position syntactic means
one way passive construction girl wa stung bee
another way cleft sentence main clause demoted complement clause copula sentence dummy subject eg
wa girl bee stung wa girl wa stung bee
dummy subject also used construction grammatical subject impersonal verb eg raining existential clause many car street
use complex sentence construction informationally vacuous subject english able maintain topic-comment sentence structure svo syntax
focus construction emphasise particular piece new salient information within sentence generally allocating main sentence level stress focal constituent
example girl wa stung bee emphasising wa bee example wasp stung girl wa stung bee contrasting another possibility example wa boy
topic focus also established syntactic dislocation either preposing postposing item focused relative main clause
example girl wa stung bee emphasis girl preposition similar effect could achieved postposition wa stung bee girl reference girl established afterthought
cohesion sentence achieved use deictic pronoun anaphora eg
exactly mean refers fact known interlocutor used locate time narrated event relative time previously narrated event
discourse marker oh well also signal progression idea sentence help create cohesion
discourse marker also used stance taking speaker position specific attitude towards said example way true idiomatic marker way expressing disbelief boy i'm hungry marker boy expressing emphasis
discourse marker particularly characteristic informal spoken register english also used written formal registers
