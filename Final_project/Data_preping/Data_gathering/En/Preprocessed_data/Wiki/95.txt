Sněžka was one of the first European mountains visited by many tourists This was mainly due to the relatively minor technical difficulties of the ascent and the fact that since the sixteenth century many resort visitors flocked to the nearby Cieplice Śląskie Zdrój and the highly visible Sněžka visually dominant over all Giant Mountains was for them an important attraction
The first historical account of an ascent to the peak is in by an unknown Venetian merchant searching for precious stones The first settlements on the mountain soon appeared being primarily mining communities tapping into its deposits of copper iron and arsenic The mining shafts totalling kilometres mi in length remain to this day
The first recorded German name was Riseberg giant mountain cf Riesengebirge Giant Mountains mentioned by Georg Agricola in Fifteen years later the name Riesenberg appears on Martin Helwig's map of Silesia The German name later changed to Riesenkoppe giant top and finally to Schneekoppe snow top snowy head
In Czech the mountain was initially called Pahrbek Sněžný snow hill later Sněžka with the eventual name Sněžovka meaning snowy or snow covered which was adopted in An older Polish name for the mountain was Góra Olbrzymia meaning giant mountain
The first building on the mountaintop was the Chapel of Saint Lawrence Laurentiuskapelle built c by the Silesian noble Schaffgotsch family to mark their dominion serving also as an inn for a brief period of time The territory including the mines were the property of the Schaffgotsch family until The so called Prussian hut Preußische Baude was built on the Silesian now Polish side in followed by the Bohemian hut Česká bouda on the Bohemian now Czech side in both built with the purpose of providing lodging The Prussian hut was rebuilt twice after fires and and the after Polish hut was finally demolished in The Bohemian hut fell into disrepair after and was demolished in
A wooden weather station was built on the mountaintop in c being the only weather station in Central Europe remaining intact after World War II It was demolished in the s
One side of the mountain is in the Czech Republic the other belongs to Poland The area is very popular in summer with tourists from the Czech Republic Poland and Germany who enjoy hiking in the alpine environment unique to this area
On the Polish side a disc shaped observatory with a weather station and restaurant was built in and the St Lawrence Chapel On the Czech side are a post office and a chairlift station connecting the peak with the town of Pec pod Sněžkou at the base of the mountain
Although the mountain is the highest natural peak in the Czech Republic the actual highest point is the top of the television transmitter on Praděd reaching metres + m If the Polish observatory is taken into account Sněžka peaks at metres
In a new post office and observation platform replaced an old post office and the remains of the Bohemian hut which had been closed since the s
In March the Polish observatory suffered serious damage to the upper disc as a result of extreme weather and structural failure The upper disc's floor broke though a fast response from the Technical University of Wrocław saved the remaining disc from taking any further damage The restaurant and meteo offices were reopened soon after the construction team had finished clearing the debris and securing what was left of the observatory After detailed inspection it was determined that no further damage should occur and the building was restored to its previous state The upper disc was restored to its design with contemporary improvements skipping certain improvements made in s and s which were suspected to contribute to the structural failure of March
The old chairlift to the top of Sněžka was replaced by a new cable car system Since February the four person cabins in two sections have carried visitors per hour from Pec pod Sněžkou
There are many marked tourist routes from the Polish side to the summit mainly from the town of Karpacz It is possible to take a chairlift from Karpacz to Kopa m asl which significantly shortens the way to the summit
