sn ka was one of the first european mountains visited by many tourists
this was mainly due to the relatively minor technical difficulties of the ascent and the fact that since the sixteenth century many resort visitors flocked to the nearby cieplice l skie zdr j and the highly visible sn ka visually dominant over all giant mountains was for them an important attraction
the first historical account of an ascent to the peak is in by an unknown venetian merchant searching for precious stones
the first settlements on the mountain soon appeared being primarily mining communities tapping into its deposits of copper iron and arsenic
the mining shafts totalling kilometres mi in length remain to this day
the first recorded german name was riseberg giant mountain cf
riesengebirge giant mountains mentioned by georg agricola in
fifteen years later the name riesenberg appears on martin helwig s map of silesia

by the silesian noble schaffgotsch family to mark their dominion serving also as an inn for a brief period of time
the territory including the mines were the property of the schaffgotsch family until
the so called prussian hut preu ische baude was built on the silesian now polish side in followed by the bohemian hut esk bouda on the bohemian now czech side in both built with the purpose of providing lodging

in march the polish observatory suffered serious damage to the upper disc as a result of extreme weather and structural failure
the upper disc s floor broke though a fast response from the technical university of wroc aw saved the remaining disc from taking any further damage
the restaurant and meteo offices were reopened soon after the construction team had finished clearing the debris and securing what was left of the observatory
after detailed inspection it was determined that no further damage should occur and the building was restored to its previous state
the upper disc was restored to its design with contemporary improvements skipping certain improvements made in s and s which were suspected to contribute to the structural failure of march
the old chairlift to the top of sn ka was replaced by a new cable car system
since february the four person cabins in two sections have carried visitors per hour from pec pod sn kou
