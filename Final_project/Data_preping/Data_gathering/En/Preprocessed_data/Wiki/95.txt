The first historical account of an ascent to the peak is in by an unknown Venetian merchant searching for precious stones The first settlements on the mountain soon appeared being primarily mining communities tapping into its deposits of copper iron and arsenic The mining shafts totalling kilometres mi in length remain to this day

In March the Polish observatory suffered serious damage to the upper disc as a result of extreme weather and structural failure The upper disc's floor broke though a fast response from the Technical University of Wroc aw saved the remaining disc from taking any further damage The restaurant and meteo offices were reopened soon after the construction team had finished clearing the debris and securing what was left of the observatory After detailed inspection it was determined that no further damage should occur and the building was restored to its previous state The upper disc was restored to its design with contemporary improvements skipping certain improvements made in s and s which were suspected to contribute to the structural failure of March
The old chairlift to the top of Sn ka was replaced by a new cable car system Since February the four person cabins in two sections have carried visitors per hour from Pec pod Sn kou
