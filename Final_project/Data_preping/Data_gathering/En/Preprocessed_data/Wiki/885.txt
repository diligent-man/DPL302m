The Thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing Although the word thoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed Thoroughbreds are considered hot blooded horses that are known for their agility speed and spirit
The Thoroughbred as it is known today was developed in th and th century England when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian Barb and Turkoman breeding All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the th and th centuries and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding During the th and th centuries the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world they were imported into North America starting in and into Australia Europe Japan and South America during the th century Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today and around foals are registered each year worldwide
Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing but are also bred for other riding disciplines such as show jumping combined training dressage polo and fox hunting They are also commonly crossbred to create new breeds or to improve existing ones and have been influential in the creation of the Quarter Horse Standardbred Anglo Arabian and various warmblood breeds
Thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion which has resulted in high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs Other health concerns include low fertility abnormally small hearts and a small hoof to body mass ratio There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed and research on the subject is ongoing
The typical Thoroughbred ranges from to hands to inches to cm high averaging hands inches cm They are most often bay dark bay or brown chestnut black or gray Less common colors recognized in the United States include roan and palomino White is very rare but is a recognized color separate from gray The face and lower legs may be marked with white but white will generally not appear on the body Coat patterns that have more than one color on the body such as Pinto or Appaloosa are not recognized by mainstream breed registries Good quality Thoroughbreds have a well chiseled head on a long neck high withers a deep chest a short back good depth of hindquarters a lean body and long legs Thoroughbreds are classified among the hot blooded breeds which are animals bred for agility and speed and are generally considered spirited and bold
Thoroughbreds born in the Northern Hemisphere are officially considered a year older on the first of January each year those born in the Southern Hemisphere officially are one year older on the first of August These artificial dates have been set to enable the standardization of races and other competitions for horses in certain age groupsThe Thoroughbred is a distinct breed of horse although people sometimes refer to a purebred horse of any breed as a thoroughbred The term for any horse or other animal derived from a single breed line is purebred While the term probably came into general use because the English Thoroughbred's General Stud Book was one of the first breed registries created in modern usage horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any animal as a thoroughbred except for horses belonging to the Thoroughbred breed Nonetheless breeders of other species of purebred animals may use the two terms interchangeably though thoroughbred is less often used for describing purebred animals of other species The term is a proper noun referring to this specific breed though often not capitalized especially in non specialist publications and outside the US For example the Australian Stud Book The New York Times and the BBC do not capitalize the word
Flat racing existed in England by at least when four mile races took place at Smithfield in London Racing continued at fairs and markets throughout the Middle Ages and into the reign of King James I of England It was then that handicapping a system of adding weight to attempt to equalize a horse's chances of winning as well as improved training procedures began to be used During the reigns of Charles II William III Anne and George I the foundation of the Thoroughbred was laid The term thro bred to describe horses was first used in
Under Charles II a keen racegoer and owner and Anne royal support was given to racing and the breeding of race horses With royal support horse racing became popular with the public and by a newspaper devoted to racing the Racing Calendar was founded Devoted exclusively to the sport it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets
All modern Thoroughbreds trace back to three stallions imported into England from the Middle East in the late th and early th centuries the Byerley Turk s the Darley Arabian and the Godolphin Arabian Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed These included the Alcock's Arabian D'Arcy's White Turk Leedes Arabian and Curwen's Bay Barb Another was the Brownlow Turk who among other attributes is thought to be largely responsible for the gray coat color in Thoroughbreds In all about stallions of Oriental breeding have been traced in the historical record as contributing to the creation of the Thoroughbred The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines whether Arabian Barb or Turk to the native English mares ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book GSB in and the practice of official registration of horses According to Peter Willett about of the foundation stallions appear to have been of Arabian bloodlines with the remainder being evenly divided between Turkoman and Barb breeding
Each of the three major foundation sires was coincidentally the ancestor of a grandson or great great grandson who was the only male descendant to perpetuate each respective horse's male line Matchem was the only descendant of his grandsire the Godolphin Arabian to maintain a male line to the present the Byerley Turk's male line was preserved by Herod or King Herod a great great grandson and the male line of the Darley Arabian owes its existence to great great grandson Eclipse who was the dominant racehorse of his day and never defeated One genetic study indicates that of all male Thoroughbreds trace their direct male line via the Y chromosome to the Darley Arabian
However in modern Thoroughbred pedigrees most horses have more crosses to the Godolphin Arabian than to the Darley Arabian when all lines of descent maternal and paternal are considered Further as a percentage of contributions to current Thoroughbred bloodlines Curwen's Bay Barb appears more often than the Byerley Turk The majority of modern Thoroughbreds alive today trace to a total of only or stallions from the th and th centuries
The mares used as foundation breeding stock came from a variety of breeds some of which such as the Irish Hobby had developed in northern Europe prior to the th century Other mares were of oriental breeding including Barb Turk and other bloodlines although most researchers conclude that the number of Eastern mares imported into England during the years after was small The th century researcher Bruce Lowe identified mare families in the Thoroughbred breed later augmented by other researchers to However it is probable that fewer genetically unique mare lines existed than Lowe identified Recent studies of the mtDNA of Thoroughbred mares indicate that some of the mare lines thought to be genetically distinct may actually have had a common ancestor in mare lines studied the haplotypes revealed that they traced to only unique foundation mares suggesting either a common ancestor for foundation mares thought to be unrelated or recording errors in the GSB
By the end of the th century the English Classic races had been established These are the St Leger Stakes founded in The Oaks founded in and The Derby in Later the Guineas Stakes and the Guineas Stakes were founded in and The Guineas and the Oaks are restricted to fillies but the others are open to racehorses of either sex aged three years The distances of these races ranging from one mile km to miles km led to a change in breeding practices as breeders concentrated on producing horses that could race at a younger age than in the past and that had more speed In the early th century the emphasis had been on longer races up to miles km that were run in multiple heats The older style of race favored older horses but with the change in distances younger horses became preferred
Selective breeding for speed and racing ability led to improvements in the size of horses and winning times by the middle of the th century Bay Middleton a winner of the Epsom Derby stood over hands high a full hand higher than the Darley Arabian Winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible This was borne out in when a race was held between a Thoroughbred Iambic considered a mid grade runner and the best Arabian of the time Asil The race was over miles m and although Iambic was handicapped by carrying stone kg lb more than Asil he still managed to beat Asil by lengths The improvement of the breed for racing in this way was said by noted th century racing writer Nimrod to have created the noblest animal in the creation
An aspect of the modern British breeding establishment is that they breed not only for flat racing but also for steeplechasing Up until the end of the th century Thoroughbreds were bred not only for racing but also as saddle horses
Soon after the start of the th century fears that the English races would be overrun with American bred Thoroughbreds because of the closing of US racetracks in the early s led to the Jersey Act of It prohibited the registration of any horse in the General Stud Book GSB if they could not show that every ancestor traced to the GSB This excluded most American bred horses because the year gap between the founding of the GSB and the American Stud Book meant that most American bred horses possessed at least one or two crosses to horses not registered in the GSB The act was not repealed until after which a horse was only required to show that all its ancestors to the ninth generation were registered in a recognized Stud Book Many felt that the Jersey Act hampered the development of the British Thoroughbred by preventing breeders in the United Kingdom from using new bloodlines developed outside the British Isles
The first Thoroughbred horse in the American Colonies was Bulle Rock imported in Maryland and Virginia were the centers of Colonial Thoroughbred breeding along with South Carolina and New York During the American Revolution importations of horses from England practically stopped but were restarted after the signing of a peace treaty Two important stallions were imported around the time of the Revolution Messenger in and Diomed before that Messenger left little impact on the American Thoroughbred but is considered a foundation sire of the Standardbred breed Diomed who won the Derby Stakes in had a significant impact on American Thoroughbred breeding mainly through his son Sir Archy John F Wall a racing historian said that Sir Archy was the first outstanding stallion we can claim as native American He was retired from the racetrack because of lack of opponents
After the American Revolution the center of Thoroughbred breeding and racing in the United States moved west Kentucky and Tennessee became significant centers Andrew Jackson later President of the United States was a breeder and racer of Thoroughbreds in Tennessee Match races held in the early th century helped to popularize horse racing in the United States One took place in in Long Island New York between Sir Henry and American Eclipse Another was a match race between Boston and Fashion in that featured bets of from each side The last major match races before the American Civil War were both between Lexington and Lecompte The first was held in in New Orleans and was won by Lecompte Lexington's owner then challenged Lecompte's owner to a rematch held in in New Orleans and won by Lexington Both of these horses were sons of Boston a descendant of Sir Archy Lexington went on to a career as a breeding stallion and led the sires list of number of winners for sixteen years fourteen of them in a row
After the American Civil War the emphasis in American racing changed from the older style of four mile km races in which the horses ran in at least two heats The new style of racing involved shorter races not run in heats over distances from five furlongs up to miles km This development meant a change in breeding practices as well as the age that horses were raced with younger horses and sprinters coming to the fore It was also after the Civil War that the American Thoroughbred returned to England to race Iroquois became the first American bred winner of the Epsom Derby in The success of American bred Thoroughbreds in England led to the Jersey Act in which limited the importation of American Thoroughbreds into England After World War I the breeders in America continued to emphasize speed and early racing age but also imported horses from England and this trend continued past World War II After World War II Thoroughbred breeding remained centered in Kentucky but California New York and Florida also emerged as important racing and breeding centers
Thoroughbreds in the United States have historically been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds The early import Messenger was the foundation of the Standardbred and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental in the development of the American Quarter Horse The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred Between World War I and World War II the US Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their Remount Service which was designed to improve the stock of cavalry mounts
Thoroughbreds began to be imported to France in and with the importation of a number of stallions from England but initially the sport of horse racing did not prosper in France The first Jockey Club in France was not formed until and in the racing and regulation functions were split off to a new society the Société d'Encouragement pour l'Amélioration des Races de Chevaux en France better known as the Jockey Club de Paris The French Stud Book was founded at the same time by the government By French bred Thoroughbreds were regularly winning races in England and in that year a French breeder owner earned the most money in England on the track World War I almost destroyed French breeding because of war damage and lack of races After the war the premier French race the Grand Prix resumed and continues to this day During World War II French Thoroughbred breeding did not suffer as it had during the first World War and thus was able to compete on an equal footing with other countries after the war
Organized racing in Italy started in when race meets were established in Florence and Naples and a meet in Milan was founded in Modern flat racing came to Rome in Later importations including the Derby Stakes winners Ellington and Melton came to Italy before the end of the th century Modern Thoroughbred breeding in Italy is mostly associated with the breeding program of Federico Tesio who started his breeding program in Tesio was the breeder of Nearco one of the dominant sires of Thoroughbreds in the later part of the th century
Other countries in Europe have Thoroughbred breeding programs including Germany Russia Poland and Hungary
Horses arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in along with the earliest colonists Although horses of part Thoroughbred blood were imported into Australia during the late th century it is thought that the first pureblood Thoroughbred was a stallion named Northumberland who was imported from England in as a coach horse sire By the first formal race meets were organized in Sydney and by the first mare of proven Thoroughbred bloodlines arrived to join the Thoroughbred stallions already there In the Sydney Turf Club the first true racing club in Australia was formed Throughout the s the Australian colonies began to import Thoroughbreds almost exclusively for racing purposes and to improve the local stock Each colony formed its own racing clubs and held its own races Gradually the individual clubs were integrated into one overarching organization now known as the Australian Racing Board Thoroughbreds from Australia were imported into New Zealand in the s and s with the first direct importation from England occurring in
Thoroughbreds have been exported to many other areas of the world since the breed was created Oriental horses were imported into South Africa from the late th century in order to improve the local stock through crossbreeding Horse racing was established there in the late th and early th centuries and Thoroughbreds were imported in increasing numbers The first Thoroughbred stallions arrived in Argentina in but the first mares did not arrive until The Argentine Stud Book was first published in Thoroughbreds were imported into Japan from although it was not until after World War II that Japan began a serious breeding and racing business involving Thoroughbreds
The number of Thoroughbred foals registered each year in North America varies greatly chiefly linked to the success of the auction market which in turn depends on the state of the economy The foal crop was over in but declined to roughly by The largest numbers are registered in the states of Kentucky Florida and California Australia is the second largest producer of Thoroughbreds in the world with almost broodmares producing about foals annually Britain produces about foals a year and worldwide there are more than active broodmares or females being used for breeding and newly registered foals in alone The Thoroughbred industry is a large agribusiness generating around billion in revenue annually in the United States and providing about jobs through a network of farms training centers and race tracks
Unlike a significant number of registered breeds today a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred with The Jockey Club registry unless conceived by live cover the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion Artificial insemination AI and embryo transfer ET though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries cannot be used with Thoroughbreds One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with artificial insemination and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns artificial insemination still requires more detailed record keeping The main reason however may be economic a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible As an example in the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered mares By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with artificial insemination it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages
Concern exists that the closed stud book and tightly regulated population of the Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because of the level of inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population According to one study of alleles in the current population can be traced to foundation animals of which are male Ten foundation mares account for of maternal tail female lineages and as noted above one stallion appears in of tail male lineages Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the maternal line called the distaff line The line that a horse comes from is a critical factor in determining the price for a young horse
Prices of Thoroughbreds vary greatly depending on age pedigree conformation and other market factors In Keeneland Sales a United States based sales company sold horses at auction with a total value of which gives an average price of As a whole for the United States in The Jockey Club auction statistics indicated that the average weanling sold for the average yearling sold for average sale price for two year olds was broodmares averaged and horses over two and broodmare prospects sold for an average of For Europe the July Tattersall's Sale sold horses at auction with a total for the sale of guineas for an average of guineas Also in Doncaster Bloodstock Sales another British sales firm sold horses for a total value of guineas making an average of guineas per horse Australian prices at auction during the racing and breeding season were as follows Australian weanlings sold for a total of an average of each Four thousand nine hundred and three yearlings sold for a total value of A an average of A Five hundred two year olds sold for A an average of A and broodmares totalled A an average of A
Averages however can be deceiving For example at the Fall Yearling sale at Keeneland young horses sold for a total of for an average of per horse However that average sales price reflected a variation that included at least horses that sold for only each and that sold for over apiece
The highest price paid at auction for a Thoroughbred was set in at for a two year old colt named The Green Monkey Record prices at auction often grab headlines though they do not necessarily reflect the animal's future success in the case of The Green Monkey injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in and he never won a race Conversely even a highly successful Thoroughbred may be sold by the pound for a few hundred dollars to become horsemeat The best known example of this was the Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand exported to Japan to stand at stud but was ultimately slaughtered in presumably for pet food
However the value of a Thoroughbred may also be influenced by the purse money it wins In Thoroughbred racehorses earned a total of in all placings an average earnings per starter of In addition the track record of a race horse may influence its future value as a breeding animal
Stud fees for stallions that enter breeding can range from to per mare in the United States and from £ to £ or more in Britain The record stud fee to date was set in the s when the stud fee of the late Northern Dancer reached million During the Australian breeding season seven stallions stood at a stud fee of A or more with the highest fee in the nation at A
Although the Thoroughbred is primarily bred for racing the breed is also used for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses dressage horses and youth show horses The larger horses are sought after for hunterjumper and dressage competitions whereas the smaller horses are in demand as polo ponies
Thoroughbred horses are primarily bred for racing under saddle at the gallop Thoroughbreds are often known for being either distance runners or sprinters and their conformation usually reflects what they have been bred to do Sprinters are usually well muscled while stayers or distance runners tend to be smaller and slimmer The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse Although there have been champion racehorses of every height from Zenyatta who stood hands to Man o' War and Secretariat who both stood at hands down to Hyperion who was only the best racehorses are generally of average size Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet predisposing them to lameness Smaller horses are considered by some to be at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them especially in the starting gate Historically Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size the average height of a Thoroughbred in was about hands high By this had increased to
In there were horses who started in races in the United States and the average Thoroughbred racehorse in the United States and Canada ran times in that year In Australia there were horses in training during and those horses started times for A of prize money During in Japan there were horses in training and those horses started times for A of prize money In Britain the British Racing Authority states there were horses in training for flat racing for and those horses started times in races
Statistically fewer than of all race horses ever win a race and less than ever win a stakes race such as the Kentucky Derby or The Derby Any horse who has yet to win a race is known as a maiden
Horses finished with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions A number of agencies exist to help make the transition from the racetrack to another career or to help find retirement homes for ex racehorses
In addition to racing Thoroughbreds compete in eventing show jumping and dressage at the highest levels of international competition including the Olympics They are also used as show hunters steeplechasers and in Western riding speed events such as barrel racing Mounted police divisions employ them in non competitive work and recreational riders also use them Thoroughbreds are one of the most common breeds for use in polo in the United States They are often seen in the fox hunting field as well
Thoroughbreds are often crossed with horses of other breeds to create new breeds or to enhance or introduce specific qualities into existing ones They have been influential on many modern breeds including the American Quarter Horse the Standardbred and possibly the Morgan a breed that went on to influence many of the gaited breeds in North America Other common crosses with the Thoroughbred include crossbreeding with Arabian bloodlines to produce the Anglo Arabian as well as with the Irish Draught to produce the Irish Sport Horse Thoroughbreds are often crossed with various Warmblood breeds due to their refinement and performance capabilities
Although Thoroughbreds are seen in the hunter jumper world and in other disciplines modern Thoroughbreds are primarily bred for speed and racehorses have a very high rate of accidents as well as other health problems
One tenth of all Thoroughbreds suffer orthopedic problems including fractures Current estimates indicate that there are career ending breakdowns for every horses starting a race in the United States an average of two horses per day The state of California reported a particularly high rate of injury per starts Other countries report lower rates of injury with the United Kingdom having injuries starts and the courses in Victoria Australia producing a rate of injuries starts Thoroughbreds also have other health concerns including a majority of animals who are prone to bleeding from the lungs exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage with low fertility and with abnormally small hearts Thoroughbreds also tend to have smaller hooves relative to their body mass than other breeds with thin soles and walls and a lack of cartilage mass which contributes to foot soreness the most common source of lameness in racehorses
One argument for the health issues involving Thoroughbreds suggests that inbreeding is the culprit It has also been suggested that capability for speed is enhanced in an already swift animal by raising muscle mass a form of selective breeding that has created animals designed to win horse races Thus according to one postulation the modern Thoroughbred travels faster than its skeletal structure can support Veterinarian Robert M Miller states that We have selectively bred for speeds that the anatomy of the horse cannot always cope with
Poor breeding may be encouraged by the fact that many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury If the injury is linked to a conformational fault the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation Additionally some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on
A high accident rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds particularly in the United States are first raced as year olds well before they are completely mature Though they may appear full grown and are in superb muscular condition their bones are not fully formed However catastrophic injury rates are higher in and year olds than in and year olds Some believe that correct slow training of a young horse including foals may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal This is because during the training process microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal the bone becomes stronger If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury
Studies have shown that track surfaces horseshoes with toe grabs use of certain legal medications and high intensity racing schedules may also contribute to a high injury rate One promising trend is the development of synthetic surfaces for racetracks and one of the first tracks to install such a surface Turfway Park in Florence Kentucky saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from in to three in the year following Polytrack installation The material is not perfected and some areas report problems related to winter weather but studies are continuing
The level of treatment given to injured Thoroughbreds is often more intensive than for horses of lesser financial value but also controversial due in part to the significant challenges in treating broken bones and other major leg injuries Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems laminitis and other infections If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human's bed rest because of the risk of developing sores internal damage and congestion
Whenever a racing accident severely injures a well known horse such as the major leg fractures that led to the euthanization of Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro or Kentucky Derby runner up Eight Belles animal rights groups have denounced the Thoroughbred racing industry On the other hand advocates of racing argue that without horse racing far less funding and incentives would be available for medical and biomechanical research on horses Although horse racing is hazardous veterinary science has advanced Previously hopeless cases can now be treated and earlier detection through advanced imaging techniques like scintigraphy can keep at risk horses off the track
