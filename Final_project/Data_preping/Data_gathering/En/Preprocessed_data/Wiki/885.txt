one genetic study indicates male thoroughbred trace direct male line via chromosome darley arabian
however modern thoroughbred pedigree horse cross godolphin arabian darley arabian line descent maternal paternal considered
percentage contribution current thoroughbred bloodline curwen's bay barb appears often byerley turk
majority modern thoroughbred alive today trace total stallion centuries
mare used foundation breeding stock came variety breed irish hobby developed northern europe prior century
mare oriental breeding including barb turk bloodline although researcher conclude number eastern mare imported england year wa small
-century researcher bruce lowe identified mare family thoroughbred breed later augmented researcher to

unlike significant number registered breed today horse cannot registered thoroughbred jockey club registry unless conceived live cover witnessed natural mating mare stallion
artificial insemination ai embryo transfer et though commonly used allowable many horse breed registry cannot used thoroughbreds
one reason greater possibility error exists assigning parentage artificial insemination although dna blood testing eliminate many concern artificial insemination still requires detailed record keeping
main reason however may economic stallion ha limited number mare serviced live cover
thus practice prevents oversupply thoroughbred although modern management still allows stallion live cover mare season wa thought possible
example australian stallion encosta de lago covered mares
allowing stallion cover couple hundred mare year rather couple thousand possible artificial insemination also preserve high price paid horse finest popular lineages
concern exists closed stud book tightly regulated population thoroughbred risk loss genetic diversity level inadvertent inbreeding inevitable small population
according one study allele current population traced foundation animal male
ten foundation mare account maternal tail-female lineage noted one stallion appears tail male lineages
thoroughbred pedigree generally traced maternal line called distaff line
line horse come critical factor determining price young horse
price thoroughbred vary greatly depending age pedigree conformation market factors

although thoroughbred primarily bred racing breed also used show jumping combined training athleticism many retired retrained race horse become fine family riding horse dressage horse youth show horses

thoroughbred one common breed use polo united states
thoroughbred often crossed horse breed create new breed enhance introduce specific quality existing ones
influential many modern breed including american quarter horse standardbred possibly morgan breed went influence many gaited breed north america
common cross thoroughbred include crossbreeding arabian bloodline produce anglo-arabian well irish draught produce irish sport horse
thoroughbred often crossed various warmblood breed due refinement performance capabilities
although thoroughbred seen hunter-jumper world discipline modern thoroughbred primarily bred speed racehorse high rate accident well health problems
one tenth thoroughbred suffer orthopedic problem including fractures
current estimate indicate career-ending breakdown every horse starting race united state average two horse per day
state california reported particularly high rate injury per starts
country report lower rate injury united kingdom injury start course victoria australia producing rate injury starts
thoroughbred also health concern including majority animal prone bleeding lung exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage low fertility abnormally small hearts
thoroughbred also tend smaller hoof relative body mass breed thin sol wall lack cartilage mass contributes foot soreness common source lameness racehorses
one argument health issue involving thoroughbred suggests inbreeding culprit
ha also suggested capability speed enhanced already swift animal raising muscle mass form selective breeding ha created animal designed win horse races
thus according one postulation modern thoroughbred travel faster skeletal structure support
miller state selectively bred speed anatomy horse cannot always cope with
poor breeding may encouraged fact many horse sent breeding shed following injury
injury linked conformational fault fault likely passed next generation
additionally breeder veterinarian perform straightening procedure horse crooked legs
help increase horse's price sale perhaps help horse sounder racing career gene poor leg still passed on
high accident rate may also occur thoroughbred particularly united state first raced year-olds well completely mature
though may appear full-grown superb muscular condition bone fully formed
believe correct slow training young horse including foal may actually beneficial overall soundness animal
training process microfractures occur leg followed bone remodeling
remodeling given sufficient time heal bone becomes stronger
proper remodeling occurs hard training racing begin horse stronger musculoskeletal system decreased chance injury
study shown track surface horseshoe toe grab use certain legal medication high-intensity racing schedule may also contribute high injury rate
one promising trend development synthetic surface racetrack one first track install surface turfway park florence kentucky saw rate fatal breakdown drop three year following polytrack installation
material perfected area report problem related winter weather study continuing
level treatment given injured thoroughbred often intensive horse lesser financial value also controversial due part significant challenge treating broken bone major leg injuries
leg injury immediately fatal still may life-threatening horse's weight must distributed evenly four leg prevent circulatory problem laminitis infections
horse loses use one leg temporarily risk leg break recovery period carrying abnormal weight load
horse periodically lie brief period time horse cannot remain lying equivalent human's bed rest risk developing sore internal damage congestion
whenever racing accident severely injures well-known horse major leg fracture led euthanization kentucky derby winner barbaro kentucky derby runner-up eight belle animal right group denounced thoroughbred racing industry
