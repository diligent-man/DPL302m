the third nepal tibet war chinese nepali was fought from to in tibet between the forces of the tibetan government then under administrative rule of the qing dynasty and the invading nepalese army resulting in huge loss of money and manpower for tibet and nepal
in the war ended with the treaty of thapathali
since the sino nepalese war of the nepalese government had renounced all claims of influence in tibet and maintained a policy of non intervention in its affairs
with their victory in the war the qing empire made nepal a tributary state but the wave of rebellions that afflicted china in the s such as the taiping rebellion had crippled her capacity to enforce imperial authority so far from beijing and the nepalese prime minister jang bahadur rana saw an excellent opportunity to press for nepalese objectives in tibet without the threat of chinese interference
jang bahadur used the alleged ill treatment to the embassy abuses to nepalese newar traders in lhasa a boundary dispute in the kuti area among other grievances to justify the nepalese demands to the tibetan government which included territorial concessions and the payment of an indemnity
he declared war in march and gave april as the date limit for his conditions to be met
in early april nepalese troops attacked across the major passes between tibet and nepal from walungchung to jara with the center of their advance in the kuti and kerong districts and were joined shortly later by reinforcements completing a total of men with thirty six guns and eight mortars
the kerung axis was commanded by general bam bahadur kunwar with troops
the kuti axis was commanded by general dhir sumsher with troops
humla and mustang was commanded by general krishna dhoj kunwar with troops
and olangchunggola axis was commanded by colonel prithvi dhoj kunwar with a force of men
sethya kaji was the main tibetan commander with about troops under his command
there were tibetan troops stationed on digarcha front whereas troops were concentrated in the tingri area
on april general dhir shamsher defeated a small tibetan detachment at chusan and captured kuti and advanced to suna gompa
kerong was occupied by bam bahadur without opposition and a tibetan force at kukurghat north of kerong after which the nepalese pushed on to dzongka the tibetan main point of resistance in the area
the battle for dzongka lasted days after which the tibetans retreated to tingri
the capture of dzongka was the last action of the campaign after which negotiations for a cease fire began
the campaign had proven more costly for jang bahadur than what he expected
negotiations carried on from may to september without a settlement
nepal was unable to press its demands with another campaign since its treasury had been exhausted by the costs of the invasion and occupation of the tibetan country while in nepal opposition to the war escalated
in lhasa the failure of negotiations led to a renewal of hostilities and this time it was tibetan troops who took the offensive
general kalon shatra commanding the tibetan army launched two simultaneous attacks in november on the nepalese camps at kuti and dzongka
surprised the nepalese lost men in kuti and the survivors fled to the border
the attack on dzongka was less successful so the garrison there was besieged
the attacks were timed to coincide with the snowing season in the passes
jang bahadur sent reinforcements and in december dhir shamsher recaptured kuti which he burned before retreating to listi back in nepal
meanwhile colonel sanak singh khattri relieved dzongka
negotiation resumed after military operations stalled
the tibetans feared a rebellion in kham while nepalese finances were stretched to their limits
the nepalese demand for ten million rupees was dropped to a nominal annual payment and nepalese territorial ambitions were dropped
in the treaty signed at thapathali the tibetans agreed to pay an annual subsidy of ten thousand rupees to the nepal durbar and to allow a nepalese trading station and agency to be established at lhasa
tibet paid lump sum of rs
as first installment but refused to pay the following year which caused war between two nations to continue
