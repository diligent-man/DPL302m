in theoretical computer science a circuit is a model of computation in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates each of which computes a function
circuits of this kind provide a generalization of boolean circuits and a mathematical model for digital logic circuits
circuits are defined by the gates they contain and the values the gates can produce
for example the values in a boolean circuit are boolean values and the circuit includes conjunction disjunction and negation gates
the values in an integer circuit are sets of integers and the gates compute set union set intersection and set complement as well as the arithmetic operations addition and multiplication
a circuit is a triple
displaystyle m l g
where
displaystyle m
is a set of values
displaystyle l
is a set of gate labels each of which is a function from
displaystyle m i
displaystyle m
for some non negative integer
displaystyle i
where
displaystyle i
represents the number of inputs to the gate and
displaystyle g
is a labelled directed acyclic graph with labels from
displaystyle l
the vertices of the graph are called gates
for each gate
displaystyle g
of in degree
displaystyle i
the gate
displaystyle g
can be labeled by an element
displaystyle ell
displaystyle l
if and only if
displaystyle ell
is defined on
displaystyle m i
the gates of in degree are called inputs or leaves
the gates of out degree are called outputs
if there is an edge from gate
displaystyle g
to gate
displaystyle h
in the graph
displaystyle g
displaystyle h
is called a child of
displaystyle g
we suppose there is an order on the vertices of the graph so we can speak of the
displaystyle k
th child of a gate when
displaystyle k
is less than the out degree of the gate
the size of a circuit is the number of nodes of a circuit
the depth of a gate
displaystyle g
is the length of the longest path in
displaystyle g
beginning at
displaystyle g
up to an output gate
in particular the gates of out degree are the only gates of depth
the depth of a circuit is the maximum depth of any gate
level
displaystyle i
is the set of all gates of depth
displaystyle i
a levelled circuit is a circuit in which the edges to gates of depth
displaystyle i
comes only from gates of depth
displaystyle i
or from the inputs
in other words edges only exist between adjacent levels of the circuit
the width of a levelled circuit is the maximum size of any level
the exact value
displaystyle v g
of a gate
displaystyle g
with in degree
displaystyle i
and label
displaystyle l
is defined recursively for all gates
displaystyle g
is an input
otherwise
displaystyle v g begin cases l text if g text is an input l v g dotsc v g i text otherwise end cases
where each
displaystyle g j
is a parent of
displaystyle g
the value of the circuit is the value of each of the output gates
the labels of the leaves can also be variables which take values in
displaystyle m
if there are
displaystyle n
leaves then the circuit can be seen as a function from
displaystyle m n
displaystyle m
it is then usual to consider a family of circuits
displaystyle c n n in mathbb n
a sequence of circuits indexed by the integers where the circuit
displaystyle c n
displaystyle n
variables
families of circuits can thus be seen as functions from
displaystyle m
displaystyle m
the notions of size depth and width can be naturally extended to families of functions becoming functions from
displaystyle mathbb n
displaystyle mathbb n
for example
displaystyle size n
is the size of the
displaystyle n
th circuit of the family
computing the output of a given boolean circuit on a specific input is p complete problem
if the input is an integer circuit however it is unknown whether this problem is decidable
