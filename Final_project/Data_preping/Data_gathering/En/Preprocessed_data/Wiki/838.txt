In theoretical computer science a circuit is a model of computation in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates each of which computes a function Circuits of this kind provide a generalization of Boolean circuits and a mathematical model for digital logic circuits Circuits are defined by the gates they contain and the values the gates can produce For example the values in a Boolean circuit are boolean values and the circuit includes conjunction disjunction and negation gates The values in an integer circuit are sets of integers and the gates compute set union set intersection and set complement as well as the arithmetic operations addition and multiplication
is a set of gate labels each of which is a function from
represents the number of inputs to the gate and
is a labelled directed acyclic graph with labels from
The vertices of the graph are called gates For each gate
The gates of in degree are called inputs or leaves The gates of out degree are called outputs If there is an edge from gate
We suppose there is an order on the vertices of the graph so we can speak of the
is less than the out degree of the gate
The size of a circuit is the number of nodes of a circuit The depth of a gate
is the length of the longest path in
up to an output gate In particular the gates of out degree are the only gates of depth The depth of a circuit is the maximum depth of any gate
is the set of all gates of depth
A levelled circuit is a circuit in which the edges to gates of depth
or from the inputs In other words edges only exist between adjacent levels of the circuit The width of a levelled circuit is the maximum size of any level

The value of the circuit is the value of each of the output gates
The labels of the leaves can also be variables which take values in
leaves then the circuit can be seen as a function from
It is then usual to consider a family of circuits
a sequence of circuits indexed by the integers where the circuit
variables Families of circuits can thus be seen as functions from
The notions of size depth and width can be naturally extended to families of functions becoming functions from
Computing the output of a given Boolean circuit on a specific input is P complete problem If the input is an integer circuit however it is unknown whether this problem is decidable
Circuit complexity attempts to classify Boolean functions with respect to the size or depth of circuits that can compute them
The complexity classes NC AC and TC
