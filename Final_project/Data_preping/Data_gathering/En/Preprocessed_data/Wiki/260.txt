In 2006, screenwriter David Ayer admitted that U-571 had distorted history, and said that he would not do it again
He told BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme that he "did not feel good" about suggesting that Americans, rather than the British, had captured the naval Enigma cipher: "It was a distortion ..
a mercenary decision ..
to create this parallel history in order to drive the film for an American audience
Both my grandparents were officers in the Second World War, and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements."
Ayer's directorial debut was with the film Harsh Times, an action-drama set on the streets of South Central Los Angeles, showing how drug use and past military experiences affects people's attempts to lead normal lives
He went on to direct the action thriller Street Kings, which was released in 2008.
