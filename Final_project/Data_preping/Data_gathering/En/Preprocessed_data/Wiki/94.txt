seraphim of sarov russian july o s
july or january o s
january born pr khor is dorovich moshn n mashn n is one of the most renowned russian saints and is venerated in the eastern orthodox church
he is generally considered the greatest of the th century startsy elders
seraphim extended the monastic teachings of contemplation theoria and self denial to the layperson
he taught that the purpose of the christian life was to receive the holy spirit
perhaps his most popular quotation amongst his devotees is acquire a peaceful spirit and thousands around you will be saved
seraphim was glorifed by the russian orthodox church in
pope john paul ii also referred to him as a saint
born july o s seraphim was baptized with the name of prochor after prochorus one of the first seven deacons of the early church and the disciple of john the evangelist
his parents isidore and agathia moshnin lived in kursk russia
his father was a merchant
according to eastern orthodox church tradition a wonderworking icon of the theotokos virgin mary our lady of kursk healed the young boy
seraphim later experienced a number of visions
in at the age of he visited dorothea of kiev
in at the age of he joined the sarov monastery as a novice poslushnik
he was officially tonsured took his monastic vows in and given the religious name of seraphim which means fiery or burning in hebrew
shortly afterwards he was ordained a hierodeacon monastic deacon
in he was ordained as a hieromonk monastic priest and became the spiritual leader of the diveyevo convent which has since come to be known as the seraphim diveyevo convent
soon after this seraphim retreated to a log cabin in the woods outside sarov monastery and led a solitary lifestyle as a hermit for years
during this time his feet became swollen to the point that he had trouble walking
sarov s eating and fasting habits became more strict
at first he ate bread obtained from the monastery and vegetables from his garden then only vegetables
for three years he ate only grass
one day while chopping wood seraphim was attacked by a gang of thieves who beat him mercilessly with the handle of his own axe
he never resisted and was left for dead
the robbers never found the money they sought only an icon of the theotokos virgin mary in his hut
seraphim had a hunched back for the rest of his life
however at the thieves trial he pleaded to the judge for mercy on their behalf
after this incident seraphim spent months in the monastery recovering and there again returned to the desert for the former spiritual feats p
after this incident seraphim spent successive nights on a rock in continuous prayer with his arms raised to the sky a feat of asceticism deemed miraculous by the eastern orthodox church especially considering the pain from his injuries
in in obedience to a reputed spiritual experience that he attributed to the virgin mary seraphim began admitting pilgrims to his hermitage as a confessor
he soon became immensely popular due to his reputation for healing powers and gift of prophecy
hundreds of pilgrims per day visited him drawn as well by his ability to answer his guests questions before they could ask
as extraordinarily harsh as seraphim often was to himself he was kind and gentle toward others always greeting his guests with a prostration a kiss and exclaiming christ is risen and calling everyone my joy
he died while kneeling before an umilenie icon of the theotokos which he called joy of all joys
this icon is kept currently in the chapel of the residence of the patriarch of moscow
there was a widespread popular belief in russia that a saint s remains were supposed to be incorrupt which was not the case with seraphim as was officially ascertained by a commission that researched his grave in january
this however did not deter canonisation spearheaded by archimandrite seraphim chichagov as well as popular veneration
at the end of january o s the most holy synod having received approval from emperor nicholas ii announced seraphim s forthcoming glorification
in early july his relics were transferred from their original burial place to the church of saints zosimus and sabbatius
nicholas ii and tsarina alexandra provided a new cypress coffin to receive the relics
the solemn canonisation discovery of the relics festivities took place in sarov on july august and were attended by the tsar his wife his mother empress maria feodorovna and other senior members of the imperial family
on july metropolitan anthony vadkovsky of st
petersburg officiated at the last pannikhida memorial service in the dormition cathedral at sarov with the royal family in attendance
these would be the last prayers offered for seraphim as a departed servant of god from that time forward prayers would instead be addressed to him as a saint
on july seraphim s birthday the late liturgy began at
at the little entrance twelve archimandrites lifted the coffin from the middle of the church and carried it around the holy table altar then placed it into a special shrine which had been constructed for them
the festivities at sarov ended with the consecration of the first two churches dedicated to saint seraphim
the first had been constructed over his monastic cell in the wilderness of sarov
the second church was consecrated on july at the diveyevo convent
following the bolshevik revolution soviet authorities severely persecuted religious groups
as part of their persecution of christians they confiscated many relics of saints including seraphim
furthermore his biographer seraphim chichagov who came to become a metropolitan was arrested sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in and is also celebrated as a russian orthodox saint
in seraphim s relics were rediscovered after being hidden in a soviet anti religious museum for seventy years
this caused a sensation in post soviet russia and throughout the orthodox world
a crucession religious procession escorted the relics on foot all the way from moscow to diveyevo convent where they remain to this day
on october relics of seraphim were launched into space aboard the soyuz ms
seraphim is remembered in the anglican communion with a commemoration on january
acquire a peaceful spirit and around you thousands will be saved it is necessary that the holy spirit enter our heart
everything good that we do that we do for christ is given to us by the holy spirit but prayer most of all which is always available to us the available information about relations between seraphim of sarov and russian old believers tradition is somewhat contradictory
on the one hand in all the memoirs and biographies and in the collections of his sayings he is undoubtedly portrayed as a convinced supporter of the reforms in the church and the official hierarchy
on the other hand on icons of seraphim he is usually depicted with a lestovka in his left hand and in some cases even in old russian old believers style monastic garments with a peculiar klobuk and an old fashioned cast bronze cross as it is with these objects that he is depicted on the only lifetime portrait of him
the lestovka used by st seraphim is preserved up to this time among his personal belongings
according to some sources the known problems with the beatification of seraphim of sarov did happen exactly due to his general support and sympathy towards the old believers tradition in which case the negative assessment of the old rite ascribed to him would have been interpreted as inventions of his followers who tried to put their teacher in the most favorable light in the eyes of the official church functionaries
it was also suggested that seraphim could have descended from a family of old ritualists or from a family of secret cryptic old believers that were widespread in northern and eastern areas of russia possibly with consequent gradual shift towards edinoverie
in spite of some alleged controversy seraphim was known at least at the level of official hagiography for his rejection of the russian old rites
the majority of old believers authors doubt virtually all the facts known about seraphim as well as the very legitimacy of his beatification and his name is invariably used in interdenominational polemics
