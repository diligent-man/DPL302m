His batting average was over for seasons and he had hits during his major league career
He also was a two-time World Series champion

Clemente was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries during the off-seasons
He often delivered baseball equipment and food to those in need
On December he died in a plane crash at the age of while en route to deliver aid to earthquake victims in Nicaragua
The following season the Pirates retired his uniform number and MLB renamed its annual Commissioner's Award in his honor
Now known as the Roberto Clemente Award it is given to the player who best exemplifies the game of baseball sportsmanship community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team
Roberto was born in Barrio San Antn Carolina Puerto Rico to Melchor Clemente and Luisa Walker
He was the youngest of seven children
During Clemente's childhood his father worked as a foreman for sugar cane crops located in the municipality located in the northeastern part of the island
Because the family's resources were limited Clemente and his brothers worked alongside his father in the fields loading and unloading trucks
As a youth Clemente was a track and field star and Olympic hopeful before deciding to turn his attention to baseball
Clemente had first shown interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios
He attended Julio Vizcarrondo Coronado High School in Carolina
During his first year in high school he was recruited by Roberto Marn to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after he was seen playing baseball in barrio San Antn
He was with the team two years as a shortstop
Clemente joined Puerto Rico's amateur league when he was years old playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team which represented the municipality of Juncos
Clemente's professional baseball career began at age when he accepted a contract from Pedrn Zorilla with Cangrejeros de Santurce Crabbers a winter league team and franchise of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League LBPPR
Clemente signed with the team on October
He was a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Cangrejeros' starting lineup the following season
During this season he hit as the team's leadoff hitter
While Clemente was playing in the LBPPR the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract with one of the team's Triple-A affiliates
After signing with the Dodgers on February Clemente moved to Montreal to play with the Royals
Affected early on by both climate and language differences Clemente received assistance from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black
Black was the original target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June scouting trip to Richmond
Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth the mission's focus quickly shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game drills
Nonetheless Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day visit
With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive remarks You mean you want him and the fact that Clemente took batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby
The manager had been instructed to use Clemente sparingly acknowledged Macon almost years later
We tried to sneak him through the draft but it didn't work As Sukeforth told Pirates beat writer Les Biederman I knew then he'd be our first draft choice Before leaving Richmond he recalled I told Montreal manager Max Macon to take good care of 'our boy' and see that he didn't get hurt
Evidently Macon took Sukeforth at his word scarcely had the Pirate scout departed when on June Clemente started his first game in over a month
In the course of two days and three games two of which he started Clemente amassed ten at-bats two more than in the previous thirty games combined
Yet just as abruptly the moment was over and he was back to riding the bench this time for almost two months
Clemente's extra inning walk-off home run of July the first home run of his North American baseball career was hit in his first at-bat after entering the game as a defensive replacement
Perhaps prompted by Sukeforth's followup visit I don't care if you never play him we're going to finish last and we're going to draft him number one Clemente's appearance ended a nearly two-month-long drought starting on June appearances starts and at-bats in games
From this point forward Clemente's playing time increased significantly he started every subsequent game against a left-handed starting pitcher finishing the season with a batting average of in games
Clemente would complement his July walk-off homer with another on September as well as a game-ending outfield assist cutting down the potential tying run at the plate on August his th birthday
As promised the Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the Rule draft that took place on November
For all but the first seven weeks of his major league career Clemente wore number
After his death this number was retired by the Pirates
For his first few weeks Clemente wore the number as his teammate Earl Smith was wearing number

In September Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve
He served his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island South Carolina Camp LeJeune in North Carolina and Washington DC

The Pirates struggled through several difficult seasons through the s
They did have a winning season in their first since
Clemente debuted with the Pirates on April wearing uniform number in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers
Early in his career with the Pirates he was frustrated by racial and ethnic tensions with sniping by the local media and some teammates
Clemente responded to this by saying I don't believe in color He noted that during his upbringing he was taught never to discriminate against someone based on ethnicity
Clemente was at a double disadvantage as he was a Latin American and Caribbean player whose first language was Spanish and was of partially African descent
The year before the Pirates had hired Curt Roberts their first African-American player
They were the fifth team in the NL and ninth in the major leagues to do so seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line by joining the Dodgers
When Clemente arrived in Pittsburgh Roberts befriended him and helped him adjust to life in the major league as well as in the Pittsburgh area
During his rookie season Clemente had to sit out several games as he had suffered a lower back injury in Puerto Rico the previous winter

Clemente batted in the series hitting safely at least once in every game
His batting average home runs and defensive playing during the course of the season had earned him his first spot on the NL All-Star roster as a reserve player and he replaced Hank Aaron in right field during the th and th innings in the second All-Star game held that season two All-Star games were held each season from through
During spring training in following advice from Pirates' batting coach George Sisler Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the speed of his swing
During the season Clemente was named the starting NL right fielder for the first of two All-Star games and went for he hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first run then drove in the second with a sacrifice fly

He pinch-hit in the game and got a single but experienced a complication of his injury as a result and had to undergo surgery shortly after being carried off the playing field
This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the season during which he batted
Although he was inactive for many games when he returned to the regular starting lineup he got hits in out of games and his batting average climbed up to
He participated as a pinch hitter and replaced Willie Stargell playing left field during the All-Star Game on July
Clemente was an All-Star every season he played in the s other than —the only year in his career after in which he failed to hit above —and a Gold Glove winner for each of his final seasons beginning in
He won the NL batting title four times and and won the league's MVP Award in hitting with a career-high home runs and RBIs

The season was the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium for Clemente abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation

Clemente spent much of his time during the off-season involved in charity work

He soon learned however that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government never reaching victims of the quake
He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors
The airplane he chartered for a New Year's Eve flight a Douglas DC- cargo plane had a history of mechanical problems and an insufficient number of flight personnel missing both a flight engineer and copilot and was overloaded by pounds kg
It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December due to engine failure
A few days after the crash the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found

Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguilln was the only member of the Pirates not to attend Roberto's memorial service
The Pirates catcher chose instead to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate
The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane were never recovered

Puerto Rican Veterans Hall of Fame Dr
Martin Luther King Jr speaking on July with Pittsburgh Post-Gazette sports editor Al Abrams said They are honoring a great one in Clemente
I have been watching his career ever since he joined the Pittsburgh club
Roberto should wind up as one of the all-time stars before he is through
Willie Mays while fielding questions from reporters following the announcement of his election to the Hall of Fame on January called Clemente the best player he ever saw other than himself
Mays reiterated his assessment of Clemente on January stating that He could do anything with a bat and in the field Mays has repeatedly through the years stood by his statements regarding Clemente
Barry Bonds speaking in told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review When I’m done I want people to say 'He’s the best' Right field belongs to Roberto Clemente center field belongs to Willie Mays
I want left field to belong to me
Sandy Koufax interviewed shortly after the selection of MLB's All-Century Team from which Clemente was conspicuously absent was asked to assess fellow honorees
Dubbing Mays the greatest player he'd ever seen and Aaron the greatest hitter Koufax noted that this raises the question of where you put Clemente he's right there This is consistent with Koufax's magazine article ranking Clemente just behind Aaron at the top of his toughest batter list while also emphasizing the former's immense power
The longest ball I ever saw hit to the opposite field was hit off me by Clemente at the Los Angeles Coliseum in
It was a fastball on the outside corner and he drove it out of the park not just over the fence he knocked it way out
I didn’t think a right-handed batter could hit it out of the field just at that point but Clemente did Moreover it appears that by his own estimation the longest blast ever yielded by Koufax in any direction was launched by Clemente at Forbes Field on May
Duke Snider wrote that Carl Furillo was the best right fielder I ever saw until Roberto Clemente came along and Clemente was possibly the best ballplayer I’ve ever seen
And just think that we could have had Clemente in our outfield
Sparky Anderson in his eponymous memoir writes Walking away… Roberto Clemente is my premier outfielder period
I saw more of Clemente than I wanted to when I managed against him
He could hit for power when he had to
When he wanted to slap it to right he shot the ball like a bullet
When he hit a ground ball to the infield he was flying to first
Clemente was a remarkable man because at the ages of thirty-four and thirty-five he played like he was twenty-one
That’s how I’ll always remember him as a man who played with youthful energy
Dave Bristol Anderson's predecessor as Reds' manager speaking in May said The best player in the game today
I’d have to take him over Aaron and all the rest
I've only been in the league a little over a year and a half but I don't think I've ever seen him make an easy out Quoted in September Bristol reiterated Clemente is the best player I’ve ever seen
I said so when I first came into the league and I still say so
Paul Richards taking part in a poll of MLB general managers at the winter meetings speaking as the then-Atlanta Braves GM said I don’t know how a man can be running away from the ball and hit it into the upper deck
I shudder to think what he would do if he stood at the plate on every pitch and defied the pitcher to pitch to him
Clemente’s a one-man show as far as I’m concerned
He’s not only the best today he’s one of the best that’s ever played baseball
He’s got power and he’s so fast that any bouncing ball is a potential base hit
He can hit the ball into the upper deck in anybody’s ballpark right field or left field
He’s got one of the strongest and most accurate throwing arms I’ve ever seen
He can throw from the most awkward and seemingly impossible positions
He can throw people out at second base on balls that would be triples to any other right fielder
And the thing about this fellow is that he actually breaks many of the fundamental rules of hitting
Many times he sticks his fanny out but he still manages to hit the ball with authority
To me he is one of the most amazing athletes of all time
Lou Boudreau speaking in said that Clemente was one of the worst-looking great hitters I’ve seen
There isn’t one phase of baseball in which he doesn’t excel
Lou Brock speaking with reporters in June explained I'm looking at the best hitter in baseball in response to queries regarding the rapt attention he had given one of Clemente's at-bats
In July Brock told The New Pittsburgh Courier Willie Mays was the greatest player I ever saw
Clemente was second and Hank Aaron was the greatest slugger
But pound for pound play-for-play Willie Mays could do it all well
You can name four or five in what I call that elite category
Clete Boyer circa said that Clemente was by far the greatest defensive right fielder who ever lived but because he played in Pittsburgh he didn't get the credit he deserved
I played with Roger Maris and against Al Kaline and they were both great right fielders
Smoky Burgess looking back in at his long MLB career told former Pittsburgh Press sports editor Les Biederman The one player who impressed me the most was Roberto Clemente both as a man and as an athlete
He was one of the nicest individuals and just tremendous as a ball player
I never saw a better player although I always regarded Ted Williams as the best hitter
Tommy John considered Clemente one of the most difficult hitters he ever faced as a pitcher
He hit the same way I pitched with his head outthinking you
Tom Seaver speaking with Phil Pepe circa said I had a kind of dual relationship with a Roberto Clemente a Henry Aaron a Willie Mays
You watch them and you appreciate their professional approach and their God-given expertise of the game
These are the guys who when you weren’t pitching you just sat there and watched them play watched what they did
Anybody who watched the ball when Willie Mays was on the field was crazy
And Clemente was very much the same
Rusty Staub speaking in April said Clemente has fantastic power fantastic speed a fantastic ability to hit the ball to the opposite field a fantastic arm he is the complete ballplayer
Roberto is not merely good at everything but great at everything
He just beats you and beats you at everything you can do in baseball
I know of no other player comparable to him Interviewed in the fall of Staub added Clemente is the greatest defensive outfielder I've ever seen
I’ve never been on his ball club and I don’t know what he’s like as a team player but this guy can do just everything to beat you run hit throw catch and just kill you with power
He’s the best player I’ve seen in the big leagues
Coot Veal one of Clemente's teammates on the Pirates told Danny Peary There were many guys on the Pirates who had leadership qualities Roberto Clemente Dick Groat Don Hoak Vernon Law even Smoky Burgess
There wasn’t a better player than Roberto Clemente
Clemente Mantle and Kaline were the best all-around players I ever saw and I think Clemente was the best
Eddie Yost baseball's onetime Walking Man when asked to name the best players of his era replied Yogi
and all the Yankees for that matter
But I saw Clemente when I was coaching for the Mets
I believe he was the best I saw
Dick Young following Game of the World Series wrote The best damn ballplayer in the World Series maybe in the whole world is Roberto Clemente and as far as I’m concerned they can give him the automobile right now
Maybe some guys hit the ball farther and some throw it harder and one or two run faster although I doubt that but nobody puts it all together like Roberto
He has spent summers of those years playing baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates
He has batted over thirteen times and for the last three seasons in his decrepitude he has hit
Just watch how Roberto Clemente runs feet the next time he hits the ball back to the pitcher and ask yourself if you work at your job that way
Every time I see Roberto Clemente play ball I think of the times I’ve heard about how ‘they’ dog it and I want to vomit
