medieval latin scholar michael lapidge historian michael wood see designating thelstan potential heir time claim alfred's nephew thelwold throne represented threat succession alfred's direct line historian janet nelson suggests seen context conflict alfred edward might reflect intention divide realm son
historian martin ryan go suggesting end life alfred may favoured thelstan rather edward successor
acrostic poem praising prince adalstan prophesying great future ha interpreted lapidge referring young thelstan punning old english meaning name noble stone
lapidge wood see poem commemoration alfred's ceremony one leading scholar john old saxon
michael wood's view poem confirms truth william malmesbury's account ceremony
wood also suggests thelstan may first english king groomed childhood intellectual john wa probably tutor
however sarah foot argues acrostic poem make better sense dated beginning thelstan's reign
edward married second wife lffld time father's death probably ecgwynn died although may put aside
new marriage weakened thelstan's position step-mother naturally favoured interest son lfweard edwin
edward taken third wife eadgifu probably putting lffld aside
eadgifu also two son future king edmund eadred
thelstan's later education wa probably mercian court aunt uncle thelfld thelred likely young prince gained military training mercian campaign conquer danelaw

contrast strong control southern britain position north wa far tenuous
death half-brother edwin might finally removed faction wessex opposed rule
guthfrith norse king dublin briefly ruled northumbria died resulting insecurity among dane would given thelstan opportunity stamp authority north

august olaf defeated rival control viking part ireland promptly launched bid former norse kingdom york
individually olaf constantine weak oppose thelstan together could hope challenge dominance wessex
medieval campaigning wa normally conducted summer thelstan could hardly expected invasion large scale late year
seems slow react old latin poem preserved william malmesbury accused languished sluggish leisure
ally plundered english territory thelstan took time gathering west saxon mercian army
however michael wood praise caution arguing unlike harold allow provoked precipitate action
two side met battle brunanburh resulting overwhelming victory thelstan supported young half-brother future king edmund
olaf escaped back dublin remnant force constantine lost son
english also suffered heavy loss including two thelstan's cousin son edward elder's younger brother thelweard
great lamentable horrible battle wa cruelly fought saxon northman several thousand northman uncounted fell king amlaib olaf escaped followers
large number saxon fell side thelstan king saxon enjoyed great victorya generation later chronicler thelweard reported wa popularly remembered great battle sealed thelstan's posthumous reputation victorious god word homilist lfric eynsham

alex woolf describes pyrrhic victory thelstan campaign seems ended stalemate power appears declined died olaf acceded kingdom northumbria without resistance
alfred smyth describes greatest battle anglo-saxon history also state consequence beyond thelstan's reign overstated
view sarah foot hand would difficult exaggerate battle's importance anglo-saxon defeated hegemony whole mainland britain would disintegrated
anglo-saxon king ruled ealdormen highest lay status king
ninth-century wessex ruled single shire middle tenth authority much wider area change probably introduced thelstan deal problem governing extended realm
one ealdormen wa also called thelstan governed eastern danelaw territory east anglia largest wealthiest province england

first king anglo-saxon people thelstan needed effective mean govern extended realm
building foundation predecessor created centralised government england yet seen
previously charter produced royal priest others member religious house produced exclusively scribe known historian thelstan showing unprecedented degree royal control important activity
unlike earlier later charter thelstan provides full detail date place adoption unusually long witness list providing crucial information historians
thelstan retired died charter reverted simpler form suggesting work individual rather development formal writing office
key mechanism government wa king's council witan old english
court peripatetic council held varying location around realms
thelstan stayed mainly wessex however controlled outlying area summoning leading figure councils
small intimate meeting adequate enlargement kingdom edward elder gave way large body attended bishop ealdormen thegns magnate distant area independent ruler submitted authority
frank stenton see thelstan's council national assembly much break provincialism wa barrier unification england
john maddicott go seeing start centralised assembly defined role english government thelstan true unwitting founder english parliament

two earliest code concerned clerical matter thelstan stated acted advice wulfhelm bishops
second enforces duty charity thelstan's reef specifying amount given poor requiring reef free one penal slave annually

patrick wormald's verdict wa harsh hallmark thelstan's law-making gulf dividing exalted aspiration spasmodic impact view legislative activity thelstan's reign ha rightly dubbed 'feverish'
view simon keynes however without doubt impressive aspect king thelstan's government vitality law-making show driving official duty insisting respect law also demonstrates difficulty controlling troublesome people
keynes see grately code impressive piece legislation showing king's determination maintain social order
thelstan's nephew king edgar reformed monetary system give anglo-saxon england advanced currency europe good quality silver coinage wa uniform abundant
thelstan's time however wa far le developed minting wa still organised regionally long thelstan unified country
grately code included provision wa one coinage across king's dominion
however section appears copied code father list town mint confined south including london kent northern wessex regions
early thelstan's reign different style coin issued region conquered york received submission british king issued new coinage known circumscription cross type

example minted wessex york english mercia mercia bearing title rex saxorum east anglia danelaw
early new coinage wa issued crowned bust type king shown first time wearing crown three stalks
wa eventually issued region apart mercia issued coin without ruler portrait suggesting sarah foot's view mercian affection west saxon king brought among quickly declined
church state maintained close relation anglo-saxon period socially politically
churchman attended royal feast well meeting royal council
thelstan's reign relation became even closer especially archbishopric canterbury come west saxon jurisdiction since edward elder annexed mercia thelstan's conquest brought northern church control southern king first time
thelstan appointed member circle bishopric wessex possibly counter influence bishop winchester frithestan
one king's mass-priests priest employed say mass household lfheah became bishop well another beornstan succeeded frithestan bishop winchester

ancient royal line west saxon provided acceptable alternative especially wrongly claimed descent seventh-century king saint oswald wa venerated germany

chronicle source life thelstan limited first biography sarah foot wa published in
anglo-saxon chronicle thelstan's reign principally devoted military event largely silent apart recording important victories

david dumville go far dismiss william's account entirely regarding treacherous witness whose account unfortunately influential
however sarah foot inclined accept michael wood's argument william's chronicle draw lost life thelstan
caution however mean discovering far william improved original
dumville's view thelstan ha regarded historian shadowy figure ostensible lack source material argues lack apparent real
