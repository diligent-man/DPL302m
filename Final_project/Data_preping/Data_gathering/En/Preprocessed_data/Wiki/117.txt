thelstan or athelstan lst n old english elst n elst n old norse a alsteinn lit noble stone c october was king of the anglo saxons from to and king of the english from to his death in
he was the son of king edward the elder and his first wife ecgwynn
modern historians regard him as the first king of england and one of the greatest anglo saxon kings
he never married and had no children he was succeeded by his half brother edmund i
when edward died in july thelstan was accepted by the mercians as king
his half brother lfweard may have been recognised as king in wessex but died within three weeks of their father s death
thelstan encountered resistance in wessex for several months and was not crowned until september
in he conquered the last remaining viking kingdom york making him the first anglo saxon ruler of the whole of england
in he invaded scotland and forced constantine ii to submit to him
thelstan s rule was resented by the scots and vikings and in they invaded england
thelstan defeated them at the battle of brunanburh a victory that gave him great prestige both in the british isles and on the continent
after his death in the vikings seized back control of york and it was not finally reconquered until
thelstan centralised government he increased control over the production of charters and summoned leading figures from distant areas to his councils
these meetings were also attended by rulers from outside his territory especially welsh kings who thus acknowledged his overlordship
more legal texts survive from his reign than from any other th century english king
they show his concern about widespread robberies and the threat they posed to social order
his legal reforms built on those of his grandfather alfred the great
thelstan was one of the most pious west saxon kings and was known for collecting relics and founding churches
his household was the centre of english learning during his reign and it laid the foundation for the benedictine monastic reform later in the century
no other west saxon king played as important a role in european politics as thelstan and he arranged the marriages of several of his sisters to continental rulers
by the ninth century the many kingdoms of the early anglo saxon period had been consolidated into four wessex mercia northumbria and east anglia
in the eighth century mercia had been the most powerful kingdom in southern england but in the early ninth wessex became dominant under thelstan s great great grandfather egbert
in the middle of the century england came under increasing attack from viking raids culminating in invasion by the great heathen army in
by the vikings had overrun east anglia northumbria and mercia and nearly conquered wessex
the west saxons fought back under alfred the great and achieved a decisive victory at the battle of edington
alfred and the viking leader guthrum agreed on a division that gave the anglo saxons western mercia and eastern mercia to the vikings
in the s renewed viking attacks were successfully fought off by alfred assisted by his son and thelstan s father edward and thelred lord of the mercians
thelred ruled english mercia under alfred and was married to his daughter thelfl d
alfred died in and was succeeded by edward
thelwold the son of thelred king alfred s older brother and predecessor as king made a bid for power but was killed at the battle of the holme in
little is known of warfare between the english and the danes over the next few years but in edward sent a west saxon and mercian army to ravage northumbria
the following year the northumbrian danes attacked mercia but suffered a decisive defeat at the battle of tettenhall
thelred died in and was succeeded as ruler of mercia by his widow thelfl d
over the next decade edward and thelfl d conquered viking mercia and east anglia
thelfl d died in and was briefly succeeded by her daughter lfwynn but in the same year edward deposed her and took direct control of mercia
when edward died in he controlled all of england south of the humber
the viking king sihtric ruled the kingdom of york in southern northumbria but ealdred maintained anglo saxon rule in at least part of the former kingdom of bernicia from his base in bamburgh in northern northumbria
constantine ii ruled scotland apart from the southwest which was the british kingdom of strathclyde
wales was divided into a number of small kingdoms including deheubarth in the southwest gwent in the southeast brycheiniog immediately north of gwent and gwynedd in the north
according to the anglo norman historian william of malmesbury thelstan was thirty years old when he came to the throne in which would mean that he was born around
he was the oldest son of edward the elder
he was edward s only son by his first consort ecgwynn
very little is known about ecgwynn and she is not named in any contemporary source
medieval chroniclers gave varying descriptions of her rank one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth while others described her birth as noble
modern historians also disagree about her status
simon keynes and richard abels believe that leading figures in wessex were unwilling to accept thelstan as king in partly because his mother had been edward the elder s concubine
however barbara yorke and sarah foot argue that allegations that thelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession and that there is no reason to doubt that she was edward s legitimate wife
she may have been related to st dunstan
william of malmesbury wrote that alfred the great honoured his young grandson with a ceremony in which he gave him a scarlet cloak a belt set with gems and a sword with a gilded scabbard
medieval latin scholar michael lapidge and historian michael wood see this as designating thelstan as a potential heir at a time when the claim of alfred s nephew thelwold to the throne represented a threat to the succession of alfred s direct line but historian janet nelson suggests that it should be seen in the context of conflict between alfred and edward in the s and might reflect an intention to divide the realm between his son and his grandson after his death
historian martin ryan goes further suggesting that at the end of his life alfred may have favoured thelstan rather than edward as his successor
an acrostic poem praising prince adalstan and prophesying a great future for him has been interpreted by lapidge as referring to the young thelstan punning on the old english meaning of his name noble stone
lapidge and wood see the poem as a commemoration of alfred s ceremony by one of his leading scholars john the old saxon
in michael wood s view the poem confirms the truth of william of malmesbury s account of the ceremony
wood also suggests that thelstan may have been the first english king to be groomed from childhood as an intellectual and that john was probably his tutor
however sarah foot argues that the acrostic poem makes better sense if it is dated to the beginning of thelstan s reign
edward married his second wife lffl d at about the time of his father s death probably because ecgwynn had died although she may have been put aside
the new marriage weakened thelstan s position as his step mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons lfweard and edwin
by edward had taken a third wife eadgifu probably after putting lffl d aside
eadgifu also had two sons the future kings edmund and eadred
edward had several daughters perhaps as many as nine
thelstan s later education was probably at the mercian court of his aunt and uncle thelfl d and thelred and it is likely the young prince gained his military training in the mercian campaigns to conquer the danelaw
according to a transcript dating from in thelstan gave a charter of privileges to st oswald s priory gloucester where his aunt and uncle were buried according to a pact of paternal piety which he formerly pledged with thelred ealdorman of the people of the mercians
when edward took direct control of mercia after thelfl d s death in thelstan may have represented his father s interests there
edward died at farndon in northern mercia on july and the ensuing events are unclear
lfweard edward s eldest son by lffl d had ranked above thelstan in attesting a charter in and edward may have intended lfweard to be his successor as king either of wessex only or of the whole kingdom
if edward had intended his realms to be divided after his death his deposition of lfwynn in mercia in may have been intended to prepare the way for thelstan s succession as king of mercia
when edward died thelstan was apparently with him in mercia while lfweard was in wessex
mercia acknowledged thelstan as king and wessex may have chosen lfweard
however lfweard outlived his father by only sixteen days
even after lfweard s death there seems to have been opposition to thelstan in wessex particularly in winchester where lfweard was buried
at first thelstan behaved as a mercian king
a charter relating to land in derbyshire which appears to have been issued at a time in when his authority had not yet been recognised outside mercia was witnessed only by mercian bishops
in the view of historians david dumville and janet nelson he may have agreed not to marry or have heirs in order to gain acceptance
however sarah foot ascribes his decision to remain unmarried to a religiously motivated determination on chastity as a way of life
the coronation of thelstan took place on september at kingston upon thames perhaps due to its symbolic location on the border between wessex and mercia
he was crowned by the archbishop of canterbury athelm who probably designed or organised a new ordo religious order of service in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet
the new ordo was influenced by west frankish liturgy and in turn became one of the sources of the medieval french ordo
opposition seems to have continued even after the coronation
according to william of malmesbury an otherwise unknown nobleman called alfred plotted to blind thelstan on account of his supposed illegitimacy although it is unknown whether he aimed to make himself king or was acting on behalf of edwin lfweard s younger brother
blinding would have been a sufficient disability to render thelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder
tensions between thelstan and winchester seem to have continued for some years
the bishop of winchester frithestan did not attend the coronation or witness any of thelstan s known charters until
after that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in but was listed in a lower position than he was entitled to by his seniority
in edwin was drowned in a shipwreck in the north sea
his cousin adelolf count of boulogne took his body for burial at the abbey of saint bertin in saint omer
according to the abbey s annalist folcuin who wrongly believed that edwin had been king he had fled england driven by some disturbance in his kingdom
folcuin stated that thelstan sent alms to the abbey for his dead brother and received monks from the abbey graciously when they came to england although folcuin did not realise that thelstan died before the monks made the journey in
the twelfth century chronicler symeon of durham said that thelstan ordered edwin to be drowned but this is dismissed by most historians
edwin might have fled england after an unsuccessful rebellion against his brother s rule and his death may have put an end to winchester s opposition
edward the elder had conquered the danish territories in east mercia and east anglia with the assistance of thelfl d and her husband thelred but when edward died the danish king sihtric still ruled the viking kingdom of york formerly the southern northumbrian kingdom of deira
in january thelstan arranged for his only full sister to marry sihtric
the two kings agreed not to invade each other s territories or to support each other s enemies
the following year sihtric died and thelstan seized the chance to invade
guthfrith a cousin of sihtric led a fleet from dublin to try to take the throne but thelstan easily prevailed
he captured york and received the submission of the danish people
according to a southern chronicler he succeeded to the kingdom of the northumbrians and it is uncertain whether he had to fight guthfrith
southern kings had never ruled the north and his usurpation was met with outrage by the northumbrians who had always resisted southern control
however at eamont near penrith on july king constantine ii of alba king hywel dda of deheubarth ealdred of bamburgh and king owain of strathclyde or morgan ap owain of gwent accepted thelstan s overlordship
his triumph led to seven years of peace in the north
whereas thelstan was the first english king to achieve lordship over northern britain he inherited his authority over the welsh kings from his father and aunt
in the s gwent acknowledged the lordship of wessex and deheubarth and gwynedd accepted that of thelfl d following edward s takeover of mercia they transferred their allegiance to him
according to william of malmesbury after the meeting at eamont thelstan summoned the welsh kings to hereford where he imposed a heavy annual tribute and fixed the border between england and wales in the hereford area at the river wye
the dominant figure in wales was hywel dda of deheubarth described by the historian of early medieval wales thomas charles edwards as the firmest ally of the emperors of britain among all the kings of his day
welsh kings attended thelstan s court between and and witnessed charters at the head of the list of laity apart from the kings of scotland and strathclyde showing that their position was regarded as superior to that of the other great men present
the alliance produced peace between wales and england and within wales lasting throughout thelstan s reign though some welsh resented the status of their rulers as under kings as well as the high level of tribute imposed upon them
in armes prydein vawr the great prophecy of britain a welsh poet foresaw the day when the british would rise up against their saxon oppressors and drive them into the sea
according to william of malmesbury after the hereford meeting thelstan went on to expel the cornish from exeter fortify its walls and fix the cornish boundary at the river tamar
this account is regarded sceptically by historians however as cornwall had been under english rule since the mid ninth century
thomas charles edwards describes it as an improbable story while historian john reuben davies sees it as the suppression of a british revolt and the confinement of the cornish beyond the tamar
thelstan emphasised his control by establishing a new cornish see and appointing its first bishop but cornwall kept its own culture and language
thelstan became the first king of all the anglo saxon peoples and in effect overlord of britain
his successes inaugurated what john maddicott in his history of the origins of the english parliament calls the imperial phase of english kingship between about and when rulers from wales and scotland attended the assemblies of english kings and witnessed their charters
thelstan tried to reconcile the aristocracy in his new territory of northumbria to his rule
he lavished gifts on the minsters of beverley chester le street and york emphasising his christianity
he also purchased the vast territory of amounderness in lancashire and gave it to the archbishop of york his most important lieutenant in the region
but he remained a resented outsider and the northern british kingdoms preferred to ally with the pagan norse of dublin
in contrast to his strong control over southern britain his position in the north was far more tenuous
in thelstan invaded scotland
his reasons are unclear and historians give alternative explanations
the death of his half brother edwin in might have finally removed factions in wessex opposed to his rule
guthfrith the norse king of dublin who had briefly ruled northumbria died in any resulting insecurity among the danes would have given thelstan an opportunity to stamp his authority on the north
an entry in the annals of clonmacnoise recording the death in of a ruler who was possibly ealdred of bamburgh suggests another possible explanation
this points to a dispute between thelstan and constantine over control of his territory
the anglo saxon chronicle briefly recorded the expedition without explanation but the twelfth century chronicler john of worcester stated that constantine had broken his treaty with thelstan
thelstan set out on his campaign in may accompanied by four welsh kings hywel dda of deheubarth idwal foel of gwynedd morgan ap owain of gwent and tewdwr ap griffri of brycheiniog
his retinue also included eighteen bishops and thirteen earls six of whom were danes from eastern england
by late june or early july he had reached chester le street where he made generous gifts to the tomb of st cuthbert including a stole and maniple ecclesiastical garments originally commissioned by his step mother lffl d as a gift to bishop frithestan of winchester
the invasion was launched by land and sea
according to symeon of durham his land forces ravaged as far as dunnottar in north east scotland the furthest north that any english army had reached since ecgfrith s disastrous invasion in while the fleet raided caithness then probably part of the norse kingdom of orkney
no battles are recorded during the campaign and chronicles do not record its outcome
by september however he was back in the south of england at buckingham where constantine witnessed a charter as subregulus thus acknowledging thelstan s overlordship
in a charter was attested by constantine owain of strathclyde hywel dda idwal foel and morgan ap owain
at christmas of the same year owain of strathclyde was once more at thelstan s court along with the welsh kings but constantine was not
his return to england less than two years later would be in very different circumstances
in olaf guthfrithson succeeded his father guthfrith as the norse king of dublin
the alliance between the norse and the scots was cemented by the marriage of olaf to constantine s daughter
by august olaf had defeated his rivals for control of the viking part of ireland and he promptly launched a bid for the former norse kingdom of york
individually olaf and constantine were too weak to oppose thelstan but together they could hope to challenge the dominance of wessex
in the autumn they joined with the strathclyde britons under owain to invade england
medieval campaigning was normally conducted in the summer and thelstan could hardly have expected an invasion on such a large scale so late in the year
he seems to have been slow to react and an old latin poem preserved by william of malmesbury accused him of having languished in sluggish leisure
the allies plundered english territory while thelstan took his time gathering a west saxon and mercian army
however michael wood praises his caution arguing that unlike harold in he did not allow himself to be provoked into precipitate action
when he marched north the welsh did not join him and they did not fight on either side
the two sides met at the battle of brunanburh resulting in an overwhelming victory for thelstan supported by his young half brother the future king edmund
olaf escaped back to dublin with the remnant of his forces while constantine lost a son
the english also suffered heavy losses including two of thelstan s cousins sons of edward the elder s younger brother thelweard
the battle was reported in the annals of ulster
a great lamentable and horrible battle was cruelly fought between the saxons and the northmen in which several thousands of northmen who are uncounted fell but their king amlaib olaf escaped with a few followers
a large number of saxons fell on the other side but thelstan king of the saxons enjoyed a great victory a generation later the chronicler thelweard reported that it was popularly remembered as the great battle and it sealed thelstan s posthumous reputation as victorious because of god in the words of the homilist lfric of eynsham
the anglo saxon chronicle abandoned its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory employing imperial language to present thelstan as ruler of an empire of britain
the site of the battle is uncertain however and over thirty sites have been suggested with bromborough on the wirral the most favoured among historians
historians disagree over the significance of the battle
alex woolf describes it as a pyrrhic victory for thelstan the campaign seems to have ended in a stalemate his power appears to have declined and after he died olaf acceded to the kingdom of northumbria without resistance
alfred smyth describes it as the greatest battle in anglo saxon history but he also states that its consequences beyond thelstan s reign have been overstated
in the view of sarah foot on the other hand it would be difficult to exaggerate the battle s importance if the anglo saxons had been defeated their hegemony over the whole mainland of britain would have disintegrated
anglo saxon kings ruled through ealdormen who had the highest lay status under the king
in ninth century wessex they each ruled a single shire but by the middle of the tenth they had authority over a much wider area a change probably introduced by thelstan to deal with the problems of governing his extended realm
one of the ealdormen who was also called thelstan governed the eastern danelaw territory of east anglia the largest and wealthiest province of england
he became so powerful that he was later known as thelstan half king
several of the ealdormen who witnessed charters had scandinavian names and while the localities they came from cannot be identified they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led danish armies in the time of edward the elder and who were retained by thelstan as his representatives in local government
beneath the ealdormen reeves royal officials who were noble local landowners were in charge of a town or royal estate
the authority of church and state was not separated in early medieval societies and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan bishop and local abbots who also attended the king s royal councils
as the first king of all the anglo saxon peoples thelstan needed effective means to govern his extended realm
building on the foundations of his predecessors he created the most centralised government that england had yet seen
previously some charters had been produced by royal priests and others by members of religious houses but between and they were produced exclusively by a scribe known to historians as thelstan a showing an unprecedented degree of royal control over an important activity
unlike earlier and later charters thelstan a provides full details of the date and place of adoption and an unusually long witness list providing crucial information for historians
after thelstan a retired or died charters reverted to a simpler form suggesting that they had been the work of an individual rather than the development of a formal writing office
a key mechanism of government was the king s council witan in old english
anglo saxon kings did not have a fixed capital city
their courts were peripatetic and their councils were held at varying locations around their realms
thelstan stayed mainly in wessex however and controlled outlying areas by summoning leading figures to his councils
the small and intimate meetings that had been adequate until the enlargement of the kingdom under edward the elder gave way to large bodies attended by bishops ealdormen thegns magnates from distant areas and independent rulers who had submitted to his authority
frank stenton sees thelstan s councils as national assemblies which did much to break down the provincialism that was a barrier to the unification of england
john maddicott goes further seeing them as the start of centralised assemblies that had a defined role in english government and thelstan as the true if unwitting founder of the english parliament
the anglo saxons were the first people in northern europe to write administrative documents in the vernacular and law codes in old english go back to thelberht of kent at the beginning of the seventh century
the law code of alfred the great from the end of the ninth century was also written in the vernacular and he expected his ealdormen to learn it
his code was strongly influenced by carolingian law going back to charlemagne in such areas as treason peace keeping organisation of the hundreds and judicial ordeal
it remained in force throughout the tenth century and thelstan s codes were built on this foundation
legal codes required the approval of the king but they were treated as guidelines which could be adapted and added to at the local level rather than a fixed canon of regulations and customary oral law was also important in the anglo saxon period
more legal texts survive from thelstan s reign than from any other tenth century english king
the earliest appear to be his tithe edict and the ordinance on charities
four legal codes were adopted at royal councils in the early s at grately in hampshire exeter faversham in kent and thunderfield in surrey
local legal texts survive from london and kent and one concerning the duns te on the welsh border probably also dates to thelstan s reign
in the view of the historian of english law patrick wormald the laws must have been written by wulfhelm who succeeded athelm as archbishop of canterbury in
other historians see wulfhelm s role as less important giving the main credit to thelstan himself although the significance placed on the ordeal as an ecclesiastical ritual shows the increased influence of the church
nicholas brooks sees the role of the bishops as marking an important stage in the increasing involvement of the church in the making and enforcement of law
the two earliest codes were concerned with clerical matters and thelstan stated that he acted on the advice of wulfhelm and his bishops
the first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church
the second enforces the duty of charity on thelstan s reeves specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually
his religious outlook is shown in a wider sacralization of the law in his reign
the later codes show his concern with threats to social order especially robbery which he regarded as the most important manifestation of social breakdown
the first of these later codes issued at grately prescribed harsh penalties including the death penalty for anyone over twelve years old caught in the act of stealing goods worth more than eight pence
this apparently had little effect as thelstan admitted in the exeter code i king thelstan declare that i have learned that the public peace has not been kept to the extent either of my wishes or of the provisions laid down at grately and my councillors say that i have suffered this too long in desperation the council tried a different strategy offering an amnesty to thieves if they paid compensation to their victims
the problem of powerful families protecting criminal relatives was to be solved by expelling them to other parts of the realm
this strategy did not last long and at thunderfield thelstan returned to the hard line softened by raising the minimum age for the death penalty to fifteen because he thought it too cruel to kill so many young people and for such small crimes as he understood to be the case everywhere
his reign saw the first introduction of the system of tithing sworn groups of ten or more men who were jointly responsible for peace keeping later known as frankpledge
sarah foot commented that tithing and oath taking to deal with the problem of theft had its origin in frankia but the equation of theft with disloyalty to thelstan s person appears peculiar to him
his preoccupation with theft tough on theft tough on the causes of theft finds no direct parallel in other kings codes
historians differ widely regarding thelstan s legislation
patrick wormald s verdict was harsh the hallmark of thelstan s law making is the gulf dividing its exalted aspirations from his spasmodic impact in his view the legislative activity of thelstan s reign has rightly been dubbed feverish
but the extant results are frankly a mess
in the view of simon keynes however without any doubt the most impressive aspect of king thelstan s government is the vitality of his law making which shows him driving his officials to do their duties and insisting on respect for the law but also demonstrates the difficulty he had in controlling a troublesome people
keynes sees the grately code as an impressive piece of legislation showing the king s determination to maintain social order
in the s thelstan s nephew king edgar reformed the monetary system to give anglo saxon england the most advanced currency in europe with a good quality silver coinage which was uniform and abundant
in thelstan s time however it was far less developed and minting was still organised regionally long after thelstan unified the country
the grately code included a provision that there was to be only one coinage across the king s dominion
however this is in a section that appears to be copied from a code of his father and the list of towns with mints is confined to the south including london and kent but not northern wessex or other regions
early in thelstan s reign different styles of coin were issued in each region but after he conquered york and received the submission of the other british kings he issued a new coinage known as the circumscription cross type
this advertised his newly exalted status with the inscription rex totius britanniae
examples were minted in wessex york and english mercia in mercia bearing the title rex saxorum but not in east anglia or the danelaw
in the early s a new coinage was issued the crowned bust type with the king shown for the first time wearing a crown with three stalks
this was eventually issued in all regions apart from mercia which issued coins without a ruler portrait suggesting in sarah foot s view that any mercian affection for a west saxon king brought up among them quickly declined
church and state maintained close relations in the anglo saxon period both socially and politically
churchmen attended royal feasts as well as meetings of the royal council
during thelstan s reign these relations became even closer especially as the archbishopric of canterbury had come under west saxon jurisdiction since edward the elder annexed mercia and thelstan s conquests brought the northern church under the control of a southern king for the first time
thelstan appointed members of his own circle to bishoprics in wessex possibly to counter the influence of the bishop of winchester frithestan
one of the king s mass priests priests employed to say mass in his household lfheah became bishop of wells while another beornstan succeeded frithestan as bishop of winchester
beornstan was succeeded by another member of the royal household also called lfheah
two of the leading figures in the later tenth century benedictine monastic reform in edgar s reign dunstan and thelwold served in early life at thelstan s court and were ordained as priests by lfheah of winchester at the king s request
according to thelwold s biographer wulfstan thelwold spent a long period in the royal palace in the king s inseparable companionship and learned much from the king s wise men that was useful and profitable to him
oda a future archbishop of canterbury was also close to thelstan who appointed him bishop of ramsbury
oda may have been present at the battle of brunanburh
thelstan was a noted collector of relics and while this was a common practice at the time he was marked out by the scale of his collection and the refinement of its contents
the abbot of saint samson in dol sent him some as a gift and in his covering letter he wrote we know you value relics more than earthly treasure
thelstan was also a generous donor of manuscripts and relics to churches and monasteries
his reputation was so great that some monastic scribes later falsely claimed that their institutions had been beneficiaries of his largesse
he was especially devoted to the cult of st
cuthbert in chester le street and his gifts to the community there included bede s lives of cuthbert
he commissioned it especially to present to chester le street and out of all manuscripts he gave to a religious foundation which survive it is the only one which was wholly written in england during his reign
it has a portrait of thelstan presenting the book to cuthbert the earliest surviving manuscript portrait of an english king
in the view of janet nelson his rituals of largesse and devotion at sites of supernatural power
enhanced royal authority and underpinned a newly united imperial realm
thelstan had a reputation for founding churches although it is unclear how justified this is
according to late and dubious sources these churches included minsters at milton abbas in dorset and muchelney in somerset
in the view of historian john blair the reputation is probably well founded but these waters are muddied by thelstan s almost folkloric reputation as a founder which made him a favourite hero of later origin myths
however while he was a generous donor to monasteries he did not give land for new ones or attempt to revive the ones in the north and east destroyed by viking attacks
he also sought to build ties with continental churches
cenwald was a royal priest before his appointment as bishop of worcester and in he accompanied two of thelstan s half sisters to the saxon court so that the future holy roman emperor otto could choose one of them as his wife
cenwald went on to make a tour of german monasteries giving lavish gifts on thelstan s behalf and receiving in return promises that the monks would pray for the king and others close to him in perpetuity
england and saxony became closer after the marriage alliance and german names start to appear in english documents while cenwald kept up the contacts he had made by subsequent correspondence helping the transmission of continental ideas about reformed monasticism to england
thelstan built on his grandfather s efforts to revive ecclesiastical scholarship which had fallen to a low state in the second half of the ninth century
john blair described thelstan s achievement as a determined reconstruction visible to us especially through the circulation and production of books of the shattered ecclesiastical culture
he was renowned in his own day for his piety and promotion of sacred learning
his interest in education and his reputation as a collector of books and relics attracted a cosmopolitan group of ecclesiastical scholars to his court particularly bretons and irish
thelstan gave extensive aid to breton clergy who had fled brittany following its conquest by the vikings in
he made a confraternity agreement with the clergy of dol cathedral in brittany who were then in exile in central france and they sent him the relics of breton saints apparently hoping for his patronage
the contacts resulted in a surge in interest in england for commemorating breton saints
one of the most notable scholars at thelstan s court was israel the grammarian who may have been a breton
israel and a certain frank drew a board game called gospel dice for an irish bishop dub innse who took it home to bangor
thelstan s court played a crucial role in the origins of the english monastic reform movement
few prose narrative sources survive from thelstan s reign but it produced an abundance of poetry much of it norse influenced praise of the king in grandiose terms such as the brunanburh poem
sarah foot even makes a case that beowulf may have been composed in thelstan s circle
thelstan s court was the centre of a revival of the elaborate hermeneutic style of later latin writers influenced by the west saxon scholar aldhelm c and by early tenth century french monasticism
foreign scholars at thelstan s court such as israel the grammarian were practitioners
the style was characterised by long convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms
the thelstan a charters were written in hermeneutic latin
in the view of simon keynes it is no coincidence that they first appear immediately after the king had for the first time united england under his rule and they show a high level of intellectual attainment and a monarchy invigorated by success and adopting the trappings of a new political order
the style influenced architects of the late tenth century monastic reformers educated at thelstan s court such as thelwold and dunstan and became a hallmark of the movement
after thelstan a charters became more simple but the hermeneutic style returned in the charters of eadwig and edgar
the historian w
stevenson commented in
the object of the compilers of these charters was to express their meaning by the use of the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent bombastic words they could find
every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight
the invocation with its appended clauses opening with pompous and partly alliterative words will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter leaving the reader dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences however michael lapidge argues that however unpalatable the hermeneutic style seems to modern taste it was an important part of late anglo saxon culture and deserves more sympathetic attention than it has received from modern historians
in the view of historian david woodman thelstan a should be accorded recognition as an individual author of no little genius a man who not only overhauled the legal form of the diploma but also had the ability to write latin that is as enduringly fascinating as it is complex
in many ways the diplomas of thelstan a represent the stylistic peak of the anglo saxon diplomatic tradition a fitting complement to thelstan s own momentous political feats and to the forging of what would become england
historians frequently comment on thelstan s grand and extravagant titles
on his coins and charters he is described as rex totius britanniae or king of the whole of britain
a gospel book he donated to christ church canterbury is inscribed thelstan king of the english and ruler of the whole of britain with a devout mind gave this book to the primatial see of canterbury to the church dedicated to christ
in charters from he is king of the english elevated by the right hand of the almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of britain and in one manuscript dedication he is even styled basileus et curagulus the titles of byzantine emperors
some historians are not impressed
clearly comments alex woolf king thelstan was a man who had pretensions while in the view of simon keynes thelstan a proclaimed his master king of britain by wishful extension
but according to george molyneaux this is to apply an anachronistic standard tenth century kings had a loose but real hegemony throughout the island and their titles only appear inflated if one assumes that kingship ought to involve domination of an intensity like that seen within the english kingdom of the eleventh and later centuries
the west saxon court had connections with the carolingians going back to the marriage between thelstan s great grandfather thelwulf and judith daughter of the king of west francia and future holy roman emperor charles the bald as well as the marriage of alfred the great s daughter lfthryth to judith s son by a later marriage baldwin ii count of flanders
one of thelstan s half sisters eadgifu married charles the simple king of the west franks in the late s
he was deposed in and eadgifu sent their son louis to safety in england
by thelstan s time the connection was well established and his coronation was performed with the carolingian ceremony of anointment probably to draw a deliberate parallel between his rule and carolingian tradition
his crowned bust coinage of was the first anglo saxon coinage to show the king crowned following carolingian iconography
like his father thelstan was unwilling to marry his female relatives to his own subjects so his sisters either entered nunneries or married foreign husbands
this was one reason for his close relations with european courts and he married several of his half sisters to european nobles in what historian sheila sharp called a flurry of dynastic bridal activity unequalled again until queen victoria s time
another reason lay in the common interest on both sides of the channel in resisting the threat from the vikings while the rise in the power and reputation of the royal house of wessex made marriage with an english princess more prestigious to european rulers
in hugh duke of the franks sent thelstan s cousin adelolf count of boulogne on an embassy to ask for the hand of one of thelstan s sisters
according to william of malmesbury the gifts adelolf brought included spices jewels many swift horses a crown of solid gold the sword of constantine the great charlemagne s lance and a piece of the crown of thorns
thelstan sent his half sister eadhild to be hugh s wife
thelstan s most important european alliance was with the new liudolfing dynasty in east francia
the carolingian dynasty of east francia had died out in the early tenth century and its new liudolfing king henry the fowler was seen by many as an arriviste
he needed a royal marriage for his son to establish his legitimacy but no suitable carolingian princesses were available
the ancient royal line of the west saxons provided an acceptable alternative especially as they wrongly claimed descent from the seventh century king and saint oswald who was venerated in germany
in or henry sent ambassadors to thelstan s court seeking a wife for his son otto who later became holy roman emperor
thelstan sent two of his half sisters and otto chose eadgyth
fifty years later thelweard a descendant of alfred the great s older brother addressed his latin version of the anglo saxon chronicle to mathilde abbess of essen who was eadgyth s granddaughter and had apparently requested it
the other sister whose name is uncertain was married to a prince from near the alps who has not definitely been identified
in early medieval europe it was common for kings to act as foster fathers for the sons of other kings
thelstan was known for the support he gave to dispossessed young royalty
in he sent an english fleet to help his foster son alan ii duke of brittany to regain his ancestral lands which had been conquered by the vikings
in the same year he assisted the son of his half sister eadgifu louis to take the throne of west francia and in he sent another fleet that unsuccessfully attempted to help louis in a struggle with rebellious magnates
according to later scandinavian sources he helped another possible foster son hakon son of harald fairhair king of norway to reclaim his throne and he was known among norwegians as thelstan the good
thelstan s court was perhaps the most cosmopolitan of the anglo saxon period
the close contacts between the english and european courts ended soon after his death but descent from the english royal house long remained a source of prestige for continental ruling families
according to frank stenton in his history of the period anglo saxon england between offa and cnut there is no english king who played so prominent or so sustained a part in the general affairs of europe
foreign contemporaries described him in panegyrical terms
the french chronicler flodoard described him as the king from overseas and the annals of ulster as the pillar of the dignity of the western world
some historians take a similar view
michael wood titled an essay the making of king aethelstan s empire an english charlemagne and described him as the most powerful ruler that britain had seen since the romans
in the view of veronica ortenberg he was the most powerful ruler in europe with an army that had repeatedly defeated the vikings continental rulers saw him as a carolingian emperor who was clearly treated as the new charlemagne
she wrote
wessex kings carried an aura of power and success which made them increasingly powerful in the s while most continental houses were in military trouble and engaged in internecine warfare
while the civil wars and the viking attacks on the continent had spelled the end of unity of the carolingian empire which had already disintegrated into separate kingdoms military success had enabled thelstan to triumph at home and to attempt to go beyond the reputation of a great heroic dynasty of warrior kings in order to develop a carolingian ideology of kingship thelstan died at gloucester on october
his grandfather alfred his father edward and his half brother lfweard had been buried at winchester but thelstan chose not to honour the city associated with opposition to his rule
by his own wish he was buried at malmesbury abbey where he had buried his cousins who died at brunanburh
no other member of the west saxon royal family was buried there and according to william of malmesbury thelstan s choice reflected his devotion to the abbey and to the memory of its seventh century abbot saint aldhelm
william described thelstan as fair haired as i have seen for myself in his remains beautifully intertwined with gold threads
his bones were lost during the reformation but he is commemorated by an empty fifteenth century tomb
after thelstan s death the men of york immediately chose the viking king of dublin olaf guthfrithson as their king and anglo saxon control of the north seemingly made safe by the victory of brunanburh collapsed
the reigns of thelstan s half brothers edmund and eadred were largely devoted to regaining control
olaf seized the east midlands leading to the establishment of a frontier at watling street
in olaf died and edmund took back control of the east midlands in and then york in
following edmund s death york again switched back to viking control and it was only when the northumbrians finally drove out their norwegian viking king eric bloodaxe in and submitted to eadred that anglo saxon control of the whole of england was finally restored
chronicle sources for the life of thelstan are limited and the first biography by sarah foot was only published in
the anglo saxon chronicle in thelstan s reign is principally devoted to military events and it is largely silent apart from recording his most important victories
an important source is the twelfth century chronicle of william of malmesbury but historians are cautious about accepting his testimony much of which cannot be verified from other sources
david dumville goes so far as to dismiss william s account entirely regarding him as a treacherous witness whose account is unfortunately influential
however sarah foot is inclined to accept michael wood s argument that william s chronicle draws on a lost life of thelstan
she cautions however that we have no means of discovering how far william improved on the original
in dumville s view thelstan has been regarded by historians as a shadowy figure because of an ostensible lack of source material but he argues that the lack is more apparent than real
charters law codes and coins throw considerable light on thelstan s government
the scribe known to historians as thelstan a who was responsible for drafting all charters between and provides very detailed information including signatories dates and locations illuminating thelstan s progress around his realm
thelstan a may have been bishop lfwine of lichfield who was close to the king
by contrast with this extensive source of information no charters survive from to a gap which historians struggle to explain and which makes it difficult to assess the degree of continuity in personnel and the operation of government between the reigns of edward and thelstan
historians are also paying increasing attention to less conventional sources such as contemporary poetry in his praise and manuscripts associated with his name
the reign of thelstan has been overshadowed by the achievements of his grandfather alfred the great but he is now considered one of the greatest kings of the west saxon dynasty
modern historians endorse the view of twelfth century chronicler william of malmesbury that no one more just or more learned ever governed the kingdom
frank stenton and simon keynes both describe him as the one anglo saxon king who will bear comparison with alfred
in keynes s view he has long been regarded with good reason as a towering figure in the landscape of the tenth century
he has also been hailed as the first king of england as a statesman of international standing
david dumville describes thelstan as the father of mediaeval and modern england while michael wood regards offa alfred and thelstan as the three greatest anglo saxon kings and thelstan as one of the more important lay intellectuals in anglo saxon history
thelstan is regarded as the first king of england by modern historians
although it was his successors who would achieve the permanent conquest of viking york thelstan s campaigns made this success possible
his nephew edgar called himself king of the english and revived the claim to rule over all the peoples of britain
simon keynes argued that the consistent usages of edgar s reign represent nothing less than a determined reaffirmation of the polity created by thelstan in the s
historian charles insley however sees thelstan s hegemony as fragile the level of overlordship wielded by thelstan during the s over the rest of britain was perhaps not attained again by an english king until edward i george molyneaux argues that
the tendency of some modern historians to celebrate thelstan as the first king of england is however problematic since there is little sign that in his day the title rex anglorum was closely or consistently tied to an area similar to that which we consider england
when thelstan s rule was associated with any definite geographical expanse the territory in question was usually the whole island of britain simon keynes saw thelstan s law making as his greatest achievement
his reign predates the sophisticated state of the later anglo saxon period but his creation of the most centralised government england had yet seen with the king and his council working strategically to ensure acceptance of his authority and laws laid the foundations on which his brothers and nephews would create one of the wealthiest and most advanced systems of government in europe
thelstan s reign built upon his grandfather s ecclesiastical programme consolidating the ecclesiastical revival and laying the foundation for the monastic reform movement later in the century
thelstan s reputation was at its height when he died
according to sarah foot he found acclaim in his own day not only as a successful military leader and effective monarch but also as a man of devotion committed to the promotion of religion and the patronage of learning later in the century thelweard praised him as a very mighty king worthy of honour and thelred the unready who named his eight sons after his predecessors put thelstan first as the name of his eldest son
in his biography of thelred levi roach commented the king was clearly proud of his family and the fact that thelstan stands atop this list speaks volumes though later overtaken by alfred the great in fame in the s it must have seemed as if everything had begun with the king s great uncle a view with which many modern historians would be inclined to concur
memory of thelstan then declined until it was revived by william of malmesbury who took a special interest in him as the one king who had chosen to be buried in his own house
william s account kept his memory alive and he was praised by other medieval chroniclers
in the early sixteenth century william tyndale justified his english translation of the bible by stating that he had read that king thelstan had caused the holy scriptures to be translated into anglo saxon
from the sixteenth century onwards alfred s reputation became dominant and thelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness
sharon turner s history of the anglo saxons first published between and played a crucial role in promoting anglo saxon studies and he helped to establish brunanburh as a key battle in english history but his treatment of thelstan was slight in comparison with alfred
charles dickens had only one paragraph on thelstan in his child s history of england and although anglo saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth century artists and alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the royal academy between and there was not one picture of thelstan
williams comments if thelstan has not had the reputation which accrued to his grandfather the fault lies in the surviving sources thelstan had no biographer and the chronicle for his reign is scanty
in his own day he was the roof tree of the honour of the western world
