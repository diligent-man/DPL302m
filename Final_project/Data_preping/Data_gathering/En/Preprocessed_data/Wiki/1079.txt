The international recognition that women have a right to a life free from violence is a recent one emerging around Historically their struggles with violence and with the impunity that often protects the perpetrators is linked with their fight to overcome discrimination Since its founding the United Nations has concerned itself with the advancement of women's rights through institutions such as the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women CSW but did not specifically target the high rates of females who were targeted with violence until the early s The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women CEDAW never mentioned violence against women the June Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action VDPA was the first international document to explicitly condemn violence against women The DEVAW resolution was developed as an extension of CEDAW and explicitly states that the strengthening and complementing of CEDAW is one of its goals
In September the CSW appointed a special working group to prepare a draft declaration against violence against women One of the aims of the resolution was to overturn the prevailing governmental stance that violence against women was a private domestic matter not requiring state intervention At the time it was known that wife beating often grouped under the terms domestic violence or intimate partner violence was the most common form of violence against women For example Levinson found that in of ninety studied cultures there was structural violence by husbands against their wives other studies at the time demonstrated a similar cross cultural pattern The health consequences of such violence were considerable for example in the United States it was the leading cause of injuries in women of women who visited emergency rooms did so because of symptoms of partner abuse and wife beating led times more often to the need for psychiatric treatment and times more often to suicide attempts than in other women Furthermore sexual violence including rape were increasingly recognised as a problem that affected a significant percentage of all women To mark International Women's Day on March General Secretary Boutros Boutros Ghali issued a statement in preparation of the declaration explicitly outlining the UN's role in the 'promotion' and 'protection' of women's rights
