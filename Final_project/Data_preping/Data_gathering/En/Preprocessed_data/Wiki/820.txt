indentured servitude is a form of labor in which a person is contracted to work without salary for a specific number of years
the contract called an indenture may be entered voluntarily for eventual compensation or debt repayment or it may be imposed as a judicial punishment
historically it has been used to pay for apprenticeships typically when an apprentice agreed to work for free for a master tradesman to learn a trade similar to a modern internship but for a fixed length of time usually seven years or less
later it was also used as a way for a person to pay the cost of transportation to colonies in the americas
like any loan an indenture could be sold most employers had to depend on middlemen to recruit and transport the workers so indentures indentured workers were commonly bought and sold when they arrived at their destinations
like prices of slaves their price went up or down depending on supply and demand
when the indenture loan was paid off the worker was free
sometimes they might be given a plot of land
indentured workers could usually marry move about locally as long as the work got done read whatever they wanted and take classes
until the late th century indentured servitude was common in british america
it was often a way for europeans usually from ireland reference needed to migrate to the american colonies they signed an indenture in return for a costly passage
however the system was also used to exploit asians mostly from india and china who wanted to migrate to the new world
these asian people were used mainly to construct roads and railway systems
after their indenture expired the immigrants were free to work for themselves or another employer
at least one economist has suggested that indentured servitude occurred largely as an institutional response to a capital market imperfection
in some cases the indenture was made with a ship s master who sold the indenture to an employer in the colonies
most indentured servants worked as farm laborers or domestic servants although some were apprenticed to craftsmen
the terms of an indenture were not always enforced by american courts although runaways were usually sought out and returned to their employer
between one half and two thirds of european immigrants to the american colonies between the s and american revolution came under indentures
however while almost half the european immigrants to the thirteen colonies were indentured servants at any one time they were outnumbered by workers who had never been indentured or whose indenture had expired and thus free wage labor was the more prevalent for europeans in the colonies
indentured people were numerically important mostly in the region from virginia north to new jersey
other colonies saw far fewer of them
the total number of european immigrants to all colonies before was about of these were involuntary prisoners
of the or so european arrivals who came voluntarily tomlins estimates that were indentured
about of these were under the age of
the age of adulthood for men was years not those over generally came on contracts lasting about years
regarding the children who came gary nash reports that many of the servants were actually nephews nieces cousins and children of friends of emigrating englishmen who paid their passage in return for their labor once in america
several instances of kidnapping for transportation to the americas are recorded such as that of peter williamson
as historian richard hofstadter pointed out although efforts were made to regulate or check their activities and they diminished in importance in the eighteenth century it remains true that a certain small part of the european colonial population of america was brought by force and a much larger portion came in response to deceit and misrepresentation on the part of the spirits recruiting agents one spirit named william thiene was known to have spirited away people from britain to the colonies in a single year
historian lerone bennett jr
notes that masters given to flogging often did not care whether their victims were black or white
also during the th and early th centuries children from the uk were often kidnapped and sold into indentured labor in the american and caribbean colonies often without any indentures
indentured servitude was also used by governments in britain as a punishment for captured prisoners of war in rebellions and civil wars
oliver cromwell sent into indentured service thousands of prisoners captured in the battle of preston and the battle of worcester
king james ii acted similarly after the monmouth rebellion in and use of such measures continued into the th century
indentured servants could not marry without the permission of their master were sometimes subject to physical punishment and did not receive legal favor from the courts
female indentured servants in particular might be raped and or sexually abused by their masters
if children were produced the labour would be extended by years
cases of successful prosecution for these crimes were very uncommon as indentured servants were unlikely to have access to a magistrate and social pressure to avoid such brutality could vary by geography and cultural norm
the situation was particularly difficult for indentured women because in both low social class and gender citation needed they were believed to be particularly prone to vice making legal redress unusual
the american revolution severely limited immigration to the united states but economic historians dispute its long term impact
sharon salinger argues that the economic crisis that followed the war made long term labor contracts unattractive
his analysis of philadelphia s population shows how the percentage of bound citizens fell from to over the course of the war
william miller posits a more moderate theory stating that the revolution wrought disturbances upon white servitude
but these were temporary rather than lasting
david galenson supports this theory by proposing that the numbers of british indentured servants never recovered and that europeans from other nationalities replaced them
indentured servitude began its decline after bacon s rebellion
bacon s rebellion was a servant uprising against the government of colonial virginia
this was due to multiple factors such as the treatment of servants support of native tribes in the surrounding area a refusal to expand the amount of land an indentured servant could work by the colonial government and inequality between the upper and lower class in colonial society
indentured servitude was the primary source of labor for early american colonists up until the rebellion
little changed in the immediate aftermath of bacon s rebellion however the rebellion did cause a general distrust of servant labor and fear of future rebellion
the fear of indentured servitude would eventually cement itself into the hearts of americans leading towards the reliance on enslaved africans
this helped to ingrain the idea of racial segregation and unite white americans under race rather than economic or social class
doing so would prevent the potential for future rebellion and change the way that agriculture was approached in the future
the american and british governments passed several laws that helped foster the decline of indentures
the uk parliament s passenger vessels act regulated travel conditions aboard ships to make transportation more expensive so as to hinder landlords tenants seeking a better life
an american law passed in abolished the imprisonment of debtors which made prosecuting runaway servants more difficult increasing the risk of indenture contract purchases
the th amendment passed in the wake of the american civil war made indentured servitude illegal in the united states
through its introduction the details regarding indentured labor varied across import and export regions and most overseas contracts were made before the voyage with the understanding that prospective migrants were competent enough to make overseas contracts on their own account and that they preferred to have a contract before the voyage
most labor contracts made were in increments of five years with the opportunity to extend another five years
many contracts also provided free passage home after the dictated labor was completed
however there were generally no policies regulating employers once the labor hours were completed which led to frequent ill treatment
in the european population of barbados was of the population
during the wars of the three kingdoms at least scottish and irish prisoners of war were transported as indentured laborers to the colonies
a half million europeans went as indentured servants to the caribbean primarily the english speaking islands of the caribbean before
in with the abolition of slavery at its onset the british were in the process of transporting a million indians out of india and into the caribbean to take the place of the recently freed africans freed in in indentureship
women looking for what they believed would be a better life in the colonies were specifically sought after and recruited at a much higher rate than men due to the high population of men already in the colonies
however women had to prove their status as single and eligible to emigrate as married women could not leave without their husbands
many women seeking escape from abusive relationships were willing to take that chance
the indian immigration act of prevented women from exiting india as widowed or single in order to escape
arrival in the colonies brought unexpected conditions of poverty homelessness and little to no food as the high numbers of emigrants overwhelmed the small villages and flooded the labor market
many were forced into signing labor contracts that exposed them to the hard field labor on the plantation
additionally on arrival to the plantation single women were assigned a man as they were not allowed to live alone
the subtle difference between slavery and indenture ship is best seen here as women were still subjected to the control of the plantation owners as well as their newly assigned partner
the indian indenture system was a system of indenture a form of debt bondage by which million indians called coolies were transported to various colonies of european powers to provide labour for the mainly sugar plantations
it started from the end of slavery in and continued until
this resulted in the development of a large indian diaspora which spread from the indian ocean i e
r union and mauritius to pacific ocean i e
fiji as well as the growth of indo caribbean and indo african population
the british wanted local black africans to work in natal as workers
but the locals refused and as a result the british introduced the indian indenture system resulting in a permanent indian south african presence
on january the government of the french indian ocean island of r union laid down terms for the introduction of indian labourers to the colony
each man was required to appear before a magistrate and declare that he was going voluntarily
the contract was for five years with pay of us per month and rations provided labourers had been transported from pondicherry and karaikal
the first attempt at importing indian labour into mauritius in ended in failure but by with abolition of slavery throughout most of the british empire transportation of indian labour to the island gained pace
by indian labourers had been transported to mauritius
after the end of slavery the west indian sugar colonies tried the use of emancipated slaves families from ireland germany and malta and portuguese from madeira
all these efforts failed to satisfy the labour needs of the colonies due to high mortality of the new arrivals and their reluctance to continue working at the end of their indenture
on november the british indian government legalised emigration to jamaica trinidad and demerara guyana
the first ship the whitby sailed from port calcutta for british guiana on january and arrived in berbice on may
transportation to the caribbean stopped in due to problems in the sugar industry and resumed in demerara and trinidad in and jamaica in
this system of labour was coined by contemporaries at the time as a new system of slavery a term later used by historian hugh tinker in his largely influential book of the same name
the indian indenture system was finally banned in
according to the economist when the indian legislative council finally ended indenture it did so because of pressure from indian nationalists and declining profitability rather than from humanitarian concerns
convicts transported to the australian colonies before the s often found themselves hired out in a form of indentured labor
indentured servants also emigrated to new south wales
the van diemen s land company used skilled indentured labor for periods of seven years or less
a similar scheme for the swan river area of western australia existed between and
during the s planters in australia fiji new caledonia and the samoa islands in need of laborers encouraged a trade in long term indentured labor called blackbirding
at the height of the labor trade more than one half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad
over a period of years from the mid th century to the early th century labor for the sugar cane fields of queensland australia included an element of coercive recruitment and indentured servitude of the south sea islanders
the workers came mainly from melanesia mainly from the solomon islands and vanuatu with a small number from polynesian and micronesian areas such as samoa the gilbert islands subsequently known as kiribati and the ellice islands subsequently known as tuvalu
they became collectively known as kanakas
it remains unknown how many islanders the trade controversially kidnapped
whether the system legally recruited islanders persuaded deceived coerced or forced them to leave their homes and travel by ship to queensland remains difficult to determine
official documents and accounts from the period often conflict with the oral tradition passed down to the descendants of workers
stories of blatantly violent kidnapping tend to relate to the first years of the trade
australia deported many of these islanders back to their places of origin in the period under the provisions of the pacific island labourers act
australia s own colonies of papua and new guinea joined after the second world war to form papua new guinea were the last jurisdictions in the world to use indentured servitude
a significant number of construction projects in british east africa and south africa required vast quantities of labor exceeding the availability or willingness of local tribesmen
indentured coolies from india were imported for such projects as the uganda railway as farm labor and as miners
they and their descendants formed a significant portion of the population and economy of kenya and uganda although not without engendering resentment from others
idi amin s expulsion of the asians from uganda in was an expulsion of indo africans
the majority of the population of mauritius are descendants of indian indentured labourers brought in between and
initially brought to work the sugar estates following the abolition of slavery in the british empire an estimated half a million indentured laborers were present on the island during this period
aapravasi ghat in the bay at port louis and now a unesco site was the first british colony to serve as a major reception centre for indentured servants from india who came to work on plantations following the abolition of slavery
the universal declaration of human rights adopted by the united nations general assembly in declares in article no one shall be held in slavery or servitude slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms
more specifically it is dealt with by article a of the united nations supplementary convention on the abolition of slavery
however only national legislation can establish the unlawfulness of indentured labor in a specific jurisdiction
in the united states the victims of trafficking and violence protection act vtvpa of extended servitude to cover peonage as well as involuntary servitude
