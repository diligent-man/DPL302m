a slinky is a precompressed helical spring toy invented by richard james in the early s
it can perform a number of tricks including travelling down a flight of steps end over end as it stretches and re forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum or appear to levitate for a period of time after it has been dropped
these interesting characteristics have contributed to its success as a toy in its home country of the united states resulting in many popular toys with slinky components in a wide range of countries
the slinky was invented and developed by american naval engineer richard t
james in and demonstrated at gimbels department store in philadelphia in november
the toy was a hit selling its entire inventory of units in minutes
james and his wife betty formed james industries in clifton heights pennsylvania to manufacture slinky and several related toys such as the slinky dog and suzie the slinky worm
in james s wife betty james became president of james industries and in moved it back to hollidaysburg pennsylvania
in she sold the company to poof products inc
the slinky was originally priced at but many paid much more due to price increases of spring steel in pennsylvania
it has however remained modestly priced throughout its history as a result of betty james concern about the toy s affordability for less affluent customers
in addition to its use as a toy it has been used as a classroom teaching tool as a portable and extendable radio antenna in wartime particularly the vietnam war and in nasa physics experiments when astronaut margaret rhea seddon demonstrated its behavior in zero gravity during a telecast from the discovery space shuttle in
it was inducted into the national toy hall of fame at the strong in rochester new york in
in it was named to the toy industry association s century of toys list
in its first years about million have been sold
in richard t james a naval mechanical engineer stationed at the william cramp sons shipyards in philadelphia was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ship in rough seas
james accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf and watched as the spring stepped in a series of arcs to a stack of books to a tabletop and to the floor where it re coiled itself and stood upright
james s wife betty later recalled he came home and said i think if i got the right property of steel and the right tension i could make it walk james experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year and finally found a spring that would walk
betty was dubious at first but changed her mind after the toy was fine tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it
she dubbed the toy slinky meaning sleek and graceful after finding the word in a dictionary and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing
with a usd loan the couple formed james industries originally james spring wire company had slinky units made by a local machine shop hand wrapped each in yellow paper and priced them at a piece
each was tall and included coils of high grade blue black swedish steel
the jameses had difficulty selling slinky to toy stores but in november they were granted permission to set up an inclined plane in the toy section of gimbels department store in philadelphia to demonstrate the toy
slinky was a hit and the first units were sold within ninety minutes
in slinky was introduced at the american toy fair
richard james opened shop in albany new york after developing a machine that could produce a slinky within seconds
the toy was packaged in a black lettered box and advertising saturated america
james often appeared on television shows to promote slinky
in the slinky dog debuted
other slinky toys introduced in the s included the slinky train loco the slinky worm suzie and the slinky crazy eyes a pair of glasses that uses slinkys over the eyeholes attached to plastic eyeballs
james industries licensed the patent us to several other manufacturers including wilkening mfg
of philadelphia and toronto which produced spring centered toys such as mr
wiggle s leap frog and mr
wiggle s cowboy
in its first years james industries sold million slinkys at apiece that would be the equivalent to billion adjusted for inflation in gross revenue over those years
in richard james left the company after his wife filed for divorce and he became an evangelical missionary in bolivia with wycliffe bible translators
betty james managed the company juggled creditors and in moved the company to hollidaysburg pennsylvania
richard james died in
the company and its product line expanded under betty james s leadership
in she explained the toy s success to the associated press by saying it s the simplicity of it
betty james insisted upon keeping the original slinky affordable
in when the price ranged from to she told the new york times so many children can t have expensive toys and i feel a real obligation to them
i m appalled when i go christmas shopping and to for a toy is nothing in slinkys cost to and slinky dogs about
in james industries was sold to poof products inc
of plymouth michigan a manufacturer of foam sports balls
slinky continued production in hollidaysburg
in james industries merged with poof products inc to create poof slinky inc
betty james died of congestive heart failure in november age after having served as president of james industries from to
over million slinkys have been sold between and and the original slinky is still a bestseller
in july the slinky brand was sold to just play
the rules that govern the mechanics of a slinky are hooke s law and the effects of gravitation
due to simple harmonic motion the period of oscillation of a dangling slinky is
displaystyle t pi sqrt frac m k
where t is the time of the period of oscillation m is the slinky s mass and k is its spring constant
in the state of equilibrium of a slinky all net force is cancelled throughout the entire slinky
this results in a stationary slinky with zero velocity
as the positions of each part of the slinky is governed by the slinky s mass the force of gravity and the spring constant various other properties of the slinky may be induced
the length of an idealized slinky extended under its own weight assuming the fully compressed length is negligible is
displaystyle l frac w k
where l is the length of the slinky w is the weight of the slinky and k is the spring constant of the slinky
due to the effect of gravity the slinky appears bunched up towards the bottom end as governed by the equation
displaystyle p n l n
where n is a dimensionless variable n with n corresponding to the top of the slinky and n being the bottom
each intermediate value of n corresponds to the proportion of the slinky s mass above that point n and p n gives the position that n is above the bottom of the slinky
this quadratic equation means that rather than the center of mass being at the middle of the slinky it lies one quarter of the length above the bottom end
displaystyle p left frac right l left frac right frac l
when set in motion on a stepped platform such as a stairway the slinky transfers energy along its length in a longitudinal wave
the whole spring descends end over end in a periodical motion as if it were walking down one step at a time
when the top end of the slinky is dropped the information of the tension change must propagate to the bottom end before both sides begin to fall the top of an extended slinky will drop while the bottom initially remains in its original position compressing the spring
this creates a suspension time of s for an original slinky but has potential to create a much larger suspension time
a suspended slinky s center of mass is accelerating downward at about feet per second per second i e g when released the lower portion moves up toward the top portion with an equivalent constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved
as the spring contracts every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the spring force changing with extension at the bottom of the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with hooke s law as the spring contracts but the centre toward which it is moving gets closer meaning the base will have been displaced sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still
should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses which have approximately linear tension distributions different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon
the jingle for the slinky television commercial was created in columbia south carolina in with johnny mccullough and homer fesperman writing the music and charles weagly penning the lyrics
it became the longest running jingle in advertising history
the jingle has itself been parodied and referenced in popular culture
it is seen in the log commercial on the ren stimpy show and sung by actor jim carrey in ace ventura when nature calls
the song is also referenced in the movie lords of dogtown where it is sung in full by emile hirsch and is sung by eddie murphy as part of the final routine in the stand up comedy film eddie murphy raw
early in the history of james industries helen herrick malsed of washington state sent the company a letter and drawings for developing slinky pull toys
the company liked her ideas and slinky dog and slinky train were added to the company s product line
slinky dog a small plastic dog whose front and rear ends were joined by a metal slinky debuted in
malsed received royalties of to annually for years on her patent for the slinky pull toy idea but never visited the plant
in the slinky dog voiced by jim varney and blake clarke was redesigned for all of pixar s toy story and toy story live action movies
james industries had discontinued their slinky dog a few years previously
betty james approved of the new slinky dog telling the press the earlier slinky dog wasn t nearly as cute as this one the molds used in manufacturing the new toy created problems for james industries so the plastic front and rear ends were manufactured in china with james industries doing the assembly and packaging
the entire run of redesigned slinky dogs sold out well before christmas
plastic slinkys are also available
they can be made in different colors
many of them are made with the colors of the rainbow in rainbow order
they were marketed in the s as a safer alternative to metal slinkys as they did not present a hazard when inserted into electrical sockets
the plastic spring toy known as the plastic slinky was invented by donald james reum sr
of master mark plastics in albany minnesota
reum came up with the idea as he was playing with different techniques to produce a spiral hose for watering plants
however as it came off the assembly line according to his children it looked more like a slinky he worked at it until it came out perfectly and then went to betty james with his prototype
reum manufactured the plastic slinky for betty james for several years
eventually betty james decided to manufacture the product exclusively through james manufacturing effectively ending the production of the toy by the small minnesota company
reum s patent number was filed on dec and issued by the us patent office on oct
in the united states postal service issued a slinky postage stamp
the slinky was inducted into the national toy hall of fame in in their celebrate the century stamp series
a bill to nominate the slinky as the state toy of pennsylvania was introduced by richard geist in but not enacted
the same year betty james was inducted into the toy industry association s hall of fame
in slinky was named to the toy industry association s century of toys list a roll call of the most memorable and most creative toys of the twentieth century
high school teachers and college professors have used slinkys to simulate the properties of waves united states troops in the vietnam war used them as mobile radio antennas as have amateur radio operators and nasa has used them in zero gravity physics experiments in the space shuttle
slinkys and similar springs can be used to create a laser gun like sound effect
this is done by holding up a slinky in the air and striking one end resulting in a metallic tone which sharply lowers in pitch
the effect can be amplified by attaching a plastic cup to one end of the slinky
in john cage composed an avant garde work called sounds of venice scored for among other things a piano a slab of marble and venetian broom a birdcage of canaries and an amplified slinky
metal slinky can be used as an antenna it resonates between and mhz
during vietnam war it was used as a portable antenna for local hf communication
this setup had many advantages over a long wire shot from m grenade launcher small dimensions fast and quiet installation reusability good takeoff angle for local communication and good enough performance
it was also used to extend range of a handheld radio
in in conjunction with the johnson space center and the houston museum of natural science discovery astronauts created a video demonstrating how familiar toys behave in space
it won t slink at all dr
rhea seddon said of slinky it sort of droops the video was prepared to stimulate interest in school children about the basic principles of physics and the phenomenon of weightlessness
in the bishop museum in honolulu hawaii hosted an interactive traveling exhibit developed by the franklin institute of philadelphia called what makes music among other things visitors could examine what makes musical sound by creating waves on an eight foot long version of a slinky toy
several online videos have shown the slinky acting as an excellent squirrel deterrent for bird feeders when mounted on the pole of the bird feeder to prevent squirrels from climbing up the pole to reach the bird feeders
