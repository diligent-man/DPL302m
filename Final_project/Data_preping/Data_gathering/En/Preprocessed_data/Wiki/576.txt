rule govern mechanic slinky hooke's law effect gravitation
due simple harmonic motion period oscillation dangling slinky is
time period oscillation slinky's mass k spring constant
state equilibrium slinky net force cancelled throughout entire slinky
position part slinky governed slinky's mass force gravity spring constant various property slinky may induced
length idealized slinky extended weight assuming fully compressed length negligible is
l length slinky w weight slinky k spring constant slinky
due effect gravity slinky appears bunched towards bottom end governed equation
n dimensionless variable n n corresponding top slinky n bottom
intermediate value n corresponds proportion slinky's mass point n pn give position n bottom slinky
quadratic equation mean rather center mass middle slinky lie one quarter length bottom end
set motion stepped platform stairway slinky transfer energy along length longitudinal wave
whole spring descends end end periodical motion walking one step time
top end slinky dropped information tension change must propagate bottom end side begin fall top extended slinky drop bottom initially remains original position compressing spring
creates suspension time original slinky ha potential create much larger suspension time
suspended slinky's center mass accelerating downward foot per second per second ie g released lower portion move toward top portion equivalent constant upward acceleration tension relieved
spring contract every point along length accelerate downward gravity tension experience decrease overall downward acceleration related height along spring due spring force changing extension- bottom spring upward initial acceleration reduces accordance hooke's law spring contract centre toward moving get closer-
phenomenology extend light string heavy suspended mass approximately linear tension distribution different mathematics would needed explain phenomenon
