William Brouncker nd Viscount Brouncker PRS April was an English mathematician who introduced Brouncker's formula and was the first president of the Royal Society
He was also a civil servant serving as a commissioner of the Royal Navy
He was a friend and colleague of Samuel Pepys and features prominently in the Great Diary
Brouncker was born in Castlelyons County Cork the elder son of William Brouncker st Viscount Brouncker and Winifred daughter of Sir William Leigh of Newnham
His family came originally from Melksham in Wiltshire
His grandfather Sir Henry Brouncker died had been Lord President of Munster and settled his family in Ireland
His father was created a viscount in the Peerage of Ireland in for his services to the Crown
Although the first viscount had fought for the Crown in the Anglo-Scots war of malicious gossip said that he paid the then enormous sum of £ for the title and was almost ruined as a result
He died only a few months afterwards
William obtained a DM at the University of Oxford in
Until he played no part in public life being a staunch Royalist he felt it best to live quietly and devote himself to his mathematical studies
He was one of the founders and the first president of the Royal Society
In he became chancellor to Queen Catherine then head of the Saint Catherine's Hospital
He was appointed one of the commissioners of the Royal Navy in and his career thereafter can be traced in the Diary of Samuel Pepys despite their frequent disagreements Samuel Pepys on the whole respected Brouncker more than most of his other colleagues writing in that in truth he is the best of them
Although his attendance at the Royal Society had become infrequent and he had quarreled with some of his fellow members he was nonetheless greatly displeased to be deprived of the presidency in
He was commissioner for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of England from
Brouncker never married but lived for many years with the actress Abigail Williams much to Pepys' disgust and left most of his property to her
She was the daughter of Sir Henry Clere died first and last of the Clere Baronets and the estranged wife of John Williams otherwise Cromwell second son of Sir Oliver Cromwell and first cousin to the renowned Oliver Cromwell
She and John had a son and a daughter
The fire of which destroyed the Royal Navy Office started in her private closet this is unlikely to have improved her relations with Samuel Pepys whose private apartments were also destroyed in the blaze
On Brouncker's death in his title passed to his brother Henry one of the most detested men of the era
William left him almost nothing in his will for reasons I think not fit to mention
His mathematical work concerned in particular the calculations of the lengths of the parabola and cycloid and the quadrature of the hyperbola which requires approximation of the natural logarithm function by infinite series
He was the first European to solve what is now known as Pell's equation
He was the first in England to take interest in generalized continued fractions and following the work of John Wallis he provided development in the generalized continued fraction of pi
This formula provides a development of π in a generalized continued fraction
displaystyle frac pi =cfrac +cfrac +cfrac +cfrac +cfrac +cfrac +ddots
The convergents are related to the Leibniz formula for pi for instance
displaystyle frac +frac +frac =frac =-frac +frac
Because of its slow convergence Brouncker's formula is not useful for practical computations of π
Brouncker's formula can also be expressed as
displaystyle frac pi =+cfrac +cfrac +cfrac +cfrac +cfrac +ddots
