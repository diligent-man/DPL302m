william brouncker nd viscount brouncker prs april was an english mathematician who introduced brouncker s formula and was the first president of the royal society

brouncker was born in castlelyons county cork the elder son of william brouncker st viscount brouncker and winifred daughter of sir william leigh of newnham

he died only a few months afterwards
william obtained a dm at the university of oxford in
until he played no part in public life being a staunch royalist he felt it best to live quietly and devote himself to his mathematical studies
he was one of the founders and the first president of the royal society
in he became chancellor to queen catherine then head of the saint catherine s hospital
he was appointed one of the commissioners of the royal navy in and his career thereafter can be traced in the diary of samuel pepys despite their frequent disagreements samuel pepys on the whole respected brouncker more than most of his other colleagues writing in that in truth he is the best of them

william left him almost nothing in his will for reasons i think not fit to mention
his mathematical work concerned in particular the calculations of the lengths of the parabola and cycloid and the quadrature of the hyperbola which requires approximation of the natural logarithm function by infinite series
he was the first european to solve what is now known as pell s equation
he was the first in england to take interest in generalized continued fractions and following the work of john wallis he provided development in the generalized continued fraction of pi
this formula provides a development of in a generalized continued fraction
displaystyle frac pi cfrac cfrac cfrac cfrac cfrac cfrac ddots
the convergents are related to the leibniz formula for pi for instance
displaystyle frac frac frac frac

because of its slow convergence brouncker s formula is not useful for practical computations of
brouncker s formula can also be expressed as
displaystyle frac pi cfrac cfrac cfrac cfrac cfrac ddots
