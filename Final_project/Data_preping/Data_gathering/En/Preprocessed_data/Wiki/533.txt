the national banking acts of and were two united states federal banking acts that established a system of national banks and created the united states national banking system
they encouraged development of a national currency backed by bank holdings of u s
treasury securities and established the office of the comptroller of the currency as part of the united states department of the treasury and a system of nationally chartered banks
the act shaped today s national banking system and its support of a uniform u s
banking policy
at the end of the second bank of the united states in the control of banking regimes devolved mostly to the states
different states adopted policies including a total ban on banking as in wisconsin a single state chartered bank as in indiana and illinois limited chartering of banks as in ohio and free entry as in new york
while the relative success of new york s free banking laws led a number of states to also adopt a free entry banking regime the system remained poorly integrated across state lines
though all banknotes were uniformly denominated in dollars notes would often circulate at a steep discount in states beyond their issue
in the end there were well publicized frauds arising in states like michigan which had adopted free entry regimes but did not require redeemability of bank issues for specie
the perception of dangerous wildcat banking along with the poor integration of the u s
banking system led to increasing public support for a uniform national banking regime
the united states government on the other hand still had limited taxation capabilities and so had an interest in the seigniorage potential of a national bank
in the polk administration created a united states treasury system that moved public funds from private banks to treasury branches in order to fund the mexican american war
however without a national currency the revenue generated this way was limited
this became more urgent during the civil war when congress and lincoln were struggling to finance the war efforts
without a national mechanism for issuing currency the lincoln administration could not exploit the powers and loopholes that for example britain could with its central bank in order to finance the high expenses involved
previously the damage that would be done to state banks by national competition was sufficient to prevent significant national bank chartering
but using the war crisis lincoln was able to expand this effort
one of the first attempts to issue a national currency came in the early days of the civil war when congress approved the legal tender act of allowing the issue of million in national notes known as greenbacks and mandating that paper money be issued and accepted in lieu of gold and silver coins
the bills were backed only by the national government s promise to redeem them and their value was dependent on public confidence in the government as well as the ability of the government to give out specie in exchange for the bills in the future
many thought this promise backing the bills was about as good as the green ink printed on one side hence the name greenbacks
the second legal tender act enacted july a joint resolution of congress and the third legal tender act enacted march expanded the limit to million
the largest amount of greenbacks outstanding at any one time was calculated as
the national bank act ch
stat february originally known as the national currency act was passed in the senate by a vote and was supplemented a year later by the national banking act of
the goals of these acts was to create a single national currency a nationalized bank chartering system and to raise money for the union war effort
the act established national banks that could issue notes which were backed by the united states treasury and printed by the government itself
the quantity of notes that a bank was allowed to issue was proportional to the bank s level of capital deposited with the comptroller of the currency at the treasury
to further control the currency the act taxed notes issued by state and local banks essentially pushing non federally issued paper out of circulation
since the establishment of the republic state governments had held authority to regulate banks
before the act state legislatures typically issued bank charters on a case by case basis taking into consideration whether the area needed a new bank and if the applicant was of good moral standing
as this system could be subject to corruption states began passing free banking laws in which meant that any applicant who filled out the correct paperwork and deposited an in kind payment to the state would be granted a charter
by the s over half of states had such a law on the books
however the national banking act of ch
stat june brought a close to the issue by establishing federally issued bank charters which took banking out of the hands of state governments
the first bank to receive a national charter was the first national bank of philadelphia pennsylvania charter
the first new national bank to open was the first national bank of davenport iowa charter
additionally the new act converted more than state banks to national banks
the national bank act of was passed on february th and was the first attempt to establish a federal banking system after the failures of the first and second banks of the united states and served as the predecessor to the federal reserve act of
the act allowed the creation of national banks set out a plan for establishing a national currency backed by government securities held by other banks and gave the federal government the ability to sell war bonds and securities in order to help the war effort
national banks were chartered by the federal government and were subject to stricter regulation they had higher capital requirements and were not allowed to loan more than of their holdings
a high tax on state banks was levied to discourage competition and by most state banks had either received national charters or collapsed
the act based on a new york state law brought the federal government into active supervision of commercial banks
further acts passed in and imposed a tax to speed the adoption of the system
all banks national or otherwise had to pay a percent tax on payments that they made in currency notes other than national bank notes
the tax rate was intentionally set so high as to effectively prohibit further circulation of state bank and private notes
by this time the conversion from state banks to national banks was well underway
the constitutionality of the tax came before the supreme court in veazie bank v
fenno a case by a state chartered maine bank and the collector of internal revenue
the court ruled in favor of the government
state banks declined until the s when the growing popularity of checks and the declining profitability of national bank currency issues caused a resurgence
the granting of charters led to the creation of many national banks and a national banking system which grew at a fast pace
the number of national banks rose from immediately after the act to in
initially this rise in national banking came at the expense of state banking the number of state banks dwindled from in to in
though state banks were no longer allowed to issue notes local bankers took advantage of less strict capital requirements for state banks vs
for national banks and opened new branches en masse
these new state banks then served as competition for national banks growing to in number by
the years leading up to the passing of the tax on banknotes consisted of events surrounding the national banking act of
during this time period hugh mcculloch was determined to fight against the national banking legislation which he rightly perceived as a threat to state chartered banking
although he tried to block the system s creation he mcculloch was not determined to be its champion part of his plans to revamp this portion of the banking system included hiring a new staff being hands on with several aspects such as personally evaluating applications for bank charters and consoled prospective bankers and assisting in the design of the new national bank notes and arranged for their engraving printing and distribution as an end result of mcculloch s efforts many banks were just not willing to conform to his system of operations
this prompted congress to pass a percent tax on the notes of state banks signaling its determination that national banks would triumph and the state banks would fade away
a later act passed on march imposed a tax of percent on the notes of state banks to take effect on july
similar to previous taxes this effectively forced all non federal currency from circulation
it also resulted in the creation of demand deposit accounts and encouraged banks to join the national system increasing the number of national banks substantially
the national banking acts served to create the federal state dual structure that is now a defining characteristic of the u s
banking system and economy
the comptroller of the currency continues to have significance in the u s
economy and is responsible for administration and supervision of national banks as well as certain activities of bank subsidiaries per the gramm leach bliley act of
in the act was used by john d
hawke jr comptroller of the currency to effectively bar state attorneys general from national bank oversight and regulatory roles
many blame the resulting lack of oversight and regulation for the late s recession the bailout of the u s
financial system and the subprime mortgage crisis
