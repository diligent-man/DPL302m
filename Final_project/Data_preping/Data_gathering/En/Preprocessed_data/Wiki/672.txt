Robert Boyce Brandom born March is an American philosopher who teaches at the University of Pittsburgh He works primarily in philosophy of language philosophy of mind and philosophical logic and his academic output manifests both systematic and historical interests in these topics His work has presented arguably the first fully systematic and technically rigorous attempt to explain the meaning of linguistic items in terms of their socially norm governed use meaning as use to cite the Wittgensteinian slogan thereby also giving a non representationalist account of the intentionality of thought and the rationality of action as well
Brandom is broadly considered to be part of the American pragmatist tradition in philosophy In he won the Mellon Distinguished Achievement Award
Brandom earned his BA in from Yale University and his PhD in from Princeton University under Richard Rorty and David Kellogg Lewis His doctoral thesis was titled Practice and Object
Brandom's work is heavily influenced by that of Wilfrid Sellars Richard Rorty Michael Dummett and his Pittsburgh colleague John McDowell He also draws heavily on the works of Immanuel Kant G W F Hegel Gottlob Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein
He is best known for his investigations of linguistic meanings or semantics He advocates the view that the meaning of an expression is fixed by how it is used in inferences see inferential role semantics This project is developed at length in his influential book Making It Explicit and more briefly in Articulating Reasons An Introduction to Inferentialism a chapter of that latter work Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism outlines the main themes of representationalism the tradition of basing semantics on the concept of representation vs inferentialism the conviction for an expression to be meaningful is to be governed by a certain kind of inferential rules and inferentialism's relationship to logical expressivism the conviction that logic is expressive in the sense that it makes explicit or codifies certain aspects of the inferential structure of our discursive practice
Brandom has also published a collection of essays on the history of philosophy Tales of the Mighty Dead a critical and historical sketch of what he calls the philosophy of intentionality He is the editor of a collection of papers about Richard Rorty's philosophy Rorty and His Critics Brandom delivered the John Locke lectures at Oxford University which Oxford University Press published under the title Between Saying and Doing Towards an Analytic Pragmatism In he published A Spirit of Trust a book about Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit
