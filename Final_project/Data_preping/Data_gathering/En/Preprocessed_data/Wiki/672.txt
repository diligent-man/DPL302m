Robert Boyce Brandom (born March 13, 1950) is an American philosopher who teaches at the University of Pittsburgh
He works primarily in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind and philosophical logic, and his academic output manifests both systematic and historical interests in these topics
His work has presented "arguably the first fully systematic and technically rigorous attempt to explain the meaning of linguistic items in terms of their socially norm-governed use ("meaning as use", to cite the Wittgensteinian slogan), thereby also giving a non-representationalist account of the intentionality of thought and the rationality of action as well."
Brandom is broadly considered to be part of the American pragmatist tradition in philosophy
In 2003 he won the Mellon Distinguished Achievement Award.
Brandom earned his B.A
in 1972 from Yale University and his Ph.D
in 1977 from Princeton University, under Richard Rorty and David Kellogg Lewis
His doctoral thesis was titled Practice and Object.
Brandom's work is heavily influenced by that of Wilfrid Sellars, Richard Rorty, Michael Dummett and his Pittsburgh colleague John McDowell
 He also draws heavily on the works of Immanuel Kant, G
W
F
Hegel, Gottlob Frege, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.
He is best known for his investigations of linguistic meanings, or semantics
He advocates the view that the meaning of an expression is fixed by how it is used in inferences (see inferential role semantics)
This project is developed at length in his influential 1994 book Making It Explicit, and more briefly in Articulating Reasons: An Introduction to Inferentialism (2000); a chapter of that latter work, "Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism", outlines the main themes of representationalism (the tradition of basing semantics on the concept of representation) vs
inferentialism (the conviction for an expression to be meaningful is to be governed by a certain kind of inferential rules) and inferentialism's relationship to logical expressivism (the conviction that "logic is expressive in the sense that it makes explicit or codifies certain aspects of the inferential structure of our discursive practice").
Brandom has also published a collection of essays on the history of philosophy, Tales of the Mighty Dead (2002), a critical and historical sketch of what he calls the "philosophy of intentionality"
He is the editor of a collection of papers about Richard Rorty's philosophy, Rorty and His Critics (2000)
Brandom delivered the 2006 John Locke lectures at Oxford University, which Oxford University Press published under the title Between Saying and Doing: Towards an Analytic Pragmatism (2008)
In 2019 he published A Spirit of Trust, a book about Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit.
