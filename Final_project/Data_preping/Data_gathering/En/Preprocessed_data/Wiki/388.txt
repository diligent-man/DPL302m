research investigating artificial brain brain emulation play three important role science
ongoing attempt neuroscientist understand human brain work known cognitive neuroscience
thought experiment philosophy artificial intelligence demonstrating possible least theory create machine ha capability human being
long-term project create machine exhibiting behavior comparable animal complex central nervous system mammal particularly humans
ultimate goal creating machine exhibiting human-like behavior intelligence sometimes called strong aian example first objective project reported aston university birmingham england researcher using biological cell create neurospheres small cluster neuron order develop new treatment disease including alzheimer's motor neurone parkinson's
second objective reply argument john searle's chinese room argument hubert dreyfus's critique ai roger penrose's argument emperor's new mind
critic argued aspect human consciousness expertise simulated machines
one reply argument biological process inside brain simulated degree accuracy
reply wa made early alan turing classic paper computing machinery intelligence

design allows several function response eight task using visual input typed handwritten character output carried mechanical arm
spaun's function include copying drawing recognizing image counting
good reason believe regardless implementation strategy prediction realising artificial brain near future optimistic
particular brain including human brain cognition currently well understood scale computation required unknown
another near term limitation current approach brain simulation require order magnitude larger power consumption compared human brain
human brain consumes w power whereas current supercomputer may use much mwie order more
critic brain simulation believe simpler create general intelligent action directly without imitating nature
