On June the company announced plans to move its global headquarters to Arlington Virginia
The Raytheon Company was founded in in Cambridge Massachusetts by Laurence K Marshall Vannevar Bush and Charles G Smith as the American Appliance Company Its focus which was originally on new refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics The company's first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on Charles Smith's earlier astronomical research of the star Zeta Puppis The electron tube was christened with the name Raytheon light of from the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of radio receiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries This made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive short lived batteries
In the company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company and began marketing its rectifier under the Raytheon brand name with commercial success In Raytheon merged with Q R S Company an American manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name Raytheon Manufacturing Company By the s it had already grown to become one of the world's largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies In it diversified by acquiring Acme Delta Company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto parts
During World War II Raytheon mass manufactured magnetron tubes for use in microwave radar sets and then complete radar systems At war's end in the company was responsible for about percent of all magnetrons manufactured During the war Raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection Raytheon ranked st among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts In Raytheon's Percy Spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food In the company demonstrated the Radarange microwave oven for commercial use
After the war Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target In Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles including the SAM N Lark the air to air AIM Sparrow and the ground to air MIM Hawk missiles In Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear and changed its name to Raytheon Company
During the post war years Raytheon also made generally low to medium powered radio and television transmitters and related equipment for the commercial market In the s Raytheon began manufacturing transistors including the CK priced for and marketed to hobbyists Under the direction of Thomas L Phillips in it acquired Amana Refrigeration Inc a manufacturer of refrigerators and air conditioners Using the Amana brand name and its distribution channels Raytheon began selling the first countertop household microwave oven in and became a dominant manufacturer in the microwave oven business
In during the Persian Gulf War Raytheon's Patriot missile received great international exposure resulting in a substantial increase in sales for the company outside the United States In an effort to establish leadership in the defense electronics business Raytheon purchased in quick succession Dallas based E Systems Chrysler Corporation's defense electronics and aircraft modification businesses and the defense unit of Texas Instruments Defense Systems Electronics Group Also in Raytheon acquired the aerospace and defense business of Hughes Aircraft Company from Hughes Electronics Corporation a subsidiary of General Motors which included a number of product lines previously purchased by Hughes Electronics including the former General Dynamics missile business Pomona facility the defense portion of Delco Electronics Delco Systems Operations and Magnavox Electronic Systems Raytheon also divested itself of several nondefense businesses in the s including Amana Refrigeration and Seismograph Service Ltd sold to Schlumberger Geco Prakla
In November Raytheon purchased robotics company Sarcos and in October Raytheon acquired BBN Technologies In December Applied Signal Technology agreed to be acquired by Raytheon for million
In October Raytheon beat rivals Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for a contract to build DELRR a next generation long range radar system for the US Air Force worth an estimated billion The contract award was immediately protested by Raytheon's competitors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman After re evaluating the bids following the protests the US Air Force decided to delay awarding the DELRR EMD contract until and was to issue an amended solicitation at the end of July In the Air Force again awarded the contract to Raytheon

In February Raytheon completed the first radar antenna array for the US Army's new missile defense radar known as the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor LTAMDS to replace the service's Patriot air and missile defense system sensor
In William Boeing's Boeing Airplane Transport Corporation teamed up with Frederick Rentschler's Pratt Whitney to form the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation a large vertically integrated amalgamated firm uniting business interests in all aspects of aviation a combination of aircraft engine and airframe manufacturing and airline business to serve all aviation markets both civil aviation cargo passenger private air mail and military aviation After the Air Mail scandal of the U S government concluded that such large holding companies as United Aircraft and Transport were anti competitive and new antitrust laws were passed forbidding airframe or engine manufacturers from having interests in airlines
United Aircraft Corporation was formed in from the portions of United Aircraft and Transport east of the Mississippi River Pratt Whitney Sikorsky Vought and Hamilton Standard Propeller Company headquartered in Hartford with Frederick Rentschler founder of Pratt Whitney as president
United Aircraft became a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on March when United Aircraft and AT T were added to replace Nash Motors and International Business Machines United Aircraft subsequently known as United Technologies and Raytheon Technologies has remained a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since that time through August It was announced that starting August Raytheon Technologies would be substituted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average by Honeywell International
During World War II United Aircraft ranked sixth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts At the close of the war United Aircraft entered the emerging markets for jet engines and helicopters via Pratt Whitney and Sikorsky respectively
In the s United Aircraft began developing jet engines including the Pratt Whitney J the most powerful jet engine on the market for some years In the s Pratt Whitney produced the Pratt Whitney JT D for the Boeing
In Harry Gray left Litton Industries to become the CEO of United Aircraft He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation UTC in to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace The change became official on May The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business UTC became a mergers and acquisitions M A focused organization with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations The next year UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator In Carrier Refrigeration was acquired
At one point the military portion of UTC's business whose sensitivity to excess profits and boom bust demand drove UTC to diversify away from it actually carried the weight of losses incurred by the commercial M A side of the business Although M A activity was not new to United Aircraft the M A activity of the s and s was higher stakes and arguably unfocused Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses high tech of any type was the new theme Some Wall Street watchers questioned the true value of M A at almost any price seemingly for its own sake
In UTC acquired Sundstrand Corporation and merged it into UTC's Hamilton Standard unit to form Hamilton Sundstrand In UTC entered the fire and security business by purchasing Chubb Security In UTC acquired the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation which planned to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary under their Sikorsky Aircraft division In UTC further pursued its stake in the fire and security business by purchasing Kidde Also in UTC acquired Boeing's Rocketdyne division which was merged into the Pratt Whitney business unit and renamed Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne later sold to Aerojet and merged into Aerojet Rocketdyne In November UTC's Carrier Corporation acquired NORESCO an energy service company
