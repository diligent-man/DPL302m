neapolitan tailoring was born as an attempt to loosen up the stiffness of english tailoring which didn t suit the neapolitan lifestyle
characteristics of neapolitan tailoring
the shoulders the neapolitan jacket has no shoulder padding
neapolitan tailors removed the shoulder padding from their jackets in order to provide more freedom of movement
for this reason the neapolitan shoulder on informal jackets is sewn like a shirt sleeve spalla a camicia and it follows the natural curve of the human body rather than give it shape
this type of sleeve is cut about cm larger than the armhole and it can be finished with the repecchia that shirring the tailor creates with the extra fabric
this little flair is known as manica a mappina and it gives the jacket a rugged appearance
for formal occasions the neapolitan shoulder features a rollino a little roll of padding that raises the sleeve head to drape more cleanly
the sleeves the neapolitan sleeve is shorter than that found on other jackets as neapolitans like shirt cuffs to show right above their wrists especially when adorned with cufflinks
the sleeves are cut closer to the arms in order to avoid extra fabric hanging when these are raised
the pockets the pockets of a neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches the breast pocket is called a barchetta which means little boat due to the higher top corner of the pocket which along with the rounded bottom gives it the shape of a stylized boat
the side pockets are equally curved and their shape recalls that of a pot hence the name a pignata
neither of these features have any practical functionality but they are particular to neapolitan tailoring and they contribute to the look of a jacket made in naples
double hand finished stitching may also run throughout the sides of the patch pockets a recurring feature in informal neapolitan tailoring
the lining lining is considered an unnecessary burden and the neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible
usually the jacket is unlined or only half lined even the sleeves are completely unlined as they re meant to fit closely
additionally the lining is often left open volante literally flying so that people can admire the fine details and construction of the jacket
the lapels neapolitan jackets are famous for their wide lapels which are often peaked a punta for double breasted jackets formal jackets and coats
the risvolto dentellato the classic style of lapels not peaked are wider in neapolitan jackets they can be as wide as inches compared to the inches of a regular lapel width
just as is the case for the pockets the neapolitan lapel features double stitching running along the sides a detail that s peculiar of a neapolitan creation although reserved for the less formal pieces
the scollo a martiello literally hammer neck is the opening of the jacket over the shirt which in neapolitan tailoring is parallel to the lapels
the cran is the space that separates the lapel and the neck and it is usually higher in neapolitan tailoring to create the illusion of a more slender figure
the body neapolitan jackets tend to be shorter in the back in neapolitan dialect they say the jacket zompa arr to which roughly translates as it jumps in the back
this characteristic allows for the jacket to slide gracefully along the body
the vents on the sides are quite deep in neapolitan jackets up to inches
the darts in the front go all the way down to help the fabric follow the shape of the body and create elegant quarters
buttons and buttonholes the three roll two construction features a lapel that hides the third button in order to provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front
the buttonhole on the lapel is called occhiello in italian and it means little eye for its elongated almond shape
there isn t really a tradition for a specific type of buttonhole in naples but there is a tendency of neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt while regular buttonholes of english tradition are more elongated and slender
some tailors add a little teardrop shape at the end of the buttonhole an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition
for the buttons on the sleeves they are always working buttons and they are always overlapping people awarded the honorary citizenship of naples are
