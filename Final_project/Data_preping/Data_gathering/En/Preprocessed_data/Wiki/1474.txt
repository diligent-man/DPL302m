lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt people frequently experience violence directed toward their sexuality gender identity or gender expression
this violence may be enacted by the state as in laws prescribing punishment for homosexual acts or by individuals
it may be psychological or physical and motivated by biphobia gayphobia homophobia lesbophobia and transphobia
influencing factors may be cultural religious or political mores and biases
currently homosexual acts are legal in almost all western countries and in many of these countries violence against lgbt people is classified as a hate crime
outside the west many countries are deemed potentially dangerous to their lgbt population due to both discriminatory legislation and threats of violence
these include countries where the dominant religion is islam most african countries except south africa most asian countries except the lgbt friendly asian countries of israel japan taiwan thailand and the philippines and some former communist countries such as russia poland lgbt free zone serbia albania kosovo montenegro and bosnia and herzegovina
such violence is often associated with religious condemnation of homosexuality or conservative social attitudes that portray homosexuality as an illness or a character flaw
historically state sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to male homosexuality termed sodomy
during the middle ages and the early modern period the penalty for sodomy was usually death
during the modern period from the th century to the mid th century in the western world the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment
there was a drop in locations where homosexual acts remained illegal from when there were countries worldwide notably throughout the middle east central asia and in most of africa but also in some of the caribbean and oceania with five carrying the death penalty to when countries criminalized consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex
brazil a country with lgbt rights protections and legal same sex marriage is reported by grupo gay da bahia ggb to have the world s highest lgbt murder rate with more than murders in alone an increase of compared to
this is usually not considered a hate crime in brazil but a misinterpretation of skewed data resulting from relatively higher crime rates in the country in general when compared to world averages rather than the lgbt population being a specific target
in some countries of lgbt students experience homophobic and transphobic violence in school and of transgender students drop out of school
an early law against sexual intercourse between men is recorded in leviticus by the hebrew people prescribing the death penalty
a violent law regarding homosexual intercourse is prescribed in the middle assyrian law codes bce stating if a man lay with his neighbor when they have prosecuted him and convicted him they shall lie with him and turn him into a eunuch
in the account given in tacitus germania the death penalty was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses military treason or desertion was punished by hanging and so was moral infamy cowardice and homosexuality ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames gordon translates corpore infames as unnatural prostitutes tacitus refers to male homosexuality see

laws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in europe from the fourth to the twentieth centuries
in republican rome the poorly attested lex scantinia penalized an adult male for committing a sex crime stuprum against an underage male citizen ingenuus
it is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine
the law may also have been used to prosecute adult male citizens who willingly took a receiving role in same sex acts but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague as john boswell has noted if there was a law against homosexual relations no one in cicero s day knew anything about it when the roman empire came under christian rule all male homosexual activity was increasingly repressed often on pain of death
in ce the christian emperors constantius and constans declared same sex marriage to be illegal
shortly after in the year ce emperors valentinian ii theodosius i and arcadius declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive
emperor justinian i ce made homosexuals a scapegoat for problems such as famines earthquakes and pestilences
the earliest known execution for sodomy was recorded in the annals of the city of basel in
the mention is only one sentence king rudolph burned lord haspisperch for the vice of sodomy the executed was an obscure member of the german swiss aristocracy it is unknown if there was a political motivation behind the execution
during the middle ages the kingdom of france and the city of florence also instated the death penalty
in florence a young boy named giovanni di giovanni was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red hot iron by court order under this law
these punishments continued into the renaissance and spread to the swiss canton of z rich
knight richard von hohenberg died was burned at the stake together with his lover his young squire during this time
in france french writer jacques chausson was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman
in england the buggery act of made sodomy and bestiality punishable by death
this act was superseded in but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until although the last executions were in
in seventeenth century malta scottish voyager and author william lithgow writing in his diary in march claims a spanish soldier and a maltese teenage boy were publicly burnt to ashes for confessing to have practiced sodomy together
to escape this fate lithgow further claimed that a hundred bardassoes boy prostitutes sailed for sicily the following day
in nazi germany and occupied europe homosexuals and gender nonconforming people were among the groups targeted by the holocaust see persecution of homosexuals in nazi germany
in the poet federico garc a lorca was executed by right wing rebels who established franco s dictatorship in spain hitler s ally
as of august countries criminalize consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex
they are punishable by death in nine countries
brunei
iran fourth conviction
mauritania
qatar
saudi arabia although the maximum punishment for homosexuality is execution the government tends to use other punishments fines prison sentence and whipping unless it feels that homosexuals have challenged state authority by engaging in lgbt social movements

india criminalized homosexuality until september when the supreme court of india declared section of the indian penal code invalid and arbitrary when it concerns consensual relations of adults in private
jamaica has some of the toughest sodomy laws in the world with homosexual activity carrying a ten year jail sentence
international human rights organizations such as human rights watch and amnesty international condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime
since the united nations human rights committee has also ruled that such laws violated the right to privacy guaranteed in the universal declaration of human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights
even in countries where homosexuality is legal most countries outside of africa and the middle east there are reports of homosexual people being targeted with bullying or physical assault or even homicide
according to the grupo gay da bahia ggb brazil s oldest gay rights ngo the rate of murders of homosexuals in brazil is particularly high with a reported cases over the year period of to or about cases per population per annum
at least lgbt brazilians were murdered in
ggb reported documented alleged homophobic murders in brazil in accounting for about of intentional homicides in brazil homicide rate per population as of
of the victims were gay men were trans women or transvestites and were lesbians
by comparison the fbi reported five homophobic murders in the united states during corresponding to of intentional homicides homicide rate per population as of
the numbers produced by the grupo gay da bahia ggb have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of lgbt people reported in the media that is not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals
reinaldo de azevedo in columnist of the right wing veja magazine brazil s most read weekly publication called the ggb s methodology unscientific based on the above objection that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not
on the high level of murders of transsexuals he suggested transsexuals allegedly high involvement with the drug trade may expose them to higher levels of violence as compared to non transgender homosexuals and heterosexuals
in many parts of the world including much of the european union and united states acts of violence are legally classified as hate crimes which entail harsher sentences if convicted
in some countries this form of legislation extends to verbal abuse as well as physical violence
violent hate crimes against lgbt people tend to be especially brutal even compared to other hate crimes an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims
it is rare for a victim to just be shot he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times mutilated and strangled
they frequently involved torture cutting mutilation
showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his sexual preference
in a particularly brutal case in the united states on march in wahneta florida year old ryan keith skipper was found dead from stab wounds and a slit throat
his body had been dumped on a dark rural road less than miles from his home
his two alleged attackers william david brown jr and joseph eli bearden were indicted for robbery and first degree murder
highlighting their malice and contempt for the victim the accused killers allegedly drove around in skipper s blood soaked car and bragged of killing him
according to a sheriff s department affidavit one of the men stated that skipper was targeted because he was a faggot
in canada in police reported data found that approximately of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation
of these were of a violent nature
in comparison of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature
in the same year in the united states according to federal bureau of investigation data though crimes were committed due to racial bias and were committed due to sexual orientation only one murder and one forcible rape were committed due to racial bias whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation
in northern ireland in homophobic incidents and transphobic incidents were reported
of those incidents were violent crimes significantly higher than for any other bias category
by contrast of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature
people s ignorance of and prejudice against lgbt people can contribute to the spreading of misinformation about them and subsequently to violence
in a transgender woman was killed by a mob in hyderabad india following false rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children
three other transgender women were injured in the attack
recent research on university level students indicated the importance of queer visibility and its impact in creating a positive experience for lgbtiq members of a campus community this can reduce the impact and effect of incidents on youth attending university
when there is a poor climate students are much less likely to report incidents or seek help
in the united states during the past few years colleges and universities have taken major steps to prevent sexual harassment from taking place on campus but students have reported violence due to their sexual orientation
sexual harassment can include non contact forms such as making jokes or comments and contact forms like forcing students to commit sexual acts
even though little information exists with lgbt violence taking place at higher learning institutions different communities are taking a stand against the violence
many lgbt rape survivors said they experienced their first assault before the age of and that many arrive on campus with this experience
almost half of bisexual women experience their first assault between the ages of and most of these take place unreported on college campuses
though the federal bureau of investigation changed what the federal definition of what rape means for reporting purposes in local state governments still determine how campus violence cases are treated
catherine hill and elana silva said in drawing the line sexual harassment on campus students who admit to harassing other students generally don t see themselves as rejected suitors rather misunderstood comedians most students who commit sexual violence towards other students do it to boost their own ego believing that their actions are humorous
more than of sexual harassment towards lgbt people still goes unreported
national resources have been created to deal with the issue of sexual violence and various organizations such as the american association of university women and the national center on domestic and sexual violence are established to provide information and resources for those who have been sexually harassed
members of the organization for security and cooperation in europe began describing hate crimes based on sexual orientation as opposed to generic anti discrimination legislation to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime in
scotland enacted legislation the offences aggravation by prejudice scotland act the act which laid down in law that prejudice against disability sexual orientation and transgender status were specific offences
this act requires only a single source of evidence
those convicted under the act must be told upon sentencing both what their sentence will be and what it would have been had prejudice not been a factor
for example person a is walking past an lgbt establishment and sees persons b c standing in the doorway
person a approaches and assaults b c uttering homophobic comments as he does so
regardless of whether person a was correct in their assumptions regarding b c s sexual orientation the offence is complete
police are contacted and arrive to find person a assaulting b c
only person b has heard the offensive comments made this is sufficient for the act only the assault and breach of the peace bop require corroboration
police arrest caution and charge person a with bop and assault both common law offences under scots law and he is further charged under section of the act
having been found guilty the sheriff sentences a to years suspended for years in addition to fines and costs of
the sheriff is required to inform the court that his sentence without the act would have been of year suspended for months and fines costs of
whilst homophobia is still a big issue in modern scotland particularly in schools social attitudes towards lgbt persons have changed significantly helped by every scottish political party leader being vocally in support of equal marriage throughout that campaign
former leaders of both scottish labour and the scottish conservatives have been out lesbians and current co leader of the scottish greens patrick harvie is openly gay
the united states does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes but several states including the district of columbia enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator
among these countries as well only the united states has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity and even then only in states and the district of columbia
in november the united nations general assembly voted to remove sexual orientation from the special rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions a list of unjustified reasons for executions replacing it with discriminatory reasons on any basis
the resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups including race religion linguistic differences refugees street children and indigenous peoples
legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge however
lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty
often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization
legal defenses like the gay panic defense allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating torturing or killing homosexuals because of their orientation
these arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim s advances as to cause temporary insanity leaving them unable to stop themselves or discern right from wrong
in these cases if the loss of faculties is proven or sympathized to the jury an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced
in several common law countries the mitigatory defense of provocation has been used in violent attacks against lgbt persons which has led several australian states and territories to modify their legislation in order to prevent or reduce the using of this legal defense in cases of violent responses to non violent homosexual advances
there have been several highly publicized cases where people convicted of violence against lgbt people have received shorter sentences
one such case is that of kenneth brewer
on september he met stephen bright at a local gay bar
he bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to brewer s apartment
while there brewer made a sexual advance toward bright and bright beat him to death
bright was initially charged with second degree murder but he was eventually convicted of third degree assault and was sentenced to one year in prison
cases like bright s are not isolated
in aaron webster was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of stanley park frequented by gay men
ryan cran was convicted of manslaughter in the case in and released on parole in after serving only years of his six year sentence
two youths were tried under canada s youth criminal justice act and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty
a fourth assailant was acquitted
judges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either
in texas judge jack hampton gave a man years for killing two gay men instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor
after handing down his judgment he said i don t much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys i put prostitutes and gays at about the same level
and i d be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute
in a florida judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor that s a crime now to beat up a homosexual the prosecutor responded yes sir
and it s also a crime to kill them times have really changed the judge replied
the judge daniel futch maintained that he was joking but was removed from the case
lgbt pride parades in east european asian and south american countries often attract violence because of their public nature
though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants some would prefer that the parades not happen and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters
the country of moldova has shown particular contempt to marchers shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway
in after being denied a request to hold a parade a small group of lgbt people tried to hold a small gathering
they were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs
the gathering proceeded even so and they tried to lay flowers at the monument to the victims of repression
they were denied the opportunity however by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from city hall
the following year a parade was again attempted
a bus carried approximately participants to the capital but before they could disembark an angry crowd surrounded the bus
they shouted things like let s get them out and beat them up and beat them to death don t let them escape at the frightened passengers
the mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed they would have to destroy all of their pride materials
the passengers complied and the march was called off
all the while police stood passively about meters away taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus
russia s officials are similarly averse to pride parades
mayor of moscow yury luzhkov has repeatedly banned marches calling them satanic
pride participants instead tried to peacefully assemble and deliver a petition to city hall regarding the right of assembly and freedom of expression
they were met by skinheads and other protesters and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered
as some were being arrested other participants were attacked by protesters
police did nothing
around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat denied medical attention and verbally abused by police officers
the officers told the women no one needs lesbians no one will ever get you out of here when participants were released from custody hours later they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting
hungary on the other hand has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers but cannot stem the flow of violence
in hundreds of people participated in the budapest dignity march
police on alert due to attacks on two lgbt affiliated businesses earlier in the week erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on
hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation
a police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks
during the parade itself protesters threw molotov cocktails eggs and firecrackers at marchers
at least eight participants were injured
forty five people were detained in connection with the attacks and observers called the incident the worst violence during the dozen years the gay pride parade has taken place in budapest
in israel three marchers in a gay pride parade in jerusalem on june were stabbed by yishai shlisel a haredi jew
shlisel claimed he had acted in the name of god
he was charged with attempted murder ten years later on july six marchers were injured again by yishai shlisel when he stabbed them
it was three weeks after he was released from jail
one of the victims year old shira banki died of her wounds at the hadassah medical center three days later on august
shortly after prime minister netanyahu offered his condolences adding we will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law
in the gay pride parade in detroit was infiltrated by armed neo nazis who reportedly claimed they wanted to spark charlottesville referring to the unite the right demonstration in which resulted in the murder of heather heyer and many others injured on july the first bia ystok equality march was held in bia ystok a law and justice party stronghold surrounded by bia ystok county which is a declared lgbt free zone
two weeks before the march archbishop tadeusz wojda delivered a proclamation to all churches in podlaskie voivodeship and bia ystok stating that pride marches were blasphemy against god
wojda also asserted that the march was foreign and thanked those who defend christian values
approximately a thousand pride marchers were opposed by thousands of members of far right groups ultra football fans and others
firecrackers were tossed at the marchers homophobic slogans were chanted and the marchers were pelted with rocks and bottles
dozens of marchers were injured
amnesty international criticized the police response saying they had failed to protect marchers and failed to respond to instances of violence
according to the new york times similar to the manner in which the unite the right rally in charlottesville shocked americans the violence in bia ystok raised public concern in poland over anti lgbt propaganda
as a result of the strong anti homosexual culture in jamaica many reggae and dancehall artists such as buju banton elephant man sizzla have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals
similarly hip hop music occasionally includes aggressively homophobic lyrics but has since appeared to reform
banton wrote a song when he was years old that became a hit when he released it years later in called boom bye bye
the song is about murdering homosexuals and advocated the shooting of gay men pouring acid on them and burning them alive a song by elephant man proclaims when you hear a lesbian getting raped it s not our fault
two women in bed that s two sodomites who should be dead
canadian activists have sought to deport reggae artists from the country due to homophobic content in some of their songs which they say promote anti gay violence
in the uk scotland yard has investigated reggae lyrics and sizzla was barred from entering the united kingdom in over accusations his music promotes murder
gay rights advocates have started the group stop murder music to combat what they say is the promotion of hate and violence by artists
the group organized protests causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform and the loss of sponsors
in the group asked reggae artists to promise not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people
neither can they authorise the re release of previous homophobic songs several artists signed that agreement including buju banton beenie man sizzla and capleton but some later denied signing it
during the s skinheads in north america who promoted emerging neo nazi pop culture and racist rock songs increasingly went to punk rock concerts with anti gay music advocating violence
the vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims and is connected to aggressive heterosexual machismo or male chauvinism
theorists including calvin thomas and judith butler have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual s fear of being identified as gay
homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity
for this reason allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports and in the subculture of its supporters that are considered stereotypically male such as football and rugby
these theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status
thus by distancing themselves from gay people they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexuals in a heteronormative culture thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person
various psychoanalytic theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual s own same sex impulses whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical
this threat causes repression denial or reaction formation
the quran cites the story of the people of lot also known as the people of sodom and gomorrah destroyed by the wrath of allah because they engaged in lustful carnal acts between men
the most follwed scholars of islam such as shaykh al isl m imam malik and imam shafi amongst others ruled that islam disallows male homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it
the legal punishment for male sodomy has varied among juristic schools some prescribe capital punishment while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment
homosexual activity is a crime and forbidden in most muslim majority countries
in some relatively secular muslim majority countries such as indonesia jordan and turkey this is not the case however social persecution such as honor killings are widespread of cis gendered gay men and sometimes lesbians
the quran much like the bible and torah has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with leaving it ambiguous
for this reason islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the hadith sayings of muhammad and sunnah accounts of his life
these on the other hand are perfectly clear and particularly harsh
ibn al jawzi records muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same sex acts
muhammad prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive male homosexual partners which is a clear condemnation of male homosexuality within islam and the association with male homosexuality being associated with a cursed action has produced a long history of religiously condoned and sanctioned violence against gay men
ibn al jawzi writing in the th century claimed that muhammad had cursed sodomites in several hadith and had recommended the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in homosexual acts
al nuwayri writing in the th century reported in his nihaya that muhammad is alleged to have said what he feared most for his community were the practices of the people of lot he seems to have expressed the same idea in regard to wine and female seduction
the overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of god s creation and is therefore a revolt against god
these views vary depending upon sect
it is noteworthy to point out that quranists those who do not integrate the aforementioned hadiths into their belief system do not advocate capital punishment while still condemning male homosexuality as an abomination and major sin
most imams within the sunni and shia branches still preach views stating that homosexual males should be executed under islamic law
these are also followed up by executions in islamic countries and lynchings honor killings and hate crimes within muslim communities in non islamic countries
abu usamah at green lane mosque in birmingham defended his words to followers by saying if i were to call homosexuals perverted dirty filthy dogs who should be executed that s my freedom of speech isn t it
other contemporary islamic views are that the crime of homosexuality is one of the greatest of crimes the worst of sins and the most abhorrent of deeds
homosexuality is considered the th major sin in islam in the days of the companions of muhammad a slave boy was once forgiven for killing his master who sodomized him
the orlando nightclub shooting was at the time the deadliest mass shooting by an individual and remains the deadliest incident of violence against lgbt people in u s
history
on june omar mateen killed people and wounded more than at pulse gay nightclub in orlando florida
the act has been described by investigators as an islamic terrorist attack and a hate crime
