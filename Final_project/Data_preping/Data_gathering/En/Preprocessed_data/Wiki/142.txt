the sciritae or skiritai greek and were a people subject to sparta whose status is comparable to that of the perioeci
deriving their name from the town of skiritis a mountainous region located in northern laconia on the border with arcadia between the oenus and the eurotas rivers
according to stephanus of byzantium and hesychius of alexandria the sciritae were of arcadian origin
their way of life was essentially rural they mostly lived in villages of which the biggest were oion and caryai
their territory was inhospitable but was of strategic importance for sparta since it controlled the road to tegea which explains why it rapidly fell in spartan hands
their status was similar to that of the perioeci but xenophon distinguished between them writing to meet the case of a hostile approach at night he assigned the duty of acting as sentries outside the lines to the sciritae
in these days the duty is shared by foreigners if any happen to be present in the camp
in war the sciritae formed an elite corps of light infantry a lochos battalion of about men which were used as a complement to the civic army
according to thucydides v
they fought on the extreme left wing in the battle line the most threatening position for the hoplite phalanx in this battle the left wing was composed of the sciritae who in a lacedaemonian army have always that post to themselves alone
at night they were placed as sentinels ahead of the army xenophon constitution of the spartans xii
and acted as scouts to open the way for the king whom they only could precede
according to suda they were six hundred men and during the battle they were the first to engage and the last to withdraw
in the cyropaedia iv xenophon compares them to the hyrcanian cavalry used by the assyrians as rear guard
