tvc was influential in the s and s in lobbying for government policy based in christian fundamentalism
tvc was designated an anti gay hate group by the southern poverty law center splc citing tvc s use of known falsehoods claims about lgbt people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities and repeated groundless name calling
the splc reported that the traditional values coalition may have effectively ceased to exist as of
evangelical preacher lou sheldon was the california executive director of anita bryant s anti gay save our children campaign
sheldon started his own organization in the s to carry on his anti lgbt advocacy initially named the american liberties institute later the california coalition for traditional values and finally the traditional values coalition
in tvc organized parents to oppose project a los angeles school district stay in school program for lgbt youth
tvc continued to battle the la school district into the s but gradually expanded into a national organization with a washington d c
headquarters
tvc created a video called gay rights special rights in
the widely distributed video was a powerful tool in the anti gay rights movement of the s
in the s tvc claimed to represent over christian churches in the united states
sheldon and his daughter lafferty met with president us george w
bush on eight occasions
tvc exerted considerable influence in the united states congress in the s
andrea lafferty worked closely with her father at tvc from the late s to the mid s becoming executive director by the year and gaining influence during the george w
bush white house years from
the organization was struggling to maintain relevance by the mid s
in march the splc noted that the organization is a ghost of its former self if it exists at all
its website disappeared from the internet last year and its phone line is disconnected
lou sheldon died in
at the time of his death sheldon was suing the organization he founded claiming that tvc no longer functions as a legitimate lobby organization but instead conducts fraudulent fundraising to benefit andrea lafferty and her husband
tvc maintained an office in anaheim california where it was founded
a washington dc office run by andrea lafferty provided lobbying access to the federal government
barbara sheldon was the chairwoman of tvc s colorado branch
sheldon complained that lgbt acceptance was raising doubts in children s minds about religious prohibitions of homosexuality and organized opposition to protecting colorado school students from homophobic bullying
cyndi lamm was the director of the nebraska branch
lamm moved away from california to nebraska in because tvc was unsuccessful in opposing lgbt rights in los angeles schools
she believed that giving children information about homosexuality could cause them to become gay and so chose to raise her family elsewhere
the video gay rights special rights inside the homosexual agenda made by tvc in attempted to depict the march on washington for lesbian gay and bi equal rights and liberation as perverted it contrasted the march unfavorably with the civil rights era march on washington for jobs and freedom as an attempt drive a wedge between the lgbt and black communities
the video was distributed widely to churches in america in particular to african american churches
the video features senator trent lott and william j
bennett making anti gay statements
media scholars linda kintz and julia lesage describe the video as a titillating peepshow that conceals a battering ram against gay rights and consider it a follow up to the video the gay agenda
in some ways the aims of the group were those of a christian right
it did not provide formal position statements but outlined the traditional values it was fighting for as follows
right to life against abortion and euthanasia but in favor of capital punishment
sexual fidelity in marriage and abstinence before marriage
opposition to homosexuality and other deviant sexual behaviors see below
opposition to pornography
patriotism supporting national boundaries the armed forces political participation free enterprise limited government low taxes and personal responsibility
opposition to liberal immigration reform without first securing the u s mexico border
freedom for christians to attempt to convert non christians
cleanness from addictive behaviors with opposition to gambling the legalization of addictive drugs alcohol and smoking the group then explained in paragraphs titled discrimination and tolerance and love and hate how it aimed to deal with accusations that its activities were based on hatred of those not following similar beliefs
without stating what action should be taken the organization maintained that individuals may be free to pursue such behaviors as sodomy but that they will not and cannot tolerate these behaviors however the tvc s stances against homosexuality and the lgbt rights movement were comparatively more confrontational than those of many groups with similar views
there were a number of smaller groups that take a harder line most notably westboro baptist church which the tvc criticized for many years likening it to a false flag operation
the gap between the tvc and other conservative groups was described by winnie stachelberg of the pro lgbt human rights campaign as follows they re out there every day supporting discrimination against gay people on nearly every issue and you don t see that so much from other groups the coalition took this as a compliment
by comparison jerry falwell stated in his later years civil rights for all americans gay straight et cetera is not a liberal or a conservative value
it s an american value that i would think that we pretty much all agree on
the tvc suggested that homosexuals posed a threat of child molestation claiming they have long sought unrestricted access to children for recruitment purposes and are more willing than others on the right to use the word sodomy in reference to gay men
historically the group at one time called for cities of refuge to keep aids patients from infecting the general population
lafferty s response to a gallup poll suggesting a tilt in public opinion towards gay rights was this jesus didn t ask for a show of hands at the sermon on the mount
we his followers should not ask america to vote on which of his teachings they choose to obey
the southern poverty law center splc enumerated false statements made by tvc including the claim that gay people travel door to door to steal american children and transform them into homosexuals
the splc also notes that tvc has a history of islamophobic statements
because of this splc classified tvc as a hate group beginning in
the splc removed the designation in because the group appeared to be inactive or defunct
the tvc operated a subsidiary under the name of christian seniors association under the leadership of james lafferty the husband of andrea sheldon lafferty
it aims to be a conservative alternative to the aarp
it attracted some attention for distributing financial appeals that are designed to be confused with census material
louis sheldon was an associate of jack abramoff the republican lobbyist jailed for influence peddling
sheldon lobbied members of the us congress to kill the internet gambling prohibition act
abramoff directed his client elottery to pay to the traditional values coalition
the group has also been linked to the mariana islands worker abuse scandal as it was used by abramoff to pay for the trip of representative bob schaffer to visit the island
the denver post reported that the tvc paid the travel bill for the trip organized by abramoff s lobbying firm
abramoff s lobbying team would prepare questions and factual backup for friendly lawmakers
trips to the island for congressmen and staff would be a key tool to build permanent friends the memo said
the congressional junkets to the mariana islands were designed to build support in congress among republican lawmakers to block labor and immigration legislation for the islands which had been found to harbor squalid working conditions and abusive labor practices
