the music of the united states reflects the country s pluri ethnic population through a diverse array of styles
it is a mixture of music influenced by the music of the united kingdom west africa ireland latin america and mainland europe among other places
the country s most internationally renowned genres are jazz blues country bluegrass rock rock and roll r b pop hip hop soul funk gospel disco house techno ragtime doo wop folk music americana boogaloo tejano reggaeton surf and salsa
american music is heard around the world
since the beginning of the th century some forms of american popular music have gained a near global audience
native americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the united states and played its first music
beginning in the th century immigrants from the united kingdom ireland spain germany and france began arriving in large numbers bringing with them new styles and instruments
slaves from west africa brought their musical traditions and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot
some popular music is the electropop which is based on british west german japanese performers and some is the new school hip hop influenced by afrika bambaataa which in turn was influenced by kraftwerk
there are also some african american influence in the music tradition of the european american settlers such as jazz blues rock country and bluegrass
the united states has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the ukrainian irish scottish polish hispanic and jewish communities among others
many american cities and towns have vibrant music scenes which in turn support a number of regional musical styles
with musical centers such as boston philadelphia seattle portland new york san francisco new orleans detroit memphis houston las vegas minneapolis chicago st
louis miami atlanta san juan nashville austin washington d c los angeles and smaller cities such as asbury park new jersey milwaukee cleveland asheville north carolina louisville oakland honolulu the research triangle boulder colorado madison wisconsin tupelo mississippi and burlington vermont have all have produced and contributed to the many distinctive styles of music from the country
the cajun and creole traditions in louisiana music the folk and popular styles of hawaiian music and the bluegrass and old time music of the southeastern states are a few examples of diversity in american music
the music of the united states can be characterized by the use of syncopation and asymmetrical rhythms long irregular melodies which are said to reflect the wide open geography of the american landscape and the sense of personal freedom characteristic of american life
some distinct aspects of american music like the call and response format are derived from african techniques and instruments
throughout the later part of american history and into modern times the relationship between american and european music has been a discussed topic among scholars of american music
some have urged for the adoption of more purely european techniques and styles which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant while others have pushed for a sense of musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively american styles
modern classical music scholar john warthen struble has contrasted american and european concluding that the music of the united states is inherently distinct because the united states has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation
instead the music of the united states is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the american civil war when people from across the country were brought together in army units trading musical styles and practices
struble deemed the ballads of the civil war the first american folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to america the first american sounding music as distinct from any regional style derived from another country
the civil war and the period following it saw a general flowering of american art literature and music
amateur musical ensembles of this era can be seen as the birth of american popular music
music author david ewen describes these early amateur bands as combining the depth and drama of the classics with undemanding technique eschewing complexity in favor of direct expression
if it was vocal music the words would be in english despite the snobs who declared english an unsingable language
in a way it was part of the entire awakening of america that happened after the civil war a time in which american painters writers and serious composers addressed specifically american themes during this period the roots of blues gospel jazz and country music took shape in the th century these became the core of american popular music which further evolved into the styles like rhythm and blues rock and roll and hip hop music
music intertwines with aspects of american social and cultural identity including through social class race and ethnicity geography religion language gender and sexuality
the relationship between music and race is perhaps the most potent determiner of musical meaning in the united states
the development of an african american musical identity out of disparate sources from africa and europe has been a constant theme in the music history of the united states
little documentation exists of colonial era african american music when styles songs and instruments from across west africa commingled with european styles and instruments leading to the creation of new genres and self expression from enslaved people
by the mid th century a distinctly african american folk tradition was well known and widespread and african american musical techniques instruments and images became a part of mainstream american music through spirituals minstrel shows and slave songs
african american musical styles became an integral part of american popular music through blues jazz rhythm and blues and then rock and roll soul and hip hop all of these styles were consumed by americans of all races but were created in african american styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines
in contrast country music derives from both african and european as well as native american and hawaiian traditions and has long been perceived as a form of white music
economic and social classes separates american music through the creation and consumption of music such as the upper class patronage of symphony goers and the generally poor performers of rural and ethnic folk musics
musical divisions based on class are not absolute however and are sometimes as much perceived as actual popular american country music for example is a commercial genre designed to appeal to a working class identity whether or not its listeners are actually working class
country music is also intertwined with geographic identity and is specifically rural in origin and function other genres like r b and hip hop are perceived as inherently urban
for much of american history music making has been a feminized activity
in the th century amateur piano and singing were considered proper for middle and upper class women
women were also a major part of early popular music performance though recorded traditions quickly become more dominated by men
most male dominated genres of popular music include female performers as well often in a niche appealing primarily to women these include gangsta rap and heavy metal
the united states is often said to be a cultural melting pot taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression
though aspects of american music can be traced back to specific origins claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic due to the constant evolution of american music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques instruments and genres
elements of foreign musics arrived in the united states both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups and through informal processes as in the incidental transplantation of west african music through slavery and irish music through immigration
the most distinctly american musics are a result of cross cultural hybridization through close contact
slavery for example mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous latin and european music
american ethnic religious and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the french african music of the louisiana creoles the native mexican and european fusion tejano music and the thoroughly hybridized slack key guitar and other styles of modern hawaiian music
the process of transplanting music between cultures is not without criticism
the folk revival of the mid th century for example appropriated the musics of various rural peoples in part to promote certain political causes which has caused some to question whether the process caused the commercial commodification of other peoples songs
and the inevitable dilution of mean in the appropriated musics
the use of african american musical techniques images and conceits in popular music largely by and for white americans has been widespread since at least the mid th century songs of stephen foster and the rise of minstrel shows
the american music industry has actively attempted to popularize white performers of african american music because they are more palatable to mainstream and middle class americans
this process has been related to the rise of stars as varied as benny goodman eminem and elvis presley as well as popular styles like blue eyed soul and rockabilly
folk music in the us is varied across the country s numerous ethnic groups
the native american tribes each play their own varieties of folk music most of it spiritual in nature
african american music includes blues and gospel descendants of west african music brought to the americas by slaves and mixed with western european music
during the colonial era english french and spanish styles and instruments were brought to the americas
by the early th century the united states had become a major center for folk music from around the world including polka ukrainian and polish fiddling ashkenazi klezmer and several kinds of latin music
the native americans played the first folk music in what is now the united states using a wide variety of styles and techniques
some commonalities are near universal among native american traditional music however especially the lack of harmony and polyphony and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures
traditional instrumentations use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments like drums rattles and shakers
since european and african contact was established native american folk music has grown in new directions into fusions with disparate styles like european folk dances and tejano music
modern native american music may be best known for pow wows pan tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed
the thirteen colonies of the original united states were all former english possessions and anglo culture became a major foundation for american folk and popular music
many american folk songs are identical to british songs in arrangements but with new lyrics often as parodies of the original material
american anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes less prominent accompaniment but with heavier use of drones and more melodies in major
anglo american traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads humorous stories and tall tales and disaster songs regarding mining shipwrecks and murder
legendary heroes like joe magarac john henry and jesse james are part of many songs
folk dances of british origin include the square dance descended from the quadrille combined with the american innovation of a caller instructing the dancers
the religious communal society known as the shakers emigrated from england during the th century and developed their own folk dance style
their early songs can be dated back to british folk song models
other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in american history such as the music of the amish the harmony society and the ephrata cloister in pennsylvania
the ancestors of today s african american population were brought to the united states as slaves working primarily in the plantations of the south
they were from hundreds of tribes across west africa and they brought with them certain traits of west african music including call and response vocals and complexly rhythmic music as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents
the african musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the new world where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped africans retain continuity with their past through music
the first slaves in the united states sang work songs field hollers and following christianization hymns
in the th century a great awakening of religious fervor gripped people across the country especially in the south
protestant hymns written mostly by new england preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout christians across the south
when blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns they were called negro spirituals
it was from these roots of spiritual songs work songs and field hollers that blues jazz and gospel developed
spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith sung by slaves on southern plantations
in the mid to late th century spirituals spread out of the u s
south
in fisk university became home to the fisk jubilee singers a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country
in imitation of this group gospel quartets arose followed by increasing diversification with the early th century rise of jackleg and singing preachers from whence came the popular style of gospel music
blues is a combination of african work songs field hollers and shouts
it developed in the rural south in the first decade of the th century
the most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale with a flatted or indeterminate third as well as the typically lamenting lyrics though both of these elements had existed in african american folk music prior to the th century the codified form of modern blues such as with the aab structure did not exist until the early th century
the united states is a melting pot consisting of numerous ethnic groups
many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland often producing distinctively american styles of foreign music
some nationalities have produced local scenes in regions of the country where they have clustered like cape verdean music in new england armenian music in california and italian and ukrainian music in new york city
the creoles are a community with varied non anglo ancestry mostly descendant of people who lived in louisiana before its purchase by the u s
the cajuns are a group of francophones who arrived in louisiana after leaving acadia in canada
the city of new orleans louisiana being a major port has acted as a melting pot for people from all over the caribbean basin
the result is a diverse and syncretic set of styles of cajun music and creole music
spain and subsequently mexico controlled much of what is now the western united states until the mexican american war including the entire state of texas
after texas joined the united states the native tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south and remained culturally distinct from other texans
central to the evolution of early tejano music was the blend of traditional mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido and continental european styles introduced by german and czech settlers in the late th century
in particular the accordion was adopted by tejano folk musicians around the start of the th century and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in texas and northern mexico
classical music was brought to the united states with some of the first colonists
european classical music is rooted in the traditions of european art ecclesiastical and concert music
the central norms of this tradition developed between and centering on what is known as the common practice period
many american classical composers attempted to work entirely within european models until late in the th century
when anton n dvo k a prominent czech composer visited the united states from to he iterated the idea that american classical music needed its own models instead of imitating european composers he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly american style of classical music
by the beginning of the th century many american composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work ranging from jazz and blues to native american music
during the colonial era there were two distinct fields of what is now considered classical music
one was associated with amateur composers and pedagogues whose style was originally drawn from simple hymns and gained sophistication over time
the other colonial tradition was that of the mid atlantic cities like philadelphia and baltimore which produced a number of prominent composers who worked almost entirely within the european model these composers were mostly english in origin and worked specifically in the style of prominent english composers of the day
classical music was brought to the united states during the colonial era
many american composers of this period worked exclusively with european models while others such as william billings supply belcher and justin morgan also known as the first new england school developed a style almost entirely independent of european models
of these composers billings is the most well remembered he was also influential as the founder of the american church choir as the first musician to use a pitch pipe and as the first to introduce a violoncello into church service
many of these composers were amateur singers who developed new forms of sacred music suitable for performance by amateurs and often using harmonic methods which would have been considered bizarre by contemporary european standards
these composers styles were untouched by the influence of their sophisticated european contemporaries using modal or pentatonic scales or melodies and eschewing the european rules of harmony
in the early th century america produced diverse composers such as anthony heinrich who composed in an idiosyncratic intentionally american style and was the first american composer to write for a symphony orchestra
many other composers most famously william henry fry and george frederick bristow supported the idea of an american classical style though their works were very european in orientation
it was john knowles paine however who became the first american composer to be accepted in europe
paine s example inspired the composers of the second new england school which included such figures as amy beach edward macdowell and horatio parker
louis moreau gottschalk is perhaps the best remembered american composer of the th century said by music historian richard crawford to be known for bringing indigenous or folk themes and rhythms into music for the concert hall
gottschalk s music reflected the cultural mix of his home city new orleans louisiana which was home to a variety of latin caribbean african american cajun and creole music
he was well acknowledged as a talented pianist in his lifetime and was also a known composer who remains admired though little performed
the new york classical music scene included charles griffes originally from elmira new york who began publishing his most innovative material in
his early collaborations were attempts to use non western musical themes
the best known new york composer was george gershwin
gershwin was a songwriter with tin pan alley and the broadway theatres and his works were strongly influenced by jazz or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time
gershwin s work made american classical music more focused and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention
following gershwin the first major composer was aaron copland from brooklyn who used elements of american folk music though it remained european in technique and form
later he turned to the ballet and then serial music
charles ives was one of the earliest american classical composers of enduring international significance producing music in a uniquely american style though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in
many of the later th century composers such as john cage john corigliano terry riley steve reich john adams and miguel del aguila used modernist and minimalist techniques
reich discovered a technique known as phasing in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated gradually drifting out of sync creating a natural sense of development
reich was also very interested in non western music incorporating african rhythmic techniques in his compositions
recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of philip glass a baltimore native based out of new york meredith monk and others
the united states has produced many popular musicians and composers in the modern world
beginning with the birth of recorded music american performers have continued to lead the field of popular music which out of all the contributions made by americans to world culture
has been taken to heart by the entire world
most histories of popular music start with american ragtime or tin pan alley others however trace popular music to the renaissance and through broadsheets ballads and other popular traditions
other authors typically look at popular sheet music tracing american popular music to spirituals minstrel shows vaudeville and the patriotic songs of the civil war
the patriotic lay songs of the american revolution constituted the first kind of mainstream popular music
these included the liberty tree by thomas paine
cheaply printed as broadsheets early patriotic songs spread across the colonies and were performed at home and at public meetings
fife songs were especially celebrated and were performed on fields of battle during the american revolution
the longest lasting of these fife songs is yankee doodle still well known today
the melody dates back to and was sung by both american and british troops
patriotic songs were based mostly on english melodies with new lyrics added to denounce british colonialism others however used tunes from ireland scotland or elsewhere or did not utilize a familiar melody
the song hail columbia was a major work that remained an unofficial national anthem until the adoption of the star spangled banner
much of this early american music still survives in sacred harp
although relatively unknown outside of shaker communities simple gifts was written in by elder joseph brackett and the tune has since become internationally famous
during the civil war when soldiers from across the country commingled the multifarious strands of american music began to cross fertilize each other a process that was aided by the burgeoning railroad industry and other technological developments that made travel and communication easier
army units included individuals from across the country and they rapidly traded tunes instruments and techniques
the war was an impetus for the creation of distinctly american songs that became and remained wildly popular
the most popular songs of the civil war era included dixie written by daniel decatur emmett
the song originally titled dixie s land was made for the closing of a minstrel show it spread to new orleans first where it was published and became one of the great song successes of the pre civil war period
in addition to popular patriotic songs the civil war era also produced a great body of brass band pieces
following the civil war minstrel shows became the first distinctively american form of music expression
the minstrel show was an indigenous form of american entertainment consisting of comic skits variety acts dancing and music usually performed by white people in blackface
minstrel shows used african american elements in musical performances but only in simplified ways storylines in the shows depicted blacks as natural born slaves and fools before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism
the minstrel show was invented by daniel decatur emmett and the virginia minstrels
minstrel shows produced the first well remembered popular songwriters in american music history thomas d
rice daniel decatur emmett and most famously stephen foster
after minstrel shows popularity faded coon songs a similar phenomenon became popular
the composer john philip sousa is closely associated with the most popular trend in american popular music just before the start of the th century
formerly the bandmaster of the united states marine band sousa wrote military marches like the stars and stripes forever that reflected his nostalgia for his home and country giving the melody a stirring virile character
in the early th century american musical theater was a major source for popular songs many of which influenced blues jazz country and other extant styles of popular music
the center of development for this style was in new york city where the broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city
theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers george and ira gershwin created a uniquely american theatrical style that used american vernacular speech and music
musicals featured popular songs and fast paced plots that often revolved around love and romance
the blues is a genre of african american folk music that is the basis for much of modern american popular music
blues can be seen as part of a continuum of musical styles like country jazz ragtime and gospel though each genre evolved into distinct forms their origins were often indistinct
early forms of the blues evolved in and around the mississippi delta in the late th and early th centuries
the earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure
slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers turning them into passionate solo songs
when mixed with the christian spiritual songs of african american churches and revival meetings blues became the basis of gospel music
modern gospel began in african american churches in the s in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised often musical manner testifying
composers like thomas a
dorsey composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs
ragtime was originally a piano style featuring syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms
it is primarily a form of dance music utilizing the walking bass and is generally composed in sonata form
ragtime is a refined and evolved form of the african american cakewalk dance mixed with styles ranging from european marches and popular songs to jigs and other dances played by large african american bands in northern cities during the end of the th century
the most famous ragtime performer and composer was scott joplin known for works such as maple leaf rag
blues became a part of american popular music in the s when classic female blues singers like bessie smith grew popular
at the same time record companies launched the field of race music which was mostly blues targeted at african american audiences
the most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues derived genres including the legendary delta blues musician robert johnson and piedmont blues musician blind willie mctell
by the end of the s however pure blues was only a minor part of popular music having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm blues and the nascent rock and roll style
some styles of electric piano driven blues like boogie woogie retained a large audience
a bluesy style of gospel also became popular in mainstream america in the s led by singer mahalia jackson
the blues genre experienced major revivals in the s with chicago blues musicians such as muddy waters and little walter as well as in the s in the british invasion and american folk music revival when country blues musicians like mississippi john hurt and reverend gary davis were rediscovered
the seminal blues musicians of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as chuck berry in the s as well as on the british blues and blues rock scenes of the s and s including eric clapton in britain and johnny winter in texas
jazz is a kind of music characterized by swung and blue notes call and response vocals polyrhythms and improvisation
though originally a kind of dance music jazz has been a major part of popular music and has also become a major element of western classical music
jazz has roots in west african cultural and musical expression and in african american music traditions including blues and ragtime as well as european military band music
early jazz was closely related to ragtime with which it could be distinguished by the use of more intricate rhythmic improvisation
the earliest jazz bands adopted much of the vocabulary of the blues including bent and blue notes and instrumental growls and smears otherwise not used on european instruments
jazz s roots come from the city of new orleans louisiana populated by cajuns and black creoles who combined the french canadian culture of the cajuns with their own styles of music in the th century
large creole bands that played for funerals and parades became a major basis for early jazz which spread from new orleans to chicago and other northern urban centers
though jazz had long since achieved some limited popularity it was louis armstrong who became one of the first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz along with his friend pianist earl hines
armstrong hines and their colleagues were improvisers capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody
armstrong also popularized scat singing an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables vocables are sung
armstrong and hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called swing
swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section usually consisting of double bass and drums medium to fast tempo and rhythmic devices like the swung note which is common to most jazz
swing is primarily a fusion of s jazz fused with elements of the blues and tin pan alley
swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation previously an integral part of jazz
swing became a major part of african american dance and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance
jazz influenced many performers of all the major styles of later popular music though jazz itself never again became such a major part of american popular music as during the swing era
the later th century american jazz scene did however produce some popular crossover stars such as miles davis
in the middle of the th century jazz evolved into a variety of subgenres beginning with bebop
bebop is a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody and use of the flatted fifth
bebop was developed in the early and mid s later evolving into styles like hard bop and free jazz
innovators of the style included charlie parker and dizzy gillespie who arose from small jazz clubs in new york city
country music is primarily a fusion of african american blues and spirituals with appalachian folk music adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the s
the origins of country are in rural southern folk music which was primarily irish and british with african and continental european musics
anglo celtic tunes dance music and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern country then known as hillbilly music
early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of th century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as country and western and then simply country
the earliest country instrumentation revolved around the european derived fiddle and the african derived banjo with the guitar later added
string instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of hawaiian musical groups in the early th century
the roots of commercial country music are generally traced to when music talent scout ralph peer recorded jimmie rodgers and the carter family
popular success was very limited though a small demand spurred some commercial recording
after world war ii there was increased interest in specialty styles like country music producing a few major pop stars
the most influential country musician of the era was hank williams a bluesy country singer from alabama
he remains renowned as one of country music s greatest songwriters and performers viewed as a folk poet with a honky tonk swagger and working class sympathies
throughout the decade the roughness of honky tonk gradually eroded as the nashville sound grew more pop oriented
producers like chet atkins created the nashville sound by stripping the hillbilly elements of the instrumentation and using smooth instrumentation and advanced production techniques
eventually most records from nashville were in this style which began to incorporate strings and vocal choirs
by the early part of the s however the nashville sound had become perceived as too watered down by many more traditionalist performers and fans resulting in a number of local scenes like the bakersfield sound
a few performers retained popularity however such as the long standing cultural icon johnny cash
the bakersfield sound began in the mid to late s when performers like wynn stewart and buck owens began using elements of western swing and rock such as the breakbeat in their music
in the s performers like merle haggard popularized the sound
in the early s haggard was also part of outlaw country alongside singer songwriters such as willie nelson and waylon jennings
outlaw country was rock oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers in contrast to the clean cut country singers of the nashville sound
by the middle of the s the country music charts were dominated by pop singers alongside a nascent revival of honky tonk style country with the rise of performers like dwight yoakam
the s also saw the development of alternative country performers like uncle tupelo who were opposed to the more pop oriented style of mainstream country
at the beginning of the s rock oriented country acts remained among the best selling performers in the united states especially garth brooks
r b an abbreviation for rhythm and blues is a style that arose in the s and s
early r b consisted of large rhythm units smashing away behind screaming blues singers who had to shout to be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections
r b was not extensively recorded and promoted because record companies felt that it was not suited for most audiences especially middle class whites because of the suggestive lyrics and driving rhythms
bandleaders like louis jordan innovated the sound of early r b using a band with a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation
by the end of the s he had had several hits and helped pave the way for contemporaries like wynonie harris and john lee hooker
many of the most popular r b songs were not performed in the rollicking style of jordan and his contemporaries instead they were performed by white musicians like pat boone in a more palatable mainstream style which turned into pop hits
by the end of the s however there was a wave of popular black blues rock and country influenced r b performers like chuck berry gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners
motown records became highly successful during the early and mid s for producing music of black american roots that defied racial segregation in the music industry and consumer market
music journalist jerry wexler who coined the phrase rhythm and blues once said of motown they did something that you would have to say on paper is impossible
they took black music and beamed it directly to the white american teenager berry gordy founded motown in in detroit michigan
it was one of few r b record labels that sought to transcend the r b market which was definitively black in the american mindset and specialize in crossover music
the company emerged as the leading producer or assembly line a reference to its motor town origins of black popular music by the early s and marketed its products as the motown sound or the sound of young america which combined elements of soul funk disco and r b
notable motown acts include the four tops the temptations the supremes smokey robinson stevie wonder and the jackson
visual representation was central to motown s rise they placed greater emphasis on visual media than other record labels
many people s first exposure to motown was by television and film
motown artists image of successful black americans who held themselves with grace and aplomb broadcast a distinct form of middle class blackness to audiences which was particularly appealing to whites
soul music is a combination of rhythm and blues and gospel which began in the late s in the united states
it is characterized by its use of gospel music devices with a greater emphasis on vocalists and the use of secular themes
the s recordings of ray charles sam cooke and james brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul
charles modern sounds records featured a fusion of soul and country music country soul and crossed racial barriers in music at the time
one of cooke s most well known songs a change is gonna come became accepted as a classic and an anthem of the american civil rights movement during the s
according to allmusic james brown was critical through the gospel impassioned fury of his vocals and the complex polyrhythms of his beats in two revolutions in black american music
he was one of the figures most responsible for turning r b into soul and he was most would agree the figure most responsible for turning soul music into the funk of the late s and early s
pure soul was popularized by otis redding and the other artists of stax records in memphis tennessee
by the late s atlantic recording artist aretha franklin had emerged as the most popular female soul star in the country
also by this time soul had splintered into several genres influenced by psychedelic rock and other styles
the social and political ferment of the s inspired artists like marvin gaye and curtis mayfield to release albums with hard hitting social commentary while another variety became more dance oriented music evolving into funk
despite his previous affinity with politically and socially charged lyrical themes gaye helped popularize sexual and romance themed music and funk while his s recordings including let s get it on and i want you helped develop the quiet storm sound and format
one of the most influential albums ever recorded sly the family stone s there s a riot goin on has been considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music after prototypical instances of the sound in the group s earlier work
artists such as gil scott heron and the last poets practiced an eclectic blend of poetry jazz funk and soul featuring critical political and social commentary with afrocentric sentiment
scott heron s proto rap work including the revolution will not be televised and winter in america has had a considerable impact on later hip hop artists while his unique sound with brian jackson influenced neo soul artists
during the mid s highly slick and commercial bands such as philly soul group the o jays and blue eyed soul group hall oates achieved mainstream success
by the end of the s most music genres including soul had been disco influenced
with the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late s and early s soul music became less raw and more slickly produced resulting in a genre of music that was once again called r b usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary r b
the first contemporary r b stars arose in the s with the dance pop star michael jackson funk influenced singer prince and a wave of female vocalists like tina turner and whitney houston
michael jackson and prince have been described as the most influential figures in contemporary r b and popular music because of their eclectic use of elements from a variety of genres
prince was largely responsible for creating the minneapolis sound a blend of horns guitars and electronic synthesizers supported by a steady bouncing rhythm jackson s work focused on smooth balladry or disco influenced dance music as an artist he pulled dance music out of the disco doldrums with his adult solo debut off the wall merged r b with rock on thriller and introduced stylized steps such as the robot and moonwalk over the course of his career jackson is often recognized as the king of pop for his achievements
by the concept of popular music crossover became inextricably associated with michael jackson
thriller saw unprecedented success selling over million copies in the united states alone
by the album captured over gold and platinum awards and was recognized by the guinness book of world records as the best selling record of all time a title it still holds today
mtv s broadcast of billie jean was the first for any black artist thereby breaking the color barrier of pop music on the small screen
thriller remains the only music video recognized by the national film registry
janet jackson collaborated with former prince associates jimmy jam and terry lewis on her third studio album control the album s second single nasty has been described as the origin of the new jack swing sound a genre innovated by teddy riley
riley s work on keith sweat s make it last forever guy s guy and bobby brown s don t be cruel made new jack swing a staple of contemporary r b into the mid s
new jack swing was a style and trend of vocal music often featuring rapped verses and drum machines
the crossover appeal of early contemporary r b artists in mainstream popular music including works by prince michael and janet jackson whitney houston tina turner anita baker and the pointer sisters became a turning point for black artists in the industry as their success was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music
the use of melisma a gospel tradition adapted by vocalists whitney houston and mariah carey would become a cornerstone of contemporary r b singers beginning in the late s and throughout the s
whitney houston s r b hits included all the man that i need and i will always love you later became the best selling physical single by a female act of all time with sales of over million copies worldwide
her hit soundtrack the bodyguard spent weeks on top of the billboard hot sold over million copies worldwide and remains the best selling soundtrack album of all time
hip hop came to influence contemporary r b later in the s first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul
hip hop soul and neo soul developed later in the s
typified by the work of mary j
blige r
kelly and bobby brown the former is a mixture of contemporary r b with hip hop beats while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present
the latter is a more experimental edgier and generally less mainstream combination of s and s style soul vocals with some hip hop influence and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of d angelo erykah badu alicia keys and lauryn hill
d angelo s critically acclaimed album voodoo has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre
pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid s in the united states and the united kingdom
during the s and s pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth oriented styles it influenced
rock and pop remained roughly synonymous until the late s after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial ephemeral and accessible
although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music the genre is distinguished from chart music
bing crosby was one of the first artists to be nicknamed king of song or king of popular music
indie pop which developed in the late s marked another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music with guitar bands formed on the then novel premise that one could record and release their own music without having to procure a record contract from a major label
by the early s the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like mtv which favoured those artists such as michael jackson and madonna who had a strong visual appeal
the s are commonly remembered for an increase in the use of digital recording associated with the usage of synthesizers with synth pop music and other electronic genres featuring non traditional instruments increasing in popularity
by pop music worldwide had been permeated by electronic dance music
in researchers at the university of california irvine concluded that pop music has become sadder since the s
the elements of happiness and brightness have eventually been replaced with the electronic beats making the pop music more sad yet danceable
kelly clarkson is the only american singer to be a two time winners of the grammy award for best pop vocal album as of clarkson being the first to win twice
clarkson and justin timberlake have both been nominated five times more than any other artist though clarkson is the only artist to have the most solo albums nominated
three of timberlake s are solo two are from nsync
rock and roll developed out of country blues and r b
rock s exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated and are the subjects of much scholarship
though squarely in the blues tradition rock took elements from afro caribbean and latin musical techniques
rock was an urban style formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of african american latin and european genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco
rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music
black performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success but it was the white performer elvis presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music becoming one of the best selling musicians in history and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world
the s saw several important changes in popular music especially rock
many of these changes took place through the british invasion where bands such as the beatles the who and the rolling stones became immensely popular and had a profound effect on american culture and music
these changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer songwriter and the understanding of popular music as an art rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment
these changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to political goals such as the american civil rights movement and the opposition to the vietnam war
rock was at the forefront of this change
in the early s rock spawned several subgenres beginning with surf
surf was an instrumental guitar genre characterized by a distorted sound associated with the southern california surfing youth culture
inspired by the lyrical focus of surf the beach boys began recording in with an elaborate pop friendly and harmonic sound
as their fame grew the beach boys songwriter brian wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture
the counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism and was closely connected to the hippie subculture
the hippies were associated with folk rock country rock and psychedelic rock
folk and country rock were associated with the rise of politicized folk music led by pete seeger and others especially at the greenwich village music scene in new york
folk rock entered the mainstream in the middle of the s when the singer songwriter bob dylan began his career
allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine attributes the beatles shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid s to bob dylan s influence at the time
he was followed by a number of country rock bands and soft folky singer songwriters
psychedelic rock was a hard driving kind of guitar based rock closely associated with the city of san francisco
though jefferson airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit the grateful dead a country and bluegrass flavored jam band became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture associated with hippies lsd and other symbols of that era
some say that the grateful dead were truly the most american patriotic rock band to have ever existed forming and molding a culture that defines americans today
following the turbulent political social and musical changes of the s and early s rock music diversified
what was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music which came to include diverse styles developed in the us like punk rock
during the s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene while mainstream audiences began the decade with a wave of singer songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of s folk rock
the same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands bluesy southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars
beginning in the later s the rock singer and songwriter bruce springsteen became a major star with anthemic songs and dense inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class
punk was a form of rebellious rock that began in the s and was loud aggressive and often very simple
punk began as a reaction against the popular music of the period especially disco and arena rock
american bands in the field included most famously the ramones and talking heads the latter playing a more avant garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream new wave
other major acts include blondie patti smith and television
in the s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk
hardcore was a form of sparse punk consisting of short fast intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth with such influential bands as bad religion bad brains black flag dead kennedys and minor threat
hardcore began in metropolises like washington d c though most major american cities had their own local scenes in the s
hardcore punk and garage rock were the roots of alternative rock a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music and that arose from the punk and post punk styles
in the united states many cities developed local alternative rock scenes including minneapolis and seattle
seattle s local scene produced grunge music a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore psychedelia and alternative rock
with the addition of a more melodic element to the sound of bands like nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chains grunge became wildly popular across the united states in
three years later bands like green day the offspring rancid bad religion and nofx hit the mainstream with their respective then new albums dookie smash let s go stranger than fiction and punk in drublic and brought the california punk scene exposure worldwide
heavy metal is characterized by aggressive driving rhythms amplified and distorted guitars grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation
heavy metal s origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums
the first major american bands came in the early s like blue yster cult kiss and aerosmith
heavy metal remained however a largely underground phenomenon
during the s the first major pop metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act quiet riot and dominated by bands such as m tley cr e and ratt this was glam metal a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam influenced visual aesthetic
some of these bands like bon jovi became international stars
the band guns n roses rose to fame near the end of the decade with an image that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic
by the mid s heavy metal had branched in so many different directions that fans record companies and fanzines created numerous subgenres
the united states was especially known for one of these subgenres thrash metal which was innovated by bands like metallica megadeth slayer and anthrax with metallica being the most commercially successful
the united states was known as one of the birthplaces of death metal during the mid to late s
the florida scene was the most well known featuring bands like death cannibal corpse morbid angel deicide and many others
there are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country
jay z became an internationally renowned hip hop icon in the wake of the deaths of the notorious b i g
and tupac shakur in the mid s
kanye west was mentored by jay z and produced for him before attaining a similar level of success
hip hop is a cultural movement of which music is a part
hip hop music for the most part is itself composed of two parts rapping the delivery of swift highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals and djing and or producing the production of instrumentation through sampling instrumentation turntablism or beatboxing the production of musical sounds through vocalized tones
hip hop arose in the early s in the bronx new york city
jamaican immigrant dj kool herc is widely regarded as the progenitor of hip hop he brought with him from jamaica the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs
emcees originally arose to introduce the soul funk and r b songs that the djs played and to keep the crowd excited and dancing over time the djs began isolating the percussion break of songs when the rhythm climaxes producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over
unlike motown which predicated its mainstream success on the class appeal of its acts that rendered racial identity irrelevant hip hop of s particularly hip hop that crossed over to rock and roll was predicated on its implicit but emphatic primary identification with black identity
by the beginning of the s there were popular hip hop songs and the celebrities of the scene like ll cool j gained mainstream renown
other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness or fused hip hop with jazz heavy metal techno funk and soul
new styles appeared in the latter part of the s like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion pioneered by rappers like de la soul
gangsta rap is a kind of hip hop most importantly characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality physicality and a dangerous criminal image
though the origins of gangsta rap can be traced back to the mid s style of philadelphia s schoolly d and the west coast s ice t the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country to rappers from new york such as notorious b i g
and influential hip hop group wu tang clan and to rappers on the west coast such as too short and n w a
a distinctive west coast rap scene spawned the early s g funk sound which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound often from s funk samples the best known proponents were the rappers pac dr
dre ice cube and snoop dogg
gangsta rap continued to exert a major presence in american popular music through the end of the s and early into the st century
the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip hop was supplanted in the late s largely due to the mainstream success of hip hop artists such as kanye west
the outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper cent s third studio albums graduation and curtis respectively has since been accredited to the decline
the competition resulted in record breaking sales performances by both albums and west outsold cent selling nearly a million copies of graduation in the first week alone
industry observers remark that west s victory over cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta rap conventions in order to be commercially successful
west effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip hop artists including drake kendrick lamar and j
cole who did not follow the hardcore gangster mold and became platinum selling artists
the american music industry is dominated by large companies that produce market and distribute certain kinds of music
generally these companies do not produce or produce in only very limited quantities recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences
smaller companies often fill in the void offering a wide variety of recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa
many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region such as tejano or hawaiian music or they may be widely dispersed such as the audience for jewish klezmer
among the hispanic american musicians who were pioneers in the early stages of rock and roll were ritchie valens who scored several hits most notably la bamba and herman santiago wrote the lyrics to the iconic rock and roll song why do fools fall in love
songs that became popular in the united states and are heard during the holiday christmas season are d nde est santa claus is a novelty christmas song with year old augie r os was a record hit in which featured the mark jeffrey orchestra
feliz navidad by jos feliciano is another famous latin song
the single largest niche industry is based on latin music
latin music has long influenced american popular music and was an especially crucial part of the development of jazz
modern pop latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across latin america including colombian cumbia puerto rican reggaeton and mexican corrido
latin popular music in the united states began with a wave of dance bands in the s and s
the most popular styles included the conga rumba and mambo
in the s perez prado made the cha cha cha famous and the rise of afro cuban jazz opened many ears to the harmonic melodic and rhythmic possibilities of latin music
the most famous american form of latin music however is salsa
salsa incorporates many styles and variations the term can be used to describe most forms of popular cuban derived genres
most specifically however salsa refers to a particular style that was developed by mid s groups of new york city area cuban and puerto rican immigrants and stylistic descendants like s salsa romantica
salsa rhythms are complicated with several patterns played simultaneously
the clave rhythm forms the basis of salsa songs and is used by the performers as a common rhythmic ground for their own phrases
latin american music has long influenced american popular music jazz rhythm and blues and even country music
this includes music from spanish portuguese and sometimes french speaking countries and territories of latin america
today the american record industry defines latin music as any type of release with lyrics mostly in spanish
mainstream artists and producers tend to feature more on songs from latin artists and it s also become more likely that english language songs crossover to spanish radio and vice versa
the united states played a significant role in the development of electronic dance music specifically house and techno which originated in chicago and detroit respectively
today latin american music has become a term for music performed by latinos regardless of whether it has a latin element or not
acts such as shakira jennifer lopez enrique iglesias pitbull selena gomez christina aguilera gloria estefan demi lovato mariah carey becky g paulina rubio and camila cabello are prominent on the pop charts
iglesias who holds the record for most s on billboard s hot latin tracks released a bilingual album inspired by urban acts he releases two completely different songs to latin and pop formats at the same time
the government of the united states regulates the music industry enforces intellectual property laws and promotes and collects certain kinds of music
under american copyright law musical works including recordings and compositions are protected as intellectual property as soon as they are fixed in a tangible form
copyright holders often register their work with the library of congress which maintains a collection of the material
in addition the library of congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early th century such as by sending researchers to record folk music
these researchers include the pioneering american folk song collector alan lomax whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid th century
the federal government also funds the national endowments for the arts and humanities which allocate grants to musicians and other artists the smithsonian institution which conducts research and educational programs and the corporation for public broadcasting which funds non profit and television broadcasters
music has long affected the politics of the united states
political parties and movements frequently use music and song to communicate their ideals and values and to provide entertainment at political functions
the presidential campaign of william henry harrison was the first to greatly benefit from music after which it became standard practice for major candidates to use songs to create public enthusiasm
in more recent decades politicians often chose theme songs some of which have become iconic the song happy days are here again for example has been associated with the democratic party since the campaign of franklin d
roosevelt
since the s however music has declined in importance in politics replaced by televised campaigning with little or no music
certain forms of music became more closely associated with political protest especially in the s
gospel stars like mahalia jackson became important figures in the civil rights movement while the american folk revival helped spread the counterculture of the s and opposition to the vietnam war
the united states has the world s largest music market with a total retail value of billion dollars in the american music industry includes a number of fields ranging from record companies to radio stations and community orchestras
total industry revenue is about billion worldwide and about billion in the united states
most of the world s major record companies are based in the united states they are represented by the recording industry association of america riaa
the major record companies produce material by artists that have signed to one of their record labels a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer
record companies may also promote and market their artists through advertising public performances and concerts and television appearances
record companies may be affiliated with other music media companies which produce a product related to popular recorded music
these include television channels like mtv magazines like rolling stone and radio stations
in recent years the music industry has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the internet downloading of copyrighted music many musicians and the riaa have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music
radio stations in the united states often broadcast popular music
each music station has a format or a category of songs to be played these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification
many radio stations in the united states are locally owned and operated and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings many other stations are owned by large companies like clear channel and are generally formatted on smaller more repetitive playlists
commercial sales of recordings are tracked by billboard magazine which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales
the billboard hot is the top pop music chart for singles a recording consisting of a handful of songs longer pop recordings are albums and are tracked by the billboard
though recorded music is commonplace in american homes many of the music industry s revenue comes from a small number of devotees for example of album sales come from less than of the music buying audience
total cd sales in the united states topped million units sold in and singles sales just under three million
though the major record companies dominate the american music industry an independent music industry indie music does exist
most indie record labels have limited if any retail distribution outside a small region
artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim to be signed to a major label others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers
indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music but is often inaccessible unusual or otherwise unappealing to many people
indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the internet for fans and others to download and listen
in addition to recording artists of many kinds there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the united states many of whom rarely record including community orchestras wedding singers and bands lounge singers and nightclub djs
the american federation of musicians is the largest american labor union for professional musicians
however only of the federation s members have steady music employment
music is an important part of education in the united states and is a part of most or all school systems in the country
music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools and is an elective in later years
the scholarly study of music in the united states includes work relating music to social class racial ethnic and religious identity gender and sexuality as well as studies of music history musicology and other topics
the academic study of american music can be traced back to the late th century when researchers like alice fletcher and francis la flesche studied the music of the omaha peoples working for the bureau of american ethnology and the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology
in the s and into the early th century musicological recordings were made among indigenous hispanic african american and anglo american peoples of the united states
many worked for the library of congress first under the leadership of oscar sonneck chief of the library s music divisions
these researchers included robert w
gordon founder of the archive of american folk song and john and alan lomax alan lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the th century roots revival of american folk culture
early th scholarly analysis of american music tended to interpret european derived classical traditions as the most worthy of study with the folk religious and traditional musics of the common people denigrated as low class and of little artistic or social worth
american music history was compared to the much longer historical record of european nations and was found wanting leading writers like the composer arthur farwell to ponder what sorts of musical traditions might arise from american culture in his music in america
in john tasker howard s our american music became a standard analysis focusing on largely on concert music composed in the united states
since the analysis of musicologist charles seeger in the mid th century american music history has often been described as intimately related to perceptions of race and ancestry
under this view the diverse racial and ethnic background of the united states has both promoted a sense of musical separation between the races while still fostering constant acculturation as elements of european african and indigenous musics have shifted between fields
gilbert chase s america s music from the pilgrims to the present was the first major work to examine the music of the entire united states and recognize folk traditions as more culturally significant than music for the concert hall
chase s analysis of a diverse american musical identity has remained the dominant view among the academic establishment
until the s and s however most musical scholars in the united states continued to study european music limiting themselves only to certain fields of american music especially european derived classical and operatic styles and sometimes african american jazz
more modern musicologists and ethnomusicologists have studied subjects ranging from the national musical identity to the individual styles and techniques of specific communities in a particular time of american history
prominent recent studies of american music include charles hamm s music in the new world from and richard crawford s america s musical life from
music is an important part of several american holidays especially playing a major part in the wintertime celebration of christmas

music also plays a role at many regional holidays that are not celebrated nationwide most famously mardi gras a music and dance parade and festival in new orleans louisiana
the united states is home to numerous music festivals which showcase styles ranging from the blues and jazz to indie rock and heavy metal
some music festivals are strictly local in scope including few or no performers with a national reputation and are generally operated by local promoters
