resistive random access memory reram or rram is a type of non volatile nv random access ram computer memory that works by changing the resistance across a dielectric solid state material often referred to as a memristor
reram bears some similarities to conductive bridging ram cbram and phase change memory pcm
cbram involves one electrode providing ions that dissolve readily in an electrolyte material while pcm involves generating sufficient joule heating to effect amorphous to crystalline or crystalline to amorphous phase changes
by contrast reram involves generating defects in a thin oxide layer known as oxygen vacancies oxide bond locations where the oxygen has been removed which can subsequently charge and drift under an electric field
the motion of oxygen ions and vacancies in the oxide would be analogous to the motion of electrons and holes in a semiconductor
although reram was initially seen as a replacement technology for flash memory the cost and performance benefits of reram have not been enough for companies to proceed with the replacement
apparently a broad range of materials can be used for reram
however the discovery that the popular high gate dielectric hfo can be used as a low voltage reram has encouraged researchers to investigate more possibilities
rram is the registered trademark name of sharp corporation a japanese electronic components manufacturer in some countries including members of the european union
in the early s rerams were under development by a number of companies some of which filed patent applications claiming various implementations of this technology
reram has entered commercialization on an initially limited kb capacity scale
in february rambus bought a reram company called unity semiconductor for million
panasonic launched an reram evaluation kit in may based on a tantalum oxide t r transistor resistor memory cell architecture
in crossbar introduced an reram prototype as a chip about the size of a postage stamp that could store tb of data
in august the company claimed that large scale production of their reram chips was scheduled for
the memory structure ag a si si closely resembles a silver based cbram
also in hewlett packard demonstrated a memristor based reram wafer and predicted that tb ssds based on the technology could be available in with pb capacities available in just in time for the stop in growth of nand flash capacities
different forms of reram have been disclosed based on different dielectric materials spanning from perovskites to transition metal oxides to chalcogenides
silicon dioxide was shown to exhibit resistive switching as early as may and has recently been revisited
in and a thin film resistive memory array was first proposed by members of the university of nebraska lincoln
further work on this new thin film resistive memory was reported by j g
simmons in
in members of the atomic energy research establishment and university of leeds attempted to explain the mechanism theoretically
in may a research team from the university of florida and honeywell reported a manufacturing method for magneto resistive random access memory by utilizing electron cyclotron resonance plasma etching
leon chua argued that all two terminal non volatile memory devices including reram should be considered memristors
stan williams of hp labs also argued that reram was a memristor
however others challenged this terminology and the applicability of memristor theory to any physically realizable device is open to question
whether redox based resistively switching elements reram are covered by the current memristor theory is disputed
silicon oxide presents an interesting case of resistance switching
two distinct modes of intrinsic switching have been reported surface based in which conductive silicon filaments are generated at exposed edges which may be internal within pores or external on the surface of mesa structures and bulk switching in which oxygen vacancy filaments are generated within the bulk of the oxide
the former mode suffers from oxidation of the filaments in air requiring hermetic sealing to enable switching
the latter requires no sealing
in researchers from rice university announced a silicon filament based device that used a porous silicon oxide dielectric with no external edge structure rather filaments were formed at internal edges within pores
devices can be manufactured at room temperature and have a sub v forming voltage high on off ratio low power consumption nine bit capacity per cell high switching speeds and good endurance
problems with their inoperability in air can be overcome by hermetic sealing of devices
bulk switching in silicon oxide pioneered by researchers at ucl university college london since offers low electroforming voltages v switching voltages around v switching times in the nanoseconds regime and more than cycles without device failure all in ambient conditions
the basic idea is that a dielectric which is normally insulating can be made to conduct through a filament or conduction path formed after application of a sufficiently high voltage
the conduction path can arise from different mechanisms including vacancy or metal defect migration
once the filament is formed it may be reset broken resulting in high resistance or set re formed resulting in lower resistance by another voltage
many current paths rather than a single filament are possibly involved
the presence of these current paths in the dielectric can be in situ demonstrated via conductive atomic force microscopy
the low resistance path can be either localized filamentary or homogeneous
both effects can occur either throughout the entire distance between the electrodes or only in proximity to one of the electrodes
filamentary and homogenous switching effects can be distinguished by measuring the area dependence of the low resistance state
under certain conditions the forming operation may be bypassed
it is expected that under these conditions the initial current is already quite high compared to insulating oxide layers
cbram cells generally would not require forming if cu ions are already present in the electrolyte having already been driven in by a designed photo diffusion or annealing process such cells may also readily return to their initial state
in the absence of such cu initially being in the electrolyte the voltage would still be applied directly to the electrolyte and forming would be a strong possibility
for random access type memories a t r one transistor one resistor architecture is preferred because the transistor isolates current to cells that are selected from cells that are not
on the other hand a cross point architecture is more compact and may enable vertically stacking memory layers ideally suited for mass storage devices
however in the absence of any transistors isolation must be provided by a selector device such as a diode in series with the memory element or by the memory element itself
such isolation capabilities are inferior to the use of transistors if the on off ratio for the selector is not sufficient limiting the ability to operate very large arrays in this architecture
thin film based threshold switch can work as a selector for bipolar and unipolar reram
threshold switch based selector was demonstrated for mb array
the cross point architecture requires beol compatible two terminal selectors like punch through diode for bipolar reram or pin diode for unipolar reram
polarity can be either binary or unary
bipolar effects cause polarity to reverse when switching from low to high resistance reset operation compared to switching high to low set operation
unipolar switching leaves polarity unaffected but uses different voltages
multiple inorganic and organic material systems display thermal or ionic resistive switching effects
these can be grouped into the following categories
phase change chalcogenides such as ge sb te or aginsbte
binary transition metal oxides such as nio or tio
perovskites such as sr zr tio or pcmo
solid state electrolytes such as ges gese siox or cu s
organic charge transfer complexes such as cutcnq
organic donor acceptor systems such as al aidcn
two dimensional layered insulating materials like hexagonal boron nitridepapers at the iedm conference in suggested for the first time that reram exhibits lower programming currents than pram or mram without sacrificing programming performance retention or endurance
some commonly cited reram systems are described further below
at iedm the highest performance reram technology to date was demonstrated by itri using hfo with a ti buffer layer showing switching times less than ns and currents less than a
at iedm itri again broke the speed record showing ns switching time while also showing process and operation improvements to allow yield up to and endurance up to billion cycles
imec presented updates of their reram program at the symposia on vlsi technology and circuits including a solution with a na operating current
itri had focused on the ti hfo system since its first publication in
itri s patent has since been sold to tsmc the number of prior licensees is unknown
on the other hand imec focused mainly on hf hfo
winbond had done more recent work toward advancing and commercializing the hfo based reram
panasonic revealed its taox based reram at iedm
a key requirement was the need for a high work function metal such as pt or ir to interface with the taox layer
the change of o content results in resistance change as well as schottky barrier change
more recently a ta o taox layer was implemented which still requires the high work function metal to interface with ta o
this system has been associated with high endurance demonstration trillion cycles but products are specified at k cycles
filament diameters as large as nm have been observed
panasonic released a mb part with fujitsu and is developing nm embedded memory with umc
on april hp announced that they had discovered the memristor originally envisioned as a missing th fundamental circuit element by chua in
on july they announced they would begin prototyping reram using their memristors
hp first demonstrated its memristor using tiox but later migrated to taox possibly due to improved stability
the taox based device has some material similarity to panasonic s reram but the operation characteristics are different
the hf hfox system was similarly studied
the adesto technologies reram is based on filaments generated from the electrode metal rather than oxygen vacancies
the original material system was ag ges but eventually migrated to zrte al o
the tellurium filament achieved better stability as compared to silver
adesto has targeted the ultralow power memory for internet of things iot applications
adesto has released products manufactured at altis foundry and entered into a nm foundry agreement with towerjazz panasonic
weebit nano has been working with cea leti one of the largest nanotechnology research institutes in europe to further reram technology
beginning in november the company has demonstrated the manufacturability in nm siox reram cells followed by demonstrations of working arrays in and discrete components in
in july the company taped out its first embedded reram modules
in september weebit together with leti produced tested and characterized a mb reram array using a nm fdsoi process on mm wafers
crossbar implements an ag filament in amorphous si along with a threshold switching system to achieve a diode reram
their system includes the use of a transistor in t r or tnr architecture
crossbar started producing samples at smic on the nm process in
the ag filament diameter has been visualized on the scale of tens of nanometers
infineon technologies calls it conductive bridging ram cbram nec has a variant called nanobridge and sony calls their version electrolytic memory
new research suggests cbram can be d printed
quantum dot resistive memory device
quantum dot based non volatile resistive memory device with a switching speed of ns and on off ratio of
the device showed excellent endurance characteristics for switching cycles
retention tests showed good stability and the devices are reproducible
memory operating mechanism is proposed based on charge trapping in quantum dots with alox acting as barrier
this mechanism is supported by marked variation in capacitance value in on and off states
panasonic am l stk mn lr d bit mcu with built in reram for evaluation usb connectorcompared to pram reram operates at a faster timescale switching time can be less than ns while compared to mram it has a simpler smaller cell structure less than f mim stack
a vertical d r one diode one resistive switching device integration can be used for crossbar memory structure to reduce the unit cell size to f f is the feature dimension
compared to flash memory and racetrack memory a lower voltage is sufficient and hence it can be used in low power applications
itri has shown that reram is scalable below nm
the motion of oxygen atoms is a key phenomenon for oxide based reram one study indicated that oxygen motion may take place in regions as small as nm
it is believed that if a filament is responsible it would not exhibit direct scaling with cell size
instead the current compliance limit set by an outside resistor for example could define the current carrying capacity of the filament
a significant hurdle to realizing the potential of reram is the sneak path problem that occurs in larger passive arrays
in complementary resistive switching crs was introduced as a possible solution to sneak path current interference
in the crs approach the information storing states are pairs of high and low resistance states hrs lrs and lrs hrs so that the overall resistance is always high allowing larger passive crossbar arrays
a drawback to the initial crs solution is the requirement for switching endurance caused by conventional destructive readout based on current measurements
a new approach for a nondestructive readout based on capacity measurement potentially lowers the requirements for both material endurance and power consumption
bi layer structure is used to produce the nonlinearity in lrs to avoid the sneak path problem
a single layer device exhibiting a strong nonlinear conduction in lrs was reported
another bi layer structure was introduced for bipolar reram to improve the hrs and stability
another solution to the sneak current issue is to perform read and reset operations in parallel across an entire row of cells while using set on selected cells
in this case for a d reram tnr array with a column of n reram cells situated above a select transistor only the intrinsic nonlinearity of the hrs is required to be sufficiently large since the number of vertical levels n is limited e g n and this has been shown possible for a low current reram system
modeling of d and d caches designed with reram and other non volatile random access memories such as mram and pcm can be done using destiny tool
the increasing computational demands necessary for many improvements in artificial intelligence have led many to speculate that reram implementations could be extremely useful hardware for running artificial intelligence and machine learning applications
