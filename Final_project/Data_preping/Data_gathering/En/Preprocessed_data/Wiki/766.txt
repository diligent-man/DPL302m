Barrovian or Barrow dialect is an accent and dialect of English found in Barrow in Furness and several parts of the town's wider borough in Cumbria England historically in the county of Lancashire Although a member of the Cumbrian dialect The Barrovian and south Cumbria accent has a lot in common with the dialect of northern Lancashire particularly the Lancaster Morecambe area
Barrovian is also used as a demonym for inhabitants of Barrow
Up until the mid th century Barrow was nothing but a cluster of small villages with the Cumbrian dialect prevailing throughout huge growth however occurred between and spurred on by the introduction of the railway to the Furness peninsula and the rapidly expanding steel and jute works Barrow also became a major shipbuilding centre in the early th century From a few thousand to residents in under half a century the majority of these were immigrants to the town drawn by the burgeoning industries Large influxes came from elsewhere in Lancashire Ireland especially the counties of Antrim and Tyrone and Scotland with existing shipbuilding regions such as the Clyde and Tyneside providing a significant percentage of migrants in the early to mid th century During the s one in six of the local population had been born in Ireland or Scotland Barrow became a melting pot of accents and dialects and although it remains primarily Cumbria Lancashire orientated has strong influences from a wide geographical area
Numerous place names in Barrow are of Old Norse and Celtic origin Although they have long been Anglicised many have had their pronunciation skewed over time by the aforementioned immigrant groups One notable example being the suburbs of Roose which was settled by Cornish tin miners and is now pronounced locally with a 'z' in place of the 's' The name Furness is also pronounced to sound like 'furnace'
A study of the Barrovian dialect by the British Library found a number of traits common amongst the populace Most of the observations made are similar to other Northern English dialects with the sound as in 'up' or 'mother' being pronounced as in 'good' or 'put' Other observations made included frequent T glottalization on last letters and frequent intervocalic and syllable initial T glottaling In Plain English this can be described as the letter 't' being dropped from the middle or end of words Examples of this include the word 'cart' k rt being pronounced as 'car' ka with a Glottal stop after the letter 'r' Alternatively the number 'twenty' tw nti could be pronounced 'twen y' tw n i The same study also found frequent G dropping H dropping and Th fronting Respective examples of these phonetics include 'freezing exciting sleeping' being pronounced 'freezin excitin sleepin' where G dropping speakers pronounce the ing syllable as n while non G dropping speakers have 'appy h pi hour ha w r have h v ' being pronounced 'appy pi our a ave v ' with removal of the front ' h ' and 'through ru thought t three ri ' being pronounced as 'rough fr u frought fr t free fr i '
Pronunciation of words ending with the sound 'ure' u r are another distinct indicator of the Barrovian dialect Some words drop the u completely and convert the 're' r to 'er' r Examples of this include the word 'brochure' being pronounced 'broch er' bro 'texture' as 'text er' t kst and 'figure' as 'fig er' f g Alternatively many words containing u r are pronounced u r e g in the Barrovian dialect 'moor' rhymes with 'truer' Further examples being 'cure' kj r pronounced 'kyou er' kj u 'tour' t r as 'too er' t u 'mature' as 'ma chou er' m t u and 'secure' as 'sec you er' s k j u There is no convention for which words drop the letter 'u' and which emphasise it with little correlation between word length and pronunciation
The words 'dead' and 'well' are often used in conversation to mean 'very' or make a strong point for example it was well good or it was dead bad The word 'like' is frequently used with little meaning as is the term 'and that' which roughly translates to the use of the term 'etc ' in a spoken conversation For example I bought some crisps and biscuits and that
a bough s m crisps n biscuits n a
