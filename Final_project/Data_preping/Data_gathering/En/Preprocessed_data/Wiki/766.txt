barrovian or barrow dialect is an accent and dialect of english found in barrow in furness and several parts of the town s wider borough in cumbria england historically in the county of lancashire
although a member of the cumbrian dialect the barrovian and south cumbria accent has a lot in common with the dialect of northern lancashire particularly the lancaster morecambe area
barrovian is also used as a demonym for inhabitants of barrow
up until the mid th century barrow was nothing but a cluster of small villages with the cumbrian dialect prevailing throughout huge growth however occurred between and spurred on by the introduction of the railway to the furness peninsula and the rapidly expanding steel and jute works
barrow also became a major shipbuilding centre in the early th century
from a few thousand to residents in under half a century the majority of these were immigrants to the town drawn by the burgeoning industries
large influxes came from elsewhere in lancashire ireland especially the counties of antrim and tyrone and scotland with existing shipbuilding regions such as the clyde and tyneside providing a significant percentage of migrants in the early to mid th century
during the s one in six of the local population had been born in ireland or scotland
barrow became a melting pot of accents and dialects and although it remains primarily cumbria lancashire orientated has strong influences from a wide geographical area
numerous place names in barrow are of old norse and celtic origin
although they have long been anglicised many have had their pronunciation skewed over time by the aforementioned immigrant groups
one notable example being the suburbs of roose which was settled by cornish tin miners and is now pronounced locally with a z in place of the s
the name furness is also pronounced to sound like furnace
a study of the barrovian dialect by the british library found a number of traits common amongst the populace
most of the observations made are similar to other northern english dialects with the sound as in up or mother being pronounced as in good or put
other observations made included frequent t glottalization on last letters and frequent intervocalic and syllable initial t glottaling
in plain english this can be described as the letter t being dropped from the middle or end of words
examples of this include the word cart k rt being pronounced as car ka with a glottal stop after the letter r
alternatively the number twenty tw nti could be pronounced twen y tw n i
the same study also found frequent g dropping h dropping and th fronting
respective examples of these phonetics include freezing exciting sleeping being pronounced freezin excitin sleepin where g dropping speakers pronounce the ing syllable as n while non g dropping speakers have appy h pi hour ha w r have h v being pronounced appy pi our a ave v with removal of the front h and through ru thought t three ri being pronounced as rough fr u frought fr t free fr i
pronunciation of words ending with the sound ure u r are another distinct indicator of the barrovian dialect
some words drop the u completely and convert the re r to er r examples of this include the word brochure being pronounced broch er bro texture as text er t kst and figure as fig er f g
alternatively many words containing u r are pronounced u r e g
in the barrovian dialect moor rhymes with truer
further examples being cure kj r pronounced kyou er kj u tour t r as too er t u mature as ma chou er m t u and secure as sec you er s k j u
there is no convention for which words drop the letter u and which emphasise it with little correlation between word length and pronunciation
the words dead and well are often used in conversation to mean very or make a strong point for example it was well good or it was dead bad
the word like is frequently used with little meaning as is the term and that which roughly translates to the use of the term etc in a spoken conversation
for example i bought some crisps and biscuits and that
a bough s m crisps n biscuits n a
