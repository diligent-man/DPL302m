work blocking adrenergic receptor heart thus decreasing heart rate workload
wa commonly prescribed medication united state million prescriptions
atenolol used number condition including hyperthyroidism hypertension angina long qt syndrome acute myocardial infarction supraventricular tachycardia ventricular tachycardia symptom alcohol withdrawal
role blocker general hypertension wa downgraded june united kingdom later united state le appropriate agent ace inhibitor calcium channel blocker thiazide diuretic angiotensin receptor blocker particularly elderly
hypertension treated blocker atenolol alone conjunction thiazide diuretic associated higher incidence new onset type diabetes mellitus compared treated ace inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker
-blockers atenolol mainly studied provides weaker protection stroke mortality patient year old compared antihypertensive medications
diuretic may associated better cardiovascular cerebrovascular outcome blocker elderly
symptom overdose due excessive pharmacodynamic action also receptors
include bradycardia slow heartbeat severe hypotension shock acute heart failure hypoglycemia bronchospastic reactions
atropine counteract bradycardia glucagon help hypoglycemia dobutamine given hypotension inhalation mimetic hexoprenalin salbutamol terminate bronchospasms
blood plasma atenolol concentration may measured confirm diagnosis poisoning hospitalized patient assist medicolegal death investigation
plasma level usually le mgl therapeutic administration range mgl overdose victims
atenolol ha given example slow healthcare provider change prescribing practice face medical evidence indicates drug effective others treating conditions
although number prescription ha declining steadily since limited evidence article contesting efficacy wa published ha estimated would take year doctor stop prescribing hypertension
despite diminished efficacy compared newer antihypertensive drug atenolol beta blocker still relevant clinical choice treating condition since beta blocker diverse group medicine different property still requires research
consequence reason popularity beta blocker cannot fully attributed slow healthcare system patient compliance factor treatment cost duration also affect adherence popularity therapy
