Kublai ku bla also spelled Qubilai or K bilai Mongolian romanized Khubilai Chinese pinyin H b li September February also known by his regnal name Setsen Khan was the founder of the Yuan dynasty of China and the fifth khagan emperor of the Mongol Empire from to although after the division of the empire this was a nominal position He proclaimed the empire's dynastic name Great Yuan in and ruled Yuan China until his death in He is also known in historiography as Emperor Shizu of Yuan Chinese pinyin Yu n Sh z by his temple name Shizu
Kublai was the fourth son of Tolui his second son with Sorghaghtani Beki and a grandson of Genghis Khan He was almost when Genghis Khan died and had succeeded his older brother M ngke as Khagan in but had to defeat his younger brother Ariq B ke in the Toluid Civil War lasting until This episode marked the beginning of the fragmentation of the empire Kublai's real power was limited to the Yuan Empire even though as Khagan he still had influence in the Ilkhanate and to a significantly lesser degree in the Golden Horde If one considers the Mongol Empire at that time as a whole his realm reached from the Pacific Ocean to the Black Sea from Siberia to what is now Afghanistan
In Kublai established the Yuan dynasty and formally claimed orthodox succession from prior Chinese dynasties The Yuan dynasty came to rule over most of present day China Mongolia Korea southern Siberia and other adjacent areas He also amassed influence in the Middle East and Europe as khagan By the Yuan conquest of the Song dynasty was completed and Kublai became the first non Han emperor to rule all of China proper
The imperial portrait of Kublai was part of an album of the portraits of Yuan emperors and empresses now in the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipei White the color of the imperial costume of Kublai was the imperial color of the Yuan dynasty based on the Chinese philosophical concept of the Five Elements
Kublai Khan was the fourth son of Tolui and his second son with Sorghaghtani Beki As his grandfather Genghis Khan advised Sorghaghtani chose a Buddhist Tangut woman as her son's nurse whom Kublai later honored highly On his way home after the Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia Genghis Khan performed a ceremony on his grandsons M ngke and Kublai after their first hunt in near the Ili River Kublai was nine years old and with his eldest brother killed a rabbit and an antelope After his grandfather smeared fat from killed animals onto Kublai's middle finger in accordance with a Mongol tradition he said The words of this boy Kublai are full of wisdom heed them well heed them all of you The elderly Genghis Khan would die three years after this event in when Kublai was Kublai's father Tolui would serve as regent for two years until Genghis' successor Kublai's third uncle Ogedei was enthroned as Khagan in
After the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty in Ogedei gave Hebei attached with households to the family of Tolui who died in Kublai received an estate of his own which included households Because he was inexperienced Kublai allowed local officials free rein Corruption amongst his officials and aggressive taxation caused large numbers of ethnic Han peasants to flee which led to a decline in tax revenues Kublai quickly came to his appanage in Hebei and ordered reforms Sorghaghtani Beki sent new officials to help him and tax laws were revised Thanks to those efforts many of the people who fled returned
The most prominent and arguably most influential component of Kublai Khan's early life was his study and a strong attraction to contemporary Han culture Kublai invited Haiyun the leading Buddhist monk in northern China to his ordo in Mongolia When he met Haiyun in Karakorum in Kublai asked him about the philosophy of Buddhism Haiyun named Kublai's son who was born in Zhenjin Chinese True Gold Haiyun also introduced Kublai to the formerly Daoist Taoist and at the time Buddhist monk Liu Bingzhong Liu was a painter calligrapher poet and mathematician and he became Kublai's advisor when Haiyun returned to his temple in modern Beijing Kublai soon added the Shanxi scholar Zhao Bi to his entourage Kublai employed people of other nationalities as well for he was keen to balance local and imperial interests Mongol and Turkic
In Kublai's eldest brother M ngke became Khan of the Mongol Empire and Khwarizmian Mahmud Yalavach and Kublai were sent to China Kublai received the viceroyalty over northern China and moved his ordo to central Inner Mongolia During his years as viceroy Kublai managed his territory well boosted the agricultural output of Henan and increased social welfare spendings after receiving Xi'an These acts received great acclaim from ethnic Han warlords and were essential to the founding of the Yuan dynasty In Kublai criticized Mahmud Yalavach who was never highly valued by his ethnic Han associates over his cavalier execution of suspects during a judicial review and Zhao Bi attacked him for his presumptuous attitude toward the throne M ngke dismissed Mahmud Yalavach which met with resistance from Han Confucian trained officials
In Kublai was ordered to attack Yunnan and he tried to ask the Dali Kingdom to submit The ruling Gao family resisted and killed Mongol envoys The Mongols divided their forces into three One wing rode eastward into the Sichuan basin The second column under Subutai's son Uryankhadai took a difficult route into the mountains of western Sichuan Kublai went south over the grasslands and met up with the first column While Uryankhadai travelled along the lakeside from the north Kublai took the capital city of Dali and spared the residents despite the slaying of his ambassadors The Dali emperor Duan Xingzhi himself defected to the Mongols who used his troops to conquer the rest of Yunnan Duan Xingzhi the last king of Dali was appointed by M ngke Khan as the first tusi or local ruler Duan accepted the stationing of a pacification commissioner there After Kublai's departure unrest broke out among certain factions In and Duan Xingzhi was presented at court where he offered M ngke Khan maps of Yunnan and counsels about the vanquishing of the tribes who had not yet surrendered Duan then led a considerable army to serve as guides and vanguards for the Mongol army By the end of Uryankhadai had completely pacified Yunnan
Kublai was attracted by the abilities of Tibetan monks as healers In he made Drog n Ch gyal Phagpa of the Sakya school a member of his entourage Phagpa bestowed on Kublai and his wife Chabi Chabui an empowerment initiation ritual Kublai appointed Lian Xixian of the Kingdom of Qocho the head of his pacification commission in Some officials who were jealous of Kublai's success said that he was getting above himself and dreaming of having his own empire by competing with M ngke's capital Karakorum M ngke Khan sent two tax inspectors Alamdar Ariq B ke's close friend and governor in North China and Liu Taiping to audit Kublai's officials in They found fault listed breaches of regulations accused Han officials and executed some of them and Kublai's new pacification commission was abolished Kublai sent a two man embassy with his wives and then appealed in person to M ngke who publicly forgave his younger brother and reconciled with him
The Daoists had obtained their wealth and status by seizing Buddhist temples M ngke repeatedly demanded that the Daoists cease their denigration of Buddhism and ordered Kublai to end the clerical strife between the Daoists and Buddhists in his territory Kublai called a conference of Daoist and Buddhist leaders in early At the conference the Daoist claim was officially refuted and Kublai forcibly converted Daoist temples to Buddhism and destroyed all copies of the Daoist texts Kublai Khan and the Yuan dynasty clearly favored Buddhism while his counterparts in the Chagatai Khanate the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate later converted to Islam at various times in history Berke of the Golden Horde being the only Muslim during Kublai's era his successor did not convert to Islam
In M ngke put Kublai in command of the Eastern Army and summoned him to assist with an attack on Sichuan As he was suffering from gout Kublai was allowed to stay home but he moved to assist M ngke anyway Before Kublai arrived in word reached him that M ngke had died Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on Wuhan near the Yangtze While Kublai's force besieged Wuchang Uryankhadai joined him The Song minister Jia Sidao secretly approached Kublai to propose terms He offered an annual tribute of taels of silver and bolts of silk in exchange for Mongol agreement to the Yangtze as the frontier between the states Kublai declined at first but later reached a peace agreement with Jia Sidao
Kublai received a message from his wife that his younger brother Ariq B ke had been raising troops so he returned north to the Mongolian Plateau Before he arrived he learned that Ariq B ke had held a kurultai Mongol great council at the capital Karakorum which had named him Great Khan with the support of most of Genghis Khan's descendants Kublai and the fourth brother the Il Khan Hulagu opposed this Kublai's ethnic Han staff encouraged Kublai to ascend the throne and almost all the senior princes in northern China and Manchuria supported his candidacy Upon returning to his own territories Kublai summoned his own kurultai Fewer members of the royal family supported Kublai's claims to the title though the small number of attendees included representatives of all the Borjigin lines except that of Jochi This kurultai proclaimed Kublai Great Khan on April despite Ariq B ke's apparently legal claim to become khan
This led to warfare between Kublai and Ariq B ke which resulted in the destruction of the Mongol capital at Karakorum In Shaanxi and Sichuan M ngke's army supported Ariq B ke Kublai dispatched Lian Xixian to Shaanxi and Sichuan where they executed Ariq B ke's civil administrator Liu Taiping and won over several wavering generals To secure the southern front Kublai attempted a diplomatic resolution and sent envoys to Hangzhou but Jia broke his promise and arrested them Kublai sent Abishqa as new khan to the Chagatai Khanate Ariq B ke captured Abishqa two other princes and men and he had his own man Alghu crowned khan of Chagatai's territory In the first armed clash between Ariq B ke and Kublai Ariq B ke lost and his commander Alamdar was killed at the battle In revenge Ariq B ke had Abishqa executed Kublai cut off supplies of food to Karakorum with the support of his cousin Kadan son of gedei Khan Karakorum quickly fell to Kublai's large army but following Kublai's departure it was temporarily re taken by Ariq B ke in Yizhou governor Li Tan revolted against Mongol rule in February and Kublai ordered his Chancellor Shi Tianze and Shi Shu to attack Li Tan The two armies crushed Li Tan's revolt in just a few months and Li Tan was executed These armies also executed Wang Wentong Li Tan's father in law who had been appointed the Chief Administrator of the Central Secretariat Zhongshu Sheng early in Kublai's reign and became one of Kublai's most trusted Han Chinese officials The incident instilled in Kublai a distrust of ethnic Hans After becoming emperor Kublai banned granting the titles of and tithes to ethnic Han warlords
Chagatayid Khan Alghu who had been appointed by Ariq B ke declared his allegiance to Kublai and defeated a punitive expedition sent by Ariq B ke in The Ilkhan Hulagu also sided with Kublai and criticized Ariq B ke Ariq B ke surrendered to Kublai at Xanadu on August The rulers of the western khanates acknowledged Kublai's victory and rule in Mongolia When Kublai summoned them to a new kurultai Alghu Khan demanded recognition of his illegal position from Kublai in return Despite tensions between them both Hulagu and Berke khan of the Golden Horde at first accepted Kublai's invitation However they soon declined to attend the kurultai Kublai pardoned Ariq B ke although he executed Ariq B ke's chief supporters
The mysterious deaths of three Jochid princes in Hulagu's service the Siege of Baghdad and unequal distribution of war spoils strained the Ilkhanate's relations with the Golden Horde In Hulagu's complete purge of the Jochid troops and support for Kublai in his conflict with Ariq B ke brought open war with the Golden Horde Kublai reinforced Hulagu with young Mongols in order to stabilize the political crises in the western regions of the Mongol Empire When Hulagu died on February Berke marched to cross near Tbilisi to conquer the Ilkhanate but died on the way Within a few months of these deaths Alghu Khan of the Chagatai Khanate also died In the new official version of his family's history Kublai refused to write Berke's name as the khan of the Golden Horde because of Berke's support for Ariq B ke and wars with Hulagu however Jochi's family was fully recognized as legitimate family members
Kublai Khan named Abaqa as the new Ilkhan obedient khan and nominated Batu's grandson Mentemu for the throne of Sarai the capital of the Golden Horde The Kublaids in the east retained suzerainty over the Ilkhans until the end of their regime Kublai also sent his protege Ghiyas ud din Baraq to overthrow the court of the Oirat Orghana the empress of the Chagatai Khanate who put her young son Mubarak Shah on the throne in without Kublai's permission after her husband's death
Prince Kaidu of the House of gedei declined to personally attend the court of Kublai Kublai instigated Baraq to attack Kaidu Baraq began to expand his realm northward he seized power in and fought Kaidu and the Golden Horde He also pushed out Great Khan's overseer from the Tarim Basin When Kaidu and Mentemu together defeated Kublai Baraq joined an alliance with the House of gedei and the Golden Horde against Kublai in the east and Abagha in the west Meanwhile Mentemu avoided any direct military expedition against Kublai's realm The Golden Horde promised Kublai their assistance to defeat Kaidu whom Mentemu called the rebel This was apparently due to the conflict between Kaidu and Mentemu over the agreement they made at the Talas kurultai The armies of Mongol Persia defeated Baraq's invading forces in When Baraq died the next year Kaidu took control of the Chagatai Khanate and recovered his alliance with Mentemu
Meanwhile Kublai tried to stabilize his control over the Korean Peninsula by mobilizing another Mongol invasion after he enthroned Wonjong of Goryeo r in on Ganghwado Kublai also forced two rulers of the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate to call a truce with each other in despite the Golden Horde's interests in the Middle East and the Caucasus
In Kublai sent one of his advisors Hao Ching to the court of Emperor Lizong of Song to say that if Lizong submitted to Kublai and surrender his dynasty he would be granted some autonomy Emperor Lizong refused to meet Kublai's demands and imprisoned Hao Ching and when Kublai sent a delegation to release Hao Ching Emperor Lizong sent them back
Kublai called two Iraqi siege engineers from the Ilkhanate in order to destroy the fortresses of Song China After the fall of Xiangyang in Kublai's commanders Aju and Liu Zheng proposed a final campaign against the Song Dynasty and Kublai made Bayan of the Baarin the supreme commander Kublai ordered M ngke Tem r to revise the second census of the Golden Horde to provide resources and men for his conquest of China The census took place in all parts of the Golden Horde including Smolensk and Vitebsk in The Khans also sent Nogai Khan to the Balkans to strengthen Mongol influence there
Kublai renamed the Mongol regime in China Dai Yuan in and sought to sinicize his image as Emperor of China in order to win control of millions of Han Chinese people When he moved his headquarters to Khanbaliq also called Dadu at modern day Beijing there was an uprising in the old capital Karakorum that he barely contained Kublai's actions were condemned by traditionalists and his critics still accused him of being too closely tied to Han Chinese culture They sent a message to him The old customs of our Empire are not those of the Han Chinese laws What will happen to the old customs Kaidu attracted the other elites of Mongol Khanates declaring himself to be a legitimate heir to the throne instead of Kublai who had turned away from the ways of Genghis Khan Defections from Kublai's Dynasty swelled the gedeids' forces
The Song imperial family surrendered to the Yuan in making the Mongols the first non Han Chinese peoples to conquer all of China Three years later Yuan marines crushed the last of the Song loyalists The Song Empress Dowager and her grandson Emperor Gong of Song were then settled in Khanbaliq where they were given tax free property and Kublai's wife Chabi took a personal interest in their well being However Kublai later had Emperor Gong sent away to become a monk to Zhangye
Kublai succeeded in building a powerful empire created an academy offices trade ports and canals and sponsored science and the arts The record of the Mongols lists public schools created during Kublai's reign Having achieved real or nominal dominion over much of Eurasia and having successfully conquered China Kublai was in a position to look beyond China However Kublai's costly invasions of Vietnam Sakhalin Burma Champa and Vietnam again secured only the vassal status of those countries Mongol invasions of Japan and the third invasion of Vietnam and the invasion of Java failed
At the same time Kublai's nephew Ilkhan Abagha tried to form a grand alliance of the Mongols and the Western European powers to defeat the Mamluks in Syria and North Africa that constantly invaded the Mongol dominions Abagha and Kublai focused mostly on foreign alliances and opened trade routes Khagan Kublai dined with a large court every day and met with many ambassadors and foreign merchants
Kublai's son Nomukhan and his generals occupied Almaliq from to In a group of Genghisid princes under M ngke's son Shiregi rebelled kidnapped Kublai's two sons and his general Antong and handed them over to Kaidu and M ngke Tem r The latter was still allied with Kaidu who fashioned an alliance with him in although M ngke Tem r had promised Kublai his military support to protect Kublai from the gedeids Kublai's armies suppressed the rebellion and strengthened the Yuan garrisons in Mongolia and the Ili River basin However Kaidu took control over Almaliq
In Kublai decreed death for those who performed slaughtering of cattle according to the legal codes of Islam dhabihah or Judaism kashrut which offended Mongolian custom When Tekuder seized the throne of the Ilkhanate in attempting to make peace with the Mamluks Abaqa's old Mongols under prince Arghun appealed to Kublai After the assassination of Ahmad Fanakati and execution of his sons Kublai confirmed Arghun's coronation and awarded his commander in chief Buqa the title of chancellor
Kublai's niece Kelmish who married a Khongirad general of the Golden Horde was powerful enough to have Kublai's sons Nomuqan and Kokhchu returned Three leaders of the Jochids Tode Mongke K ch and Nogai agreed to release two princes The court of the Golden Horde returned the princes as a peace overture to the Yuan Dynasty in and induced Kaidu to release Kublai's general Konchi khan of the White Horde established friendly relations with the Yuan and the Ilkhanate and as a reward received luxury gifts and grain from Kublai Despite political disagreement between contending branches of the family over the office of Khagan the economic and commercial system continued
Kublai Khan considered China his main base realizing within a decade of his enthronement as Great Khan that he needed to concentrate on governing there From the beginning of his reign he adopted Chinese political and cultural models and worked to minimize the influences of regional lords who had held immense power before and during the Song Dynasty Kublai heavily relied on his Chinese advisers until about He had many Han Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Xu Heng and employed many Buddhist Uyghurs some of whom were resident commissioners running Chinese districts
Kublai also appointed the Sakya lama Drog n Ch gyal Phagpa the Phags pa Lama his Imperial Preceptor giving him power over all the empire's Buddhist monks In after the Phags pa Lama created the 'Phags pa script he was promoted to imperial preceptor Kublai established the Supreme Control Commission under the Phags pa Lama to administer affairs of Tibetan and Chinese monks During Phagspa's absence in Tibet the Tibetan monk Sangha rose to high office and had the office renamed the Commission for Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs In Sangha became the dynasty's chief fiscal officer However their corruption later embittered Kublai and he later relied wholly on younger Mongol aristocrats Antong of the Jalairs and Bayan of the Baarin served as grand councillors from and Oz temur of the Arulad headed the censorate Borokhula's descendant Ochicher headed a kheshig Mongolian imperial guard and the palace provision commission
In the eighth year of Zhiyuan Kublai officially created the Yuan dynasty and proclaimed the capital as Dadu Chinese Wade Giles Ta tu lit 'Grand Capital' known as Khanbaliq or Daidu to the Mongols at modern day Beijing the following year His summer capital was in Shangdu Chinese lit 'Upper Capital' also called Xanadu near what today is Dolon Nor To unify China Kublai began a massive offensive against the remnants of the Southern Song in and finally destroyed the Song in unifying the country at last at the Battle of Yamen where the last Song Emperor Zhao Bing committed suicide by jumping into the sea and ending the Song dynasty
Most of the Yuan domains were administered as provinces also translated as the Branch Secretariat each with a governor and vice governor This included China proper Manchuria Mongolia and a special Zhendong branch Secretariat that extended into the Korean Peninsula The Central Region Chinese was separate from the rest consisting of much of present day North China It was considered the most important region of the dynasty and was directly governed by the Zhongshu Sheng at Dadu Tibet was governed by another top level administrative department called the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs
Kublai promoted economic growth by rebuilding the Grand Canal repairing public buildings and extending highways However his domestic policy included some aspects of the old Mongol living traditions and as his reign continued these traditions would clash increasingly frequently with traditional Chinese economic and social culture Kublai decreed that partner merchants of the Mongols should be subject to taxes in and set up the Office of Market Taxes to supervise them in After the Mongol conquest of the Song the Muslim Uighur and Chinese merchants expanded their operations to the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean In maritime trade was put under the Office of Market Taxes The main source of revenue of the government was the monopoly of salt production
The Mongol administration had issued paper currencies from on In August Kublai created the first unified paper currency called Jiaochao bills were circulated throughout the Yuan domain with no expiration date To guard against devaluation the currency was convertible with silver and gold and the government accepted tax payments in paper currency In Kublai issued a new series of state sponsored bills to finance his conquest of the Song although eventually a lack of fiscal discipline and inflation turned this move into an economic disaster It was required to pay only in the form of paper money To ensure its use Kublai's government confiscated gold and silver from private citizens and foreign merchants but traders received government issued notes in exchange Kublai Khan is considered to be the first fiat money maker The paper bills made collecting taxes and administering the empire much easier and reduced the cost of transporting coins In Kublai's minister Sangha created a new currency Zhiyuan Chao to deal with a budget shortfall It was non convertible and denominated in copper cash Later Gaykhatu of the Ilkhanate attempted to adopt the system in Iran and the Middle East which was a complete failure and shortly afterwards he was assassinated
Sangha was a Tibetan A rich merchant from the Madurai Sultanate Abu Ali in Chinese B ih l or B h r was associated closely with its royal family After falling out with them he moved to Yuan China and received a Korean woman as his wife and a job from the Mongol Emperor the woman was formerly Sangha's wife and her father held the title of Chaesongnyeon during the reign of Chungnyeol of Goryeo according to the Dongguk Tonggam Goryeosa and Liu Mengyan's Zh ng' nj
Kublai encouraged Asian arts and demonstrated religious tolerance Despite his anti Daoist edicts Kublai respected the Daoist master and appointed Zhang Liushan as the patriarch of the Daoist Xu nji o Mysterious Order Under Zhang's advice Daoist temples were put under the Academy of Scholarly Worthies Several Europeans visited the empire notably Marco Polo in the s who may have seen the summer capital Shangdu
During the Southern Song the descendant of Confucius at Qufu Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou while the newly established Jin dynasty in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng From that time up until the Yuan dynasty there were two Duke Yanshengs once in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou An invitation to come back to Qufu was extended to the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu by the Yuan dynasty Emperor Kublai Khan The title was taken away from the southern branch after Kong Zhu rejected the invitation so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number
Thirty Muslims served as high officials in the court of Kublai Khan Eight of the dynasty's twelve administrative districts had Muslim governors appointed by Kublai Khan Among the Muslim governors was Sayyid Ajjal Shams al Din Omar who became administrator of Yunnan He was a well learned man in the Confucian and Daoist traditions and is believed to have propagated Islam in China Other administrators were Nasr al Din Yunnan and Mahmud Yalavach mayor of the Yuan capitol
Kublai Khan patronized Muslim scholars and scientists and Muslim astronomers contributed to the construction of the observatory in Shaanxi Astronomers such as Jamal ad Din introduced new instruments and concepts that allowed the correction of the Chinese calendar
Muslim cartographers made accurate maps of all the nations along the Silk Road and greatly influenced the knowledge of Yuan dynasty rulers and merchants
Muslim physicians organized hospitals and had their own institutes of Medicine in Beijing and Shangdu In Beijing was the renown Guang Hui Si Department of extensive mercy where Hui medicine and surgery were taught Avicenna's works were also published in China during that period
Muslim mathematicians introduced Euclidean Geometry Spherical trigonometry and Arabic numerals in China
Kublai brought siege engineers Ismail and Al al Din to China and together they invented the Muslim trebuchet or Huihui Pao which was utilized by Kublai Khan during the Battle of Xiangyang
Yuan Emperors like Kublai Khan forbade practices such as butchering according to Jewish kashrut or Muslim dhabihah legal codes and other restrictive decrees continued Circumcision was also strictly forbidden
Although Kublai restricted the functions of the kheshig he created a new imperial bodyguard at first entirely ethnic Han in composition but later strengthened with Kipchak Alan Asud and Russian units Once his own kheshig was organized in Kublai put three of the original kheshigs under the charge of the descendants of Genghis Khan's assistants Borokhula Boorchu and Muqali Kublai began the practice of having the four great aristocrats in his kheshig sign jarligs decrees a practice that spread to all other Mongol khanates Mongol and Han units were organized using the same decimal organization that Genghis Khan used The Mongols eagerly adopted new artillery and technologies Kublai and his generals adopted an elaborate moderate style of military campaigns in southern China Effective assimilation of the naval techniques of the Han people allowed the Yuan army to quickly conquer the Song
In the Drikung Kagyu sect revolted attacking Sakya monasteries The Chagatayid khan Duwa helped the rebels laying siege to Gaochang and defeating Kublai's garrisons in the Tarim Basin Kaidu destroyed an army at Beshbalik and occupied the city the following year Many Uyghurs abandoned Kashgar for safer bases back in the eastern part of the Yuan dynasty After Kublai's grandson Buqa Tem r crushed the resistance of the Drikung Kagyu killing Tibetans in Tibet was fully pacified
Kublai Khan invaded Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula and made it a tributary vassal state in After another Mongol intervention in Goryeo came under even tighter control of the Yuan Goryeo became a Mongol military base and several myriarchy commands were established there The court of the Goryeo supplied Korean troops and an ocean going naval force for the Mongol campaigns
Despite the opposition of some of his Confucian trained advisers Kublai decided to invade Japan Burma Vietnam and Java following the suggestions of some of his Mongol officials He also attempted to subjugate peripheral lands such as Sakhalin where its indigenous people eventually submitted to the Mongols by after Kublai's death These costly invasions and conquests and the introduction of paper currency caused inflation From to war against the Southern Song dynasty and Japan made the issue of paper currency expand from ding to ding
Within Kublai's court his most trusted governors and advisers appointed by meritocracy with the essence of multiculturalism were Mongol Semu Korean Hui and Han peoples Because the Wokou extended support to the crumbling Southern Song dynasty Kublai Khan initiated invasions of Japan
Kublai Khan twice attempted to invade Japan It is believed that both attempts were partly thwarted by bad weather or a flaw in the design of ships that were based on river boats without keels and his fleets were destroyed The first attempt took place in with a fleet of ships
The second invasion occurred in when Mongols sent two separate forces ships containing Korean Han and Mongol troops were sent from Masan while a force of sailed from southern China in ships each close to feet m long The fleet was hastily assembled and ill equipped to cope with maritime conditions In November they sailed into the treacherous waters that separate Korea and Japan by kilometres miles The Mongols easily took over Tsushima Island about halfway across the strait and then Iki Island closer to Kyushu The Korean fleet reached Hakata Bay on June and landed its troops and animals but the ships from China were nowhere to be seen Mongol landing forces were subsequently defeated at the Battle of Akasaka and the Battle of Torikai Gata Takezaki Suenaga's samurai attacked the Mongol army and fought them as reinforcements led by Shiraishi Michiyasu arrived and defeated the Mongols who suffered around dead
The samurai warriors following their custom rode out against the Mongol forces for individual combat but the Mongols held their formation The Mongols fought as a united force not as individuals and bombarded the samurai with exploding missiles and showered them with arrows Eventually the remaining Japanese withdrew from the coastal zone inland to a fortress The Mongol forces did not chase the fleeing Japanese into an area about which they lacked reliable intelligence In a number of individual skirmishes known collectively as the K an Campaign or the Second Battle of Hakata Bay the Mongol forces were driven back to their ships by the Samurai The Japanese army was heavily outnumbered but had fortified the coastal line with two meter high walls and was easily able to repulse the Mongolian forces that were launched against it
Maritime archaeologist Kenzo Hayashida led the investigation that discovered the wreckage of the second invasion fleet off the western coast of Takashima District Shiga His team's findings strongly indicate that Kublai rushed to invade Japan and attempted to construct his enormous fleet in one year a task that should have taken up to five years This forced the Chinese to use any available ships including river boats Most importantly the Chinese under Kublai's control built many ships quickly in order to contribute to the fleets in both of the invasions Hayashida theorizes that had Kublai used standard well constructed ocean going ships with curved keels to prevent capsizing his navy might have survived the journey to and from Japan and might have conquered it as intended In October a wreck possibly one of Kublai's invasion craft was found off the coast of Nagasaki David Nicolle wrote in The Mongol Warlords Huge losses had also been suffered in terms of casualties and sheer expense while the myth of Mongol invincibility had been shattered throughout eastern Asia He also wrote that Kublai was determined to mount a third invasion despite the horrendous cost to the economy and to his and Mongol prestige of the first two defeats and only his death and the unanimous agreement of his advisers not to invade prevented a third attempt
Kublai Khan invaded i Vi t now Vietnam a number of times with major campaigns in and These three campaigns are treated by a number of scholars as a success due to the establishment of tributary relations with i Vi t despite the Mongols suffering major military defeats In contrast Vietnamese historiography regards the war as a major victory against the foreign invaders whom they called the Mongol yokes
The first invasion began in under the united Mongol Empire as it looked for alternative paths to invade the Song dynasty The Mongol general Uriyangkhadai was successful in capturing the Vietnamese capital Thang Long modern day Hanoi before turning north in to invade the Song dynasty in modern day Guangxi as part of a coordinated Mongol attack with armies attacking in Sichuan under M ngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern day Shandong and Henan The first invasion also established tributary relations between the Vietnamese dynasty formerly a Song dynasty tributary state and the Yuan dynasty
Intending to demand greater tribute and direct Yuan oversight of local affairs in i Vi t and Champa the Yuan launched another invasion in The second invasion of i Vi t failed to accomplish its goals and the Yuan launched a third invasion in with the intent of replacing the uncooperative i Vi t ruler Tr n Nh n T ng with the defected Tr n prince Tr n ch T c By the end of the second and third invasions which involved both initial successes and eventual major defeats for the Mongols both i Vi t and Champa decided to accept the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty and became tributary states to avoid further conflict
Three expeditions against Burma in and brought the Mongol forces to the Irrawaddy Delta whereupon they captured Bagan the capital of the Pagan Kingdom and established their government Kublai had to be content with establishing a formal suzerainty but Pagan finally became a tributary state sending tributes to the Yuan court until the Yuan dynasty fell to the Ming dynasty in Mongol interests in these areas were commercial and tributary relationships
Kublai Khan maintained close relations with Siam in particular with prince Mangrai of Chiangmai and king Ram Khamheng of Sukhothai In fact Kublai encouraged them to attack the Khmers after the Thais were being pushed southwards from Nanchao This happened after king Jayavarman VIII of the Khmer Empire refused to pay tribute to the Mongols Jayavarman VIII was so insistent on not having to pay tribute to Kublai that he had Mongol envoys imprisoned These attacks from the Siamese eventually weakened the Khmer Empire The Mongols then decided to venture south into Cambodia in by land from Champa They were able to conquer Cambodia by Cambodia effectively became a vassal state by when Jayavarman VIII was finally forced to pay tribute to Kublai
During the last years of his reign Kublai launched a naval punitive expedition of men against Singhasari on Java but the invading Mongol forces were forced to withdraw by Majapahit after considerable losses of more than troops Nevertheless by the year that Kublai died the Thai kingdoms of Sukhothai and Chiang Mai had become vassal states of the Yuan dynasty
Under Kublai direct contact between East Asia and Europe was established made possible by Mongol control of the central Asian trade routes and facilitated by the presence of efficient postal services In the beginning of the th century Europeans and Central Asians merchants travelers and missionaries of different orders made their way to China The presence of Mongol power allowed large numbers of Yuan subjects intent on warfare or trade to travel to other parts of the Mongol Empire all the way to Rus Persia and Mesopotamia
In the th century the Sultanate of Mogadishu through its trade with prior Chinese regimes had acquired enough of a reputation in Asia to attract the attention of Kublai Khan According to Marco Polo Kublai sent an envoy to Mogadishu to spy out the Sultanate but the delegation was captured and imprisoned Kublai Khan then sent another envoy to treat for the release of the earlier Mongol delegation sent to Africa
After Kublai Khan was proclaimed Khagan at his residence in Shangdu on May he began to organize the country Zhang Wenqian a central government official was sent by Kublai in to Daming where unrest had been reported in the local population A friend of Zhang's Guo Shoujing accompanied him on this mission Guo was interested in engineering was an expert astronomer and skilled instrument maker and he understood that good astronomical observations depended on expertly made instruments Guo began to construct astronomical instruments including water clocks for accurate timing and armillary spheres that represented the celestial globe Turkestani architect Ikhtiyar al Din also known as Igder designed the buildings of the city of the Khagan Khanbaliq Dadu Kublai also employed foreign artists to build his new capital one of them a Newar named Araniko built the White Stupa that was the largest structure in Khanbaliq Dadu
Zhang advised Kublai that Guo was a leading expert in hydraulic engineering Kublai knew the importance of water management for irrigation transport of grain and flood control and he asked Guo to look at these aspects in the area between Dadu now Beijing and the Yellow River To provide Dadu with a new supply of water Guo found the Baifu spring in Mount Shen and had a km mi channel built to move water to Dadu He proposed connecting the water supply across different river basins built new canals with sluices to control the water level and achieved great success with the improvements he made This pleased Kublai and Guo was asked to undertake similar projects in other parts of the country In he was asked to go to Gansu to repair the damage that had been caused to the irrigation systems by the years of war during the Mongol advance through the region Guo travelled extensively along with his friend Zhang taking notes of the work needed to be done to unblock damaged parts of the system and to make improvements to its efficiency He sent his report directly to Kublai Khan
During the conquest of the Jin Genghis Khan's younger brothers received large appanages in Manchuria Their descendants strongly supported Kublai's coronation in but the younger generation desired more independence Kublai enforced gedei Khan's regulations that the Mongol noblemen could appoint overseers and the Great Khan's special officials in their appanages but otherwise respected appanage rights Kublai's son Manggala established direct control over Chang'an and Shanxi in In Kublai appointed Lian Xixian to investigate abuses of power by Mongol appanage holders in Manchuria The region called Lia tung was immediately brought under the Khagan's control in eliminating autonomy of the Mongol nobles there
Threatened by the advance of Kublai's bureaucratization Nayan a fourth generation descendant of one of Genghis Khan's brothers either Tem ge or Belgutei instigated a revolt in More than one prince named Nayan existed and their identity is confused Nayan tried to join forces with Kublai's competitor Kaidu in Central Asia Manchuria's native Jurchens and Water Tatars who had suffered a famine supported Nayan Virtually all the fraternal lines under Hadaan a descendant of Hachiun and Shihtur a grandson of Qasar joined Nayan's rebellion and because Nayan was a popular prince Ebugen a grandson of Genghis Khan's son Khulgen and the family of Khuden a younger brother of G y k Khan contributed troops for this rebellion
The rebellion was crippled by early detection and timid leadership Kublai sent Bayan to keep Nayan and Kaidu apart by occupying Karakorum while Kublai led another army against the rebels in Manchuria Kublai's commander Oz Tem r's Mongol force attacked Nayan's inexperienced soldiers on June while ethnic Han and Alan guards under Li Ting protected Kublai The army of Chungnyeol of Goryeo assisted Kublai in battle After a hard fight Nayan's troops withdrew behind their carts and Li Ting began bombardment and attacked Nayan's camp that night Kublai's force pursued Nayan who was eventually captured and executed without bloodshed by being smothered under felt carpets a traditional way of executing princes Meanwhile the rebel prince Shikqtur invaded Liaoning but was defeated within a month Kaidu withdrew westward to avoid a battle However Kaidu defeated a major Yuan army in the Khangai Mountains and briefly occupied Karakorum in Kaidu had ridden away before Kublai could mobilize a larger army
Widespread but uncoordinated uprisings of Nayan's supporters continued until these were ruthlessly repressed The rebel princes' troops were taken from them and redistributed among the imperial family Kublai harshly punished the darughachi appointed by the rebels in Mongolia and Manchuria This rebellion forced Kublai to approve the creation of the Liaoyang Branch Secretariat on December while rewarding loyal fraternal princes
Kublai Khan dispatched his grandson Gammala to Burkhan Khaldun in to ensure his claim to Ikh Khorig where Genghis was buried a sacred place strongly protected by the Kublaids Bayan was in control of Karakorum and was re establishing control over surrounding areas in so Kublai's rival Kaidu did not attempt any large scale military action for the next three years From on Kublai's army cleared Kaidu's forces from the Central Siberian Plateau
After his wife Chabi died in Kublai began to withdraw from direct contact with his advisers and he issued instructions through one of his other queens Nambui Only two of Kublai's daughters are known by name he may have had others Unlike the formidable women of his grandfather's day Kublai's wives and daughters were an almost invisible presence Kublai's original choice of successor was his son Zhenjin who became the head of the Zhongshu Sheng and actively administered the dynasty according to Confucian fashion Nomukhan after returning from captivity in the Golden Horde expressed resentment that Zhenjin had been made heir apparent but he was banished to the north An official proposed that Kublai should abdicate in favor of Zhenjin in a suggestion that angered Kublai who refused to see Zhenjin Zhenjin died soon afterwards in eight years before his father Kublai regretted this and remained very close to his wife Bairam also known as Kokejin
Kublai became increasingly despondent after the deaths of his favorite wife and his chosen heir Zhenjin The failure of the military campaigns in Vietnam and Japan also haunted him Kublai turned to food and drink for comfort became grossly overweight and suffered gout and diabetes The emperor overindulged in alcohol and the traditional meat rich Mongol diet which may have contributed to his gout Kublai sank into depression due to the loss of his family his poor health and advancing age Kublai tried every medical treatment available from Korean shamans to Vietnamese doctors and remedies and medicines but to no avail At the end of the emperor refused to participate in the traditional New Years' ceremony Before his death Kublai passed the seal of Crown Prince to Zhenjin's son Tem r who would become the next Khagan of the Mongol Empire and the second ruler of the Yuan dynasty Seeking an old companion to comfort him in his final illness the palace staff could choose only Bayan more than years his junior Kublai weakened steadily and on February he died at the age of Two days later the funeral cort ge took his body to the burial place of the khans in Mongolia
Kublai first married Tegulen but she died very early Then he married Chabi of the Khongirad who was his most beloved empress After Chabi's death in Kublai married Chabi's young cousin Nambui presumably in accordance with Chabi's wish

I ascended on Fragrant Hill in the friendly season of spring
Not discouraged I climbed to the peak and met the Golden Face
Flowers shone bright rays and auspicious colors gleamed like a rainbow
Incense smoke wafted like mist and a blessed light emanated
Raindrops were like bubbles on jade bamboos at the edge of the big rock
The blowing wind played a song among the green pines at the mountain pass
In front of the Buddha in the temple I conducted the incense ceremony
And on the way back I rode a Blue Dragon in the royal carriage
