There may be evidence of retainer sacrifice in the early dynastic period at Abydos when on the death of a King he would be accompanied with servants and possibly high officials who would continue to serve him in eternal life The skeletons that were found had no obvious signs of trauma leading to speculation that the giving up of life to serve the King may have been a voluntary act possibly carried out in a drug induced state At about BCE any possible evidence of such practices disappeared though echoes are perhaps to be seen in the burial of statues of servants in Old Kingdom tombs
References in the Bible point to an awareness of and disdain of human sacrifice in the history of ancient Near Eastern practice During a battle with the Israelites the King of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering olah as used of the Temple sacrifice Kings The Bible then recounts that following the King's sacrifice There was great indignation or wrath against Israel and that the Israelites had to raise their siege of the Moabite capital and go away This verse had perplexed many later Jewish and Christian commentators who tried to explain what the impact of the Moabite King's sacrifice was to make those under siege emboldened while disheartening the Israelites make God angry at the Israelites or the Israelites fear his anger make Chemosh the Moabite god angry or otherwise Whatever the explanation evidently at the time of writing such an act of sacrificing the firstborn son and heir while prohibited by Israelites Deuteronomy was considered as an emergency measure in the Ancient Near East to be performed in exceptional cases where divine favor was desperately needed

In ancient Rome human sacrifice was infrequent but documented Roman authors often contrast their own behavior with that of people who would commit the heinous act of human sacrifice These authors make it clear that such practices were from a much more uncivilized time in the past far removed It is thought that many ritualistic celebrations and dedications to gods used to involve human sacrifice but have now been replaced with symbolic offerings Dionysius of Halicarnassus says that the ritual of the Argei in which straw figures were tossed into the Tiber river may have been a substitute for an original offering of elderly men Cicero claimed that puppets thrown from the Pons Suplicius by the Vestal Virgins in a processional ceremony were substitutes for the past sacrifice of old men
After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks in male female couples were buried under the Forum Boarium in a stone chamber used for the purpose at least once before In Livy's description of these sacrifices he distances the practice from Roman tradition and asserts that the past human sacrifices evident in the same location were wholly alien to the Roman spirit The rite was apparently repeated in BCE preparatory to an invasion of Gaul They buried both the Greeks and the two Gauls alive as a plea to the gods to save Rome from destruction at the hands of Hannibal When the Romans conquered the Celts in Gaul they tortured the people by cutting off their hands and feet and leaving them to die The Romans justified their actions by also accusing the Celts of practicing human sacrifice
