closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting
human sacrifice was practiced in many human societies beginning in prehistoric times
by the iron age st millennium bce with the associated developments in religion the axial age human sacrifice was becoming less common throughout africa europe and asia and came to be looked down upon as barbaric during classical antiquity
in the americas however human sacrifice continued to be practiced by some to varying degrees until the european colonization of the americas
today human sacrifice has become extremely rare
modern secular laws treat human sacrifices in the same manner as murder
most major religions in the modern day condemn the practice
for example the hebrew bible prohibits murder and human sacrifice to molech
human sacrifice sometimes called ritual murder has been practiced on a number of different occasions and in many different cultures
the various rationales behind human sacrifice are the same that motivate religious sacrifice in general
human sacrifice is typically intended to bring good fortune and to pacify the gods for example in the context of the dedication of a completed building like a temple or bridge
fertility was another common theme in ancient religious sacrifices such as sacrifices to the aztec god of agriculture xipe totec
in ancient japan legends talk about hitobashira human pillar in which maidens were buried alive at the base of or near some constructions to protect the buildings against disasters or enemy attacks and almost identical accounts appear in the balkans the building of skadar and bridge of arta

according to ross hassig author of aztec warfare between and persons were sacrificed in the ceremony
human sacrifice can also have the intention of winning the gods favor in warfare
in homeric legend iphigeneia was to be sacrificed by her father agamemnon to appease artemis so she would allow the greeks to wage the trojan war
in some notions of an afterlife the deceased will benefit from victims killed at his funeral
mongols scythians early egyptians and various mesoamerican chiefs could take most of their household including servants and concubines with them to the next world
this is sometimes called a retainer sacrifice as the leader s retainers would be sacrificed along with their master so that they could continue to serve him in the afterlife
another purpose is divination from the body parts of the victim
according to strabo celts stabbed a victim with a sword and divined the future from his death spasms
headhunting is the practice of taking the head of a killed adversary for ceremonial or magical purposes or for reasons of prestige
it was found in many pre modern tribal societies
human sacrifice may be a ritual practiced in a stable society and may even be conducive to enhance societal unity see sociology of religion both by creating a bond unifying the sacrificing community and in combining human sacrifice and capital punishment by removing individuals that have a negative effect on societal stability criminals religious heretics foreign slaves or prisoners of war
however outside of civil religion human sacrifice may also result in outbursts of blood frenzy and mass killings that destabilize society
many cultures show traces of prehistoric human sacrifice in their mythologies and religious texts but ceased the practice before the onset of historical records
some see the story of abraham and isaac genesis as an example of an etiological myth explaining the abolition of human sacrifice
the vedic purushamedha literally human sacrifice is already a purely symbolic act in its earliest attestation
according to pliny the elder human sacrifice in ancient rome was abolished by a senatorial decree in bce although by this time the practice had already become so rare that the decree was mostly a symbolic act
human sacrifice once abolished is typically replaced by either animal sacrifice or by the mock sacrifice of effigies such as the argei in ancient rome
successful agricultural cities had already emerged in the near east by the neolithic some protected behind stone walls
jericho is the best known of these cities but other similar settlements existed along the coast of levant extending north into asia minor and west to the tigris and euphrates rivers
most of the land was arid and the religious culture of the entire region centered on fertility and rain
many of the religious rituals including human sacrifice had an agricultural focus
blood was mixed with soil to improve its fertility
there may be evidence of retainer sacrifice in the early dynastic period at abydos when on the death of a king he would be accompanied with servants and possibly high officials who would continue to serve him in eternal life
the skeletons that were found had no obvious signs of trauma leading to speculation that the giving up of life to serve the king may have been a voluntary act possibly carried out in a drug induced state
at about bce any possible evidence of such practices disappeared though echoes are perhaps to be seen in the burial of statues of servants in old kingdom tombs
references in the bible point to an awareness of and disdain of human sacrifice in the history of ancient near eastern practice
during a battle with the israelites the king of moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering olah as used of the temple sacrifice kings
the bible then recounts that following the king s sacrifice there was great indignation or wrath against israel and that the israelites had to raise their siege of the moabite capital and go away
this verse had perplexed many later jewish and christian commentators who tried to explain what the impact of the moabite king s sacrifice was to make those under siege emboldened while disheartening the israelites make god angry at the israelites or the israelites fear his anger make chemosh the moabite god angry or otherwise
whatever the explanation evidently at the time of writing such an act of sacrificing the firstborn son and heir while prohibited by israelites deuteronomy was considered as an emergency measure in the ancient near east to be performed in exceptional cases where divine favor was desperately needed
the binding of isaac appears in the book of genesis the story appears in the quran though islamic tradition holds that ismael was the one to be sacrificed
in both the quranic and biblical stories god tests abraham by asking him to present his son as a sacrifice on moriah
abraham agrees to this command without arguing
the story ends with an angel stopping abraham at the last minute and providing a ram caught in some nearby bushes to be sacrificed instead
many bible scholars have suggested this story s origin was a remembrance of an era when human sacrifice was abolished in favour of animal sacrifice
another probable instance of human sacrifice mentioned in the bible is the sacrifice of jephthah s daughter in judges
jephthah vows to sacrifice to god whatsoever comes to greet him at the door when he returns home if he is victorious
the vow is stated in the book of judges then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lord s and i will offer him a burnt offering when he returns from battle his virgin daughter runs out to greet him
she begs for and is granted two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends after which he jephthah did to her as he had vowed

according to roman and greek sources phoenicians and carthaginians sacrificed infants to their gods
the bones of numerous infants have been found in carthaginian archaeological sites in modern times but their cause of death remain controversial
in a single child cemetery called the tophet by archaeologists an estimated urns were deposited
plutarch c c ce mentions the practice as do tertullian orosius diodorus siculus and philo
livy and polybius do not
the bible asserts that children were sacrificed at a place called the tophet roasting place to the god moloch
according to diodorus siculus s bibliotheca historica there was in their city a bronze image of cronus extending its hands palms up and sloping toward the ground so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire
plutarch however claims that the children were already dead at the time having been killed by their parents whose consent as well as that of the children was required
tertullian explains the acquiescence of the children as a product of their youthful trustfulness
the accuracy of such stories is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists
there is archaeological evidence of human sacrifice in neolithic to eneolithic europe

references to human sacrifice can be found in greek historical accounts as well as mythology
the human sacrifice in mythology the deus ex machina salvation in some versions of iphigeneia who was about to be sacrificed by her father agamemnon and her replacement with a deer by the goddess artemis may be a vestigial memory of the abandonment and discrediting of the practice of human sacrifice among the greeks in favour of animal sacrifice
in ancient rome human sacrifice was infrequent but documented
roman authors often contrast their own behavior with that of people who would commit the heinous act of human sacrifice
these authors make it clear that such practices were from a much more uncivilized time in the past far removed
it is thought that many ritualistic celebrations and dedications to gods used to involve human sacrifice but have now been replaced with symbolic offerings
dionysius of halicarnassus says that the ritual of the argei in which straw figures were tossed into the tiber river may have been a substitute for an original offering of elderly men
cicero claimed that puppets thrown from the pons suplicius by the vestal virgins in a processional ceremony were substitutes for the past sacrifice of old men
after the roman defeat at cannae two gauls and two greeks in male female couples were buried under the forum boarium in a stone chamber used for the purpose at least once before
in livy s description of these sacrifices he distances the practice from roman tradition and asserts that the past human sacrifices evident in the same location were wholly alien to the roman spirit the rite was apparently repeated in bce preparatory to an invasion of gaul
they buried both the greeks and the two gauls alive as a plea to the gods to save rome from destruction at the hands of hannibal
when the romans conquered the celts in gaul they tortured the people by cutting off their hands and feet and leaving them to die
the romans justified their actions by also accusing the celts of practicing human sacrifice
according to pliny the elder human sacrifice was banned by law during the consulship of publius licinius crassus and gnaeus cornelius lentulus in bce although by this time it was so rare that the decree was largely symbolic
the romans also had traditions that centered around ritual murder but which they did not consider to be sacrifice
such practices included burying unchaste vestal virgins alive and drowning hermaphroditic children
these were seen as reactions to extraordinary circumstances as opposed to being part of roman tradition
vestal virgins who were accused of being unchaste were put to death and a special chamber was built to bury them alive
this aim was to please the gods and restore balance to rome
human sacrifices in the form of burying individuals alive were not uncommon during times of panic in ancient rome
however the burial of unchaste vestal virgins was also practiced in times of peace
their chasteness was thought to be a safeguard of the city and even in punishment the state of their bodies was preserved in order to maintain the peace
captured enemy leaders were only occasionally executed at the conclusion of a roman triumph and the romans themselves did not consider these deaths a sacrificial offering
gladiator combat was thought by the romans to have originated as fights to the death among war captives at the funerals of roman generals and christian polemicists such as tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be little more than human sacrifice
over time participants became criminals and slaves and their death was considered a sacrifice to the manes on behalf of the dead
political rumors sometimes centered around sacrifice and in doing so aimed to liken individuals to barbarians and show that the individual had become uncivilized
human sacrifice also became a marker and defining characteristic of magic and bad religion
there is evidence that ancient celtic peoples practiced human sacrifice
accounts of celtic human sacrifice come from roman and greek sources
julius caesar and strabo wrote that the gauls burnt animal and human sacrifices in a large wickerwork figure known as a wicker man and said the human victims were usually criminals while posidonius wrote that druids who oversaw human sacrifices foretold the future by watching the death throes of the victims
caesar also wrote that slaves of gaulish chiefs would be burnt along with the body of their master as part of his funeral rites
in the st century ad roman writer lucan mentioned human sacrifices to the gaulish gods esus toutatis and taranis
in a th century commentary on lucan an unnamed author added that sacrifices to esus were hanged from a tree those to toutatis were drowned and those to taranis were burned
according to the nd century roman writer cassius dio boudica s forces impaled roman captives during her rebellion against the roman occupation to the accompaniment of revelry and sacrifices in the sacred groves of andate

several ancient irish bog bodies have been interpreted as kings who were ritually killed presumably after serious crop failures or other disasters

human sacrifice was practiced in tibet prior to the arrival of buddhism in the th century
historical practices such as burying bodies under the cornerstones of houses may have been practiced during the medieval era but few concrete instances have been recorded or verified
the prevalence of human sacrifice in medieval buddhist tibet is less clear
the lamas as professing buddhists could not condone blood sacrifices and they replaced the human victims with effigies made from dough which is still to this day dyed partially red to symbolize sacrifice
this replacement of human victims with effigies is attributed to padmasambhava a tibetan saint of the mid th century in tibetan tradition
nevertheless there is some evidence that outside of orthodox buddhism there were practices of tantric human sacrifice which survived throughout the medieval period and possibly into modern times
the th century blue annals reports that in the th century so called robber monks slaughtered men and women in their ceremonies
grunfeld concludes that it cannot be ruled out that isolated instances of human sacrifice did survive in remote areas of tibet until the mid th century but they must have been rare
grunfeld also notes that tibetan practices unrelated to human sacrifice such as the use of human bone in ritual instruments have been depicted without evidence as products of human sacrifice

regarding possible vedic mention of human sacrifice the prevailing th century view associated above all with henry colebrooke was that human sacrifice did not actually take place
those verses which referred to purushamedha were meant to be read symbolically or as a priestly fantasy

the peoples of the southeastern united states known as the mississippian culture to ce have been suggested to have practiced human sacrifice because some artifacts have been interpreted as depicting such acts
mound at cahokia the largest mississippian site located near modern st
louis missouri was found to have numerous pits filled with mass burials thought to have been retainer sacrifices
