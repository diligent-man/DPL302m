the new life movement traditional chinese simplified chinese pinyin x n sh nghu y nd ng was a government led civic campaign in the s republic of china to promote cultural reform and neo confucian social morality and to ultimately unite china under a centralised ideology following the emergence of ideological challenges to the status quo
chiang kai shek as head of the government and the chinese nationalist party launched the initiative on february as part of an anti communist campaign and soon enlarged the campaign to target the whole nation
chiang and his wife soong mei ling who played a major role in the campaign advocated a life guided by four virtues l proper rite y righteousness or justice li n honesty and cleanness and ch shame sense of right and wrong
the campaign proceeded with help of the blue shirts society and the cc clique within the nationalist party and christian missionaries in china
the new life movement was founded at a time when china already weakened by western imperialism faced the threats of rising japanese militarism domestic factionalism and communism
the launch of the new life movement was set in the context of chiangs growing concern with corruption and moral decadence that they blamed on foreign influences
historian colin mackerras writes that corruption was an abiding feature of chiang kai shek s rule and that nepotism and bribery were rife among the bureaucracy
chiang charged that if we do not weed the present body of corruption bribery perfunctoriness and ignorance and establish instead a clean effective administration the day will soon come when the revolution will be started against us as we did the manchus
chiang claimed that chinese were unbearably filthy hedonistic lazy and physically and spiritually decrepit and thus leading lives that were barbaric and devoid of reason chiang s political rival wang jingwei described chinese life as a life of smoking sickness gambling filth ghosts i e superstition and indolence
wang argued the fundamental psychological basis of such behaviour was lackadaisicalness suibian zhuyi and self seekingness zili zhuyi
he contended that lackadaisicalness led to lives without a sense of right or wrong and hence with no distinctions or purpose
self seekingness he argued led to the rejection of all outside interference with this kind of behaviour as encroachment on freedom
there was no consideration for others and their rights only of one s own comfort inevitably obstructing social life and group solidarity
in chiang s mind these concerns were compounded by the influx of foreign ideas following the new culture movement and may fourth movement which fostered western concepts such as liberalism pragmatism and nationalism as well as more radical ideas including marxism respectively
the movement attempted to counter such threats through a resurrection of traditional chinese morality which it held to be superior to modern western values
as such the movement was based upon confucianism mixed with christianity nationalism and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism
it rejected individualism and liberalism while also opposing socialism and communism
soong mei ling called for a program of spiritual enlightenment
she wrote inforum an american magazine in that the mere accumulation of great wealth is not sufficient to enable china to resume her position as a great nation there must be she continued also revival of the spirit since spiritual values transcend mere material riches
she played a major role both in launching the movement and in representing its public face chiang kai shek used the confucian and methodist notion of self cultivation and correct living for the movement to this end it prescribed proper etiquette on every aspect of daily life
he considered the new life movement a key part of the program to carry out the principle of the people s livelihood in sun yat sen s three principles of the people
however implementing the movement was suspended indefinitely in the approach to the second sino japanese war
chiang kai shek s september speech stated that the new life movement aimed at the promotion of a regular life guided by the four virtues l proper rite y righteousness or justice li n honesty and cleanness and ch shame sense of right and wrong
these virtues he went on
must be applied to ordinary life in the matter of food clothing shelter and action
the four virtues are the essential principles for the promotion of morality
they form the major rules for dealing with men and human affairs for cultivating oneself and for adjustment to one s surroundings
whoever violates these rules is bound to fail and a nation that neglects them will not survive chiang later extended the four virtues to eight by the addition of promptness precision harmoniousness and dignity
these elements were summarized in two basic forms cleanliness and discipline and were viewed as the first step in achieving a new life
people were encouraged to engage in modern polite behaviour such as not to spit urinate or sneeze in public
they were encouraged to adopt good table manners such as not making noises when eating
the ideological strictness of the new life movement had many similarities with neo confucianism which had been the dominant moral philosophy of previous centuries
the new life movement four virtues were taken from confucian school of thought
paul linebarger had stated that its the new life movement s principles consist of a simple restatement of the cardinal confucian personal virtues interpreted to suit modern conditions
the historian lloyd eastman saw chiang s goal as unifying china under a singular ideology a fascist one at that with the resulting new life movement being a popularized or a sloganized confucianism
according to keith schoppa the new set of beliefs was seen to be easy to execute with four main virtues backed by further sub rules that regulated the everyday life of the regular chinese citizen
the movement was also shaped by chiang s christianity
according to elmer clark the new doctrine was an ambitious moral and ethical enterprise which proposed nothing less than a chinese renaissance a complete reformation of the habits customs and manners of one fourth of the human race to bring them more in line with the accepted morals of christian civilisation
overlapping moral guidelines exist between confucianism and christianity
the rules placed in the new life movement often blur the lines between the influence of the two on the movement such as do not gamble or be polite and courteous to women and children
there is a totalitarian aspect to the movement
dirlik sees the movement as a modern counterrevolution opposed to an anti revolutionary conservatism due to the fact that it instrumentalised traditional moral codes and societal constructs
other historians regard this movement as imitating nazism and being a neo nationalistic movement used to elevate chiang s control of everyday lives
frederic wakeman suggested that the new life movement was confucian fascism
despite the grandiose goal of revitalising and revolutionising china the new life movement ultimately ended in failure as both domestic and foreign reception remained paltry throughout the duration of the movement
the combination of the movement s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and the seeming banality of its concerns caused both chinese and foreign commentators to ignore the significance of new life ideology and intentions and instead to stress the more superficial aspects of the movement
consequently the movement was approached variously as a joke or to those taking it more seriously a shallow and antiquated regression to chinese tradition when tradition had already proved incapable of solving china s problems
the movement s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and abstract code of ethics contrasted sharply with the promises of the communists who spoke sharply and to the point on taxation distribution of land and the disposition of overlords
from the perspective of a chinese citizen the policies of marxists are far more practical and coherent leading to the lack of significance attributed to the new life movement
on a western perspective chiang s complex code of ethics was far too abstract and lacking in action to be useful or pragmatic perceived as being superficial and inordinately idealistic
the lack of popular domestic reception is exacerbated by the behaviour of the blue shirts a far right fascist group that enforced the rules of the new life movement
historian sterling seagrave writes by the blue shirts were running amok driven by excesses of zeal and brutality giving the new life movement a bad name the literary digest observed that year most likely to upset the teacups were chiang s own civilian anti foreign bombing stabbing shooting blue shirt terrorists who once useful now unmanageable have become something of a frankenstein monster the association of the violent and repressive behaviour of the blue shirts compounded the less than enthusiastic reception of the movement further attributing to it a negative reputation as well
the new life movement aimed to control chinese lifestyles
some measures and moral codes included opposition to littering and spitting at random opposition to opium use opposition to conspicuous consumption rejection of immoral entertainment in favour of artistic and athletic pursuits courteous behaviour saluting the flag
chiang urged citizens to bathe with cold water since the supposed japanese habit of washing their faces with cold water was a sign of their military strength
chiang relied on government law enforcement to reinforce moral behaviour
task forces were created in different regions to implement the movement yet in reports from some districts on the implementation the movement was seen to be severely underfunded understaffed and poorly understood by law enforcement officials
the blue shirts were also instrumental in the implementation of the new life movement
the neo right wing group at first was useful to chiang correcting the behaviour of those not following the four virtues and the further rules placed
however they soon turned to force to reinforce chiang s ideals giving bad publicity and views on the movement
the excessive violence used by the blue shirts encompassed the movement leading to a reluctant public in following the new dogma in place by the kmt
in the words of soong mei ling s biographer the new life movement was a curious east west ideological fusion of neo confucian precepts thinly disguised new testament christianity ymca style social activism elements of bushido the samurai code and european fascism along with a generous dose of new england puritanism arif dirlik explains the movement as motivated by the need to counter communist success in both ideological appeal and political organization
