certain optimization problem unknown optimal solution might number vector rather continuous quantity example function shape body
problem infinite-dimensional optimization problem continuous quantity cannot determined finite number certain degree freedom
optimal solution course line segment joining point metric defined plane euclidean metric
given two city country many hill valley find shortest road going one city other
given two circle serve top bottom cup given height find shape side wall cup side wall ha minimal area
intuition would suggest cup must conical cylindrical shape false
find shape bridge capable sustaining given amount traffic using smallest amount material
find shape airplane bounce away radio wave enemy radarinfinite-dimensional optimization problem challenging finite-dimensional ones
typically one need employ method partial differential equation solve problems
