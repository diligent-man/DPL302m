in certain optimization problems the unknown optimal solution might not be a number or a vector but rather a continuous quantity for example a function or the shape of a body
such a problem is an infinite dimensional optimization problem because a continuous quantity cannot be determined by a finite number of certain degrees of freedom
find the shortest path between two points in a plane
the variables in this problem are the curves connecting the two points
the optimal solution is of course the line segment joining the points if the metric defined on the plane is the euclidean metric
given two cities in a country with many hills and valleys find the shortest road going from one city to the other
this problem is a generalization of the above and the solution is not as obvious
given two circles which will serve as top and bottom for a cup of given height find the shape of the side wall of the cup so that the side wall has minimal area
the intuition would suggest that the cup must have conical or cylindrical shape which is false
the actual minimum surface is the catenoid
find the shape of a bridge capable of sustaining given amount of traffic using the smallest amount of material
find the shape of an airplane which bounces away most of the radio waves from an enemy radar infinite dimensional optimization problems can be more challenging than finite dimensional ones
typically one needs to employ methods from partial differential equations to solve such problems
several disciplines which study infinite dimensional optimization problems are calculus of variations optimal control and shape optimization
