mathematics spiral curve emanates point moving farther away revolves around point
two major definition spiral american heritage dictionary are
curve plane wind around fixed center point continuously increasing decreasing distance point
three-dimensional curve turn around axis constant continuously varying distance moving parallel axis helixthe first definition describes planar curve extends perpendicular direction within plane groove one side record closely approximates plane spiral finite width depth groove wider spacing within track fall
another example center line arm spiral galaxy trace logarithmic spirals
second definition includes two kind dimensional relative spirals
