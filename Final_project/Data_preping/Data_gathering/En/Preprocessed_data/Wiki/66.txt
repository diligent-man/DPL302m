in mathematics a spiral is a curve which emanates from a point moving farther away as it revolves around the point
two major definitions of spiral in the american heritage dictionary are
a curve on a plane that winds around a fixed center point at a continuously increasing or decreasing distance from the point
a three dimensional curve that turns around an axis at a constant or continuously varying distance while moving parallel to the axis a helix the first definition describes a planar curve that extends in both of the perpendicular directions within its plane the groove on one side of a record closely approximates a plane spiral and it is by the finite width and depth of the groove but not by the wider spacing between than within tracks that it falls short of being a perfect example note that successive loops differ in diameter
in another example the center lines of the arms of a spiral galaxy trace logarithmic spirals
the second definition includes two kinds of dimensional relatives of spirals
a conical or volute spring including the spring used to hold and make contact with the negative terminals of aa or aaa batteries in a battery box and the vortex that is created when water is draining in a sink is often described as a spiral or as a conical helix
quite explicitly definition also includes a cylindrical coil spring and a strand of dna both of which are quite helical so that helix is a more useful description than spiral for each of them in general spiral is seldom applied if successive loops of a curve have the same diameter in the side picture the black curve at the bottom is an archimedean spiral while the green curve is a helix
the curve shown in red is a conic helix
a two dimensional or plane spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates where the radius
displaystyle r
is a monotonic continuous function of angle
displaystyle varphi
displaystyle r r varphi
the circle would be regarded as a degenerate case the function not being strictly monotonic but rather constant
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
coordinates the curve has the parametric representation
displaystyle x r varphi cos varphi qquad y r varphi sin varphi
some of the most important sorts of two dimensional spirals include
the archimedean spiral
displaystyle r a varphi
the hyperbolic spiral
displaystyle r a varphi
fermat s spiral
displaystyle r a varphi
the lituus
displaystyle r a varphi
the logarithmic spiral
displaystyle r ae k varphi
the cornu spiral or clothoid
the fibonacci spiral and golden spiral
the spiral of theodorus an approximation of the archimedean spiral composed of contiguous right triangles
the involute of a circle used twice on each tooth of almost every modern gearan archimedean spiral is for example generated while coiling a carpet
a hyperbolic spiral appears as image of a helix with a special central projection see diagram
a hyperbolic spiral is some times called reciproke spiral because it is the image of an archimedean spiral with a circle inversion see below
the name logarithmic spiral is due to the equation
displaystyle varphi tfrac k cdot ln tfrac r a
approximations of this are found in nature
spirals which do not fit into this scheme of the first examples
a cornu spiral has two asymptotic points
the spiral of theodorus is a polygon
the fibonacci spiral consists of a sequence of circle arcs
the involute of a circle looks like an archimedean but is not see involute examples
the following considerations are dealing with spirals which can be described by a polar equation
displaystyle r r varphi
especially for the cases
displaystyle r varphi a varphi n
archimedean hyperbolic fermat s lituus spirals and the logarithmic spiral
displaystyle r ae k varphi
polar slope anglethe angle
displaystyle alpha
between the spiral tangent and the corresponding polar circle see diagram is called angle of the polar slope and
displaystyle tan alpha
the polar slope
from vector calculus in polar coordinates one gets the formula
displaystyle tan alpha frac r r
hence the slope of the spiral
displaystyle r a varphi n
displaystyle tan alpha frac n varphi
in case of an archimedean spiral
displaystyle n
the polar slope is
displaystyle tan alpha tfrac varphi
the logarithmic spiral is a special case because of
displaystyle tan alpha k
constant

displaystyle kappa dotsb frac a varphi n frac varphi n n varphi n
in case of
displaystyle n

arc lengththe length of an arc of a curve with polar equation
displaystyle r r varphi
displaystyle l int limits varphi varphi sqrt left r prime varphi right r varphi mathrm d varphi
for the spiral
displaystyle r a varphi n
the length is
displaystyle l int varphi varphi sqrt frac n r varphi r d varphi a int limits varphi varphi varphi n sqrt n varphi d varphi
not all these integrals can be solved by a suitable table
in case of a fermat s spiral the integral can be expressed by elliptic integrals only
the arc length of a logarithmic spiral
displaystyle r ae k varphi
displaystyle l tfrac sqrt k k big r varphi r varphi big
circle inversionthe inversion at the unit circle has in polar coordinates the simple description
displaystyle r varphi mapsto tfrac r varphi
the image of a spiral
displaystyle r a varphi n
under the inversion at the unit circle is the spiral with polar equation
displaystyle r tfrac a varphi n
for example the inverse of an archimedean spiral is a hyperbolic spiral a logarithmic spiral
displaystyle r ae k varphi
is mapped onto the logarithmic spiral
displaystyle r tfrac a e k varphi
the function
displaystyle r varphi
of a spiral is usually strictly monotonic continuous
and unbounded
for the standard spirals
displaystyle r varphi
is either a power function or an exponential function
if one chooses for
displaystyle r varphi
a bounded function the spiral is bounded too
a suitable bounded function is the arctan function
example setting
arctan
displaystyle r a arctan k varphi
and the choice
displaystyle k a varphi geq
gives a spiral that starts at the origin like an archimedean spiral and approaches the circle with radius
displaystyle r a pi

example for
arctan
displaystyle r a arctan k varphi pi

one gets a spiral that approaches the origin like a hyperbolic spiral and approaches the circle with radius

two well known spiral space curves are conic spirals and spherical spirals defined below
another instance of space spirals is the toroidal spiral
a a spiral wound around a helix also known as double twisted helix represents objects such as coiled coil filaments or the slinky spring toy
if in the
displaystyle x
displaystyle y
plane a spiral with parametric representation
displaystyle x r varphi cos varphi qquad y r varphi sin varphi
is given then there can be added a third coordinate
displaystyle z varphi
such that the now space curve lies on the cone with equation
displaystyle m x y z z m
displaystyle x r varphi cos varphi qquad y r varphi sin varphi qquad color red z z mr varphi
spirals based on this procedure are called conical spirals
examplestarting with an archimedean spiral
displaystyle r varphi a varphi
one gets the conical spiral see diagram
displaystyle x a varphi cos varphi qquad y a varphi sin varphi qquad z z ma varphi quad varphi geq
if one represents a sphere of radius
displaystyle r
displaystyle begin array cll x r cdot sin theta cdot cos varphi y r cdot sin theta cdot sin varphi z r cdot cos theta end array
and sets the linear dependency
displaystyle varphi c theta c
for the angle coordinates one gets a spherical curve called spherical spiral with the parametric representation with
displaystyle c
equal to twice the number of turns
displaystyle begin array cll x r cdot sin theta cdot cos color red c theta y r cdot sin theta cdot sin color red c theta z r cdot cos theta qquad qquad leq theta leq pi end array
spherical spirals were known to pappus too
remark a rhumb line is not a spherical spiral in this sense
a rhumb line also known as a loxodrome or spherical spiral is the curve on a sphere traced by a ship with constant bearing e g travelling from one pole to the other while keeping a fixed angle with respect to the meridians
the loxodrome has an infinite number of revolutions with the separation between them decreasing as the curve approaches either of the poles unlike an archimedean spiral which maintains uniform line spacing regardless of radius
the study of spirals in nature has a long history
christopher wren observed that many shells form a logarithmic spiral jan swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from helix to spirula and henry nottidge moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells
d arcy wentworth thompson s on growth and form gives extensive treatment to these spirals
he describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis the shape of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a geometric progression
in some shells such as nautilus and ammonites the generating curve revolves in a plane perpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planar discoid shape
in others it follows a skew path forming a helico spiral pattern
thompson also studied spirals occurring in horns teeth claws and plants
a model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by h
vogel
this has the form
displaystyle theta n times circ r c sqrt n
where n is the index number of the floret and c is a constant scaling factor and is a form of fermat s spiral
the angle is the golden angle which is related to the golden ratio and gives a close packing of florets
spirals in plants and animals are frequently described as whorls
this is also the name given to spiral shaped fingerprints
a spiral like form has been found in mezine ukraine as part of a decorative object dated to bce
the spiral and triple spiral motif is a neolithic symbol in europe megalithic temples of malta
the celtic symbol the triple spiral is in fact a pre celtic symbol
it is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric newgrange monument in county meath ireland
newgrange was built around bce predating the celts and the triple spirals were carved at least years before the celts reached ireland but has long since been incorporated into celtic culture
the triskelion symbol consisting of three interlocked spirals or three bent human legs appears in many early cultures including mycenaean vessels on coinage in lycia on staters of pamphylia at aspendos bc and pisidia as well as on the heraldic emblem on warriors shields depicted on greek pottery
spirals can be found throughout pre columbian art in latin and central america
the more than petroglyphs rock engravings in las plazuelas guanajuato mexico dating ad predominantly depict spirals dot figures and scale models
in colombia monkeys frog and lizard like figures depicted in petroglyphs or as gold offering figures frequently includes spirals for example on the palms of hands
in lower central america spirals along with circles wavy lines crosses and points are universal petroglyphs characters
spirals can also be found among the nazca lines in the coastal desert of peru dating from bc to ad
the geoglyphs number in the thousands and depict animals plants and geometric motifs including spirals
spiral shapes including the swastika triskele etc have often been interpreted as solar symbols
roof tiles dating back to the tang dynasty with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of chang an modern day xi an
spirals are also a symbol of hypnosis stemming from the clich of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral one example being kaa in disney s the jungle book
they are also used as a symbol of dizziness where the eyes of a cartoon character especially in anime and manga will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed
the spiral is also found in structures as small as the double helix of dna and as large as a galaxy
because of this frequent natural occurrence the spiral is the official symbol of the world pantheist movement
the spiral is also a symbol of the dialectic process and dialectical monism
the spiral has inspired artists throughout the ages
among the most famous of spiral inspired art is robert smithson s earthwork spiral jetty at the great salt lake in utah
the spiral theme is also present in david wood s spiral resonance field at the balloon museum in albuquerque as well as in the critically acclaimed nine inch nails concept album the downward spiral
the spiral is also a prominent theme in the anime gurren lagann where it represents a philosophy and way of life
it also central in mario merz and andy goldsworthy s work
the spiral is the central theme of the horror manga uzumaki by junji ito where a small coastal town is afflicted by a curse involving spirals
a piece of mind by wayne a beale also depicts a large spiral in this book of dreams and images
the coiled spiral is a central image in australian artist tanja stark s suburban gothic iconography that incorporates spiral electric stove top elements as symbols of domestic alchemy and spirituality
