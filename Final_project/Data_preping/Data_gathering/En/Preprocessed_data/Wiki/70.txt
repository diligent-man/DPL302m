Venango County is a county located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
As of the 2010 census, the population was 54,984
Its county seat is Franklin
The county was created in 1800 and later organized in 1805.
Venango County comprises the Oil City, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area
It is defined as part of the Pittsburgh media market.
Venango County was created on March 12, 1800, from parts of Allegheny and Lycoming Counties
The name "Venango" comes from the Native American name of the region, Onenge, meaning Otter
This was corrupted in English as the Venango River
The settlement at its mouth was likewise called Venango, and is the site of present-day South Side of Oil City, Pennsylvania.
Venango County was home to an oil boom in the years following discovery of natural oil (petroleum) in the mid-1850s.
George Bissell, a Yale University Chemistry professor, and Edwin L
Drake, a former railroad conductor, made the first successful use of a drilling rig on August 28, 1859, near Titusville, Pennsylvania
(Although Titusville is in Crawford County, the first oil well was drilled outside of town, less than a mile inside of the Venango County boundary.) This single well soon exceeded the entire cumulative oil output of Europe since the 1650s
Within weeks oil derricks were erected all over the area
Other oil boom towns located in Venango County included Franklin, Oil City, and the now defunct Pithole City
The principal product of the oil was kerosene.
McClintocksville was a small community in Cornplanter Township in Venango County
In 1861, it was the location of Wamsutta Oil Refinery, the first business venture of Henry Huttleston Rogers, who became a leading United States capitalist, businessman, industrialist, financier, and philanthropist
Rogers and his young wife Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers lived in a one-room shack there along Oil Creek for several years beginning in 1862.
Shortly later, Rogers met oil pioneer Charles Pratt who purchased the entire output of the tiny Wamsutta Oil Refinery
In 1867, Rogers joined Pratt in forming Charles Pratt and Company, which was purchased by Standard Oil in 1874
Rogers became one of the key men in John D
Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust.
After joining Standard Oil, Rogers invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways
The Virginian Railway is widely considered his final life's achievement
Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million, and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States
He was also a generous philanthropist, providing many public works for his hometown of Fairhaven, Massachusetts, and financially assisting helping such notables as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and Dr
Booker T
Washington.
Perhaps in one of history's ironies, another resident of Venango County about the same time as Henry and Abbie Rogers was a little girl named Ida M
Tarbell, whose father was an independent producer whose small business was ruined by the South Improvement Company scheme of 1871 and the conglomerate which became Standard Oil
Introduced to each other in 1902 by their mutual friend Mark Twain, Tarbell who had become an investigative journalist and Rogers, who knew of her work, shared meetings and information over a two-year period which led to her epoch work, The History of the Standard Oil Company, published in 1904, which many historians feel helped fuel public sentiment against the giant company and helped lead to the court-ordered break-up of it in 1911.
The oil heritage of Venanago County is remembered by a Pennsylvania State Park and many heritage sites which help tell the story and memorialize the people of the oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
According to the U.S
Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 683 square miles (1,770 km), of which 674 square miles (1,750 km) is land and 8.6 square miles (22 km) (1.3%) is water.
French Creek is formed near French Creek, New York and extends for a length of 117 miles (188 km) with a drainage area of 1,270 square miles (3,289 km)
It joins the Allegheny River near Franklin, Pennsylvania
 The watershed area includes parts of Erie, Crawford, Venango, and Mercer Counties in Pennsylvania as well as Chautauqua County, New York.

Venango County has long been powerfully Republican
Only twice since the Civil War has the county selected a Democratic presidential candidate, and only Lyndon Johnson in his 1964 landslide has gained an absolute majority for the Democratic Party
In 1984 Venango County actually voted fractionally more Democratic than the nation at-large due to hostility towards Reaganomics in industrial districts, and in the 1992 and 1996 elections it came within 2 points and 1 point of voting for Democrat Bill Clinton, but by 2016 Donald Trump had gained 68.1 percent to Hillary Clinton's 26.8 percent – figures which were long typical of the county.
As of February 21, 2022, there are 32,319 registered voters in Venango County

Pennzoil
Quaker StatePennzoil and Quaker State left the Venango area for Texas
After leaving the area they merged and stopped refining oil
They now concentrate on retail oil and automotive additives produced for them by other companies
As of 2007, the two companies only exist as brand names after the company disappeared because of successive mergers.
With global crude oil prices touching US$100 in early 2008, long-dormant interest reawakened in Venango County's remaining oil reserves, 70% undrilled by one estimate
 High prices make less accessible oil deposits worth extracting
 For instance, a Canadian firm proposed drilling several large mines and allowing oil to flood the tunnels.
