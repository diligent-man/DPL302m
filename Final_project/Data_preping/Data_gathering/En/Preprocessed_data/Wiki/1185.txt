David McClister directed the Need You Now music video using a treatment he wrote in minutes
The video features all three members of Lady Antebellum acting out scenes pertaining to the storyline It begins in a hallway of a hotel where Kelley is sitting against a wall and Scott is in her room with Haywood playing the piano Kelley goes to a cafe and has a coffee where Haywood arrives with his love interest Scott then leaves her room and hails a taxi Kelley leaves the cafe and goes outside to walk to a costume ball to which Scott is also traveling When they arrive at the ball they both see their love interests wearing masks and embrace them Haywood soon arrives at the ball with his love interest The video ends with all three members embracing their love interests The video was filmed at the King Edward Hotel in Toronto Ontario
Of the changes between the song and its music video one of the most noted is Kelley drinking coffee instead of whiskey since the song states the character is intoxicated In response McClister admitted he simply did not want the video to be a literal adaptation of the song as he felt sitting in a diner in the middle of the night was lonelier
