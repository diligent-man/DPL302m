this is a summary of the different copyright policies of academic publishers for books book chapters and journal articles
academic publishers fall broadly into two categories subscription and open access which take different approaches to copyright
subscription publishers typically require transfer of copyright ownership from the authors to the publisher with the publisher monetising articles behind paywalls
the final version of an article as copyedited and typeset by the publisher is typically called the version of record
such publishers sometimes allow certain rights to their authors including permission to reuse parts of the paper in the author s future work to distribute a limited number of copies
in the print format such copies are called reprints in the electronic format they are called postprints
open access publishers allow authors to retain their copyright but attach a reuse license to the work so that it can be hosted by the publisher and openly shared reused and adapted
such publishers are either funded by charging authors article processing fees gold oa or by being subsidised by a larger organisation diamond oa
academic book publishing policies are not consolidated into a single database in contrast to the sherpa romeo database of journal policies
however a relatively small number of academic book publishers dominate the market
most publishers permit self archiving of the postprint version of the author s own chapter if contributed to only one chapter or of the total book if contributed to multiple chapters
the notable exception is elsevier which is the largest publisher to not permit chapter archiving under any circumstances
academic journal publishing policies focus on two main aspects whether a preprint article already openly shared can be submitted to a journal and what version of the article can be subsequently openly shared after peer review has been concluded academic publishers will not publish work that has already been published elsewhere so a key issue has been the interpretation of a preprint server
traditionally academic have circulated pre submission copies of their articles for informal feedback
however open preprint servers since the s increased the scale and visibility of this process and raised the question as to whether this constituted prior publication or merely sharing
the majority of academic journal publishers now accept submission of articles that have already been shared as preprints with copyright of this version remaining with the author by default
the sharing of postprints the last version of an article after peer review but before copyright is transferred to a publisher has become increasingly permitted by academic journal publishers typically after an embargo of months
journal policies are consolidated in the sherpa romeo database
the copyright of the final published version of record may reside with the authors or the publisher depending on the publisher s business model
for journals following a subscription model where articles are accessed via a paywall copyright is transferred from author to publisher
sharing of the final formatted article is therefore typically never permitted
the rise of gold open access academic journals stands in contrast to this where copyright is retained by the author and a reuse license typically a creative commons variant applied
