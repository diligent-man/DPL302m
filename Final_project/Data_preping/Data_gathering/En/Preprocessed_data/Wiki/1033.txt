corrugated fiberboard material consisting fluted corrugated sheet one two flat linerboards
made flute lamination machine corrugators used making cardboard boxes
corrugated medium sheet linerboards made kraft containerboard paperboard material usually inch mm thick
corrugated fiberboard sometimes called 'corrugated cardboard' although cardboard might heavy paper-pulp based board
corrugated also called pleated paper wa patented england used liner tall hat corrugated boxboard wa patented used shipping material december
patent wa issued albert jones new york city single-sided single-face corrugated board
jones used corrugated board wrapping bottle glass lantern chimneys
first machine producing large quantity corrugated board wa built g
smyth year oliver long improved upon jones' design inventing corrugated board liner sheet side thereby inventing corrugated board came known modern times
scottish-born robert gair invented pre-cut paperboard box flat piece manufactured bulk folded boxes
wa printing seed bag metal ruler used crease bag shifted position cut them
gair discovered cutting creasing one operation could make prefabricated paperboard boxes
applying idea corrugated boxboard wa straightforward development material became available early century
corrugated box wa first used packaging glass pottery containers
mid-s case enabled fruit produce shipped farm retailer without bruising improving return producer opening export markets
moisture certain limit cause cracking corrugated board reduce compression strength board
edge crush test measure force per unit width predicts box compression strength
box compression strength direct measurement performance corrugated boxes
flat crush test measure flute rigidity reported kpa
reported gmcorrugated fiberboard anisotropic many property highly directional
example edge crush bending stiffness tensile surface characteristic different depending orientation flute machine direction manufacture
corrugated board manufactured large high-precision machinery line called corrugators usually running foot per minute mmin more
machine time become complex objective avoiding common problem corrugated board production warp washboarding
key raw material corrugating paper different grade layer making corrugated box
due supply chain scale consideration paper produced separate plant called paper mills
newly formed corrugated board heated bottom hot plates
corrugated medium often pound per square foot gram per square metre basis weight u uk gram per square metre lbsq ft fluting paper common
single-facer heated moistened formed fluted pattern geared wheels
joined flat linerboard starch based adhesive form single face board
double-backer second flat linerboard adhered side fluted medium form single wall corrugated board
linerboards test liner recycled paper kraft paperboard various grades
liner may bleached white mottled white colored preprinted
common flute size b c e f microflute
letter designation relates order flute invented relative sizes
flute size refers number flute per linear foot although actual flute dimension different corrugator manufacturer may vary slightly
measuring number flute per linear foot reliable method identifying flute size measuring board thickness vary due manufacturing conditions
corrugated fiberboard specified construction single face singlewall doublewall etc flute size burst strength edge crush strength flat crush basis weight component pound per thousand square foot gram per square meter etc surface treatment coating etc
choice corrugated medium flute size combining adhesive linerboards varied engineer corrugated board specific property match wide variety potential uses
double triple-wall corrugated board also produced high stacking strength puncture resistance
corrugators two knife corrugators mean produce two different sheet length side-by-side
packaging engineer design corrugated box meet particular need product shipped hazard shipping environment shock vibration compression moisture etc marketing need retailer consumers

alternatively sheet corrugated board may sent different manufacturing facility box fabrication sometimes called sheet plant converters
corrugated board creased scored provide controlled bending board
conversion produced different machine depending conversion made flexo folder gluers ffg rotary die cutter rdc printer slotters printing presses
limitation common corrugated material ha difficulty applying fine graphic print informative marketing purposes
reason stem fact prefabricated corrugated sheet relatively thick spongy compared thin incompressible nature solid fibre paper paperboard
due characteristic corrugated ha mainly printed using flexographic process nature coarse application loose registration properties
recent development popular usage hybrid product featuring structural benefit corrugated combined high-graphics print lithography previously restricted paperboard folding cartons
