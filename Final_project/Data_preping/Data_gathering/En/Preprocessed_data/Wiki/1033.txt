Corrugated fiberboard is a material consisting of a fluted corrugated sheet and one or two flat linerboards It is made on flute lamination machines or corrugators and is used for making cardboard boxes
The corrugated medium sheet and the linerboard s are made of kraft containerboard a paperboard material usually over inches mm thick Corrugated fiberboard is sometimes called 'corrugated cardboard' although cardboard might be any heavy paper pulp based board
Corrugated also called pleated paper was patented in England in and used as a liner for tall hats but corrugated boxboard was not patented and used as a shipping material until December The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City for single sided single face corrugated board Jones used the corrugated board for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated board was built in by G Smyth and in the same year Oliver Long improved upon Jones' design by inventing corrugated board with liner sheets on both sides thereby inventing corrugated board as it came to be known in modern times
Scottish born Robert Gair invented the pre cut paperboard box in flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes Gair's invention resulted from an accident He was a Brooklyn printer and paper bag maker during the s While he was printing seed bags a metal ruler used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes Applying this idea to corrugated boxboard was a straightforward development when the material became available in the early th century
The corrugated box was first used for packaging glass and pottery containers In the mid s the case enabled fruit and produce to be shipped from farm to retailer without bruising improving the return to producers and opening export markets
Several properties and characteristics can be measured for corrugated board Some of these include
Moisture content ranges from If moisture is below a certain limit it will cause cracking in corrugated board and if it is above then it will reduce the compression strength of board
Edge crush test measures force per unit width and predicts Box compression strength It is reported in KN m or lb inch
Burst strength is the pressure required to rupture corrugated sheet It is reported in KPa or lb inch
Box Compression strength is the direct measurement of performance of corrugated boxes It is reported in kgf or N
Flat crush test measures flutes rigidity and reported in KPa
Grammage is the weight per meter square of any material It is reported in g m Corrugated fiberboard is anisotropic many of its properties are highly directional For example edge crush bending stiffness tensile and surface characteristics are different depending on the orientation to the flutes and the machine direction of manufacture
Corrugated board is manufactured on large high precision machinery lines called corrugators usually running at about feet per minute m min or more These machines over time have become very complex with the objective of avoiding some common problems in corrugated board production such as warp and washboarding
The key raw material in corrugating is paper different grades for each layer making up the corrugated box Due to supply chain and scale considerations paper is produced in separate plants called paper mills Most corrugating plants keep an inventory of paper reels
In the classical corrugator the paper is softened with high pressure steam After the board is formed it is dried in the so called dry end Here the newly formed corrugated board is heated from the bottom by hot plates On the top various pressures are applied by a load system on the belt
The corrugated medium is often pounds per square foot grams per square metre basis weight in the US in the UK a grams per square metre lb sq ft fluting paper is common At the single facer it is heated moistened and formed into a fluted pattern on geared wheels This is joined to a flat linerboard with a starch based adhesive to form single face board At the double backer a second flat linerboard is adhered to the other side of the fluted medium to form single wall corrugated board Linerboards are test liners recycled paper or kraft paperboard of various grades The liner may be bleached white mottled white colored or preprinted
Common flute sizes are A B C E and F or microflute The letter designation relates to the order that the flutes were invented not the relative sizes Flute size refers to the number of flutes per linear foot although the actual flute dimensions for different corrugator manufacturers may vary slightly Measuring the number of flutes per linear foot is a more reliable method of identifying flute size than measuring board thickness which can vary due to manufacturing conditions The most common flute size in corrugated boxes is C flute
Corrugated fiberboard can be specified by the construction single face singlewall doublewall etc flute size burst strength edge crush strength flat crush basis weights of components pounds per thousand square feet grams per square meter etc surface treatments and coatings etc TAPPI and ASTM test methods for these are standardized
The choice of corrugated medium flute size combining adhesive and linerboards can be varied to engineer a corrugated board with specific properties to match a wide variety of potential uses Double and triple wall corrugated board is also produced for high stacking strength and puncture resistance
Most corrugators are two knife corrugators which means that they can produce two different sheet lengths side by side This leads to an optimisation problem known as the cutting stock problem
Packaging engineers design corrugated boxes to meet the particular needs of the product being shipped the hazards of the shipping environment shock vibration compression moisture etc and the marketing needs of retailers and consumers
The most common box style is the Regular Slotted Container RSC All flaps are the same length from the score to the edge Typically the longer major flaps meet in the middle and the minor flaps do not However with the rise of E commerce and a more competitive retail environment box designs are becoming more dynamic and functional straying away from typical shipping box designs
The manufacturer's joint is most often joined with adhesive but may also be taped or stitched The box is shipped flat knocked down to the packager who sets up the box fills it and closes it for shipment Box closure may be by tape adhesive staples strapping etc
The size of a box can be measured for either internal for product fit or external for handling machinery or palletizing dimensions Boxes are usually specified and ordered by the internal dimensions
A box maker's certificate also known as box certificate or box certificate of maker is a seal printed on an outside surface typically the bottom of the box that includes some information about how strong the box is The certificate is not required but if used it implies compliance with regulations relating to the certificate Significant information includes
Bursting Test or Edge Crush Test
Size Limit the maximum outside dimensions of a finished box when the length width and depth of the box are added together
Gross Weight LimitBoxes can be formed in the same plant as the corrugator Such plants are known as integrated plants Part of the scoring and cutting takes place in line on the corrugator Alternatively sheets of corrugated board may be sent to a different manufacturing facility for box fabrication these are sometimes called sheet plants or converters
The corrugated board is creased or scored to provide controlled bending of the board Most often slots are cut to provide flaps on the box Scoring and slotting can also be accomplished by die cutting Along with the print being produced on the box in these plants These conversions are produced on different machines depending on the conversion being made Flexo Folder Gluers FFG Rotary Die Cutters RDC Printer Slotters or Printing Presses
A limitation of common corrugated material has been the difficulty in applying fine graphic print for informative and marketing purposes The reasons for this stem from the fact that prefabricated corrugated sheets are relatively thick and spongy compared to the thin and incompressible nature of solid fibre paper such as paperboard Due to these characteristics of corrugated it has been mainly printed using a flexographic process which is by nature a coarse application with loose registration properties
A more recent development popular in usage is a hybrid product featuring the structural benefits of corrugated combined with the high graphics print of lithography previously restricted to paperboard folding cartons This application generally referred to as 'Single Face Laminate' begins its process as a traditional fluted medium adhered to a single linerboard single face but in place of a second long fibered liner a pre printed sheet of paperboard such as SBS solid bleached sulfate is laminated to the outer facing The sheet can then be converted with the same processes used for other corrugated manufacturing into any desired form
Specialized equipment is necessary for the material construction of SFL so users may expect to pay a premium for these products However this cost is often offset by the savings over a separate paperboard sleeve and the labor necessary to assemble the completed package
Old corrugated containers are an excellent source of fiber for recycling They can be compressed and baled for cost effective transport The baled boxes are put in a hydropulper which is a large vat of warm water for cleaning and processing The pulp slurry is then used to make new paper and fiber products
Mill and corrugator scrap or broke is the cleanest source for recycling The high rates of post consumer recycling reflect the efficiency of recycling mills to clean and process the incoming materials Several technologies are available to sort screen filter and chemically treat the recycled paper
Many extraneous materials are readily removed Twine strapping etc are removed from the hydropulper by a ragger Metal straps and staples can be screened out or removed by a magnet Film backed pressure sensitive tape stays intact the PSA adhesive and the backing are both removed together
Materials which are more difficult to remove include wax coatings on corrugated boxes and stickies soft rubbery particles which can clog the paper maker and contaminate the recycled paper Stickies can originate from book bindings hot melt adhesives pressure sensitive adhesives from paper labels laminating adhesives of reinforced gummed tapes etc
Corrugated fiberboard shredders are now available which convert post consumer corrugated board into packing cushioning materials by means of a specialized shredding process
