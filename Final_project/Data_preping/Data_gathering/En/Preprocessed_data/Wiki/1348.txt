though the first bra a linen and lace garment that looks almost exactly like a modern bra was discovered in an early th century collection from lengberg castle in tyrol austria there is no other evidence of any use of bras in the s and the first bra is attributed to mary phelps jacob better known as caresse crosby a new york socialite

the underwire bra utilizes a wire sewn into the bra fabric and under each cup from the center gore to under the wearer s armpit

about of women who wear bras wear a steel underwire bra according to underwear manufacturer industries of new york in
in million of the bras sold in the united states were underwire bras

there has been complaints that underwire bras restrict the flow of blood and lymph fluid around the breasts preventing drainage of toxins though there has been no evidence of that
in the next decade particularly during the covid lockdowns bralettes and soft bras started replacing underwired and padded bras sometimes also serving as an outerwear
at the same time popularity of brands like victoria s secret decreased significantly
because according to sarah shotton creative director of agent provocateur now it s about the athletic body health and wellbeing than about the male gaze while according to independent lingerie designer araks yeramyan it was metoo that catapulted the bralette movement into what it is today some bralettes still provide plunging designs light padding bottom support or significant cleavage
mass produced bras are manufactured to fit a prototypical woman standing with both arms at her sides
the design assumes that both breasts are equally sized and symmetrical
manufacturing a well fitting bra is a challenge since the garment is supposed to be form fitting but women s breasts may sag vary in volume width height shape and position on the chest
manufacturers make standard bra sizes that provide a close fit however even a woman with accurate measurements can have a difficult time finding a correctly fitted bra because of the variations in sizes between different manufacturers
some manufacturers create vanity sizes and deliberately mis state the size of their bras in an attempt to persuade women that they are slimmer and more buxom
a bra is one of the most complicated garments to make
a typical design has between and parts including the band gore side panel cup apex neckline underwire strap ring slider strap join and closure
bras are built on a square frame model
lingerie designer chantal thomass said
the primary component offering the most support is a chest band that wraps around the torso
it supports two cups that are usually held in place by two shoulder straps
the chest band is usually closed in the back by a hook and eye fastener but smaller busted models may be fastened at the front
sleep bras or athletic bras do not have fasteners and are pulled on over the head and breasts
the section between the cups is called a gore
the section under the armpit where the band joins the cups is called the back wing
bra components including the cup top and bottom if seamed the central side and back panels and straps are cut to manufacturer s specifications
many layers of fabric may be cut at the same time using computer controlled lasers or bandsaw shearing devices
the pieces are assembled by piece workers using industrial sewing machines or automated machines
coated metal hooks and eyes are sewn in by machine and heat processed or ironed into the back ends of the band and a tag or label is attached or printed onto the bra itself
the completed bras are folded mechanically or manually and packaged for shipment
the chest band and cups not the shoulder straps are designed to support the weight of women s breasts
strapless bras rely on an underwire and additional seaming and stiffening panels to support them
the shoulder straps of some sports bras cross over at the back to take the pressure off the shoulders when arms are raised
manufacturers continually experiment with proprietary frame designs
for example the playtex hour bra model utilizes an m frame design
bras were originally made of linen cotton broadcloth and twill weaves and sewn using flat felled or bias tape seams
they are now made of a variety of materials including tricot spandex spanette latex microfiber satin jacquard foam mesh and lace which are blended to achieve specific purposes
spandex a synthetic fiber with built in stretch memory can be blended with cotton polyester or nylon
mesh is a high tech synthetic composed of ultra fine filaments that are tightly knit for smoothness
sixty to seventy per cent of bras sold in the uk and us have underwired cups
the underwire is made of metal plastic or resin
said the antecedents for underwire in bras date to at least when marie tucek of new york city patented a breast supporter a sort of early push up bra made of either metal or cardboard and then covered with fabric
underwire is built around the perimeter of the cup where it attaches to the band increasing its rigidity to improve support lift and separation
wirefree or softcup bras have additional seaming and internal reinforcement
by the late s wire free bras were emerging both at hanky panky and at hanro in switzerland
cosabella in italy and eres company fr in france followed in the s as did eberjey in the s
others use padding or shaping materials to enhance bust size or cleavage
in most countries bras come in a band and cup size such as c is the chest band or the measurement around the torso directly underneath the breasts and c is the cup size which refers to the volume of the breasts
most bras are offered in sizes the triumph doreen comes in sizes up to j
the cup size varies depending on the band size
a d cup on a band is larger in volume than a d cup on a band as the volume of a woman s breast increases as her chest band dimension increases
in countries that have adopted the european en dress size standard the measurement is rounded to the nearest multiple of centimetres in
international manufacturing standards and measurement systems vary widely
bras are designed for an ideal body but women s anatomy vary widely
ten percent of women s breasts are asymmetrical with the left breast being larger in percent of cases
one woman s breasts may be ptotic and widely spaced another s might be centered closely on the chest upright and very full
as a result finding a correctly fitting bra is extremely difficult
when women find a bra that appears to fit they tend to stay with that size even though they may lose and gain weight
in a survey in the united kingdom per cent of over women between the ages of to said they had had a bra fitting and per cent said that fit was the least important factor when selecting a bra
increased publicity about the issue of poorly fitted bras has increased the number of women seeking a fitting
the uk retailer marks spencer stated that about women are fitted for bras in their stores weekly
despite this about percent of women still wear the wrong bra size
bra experts recommend professional bra fittings from the lingerie department of a clothing store or a specialty lingerie store especially for cup sizes d or larger and particularly if there has been significant weight gain or loss or if the wearer is continually adjusting her bra
women in the uk change their bra size on average six times over their lifetimes
signs of a loose bra band include the band riding up the back
if the band causes flesh to spill over the edges it is too small
a woman can test whether a bra band is too tight or loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are in the back and then check for fit and comfort
experts suggest that women choose a band size that fits using the outermost set of hooks
this allows the wearer to use the tighter hooks as the bra stretches during its lifetime
bras may be designed to enhance a woman s breast size or to create cleavage or for other aesthetic fashion or more practical considerations

a local news story in the atlantic city press erroneously reported that the bras girdles falsies curlers and copies of popular women s magazines burned in the freedom trash can
individuals who were present said that no one burned a bra nor did anyone take off her bra
however a female reporter lindsy van gelder covering the protest drew an analogy between the feminist protesters and vietnam war protesters who burned their draft cards and the parallel between protesters burning their draft cards and women burning their bras was encouraged by some organizers including robin morgan

i often say that if they had called us girdle burners every woman in america would have run to join us
feminism and bra burning became linked in popular culture
the analogous term jockstrap burning has since been coined as a reference to masculism
while feminist women did not literally burn their bras some stopped wearing them in protest
the feminist author bonnie j
dow has suggested that the association between feminism and bra burning was encouraged by individuals who opposed the feminist movement
bra burning created an image that women weren t really seeking freedom from sexism but were attempting to assert themselves as sexual beings
this might lead individuals to believe as susan j
douglas wrote that the women were merely trying to be trendy and to attract men some feminist activists believe that anti feminists use the bra burning myth and the subject of going braless to trivialize what the protesters were trying to accomplish at the feminist miss america protest and the feminist movement in general
the trope of feminists burning their bras was anticipated by an earlier generation of feminists who called for burning corsets as a step toward liberation
in elizabeth stuart phelps ward wrote
some feminists began arguing in the s and s that the bra was an example of how women s clothing shaped and even deformed women s bodies to male expectations
professor lisa jardine listened to feminist germaine greer talk about bras during a formal college dinner in newnham college cambridge in greer had become a member of that college in
germaine greer s book the female eunuch became associated with the anti bra movement because she pointed out how restrictive and uncomfortable a bra could be
bras are a ludicrous invention she wrote but if you make bralessness a rule you re just subjecting yourself to yet another repression
susan brownmiller in her book femininity took the position that women without bras shock and anger men because men implicitly think that they own breasts and that only they should remove bras
the feminist author iris marion young wrote in that the bra serves as a barrier to touch and that a bra less woman is deobjectified eliminating the hard pointy look that phallic culture posits as the norm without a bra in her view women s breasts are not consistently shaped objects but change as the woman moves reflecting the natural body
other feminist anti bra arguments from young in include that training bras are used to indoctrinate girls into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects and to accentuate their sexuality
young also wrote in that in american culture breasts are subject to c apitalist patriarchal american media dominated culture that objectifies breasts before such a distancing glance that freezes and masters the academic wendy burns ardolino wrote in that women s decision to wear bras is mediated by the male gaze

women sometimes wear bras because they mistakenly believe they prevent breasts from sagging ptosis as they get older
physicians lingerie saleswomen teen girls and adult women used to believe that bras were medically required to support breasts
in a article in parents magazine frank h
crowell wrote that it was important for teen girls to begin wearing bras early
this would prevent sagging breasts stretched blood vessels and poor circulation later on
this belief was based on the incorrect idea that since breasts cannot anatomically support themselves wearing a brassiere makes a difference as a woman ages
a study by jean denis rouillon said that wearing a bra may actually weaken the supportive tissue that holds up breasts
bra manufacturers are careful to claim that bras only affect the shape of breasts while they are being worn
the key factors influencing breast ptosis over a woman s lifetime are cigarette smoking her number of pregnancies gravity higher body mass index larger bra cup size and significant weight gain and loss
