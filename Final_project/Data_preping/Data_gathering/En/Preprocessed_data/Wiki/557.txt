The Ferrari is a series of sports cars and grand tourers built by Ferrari from to
The company's most successful early line the series includes many variants designed for road use or sports car racing
series cars are characterized by their use of a L cc Colombo V engine designed by Gioacchino Colombo
They were replaced by the and series cars
Most road cars share the same two wheelbases mm in for short wheelbase SWB and mm in for long wheelbase LWB
Nearly all s share the same Colombo Tipo V engine
At cc cu in it was notable for its light weight and impressive output of up to PS kW hp in the Testa Rossa and GTO
The V weighed hundreds of pounds less than its chief competitors â€” for example it was nearly half the weight of the Jaguar XK straight-
Ferrari uses the displacement of a single cylinder as the model designation
The V propelled the Ferrari racing cars to numerous victories
Typical of Ferrari the Colombo V made its debut on the race track with the racing s preceding the street cars by three years
The first was the experimental S berlinetta prototype entered in the Mille Miglia for Giovanni Bracco and Alfonso Rolfo
The Mercedes-Benz W racers of Rudolf Caracciola Hermann Lang and Karl Kling were faster on the long straights but the PS kW hp Ferrari made up sufficient ground in the hills and curves to win the race
The car was later entered at Le Mans and in the Carrera Panamericana
The S used a mm in wheelbase with a Tuboscocca tubular trellis frame
Suspension was by double wishbones at the front with double longitudinal semi-elliptic springs locating the live axle at the rear
The car had the drum brakes and worm-and-sector steering typical of the period
The dry-sump L cc cu in engine used three Weber DCF carburettors and was mated directly to a five-speed manual transmission
Following the success of the S in the Mille Miglia Ferrari showed a more conventional chassis for the new engine at the Paris Motor Show
Pinin Farina then created coup bodywork which had a small grille compact tail and panoramic rear window and the new car was launched as the MM for Mille Miglia at the Geneva Motor Show
Carrozzeria Vignale's open barchetta version was also an innovative design whose recessed headlights and side vents became a Ferrari staple for the s
MM was the sole chassis with Vignale Berlinetta body distinctive for its triple portholes on the bottom of front fenders not on top
The MM's wheelbase was longer than the S at mm in with the coup kg lb heavier than the kg lb barchetta
The V engine's dry sump was omitted from the production car and the transmission was reduced by one gear
Power was increased to PS kW hp
The four-cylinder TF and S replaced the V-powered MM later in
The MM's race debut was at the Giro di Sicilia with privateer Paolo Marzotto
A Carrozzeria Morelli-bodied MM barchetta driven by Clemente Biondetti came fourth in the Mille Miglia
Main article Ferrari MonzaThe Monza was an unusual hybrid of the light four-cylinder Mondial and the line
The model used the MM engine in the short-wheelbase chassis from the Mondial
The first three used the Pinin Farina barchetta shape of the Monza and Mondial
One more Monza was built by Carrozzeria Scaglietti an early use of the now-familiar coachbuilder
The Monzas failed to gain much success and the union of the Monza chassis and engine was not pursued for some time
Main article Ferrari Testa RossaThe racing Testa Rossa was one of the most successful Ferrari racing cars in its history with three wins at Le Mans four wins at Sebring and two wins at Buenos Aires
One example sold at auction for a record-breaking million
Main article Ferrari GTOThe GTO was produced from to for homologation into the FIA's Group Grand Touring Car category
GTO stands for Gran Turismo Omologato Italian for Homologated Grand Tourer
When new the GTO sold for in the United States and buyers had to be personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and his dealer for North America Luigi Chinetti
In May the Ferrari GTO chassis number GT sold by an auction for US
In October the Ferrari GTO chassis number GT sold by Connecticut-based collector Paul Pappalardo to an unnamed buyer in a private transaction for US million
In August the Ferrari GTO chassis number GT sold at auction for US
In the Series II was introduced which had a different body
Three such cars were made and four older Series I cars were given a Series II body
It brought the total number of GTOs produced to
In Sports Car International placed the GTO eighth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the s and nominated it the top sports car of all time
Motor Trend Classic placed it first on a list of the Greatest Ferraris of all time
The P was a prototype racer produced in winning that year's Hours of Sebring km Nrburgring and the Hours of Le Mans
The P used an engine derived from the Testa Rossa mounted in a rear mid-engine rear wheel drive configuration
The mid-engined Le Mans looked very much the prototype racer but was intended for production as a road-going GT
Descended from the P the Le Mans also appeared in and sported Pininfarina bodywork
Ferrari was unable to persuade the FIA that he would build the examples required to homologate the car for GT racing
As a result Ferrari withdrew from factory participation in the GT class of the World Sportscar Championship allowing the Shelby Cobra team to dominate
A LM competing in the Prototype category won the Hours of Le Mans
Only the very early LM's were true models
All the others were made as -litre models and as such should have been named LM
The early cars were converted to the -litre engine
The design was successful both on the road and on the track
A number of GT models were built in varying states of road or racing trim
The Europa introduced at the Paris Motor Show was the only one of the family to use a different engine sporting the cc Lampredi V based on a design for Formula One L engine
It was a square engine with mm in of bore and stroke developing PS kW hp at rpm with three Weber DCF or DCZ carburettors and mated to a -speed transmission
With the long mm in wheelbase and Ferrari America-style bodies it was designed as a grand tourer
Three different rear axle ratios were offered to customers providing an estimated top speed between kilometres per hour mph depending on the ratio
Both Europa and America shared the same chassis wheelbase and mechanicals apart for the engine
The bodywork was designed by Giovanni Michelotti and constructed by Pinin Farina and Vignale
Styling resembled the America and Mexico coupes
were made including Pinin Farina-built coupes Vignale coupes Pinin Farina cabriolet and Vignale cabriolet
Two were later converted by the Ferrari factory to America specification chassis AL and EU
The first road car to use Colombo's V was the Europa GT introduced at the Paris Motor Show
It was also the first Ferrari to use the Gran Turismo moniker
Pinin Farina's sober Paris coup was just one of many shapes for the GT model line with coachbuilt production extending through before the line became more standardized
The original Europa GT used a mm in wheelbase on a conventional chassis with - Stella Bianca tyres
The wet sump V was tuned to PS kW hp with three Weber DCZ carburettors
Echoing Vignale's Europa Pinin Farina added now-familiar vents to the front fenders a standard styling cue for many of the GTs that followed
finished third at the Lige-Rome-Lige rally in
Pinin Farina introduced a -based prototype coup at the Geneva Motor Show which came to be called the GT Boano
Intended as a styling exercise and inspiration to GT Europa customers the car generated demand that soon called for a production series
Unable to meet the demand without expansion Pinin Farina asked Mario Boano formerly of Ghia to handle the construction
When Fiat later recruited Boano he handed production duties to his son-in-law Ezio Ellena
With partner Luciano Pollo Carrozzeria Ellena would produce the GT for another few years
Ellena revised the car raising the roof and removing the vent windows from the doors
These examples became known as the GT Ellena
Carrozzeria Boano built GTs on the long-wheelbase chassis
The single convertible GT was sold to New York collector Bob Lee off the stand at the New York Auto Show
At the direction of Enzo Ferrari Lee bought the car for far below cost
He still owns it making it one of the oldest Ferraris still in the hands of the original purchaser
Four examples of the GT Coup Speciale were made on the type chassis
Although chassis numbers were in the middle of the Boano GT Coup run they did not share the same chassis type
They had Series I Superamerica-style bodies and type V engines
The original GT Berlinetta nicknamed the Long Wheelbase Berlinetta was also called the Tour de France after competing in the -day Tour de France automobile race
Seventy-seven Tour de France cars were built of which a number were sold for GT races from through
Construction was handled by Carrozzeria Scaglietti based on a Pinin Farina design
The engine began at PS kW hp but eventually rose to PS kW hp
Pirelli Cinturato R tyres CA were standard
At the Geneva Motor Show Scaglietti displayed their own GT prototype which became known as the limited-production Series I no-louvre GT Berlinetta
The first customer car was built in May with production now the responsibility of Scaglietti in Modena
Fourteen no-louvre and nine -louvre Series I and II Berlinettas were made
There were four series of GT Berlinettas
In mid- the Series III cars were introduced with three louvres and covered headlights
The Series IV cars retained the covered headlights and had a single vent louvre
Zagato also made five no-louvre superlight cars to Ugo Zagato's design
A GT Berlinetta won Tour de France Automobile three times in and
Ferrari's winning streak in this race will be carried over with later 'Interim' and SWB Berlinettas
Released at the Geneva Motor Show in the original GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina Series I used the mm in wheelbase and the body was styled differently from the Berlinetta
Cars left the factory on either R or VR Pirelli Cinturato tyres CA
About examples were produced before a second series was shown at Paris in
These later cars had more in common with the production Berlinetta
About of the Series II cars were built
Motor Trend Classic placed the GT Series I Cabriolet and Coup ninth on their list of the ten Greatest Ferraris of all time
Designed for export to North America the GT California Spyder was Scaglietti's interpretation of an open-top GT
Aluminium was used for the hood doors and trunk lid with steel elsewhere for most models
Several aluminium-bodied racing versions were also built
The engine was the same as in the Tour de France racing car with up to PS hp kW at rpm and a maximum torque of Nâ‹…m lbâ‹…ft kgâ‹…m at rpm from a cc L cu in naturally aspirated SOHC valves per cylinder Âº Ferrari Colombo V engine equipped with Weber carburetors
All used the long mm in chassis and Pirelli Cinturato VR tyres CA were standard
A total of fifty LWBs were made before the SWB version superseded them in
One example sold at auction on August in Monterey California for millionThis car was central to the plot of the successful film Ferris Bueller's Day Off
UK radio host and former Top Gear presenter Chris Evans bought one for million in
Needing series production to stabilize his company's finances Enzo Ferrari asked Pinin Farina to design a simple and classic GT coup
After the GT Coup BoanoEllena Pinin Farina's Grugliasco plant expanded and now had the capacity to produce the new GT Coup Pinin Farina
It was introduced at Milan in and near-identical examples were built by
The GT Coup eschewed the fender vents for simple clean lines and a notchback look with panoramic rear window
The oval grille was replaced by a more traditional long narrow look with protruding headlights
Telescopic shock absorbers were also fitted instead of the Houdailles on previous s and disc brakes were added in
The original R Pirelli Cinturato tyres CA were later changed to VR
The final GT Coup had a Superfast tail and was shown at the London Motor Show
In seven GT Interim LWB Berlinettas were made
They utilized the old long-wheelbase chassis and had the new Pinin Farina bodywork of the upcoming SWB Berlinettas
Interim vehicles have an additional rear quarter window absent from the succeeding Passo Corto Berlinettas
The Interim vehicles are serial numbers GT GT GT GT GT GT and GT
'Interim' Berlinetta won Tour de France Automobile thus continuing Ferrari's dominance
In line with the high-volume coup Pinin Farina also designed a plainer GT Cabriolet for series production
Introduced at the Paris Motor Show the GT Cabriolet sported a look similar to the GT Coup of the previous year including the removal of the side vents
VR Pirelli Cinturato tyres CA were standard
On the Coup the headlights were uncovered
One of the most notable GT racers of its time the GT Berlinetta SWB used a short mm in wheelbase for better handling
Of the examples built both steel and aluminum bodies were used in various road lusso and racing trims
Engine output ranged from PS kW hp to PS kW hp
The lusso road car version was originally fitted with VR Pirelli Cinturato CADevelopment of the GT SWB Berlinetta was handled by Giotto Bizzarrini Carlo Chiti and young Mauro Forghieri the same team that later produced the GTO
Disc brakes were a first on a Ferrari GT and the combination of low weight high power and well-sorted suspension made it competitive
It was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in October and quickly began selling and racing
The SWB Berlinetta won Ferrari the GT class of the Constructor's Championship
Also won and Tour de France Automobile before giving ground to the GTO's
In Sports Car International placed the GT SWB seventh on a list of Top Sports Cars of the s and Motor Trend Classic placed it fifth on a list of the ten Greatest Ferraris of all time
In Ferrari gave the GT Berlinetta sharper handling reducing its wheelbase from mm to mm
In Scaglietti unveiled the GT California Spyder SWB at the Geneva Motor Show its body pulled more tautly over this updated chassis
Like the GT Berlinetta SWB on which it was based the revised Spyder also received disc brakes and a PS kW hp version of the three-litre V
It was fitted with VR Pirelli Cinturato tyres CA
The switch to the mm chassis of the GT Berlinetta SWB lowered the body by mm but an easier way to tell the passo lungo LWB version from the passo corto SWB version of the California Spyder is to look at the hood scoop and the vents on sides of the front fenders
The hood scoop is much lower on the SWB version
A custom-built fiberglass-bodied replica of a GT California Spyder was featured in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off
Three Modena Spyders two running and one shell for destruction were built on custom frames for the film by Modena Design Development
One of the running models was sold back to Modena for restoration and in April became the nd vehicle added to the National Historic Vehicle Register
A SWB that had been owned by James Coburn was sold for Â£ million to radio DJ Chris Evans
A barn-find SWB owned by French actor Alain Delon while he was making the film Les Felins with Jane Fonda sold for US million in February
On March at the Omni Amelia Island Plantation a SWB sold for US million at auction
The LWB GT theme was expanded with the + model GTE the first large-production four-seat Ferrari earlier four-seaters were made in very small numbers
Interior space was increased by moving the engine forward in the chassis
The rear seats were suitable for children but small for adults
Pirelli Cinturato VR tyres CA were original equipment
The standard wheels used on series were the Borrani RW and the series were fitted with the Borrani RW as a standard
Engine output was listed at PS kW hp
Almost GTEs were constructed by Pininfarina with prototypes starting in and continuing through three series until
The model was followed by the visually similar America which shared the GTE's chassis but used the larger L engine of the series
The large production run of the GTE was a major contributor to Ferrari's financial well-being in the early s
A GTE can be seen in The Wrong Arm of the Law a film starring Peter Sellers
Pininfarina updated the GT with the GT Lusso or GTL
Introduced at the Paris show the car had flowing lines and a fastback shape typical of the GT cars of the mid-s
The engine was the GTO's Tipo with PS kW hp and three Weber DCS carburettors
VR Pirelli Cinturato tyres CA were standard
Built by Scaglietti the Lusso continued through with few modifications
Rock star Eric Clapton owned one and an example that had been owned by Steve McQueen sold at auction for million on August
In Sports Car International placed the GT Lusso tenth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the s
Steve Boone a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the group Lovin' Spoonful owned chassis number which was stolen from a repair shop in Queens New York and never found
Tractor manufacturer Ferruccio Lamborghini owned several Ferrari s
His frustration with Enzo Ferrari's response to his complaints about frequent clutch problems was key to his decision to make his own cars
He later hired ex-Ferrari engineers to design and develop them
