trainor temporarily relocated to orleans massachusetts with her family when she was in eighth grade before moving to north eastham massachusetts
she attended nauset regional high school where she studied guitar played trumpet and sang in a jazz band for three years
while a teenager trainor s parents nudged her to attend songwriting conventions and took her to venues at which production companies were searching for new artists and songwriters
she used logic studio to record and produce her compositions and later worked independently in a home studio built by her parents
trainor independently released three albums of material she had written recorded performed and produced between the ages and
these included her eponymous release and albums i ll sing with you and only
trainor introduced herself to former nrbq member al anderson at a music conference in nashville
impressed by her songwriting he referred her to his publisher carla wallace of music publishing firm big yellow dog music
though trainor had been offered a full scholarship to the berklee college of music she decided to pursue her songwriting career and signed with big yellow dog in
her ability to compose in a variety of genres influenced this decision
trainor was unsure about becoming a recording artist herself her father recalled she thought she was one of the chubby girls who would never be an artist
throughout she traveled to nashville new york city and los angeles where she wrote and helped produce country and pop songs
trainor recorded demos for other artists and her vocals were occasionally used on the final recordings
trainor found songwriting affinity with american songwriter kevin kadish whom she met in june due to their mutual love of pop music from the s and s
kadish had wished to create a s sounding record of doo wop inspired pop for three years but could not find any artist that was interested
he shared the idea with trainor after the two bonded over jimmy soul s single if you wanna be happy and they decided to create the extended play ep title with the same sound just for fun
they wrote the song all about that bass in july and had completed three songs before kadish started producing a rock album for the rest of the year
trainor and kadish pitched it to several record labels who said it would not be successful because of its retro styled composition and wanted to rerecord it using synthesizers which they refused
trainor performed the song on a ukulele for l a
reid the chairman of epic records who signed her with the label minutes later
trainor immediately began working on more songs with kadish as epic wanted her to record an entire album
the label briefly suggested that trainor work with other producers such as pharrell williams or timbaland but she insisted on continuing with kadish kevin s my guy
her artists and repertoire called kadish and said whatever you did on bass do it more times
don t bring in any more writers
don t bring in any other producers
whoever you used on that song while recording title trainor took a two month break because polyps were developing on her vocal cords
she recounted that kadish would calm her down they would dim the lights so she wouldn t get frustrated and had to use demo vocal takes trainor had recorded as guides
some of the album s material was recorded while trainor laid on a bed kadish made in the studio
in september she told billboard that it was pretty much done and she only had one more song left to complete
following the initial completion of title trainor and kadish had an additional day to work together and went into the studio
they wrote the song lips are movin within eight minutes
trainor told usa today in mid august it was done until we wrote this smash in eight minutes literally
i calculated it eight minutes
we were like we have to add this now
trainor wrote like i m gonna lose you with fellow songwriters justin weaver and caitlyn smith while working in music row and intended to pitch it to kelly clarkson
initially reluctant to include it on the album her manager and uncle convinced her otherwise
title s sound was inspired by trainor s love of throwback style records and music from the s and s
she wanted to continue the doo wop vibe of the album s preceding singles and simultaneously showcase influences of caribbean music rapping and fugees
trainor considered it distinctive and disparate from popular music at the time it s got the throwback in there but i snuck some reggae in there and clever fun lyrics and catchy melodies
according to her the writing on title reflects on the changes in her life and artistic process
trainor intended the album to be a source of empowerment for young people she wished she had written some of its songs before she attended high school
she gravitated towards discussing unemployed men she had dated in the past who made her pay for them and only texted her instead of taking her out
when time s nolan feeney asked trainor what she wanted listeners to hear on it she said i want to help myself
i want to make sure guys take me on a date and treat me right because i didn t do that in the past
i want to love my body more
i just hope younger girls love themselves more and younger people in general

title comprises three part harmonies handclaps finger clicks acoustic bass guitar bubblegum pop melodies and reggae and soca riddims
according to jim farber of new york daily news the album s caribbean music tracks were inspired by trainor s tobago born uncle and millie small s song my boy lollipop

trainor wrote the title track and dear future husband to correct issues with contemporary dating and hookup culture like women basing their self worth on social media likes and whether their partner replied to their texts
the former is a doo wop song with caribbean music influences and a ska inflected bridge on which she refuses to be friends with benefits and pushes her partner to define their relationship more clearly
the penultimate track of the standard edition is what if i a s style ballad with string instrumentation which contemplates the dangers of first date sex and is lyrically reminiscent of the shirelles s single will you still love me tomorrow
