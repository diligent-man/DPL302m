autism spectrum disorders asds are developmental disorders that begin in early childhood persist throughout adulthood and affect three crucial areas of development communication social interaction and restricted patterns of behavior
there are many conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders such as fragile x syndrome and epilepsy
in medicine and in psychiatry comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions co occurring with the primary one or the effect of such additional disorders
about of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders perhaps due to an overlap in genetic causes
distinguishing between asds and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of asds often overlap with symptoms of other disorders and the characteristics of asds make traditional diagnostic procedures difficult
anxiety disorders are common among children and adults with asd
symptoms are likely affected by age level of cognitive functioning degree of social impairment and asd specific difficulties
many anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are not commonly diagnosed in people with asd because such symptoms are better explained by asd itself and it is often difficult to tell whether symptoms such as compulsive checking are part of asd or a co occurring anxiety problem
the prevalence of anxiety disorders in children with asd has been reported to be anywhere between and the wide range is likely due to differences in the ways the studies were conducted
a systematic review summarized available evidence on interventions to reduce anxiety in school children with autism spectrum disorder
of the studies reviewed used a cognitive behavioral therapy cbt approach
the review found that cbt was moderately to highly effective at reducing anxiety in school children with autism spectrum disorder but that effects varied depending on whether they were reported by clinicians parents or self reported
treatments involving parents and one on one compared to group treatments were more effective
brain fog is a constellation of symptoms that include reduced cognition inability to concentrate and multitask as well as loss of short and long term memory
brain fog can be present in patients with autism spectrum disorder asd
its prevalence however remains unknown
bipolar disorder or manic depression is itself often claimed to be comorbid with a number of conditions including autism
autism includes some symptoms commonly found in mood and anxiety disorders
gastrointestinal symptoms are a common comorbidity in patients with autism spectrum disorders asd even though the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown
the most common gastrointestinal symptoms reported by proprietary tool developed and administered by mayer padua tillisch are abdominal pain constipation diarrhea and bloating reported in at least percent of participants
carbohydrate digestion and transport is impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder which is thought to be attributed to functional disturbances that cause increased intestinal permeability deficient enzyme activity of disaccharides increased secretin induced pancreatico biliary secretion and abnormal fecal flora clostridia taxa
altered gastrointestinal function accompanied by pain may induce feeding issues and increase perceived negative behaviors including self injury in individuals with autism
major depressive disorder has been shown by several studies to be one of the most common comorbid conditions in those with asd and is thought to develop and occur more in high functioning individuals during adolescence when the individual develops greater insight into their differences from others
in addition the presentation of depression in asds can depend on the level of cognitive functioning in the individual with lower functioning children displaying more behavioral issues and higher functioning children displaying more traditional depressive symptoms
the initial accounts of asperger syndrome and other diagnostic schemes include descriptions of developmental coordination disorder
children with asd may be delayed in acquiring motor skills that require motor dexterity such as bicycle riding or opening a jar and may appear awkward or uncomfortable in their own skin
they may be poorly coordinated or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture poor handwriting other hand dexterity impairments or problems with visual motor integration visual perceptual skills and conceptual learning
they may show problems with proprioception sensation of body position on measures of developmental coordination disorder balance tandem gait and finger thumb apposition
asd is also associated with epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder
one in four autistic children develops seizures often starting either in early childhood or adolescence
seizures caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain can produce a temporary loss of consciousness a blackout a body convulsion unusual movements or staring spells
sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever
an eeg can help confirm the seizure s presence
typically onset of epilepsy occurs before age five or during puberty and is more common in females and individuals who also have a comorbid intellectual disability
fragile x syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability
it was so named because one part of the x chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope
fragile x syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with asd
if one child has fragile x there is a chance that boys born to the same parents will have fragile x see mendelian genetics
other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome
gender dysphoria is a diagnosis given to transgender people who experience discomfort related to their gender identity
autistic people are more likely to experience gender dysphoria
around of gender identity clinic assessed individuals reported characteristics of asd
studies have confirmed a link between hereditary connective tissue disorders such as ehlers danlos syndromes eds and hypermobility spectrum disorder hsd with autism as a comorbidity and a co occurrence within the same families
several lines of evidence indicate abnormalities of folate metabolism in asd
these abnormalities can lead to a decrease in methyltetrahydrofolate production alter the production of folate metabolites and reduce folate transport across the blood brain barrier and in neurons
the most significant abnormalities of folate metabolism associated with asds may be autoantibodies to the alpha folate receptor fr
these autoantibodies have been associated with cerebral folate deficiency
autoantibodies can bind to fr and greatly impair its function
in one study reported that and of children with asd were positive for fr blocking and binding autoantibodies respectively
this high rate of anti fr autoantibody positivity was confirmed by ramaekers et al
who compared children with asd to non autistic controls
these controls were children who had a developmental delay but did not have asd
fr blocking autoantibodies were positive in of children with asd but only in of children without asd
many children with asd and cerebral folate deficiency have marked improvements in their clinical status when taking folinic acid
a series of five children with cerebral folate deficiency and low functioning autism with neurological deficits found a complete reduction of asd symptoms with the use of folinic acid in a child and substantial improvements in communication in two other children
an imbalance in glutathione dependent redox metabolism has been shown to be associated with autism spectrum disorders asd
glutathione synthesis and intracellular redox balance are related to folate metabolism and methylation metabolic pathways that have also been shown to be abnormal in asd
together these metabolic abnormalities define a distinct endophenotype of tsa closely associated with genetic epigenetic and mitochondrial abnormalities as well as environmental factors related to asd
glutathione is involved in neuroprotection against oxidative stress and neuroinflammation by improving the antioxidant stress system
in autistic children studies have shown that glutathione metabolism can be improved
subcutaneously by injection of methylcobalamin
oral folinic acid
a vitamin and mineral supplement that includes antioxidants coenzyme q and vitamins b
tetrahydrobiopterin
interestingly recent dbpc studies have shown that n acetyl cysteine a glutathione precursor supplement is effective in improving the symptoms and behaviors associated with asd
however glutathione was not measured in these studies
small medium and large dpbc trials and open small and medium sized clinical trials demonstrate that new treatments for children with asd for oxidative stress are associated with improvements in baseline symptoms of asd sleep gastrointestinal symptoms hyperactivity seizures and parental impression sensory and motor symptoms
these new treatments include n acetyl l cysteine methylcobalamin with and without oral folinic acid vitamin c and a vitamin and mineral supplement that includes antioxidants enzyme q and b vitamins
several other treatments that have antioxidant properties including carnosine have also been reported to significantly improve asd behaviors suggesting that treatment of oxidative stress could be beneficial for children with asd
many antioxidants can also help improve mitochondrial function suggesting that clinical improvements with antioxidants could occur through a reduction in oxidative stress and or an improvement in mitochondrial function
some of these treatments can have frequent serious side effects bronchospasm etc
the central player in bioenergetics is the mitochondrion
mitochondria produce about of cellular energy regulate cellular redox status produce ros maintain ca homeostasis synthesize and degrade high energy biochemical intermediates and regulate cell death through activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore mtptp
when they fail less and less energy is generated within the cell
cell injury and even cell death follow
if this process is repeated throughout the body whole organ systems begin to fail
mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can affect multiple organs with varying severity
symptoms may be acute or chronic with intermittent decompensation
neurological manifestations include encephalopathy stroke cognitive regression seizures cardiopathies cardiac conduction defects hypertensive heart disease cardiomyopathy etc diabetes visual and hearing loss organ failure neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy
the prevalence estimates of mitochondrial disease and dysfunction across studies ranging from about to
this may be in part due to the unclear distinction between mitochondrial disease and dysfunction
mitochondrial diseases are difficult to diagnose and have become better known and detected
studies indicating the highest rates of mitochondrial diagnosis are usually the most recent
some drugs are toxic to mitochondria
these can trigger or aggravate dysfunctions or mitochondrial diseases
antiepileptics valproic acid also used in various other indications and phenytoin are the most toxic
phenobarbital carbamazepine oxcarbazepine ethosuximide zonisamide topiramate gabapentin and vigabatrin are also
other types of drugs corticosteroids such as cortisone isotretinoin accutane and other vitamin a derivatives barbiturates certain antibiotics propofol volatile anesthetics non depolarizing muscle relaxants some local anesthetics statins fibrates glitazones beta blockers biguanides amiodarone some chemotherapies some neuroleptics nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and various other drugs
asd is also associated with neurofibromatosis type i nf
nf is a complex multi system human disorder caused by the mutation of a gene on chromosome that is responsible for production of a protein called neurofibromin which is needed for normal function in many human cell types
nf causes tumors along the nervous system which can grow anywhere on the body
nf is one of the most common genetic disorders and is not limited to any person s race or sex
nf is an autosomal dominant disorder which means that mutation or deletion of one copy or allele of the nf gene is sufficient for the development of nf although presentation varies widely and is often different even between relatives affected by nf
the role of the immune system and neuroinflammation in the development of autism is controversial
until recently there was scant evidence supporting immune hypotheses but research into the role of immune response and neuroinflammation may have important clinical and therapeutic implications
the exact role of heightened immune response in the central nervous system cns of patients with autism is uncertain but may be a primary factor in triggering and sustaining many of the comorbid conditions associated with autism
recent studies indicate the presence of heightened neuroimmune activity in both the brain tissue and the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with autism supporting the view that heightened immune response may be an essential factor in the onset of autistic symptoms
a review also found evidence of microglial activation and increased cytokine production in postmortem brain samples from people with autism
the prevalence of peripheral neuropathies would be significantly increased in asd
peripheral neuropathies may be asymptomatic
peripheral neuropathy is a common manifestation of mitochondrial diseases and polyneuropathies would be relatively common
neuropathies could also be caused by other features of asd
obsessive compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent obsessive thoughts or compulsive acts
about of individuals with autism spectrum disorders also have ocd
obsessive compulsive personality disorder ocpd is a cluster c personality disorder characterized by a general pattern of excessive concern with orderliness perfectionism attention to details mental and interpersonal control and a need for control over one s environment which interferes with personal flexibility openness to experience and efficiency as well as interfering with relationships
there are considerable similarities and overlap between autism and ocpd such as list making inflexible adherence to rules and obsessive aspects of routines though the latter may be distinguished from ocpd especially regarding affective behaviors bad social skills difficulties with theory of mind and intense intellectual interests e g
an ability to recall every aspect of a hobby
a study involving adult autistic people found that of those diagnosed with autism met the diagnostic requirements for a co morbid ocpd diagnosis
childhood onset schizophrenia is preceded by childhood autistic spectrum disorders in almost half of cases and an increasing number of similarities are being discovered between the two disorders
studies have also found that the presence of psychosis in adulthood is significantly higher in those with autism spectrum disorders especially those with pdd nos than in the general population
this psychosis generally occurs in an unusual way with most individuals with asd experiencing a highly atypical collection of symptoms
recent studies have also found that the core asd symptoms also generally present in a slightly different way during the childhood of the individuals that will later become psychotic long before the actual psychosis develops
schizoid personality disorder spd is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle secretiveness emotional coldness detachment and apathy
other associated features include stilted speech a lack of deriving enjoyment from most if not all activities feeling as though one is an observer rather than a participant in life an inability to tolerate emotional expectations of others apparent indifference when praised or criticised a degree of asexuality and idiosyncratic moral or political beliefs
symptoms typically start in late childhood or adolescence
several studies have reported an overlap confusion or comorbidity with the autism spectrum disorder asperger syndrome
asperger syndrome had traditionally been called schizoid disorder of childhood and eugen bleuler coined both the terms autism and schizoid to describe withdrawal to an internal fantasy against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance
in a study of a sample of young adults with asperger syndrome it was found that of them also met criteria for spd the highest comorbidity out of any personality disorder in the sample the other comorbidities were for obsessive compulsive personality disorder for avoidant personality disorder and one female with schizotypal personality disorder
additionally twice as many men with asperger syndrome met criteria for spd than women
while of the whole sample were unemployed with no occupation this rose to for the asperger s and spd comorbid group
although the cause for this comorbidity is not yet certain genetic evidence for a spectrum between cluster a personality disorders schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders has been found
tantam suggested that asperger syndrome may confer an increased risk of developing spd
in the same study it was noted that the dsm may complicate diagnosis of spd by requiring the exclusion of a pervasive developmental disorder pdd before establishing a diagnosis of spd
the study found that social interaction stereotyped behaviours and specific interests were more severe in the individuals with asperger syndrome also fulfilling spd criteria against the notion that social interaction skills are unimpaired in spd
the authors believe that substantial subgroup of people with autism spectrum disorder or pdd have clear schizoid traits and correspond largely to the loners in lorna wing s classification the autism spectrum lancet described by sula wolff
unusual responses to sensory stimuli are more common and prominent in individuals with autism and sensory abnormalities are commonly recognized as diagnostic criteria in autism spectrum disorder asd as reported in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm v although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders
sensory processing disorder is comorbid with asd with comorbidity rates of
with or without meeting the standards of spd about of asd individuals have some type of atypical sensory experiences described as both hyper and hypo reactivity
the prevalence of reported unusual sensory behaviors that effect functioning in everyday life is also higher ranging from to depending on factors such as age iq and the control group used
several studies have reported associated motor problems that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking asd is not associated with severe motor disturbances
many with asd often find it uncomfortable to sit or stand in a way which neurotypical people will find ordinary and may stand in an awkward position such as with both feet together supinating sitting cross legged or with one foot on top of the other or simply having an awkward gait
however despite evidently occurring more often in people with asd all evidence is anecdotal and unresearched at this point
it has been observed by some psychologists that there is commonality to the way in which these awkward positions may manifest
reduced nmda receptor function has been linked to reduced social interactions locomotor hyperactivity self injury pre impulse inhibition ppi deficits and sensory hypersensitivity among others
results suggest that nmda dysregulation could contribute to core asd symptoms
sleep disorders are commonly reported by parents of individuals with asds including late sleep onset early morning awakening and poor sleep maintenance sleep disturbances are present in of individuals with asd
unlike general pediatric insomnia which has its roots in behavior sleep disorders in individuals with asd are comorbid with other neurobiological medical and psychiatric issues
if not addressed severe sleep disorders can exacerbate asd behaviors such as self injury however there are no food and drug administration approved pharmacological treatments for pediatric insomnia at this time
studies have found abnormalities in the physiology of melatonin and circadian rhythm in people with autism spectrum disorders asd
these physiological abnormalities include lower concentrations of melatonin or melatonin metabolites in asds compared to controls
some evidence suggests that melatonin supplements improve sleep patterns in children with autism but robust high quality studies are overall lacking
according to one study of people who are autistic would be affected by tinnitus which is much higher than in the general population
the prevalence of tourette syndrome among individuals who are autistic is estimated to be higher than the to prevalence for the general population
several hypotheses for this association have been advanced including common genetic factors and dopamine glutamate or serotonin abnormalities
tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs
it has a consistently strong association with the autism spectrum
one to four percent of autistic people also have tuberous sclerosis
studies have reported that between and of individuals with tuberous sclerosis meet the diagnostic criteria for autism with an even higher proportion showing features of a broader pervasive developmental disorder
vitamin deficiencies are more common in autism spectrum disorders than in the general population
vitamin d vitamin d deficiency was concerned in a german study of hospitalized autistic population
of the entire asd group in the study was severely deficient which is much higher than in the general population
other studies also show a higher rate of vitamin d deficiencies in asds
vitamine b the researchers found that overall b levels in the brain tissue of autistic children were three times lower than those of the brain tissue of children not affected by asd
this lower than normal b profile persisted throughout life in the brain tissues of patients with autism
these deficiencies are not visible by conventional blood sampling
as for the classic deficiency of vitamin b it would affect up to of the population its prevalence has not yet been studied in autism spectrum disorders
vitamin b deficiency is one of the most serious
vitamin b folic acid studies have been conducted regarding folic acid supplementation in autism in children
the results showed that folic acid supplementation significantly improved certain symptoms of autism such as sociability verbal preverbal cognitive language receptive language and emotional expression and communication
in addition this treatment improved the concentrations of folic acid homocysteine and redox metabolism of standardized glutathione
vitamin a vitamin a can induce mitochondrial dysfunction
according to a non specific study on asd vitamin a and its derivatives retinoids are micronutrients necessary for the human diet in order to maintain several cellular functions of human development in adulthood as well as during aging although it is either an essential micronutrient used in clinical applications vitamin a has several toxic effects on the redox environment and mitochondrial function
a decline in the quality of life and an increase in the mortality rate among users of vitamin a supplements have been reported
although the exact mechanism by which vitamin a causes its deleterious effects is not yet clear vitamin a and its derivatives retinoids disrupt mitochondrial function by a mechanism that is not fully understood
zinc zinc deficiency incidence rates in children aged to to and to years were estimated at and for boys and at and among girls
magnesium incidence rates of magnesium deficiency in children aged to to and to years were estimated at and for boys and at and among girls
calcium incidence rates of calcium deficiency in children aged to to years and to years were estimated at and for boys and at and among girls it has been found that special diets that are inappropriate for children with asd usually result in excessive amounts of certain nutrients and persistent vitamin deficiencies
phobias and other psychopathological disorders have often been described along with asd but this has not been assessed systematically
the fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from to
this wide variation illustrates the difficulty of assessing intelligence in austistic indificiuals
for example a british study of autistic children found about with intelligence in the normal range iq above with a mild to moderate intellectual disability and about with a severe to profound intellectual disability iq below
for asd other than autism the association is much weaker the same study reported typical levels of intelligence in about of children with pdd nos
estimates are that of individuals with asd have some degree of an intellectual disability with females more likely to be in severe range of an intellectual disability
learning disabilities are also highly comorbid in individuals with an asd
approximately of individuals with an asd also have some degree of learning disability although the types of learning disability vary depending on the specific strengths and weaknesses of the individual
a review questioned the common assumption that most children with autism have an intellectual disability
it is possible that the association between an intellectual disability and autism is not because they usually have common causes but because the presence of both makes it more likely that both will be diagnosed
the cdc states that based on information from reporting states of people with autism have above iq
previously the diagnosis manual dsm iv did not allow the co diagnosis of asd and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd
however following years of clinical research the most recent publication dsm in removed this prohibition of co morbidity
thus individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also have a diagnosis of adhd with the modifiers of inattentive hyperactive combined type or not otherwise specified
clinically significant symptoms of these two conditions commonly co occur and children with both sets of symptoms may respond poorly to standard adhd treatments
individuals with autism spectrum disorder may benefit from additional types of medications
autism and working memory
