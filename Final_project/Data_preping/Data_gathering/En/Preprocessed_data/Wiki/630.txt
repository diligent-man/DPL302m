charles forbes ren de montalembert french pronunciation a l f b ne d m tal b april in london march in paris was a french publicist historian and count of montalembert deux s vres and a prominent representative of liberal catholicism
charles forbes ren de montalembert who was born on april was of french and scots ancestry
his father marc ren belonged to the family of angoumois which could trace its descent back to the th century while charters show the history of the house even two centuries earlier
for several generations the family had been distinguished both in the army and in the field of science
montalembert senior had fought under cond and subsequently served in the british army
he married eliza rose forbes whose father james forbes belonged to a very old scottish protestant family
charles their eldest son was born in london
at the french restoration of marc ren returned to france was raised to the peerage in and became ambassador to sweden where charles completed his education in
montalembert s early years were spent in england where he was largely raised by his grandfather who although a protestant encouraged him to follow the religion of his father
in he attended the lyc e bourbon and at the coll ge sainte barbe in paris
in he was a contributor to the review le correspondant
in september and october he travelled in ireland where he met daniel o connell he was thinking of assisting the cause for which o connell was struggling by writing a history of ireland when he learned that the house of commons had passed the irish emancipation act
charles de montalembert was under twenty five at his father s death in and therefore too young to take his seat as a peer but he retained other rights
combined with his literary and intellectual activity this made him a person of some importance
he was a liberal in the english sense and disagreed with the new regime on only the religious question
he would have approved of the policy of the golden mean represented by louis philippe
he wished to see the church free from state control and attacked the monopoly of public instruction by which the monarchy fortified its position
this latter scheme first brought montalembert to public attention when he was formally charged with unlicensed teaching
he claimed the right of trial by his peers and made a notable defence with a deliberate intention of protest in
on the other hand he thought that the church should not obstinately oppose new ideas
he had eagerly entered into the plans of his friends lamennais and lacordaire and he collaborated with them in the newspaper l avenir the future
he especially distinguished himself in l avenir by his campaigns in favour of freedom for ireland and poland and for these he received the congratulations of victor hugo and alfred de vigny
in he thought of going to poland and joining the insurgents there
he was instrumental in setting up the polish library in paris and its associated literary society for the great emigration into france
the ultramontane party was roused by the boldness of montalembert and his two friends who then left for rome
they failed to win any mitigation of the measures which the roman curia took against l avenir
its doctrines were condemned in two encyclicals mirari vos in and singulari nos in and montalembert submitted
in he took his seat in the chamber of peers and his competence soon made him famous
he clung to his early liberalism and in saw the end of a government towards which he had always been hostile
in he was elected to the chamber of deputies
he was at first inclined to support napoleon iii but was soon alienated by his policy
montalembert remained in the chamber until when he was obliged to retire to private life
he was still recognised as a formidable opponent of the empire
meanwhile his liberal ideas had made him some irreconcilable enemies among the ultramontanists
louis veuillot in his paper l univers religieux opposed him
in montalembert answered them by reviving a review which had for some time ceased publication le correspondant
this he used to fight the party of veuillot and the far left liberals of the revue des deux mondes
at a noted catholic congress in malines belgium in montalembert gave two long addresses on catholic liberalism
he was also a staunch supporter of the independence of education from the state
i do not want to be constrained by the state to believe what it believes to be true because the state is not the judge of truth
however the state is bound to protect me in the practice of the truth that i choose that is to say the exercise of the religion that i profess this is what constitutes religious freedom in the modern state which the free state is bound to respect and guarantee not only for each citizen in particular but for groups of citizens joined together to profess and propagate their belief that is to say for corporation for associations and for churches he took great interest in the d buts of the liberal empire
he severed his connection with p re hyacinthe loyson as he had with lamennais and made the submission expected of him to the council
it was his last fall
montalembert became increasingly isolated politically for his support of religious freedom in education and by the church for his liberal views
charles de montalembert died in
montalembert married mlle de merode daughter of f lix de m rode
his daughter married the vicomte de meaux a roman catholic statesman and distinguished writer
he was thus the brother in law of belgian prelate and papal statesman xavier de m rode
montalembert was a close friend of edwin wyndham quin rd earl of dunraven and mount earl with whom he toured scotland in staying at dunraven castle on his return journey
the viscount travelled with montalembert to switzerland the following year and stayed at ma che doubs montalembert s country property on his return
in addition to being an eloquent orator montalembert wrote in a style at once picturesque fiery and polished
he was an ardent student of the middle ages but his medieval enthusiasm was strongly tinctured with religious sentiments
his first historical work la vie de ste elisabeth de hongrie is not so much a history as a religious manifesto which did much to restore the position of hagiography
it met with great success but montalembert was not elected a member of the acad mie fran aise until after the fall of the july monarchy
from this time he gave much of his attention to a great work on monasticism in the west
he was at first attracted by the figure of st
bernard and devoted one volume to him
he later withdrew it on the advice of his friend dupanloup and the entire printing was destroyed
he then enlarged his original plan and published the first volumes of his moines d occident an eloquent work which was received with much admiration in those circles where language was more appreciated than learning
the work unfinished at the time of the author s death was completed later from some long fragments found among his papers
volumes vi and vii appeared in
like chateaubriand he kept a close now published record of acquaintances invitations necrology
