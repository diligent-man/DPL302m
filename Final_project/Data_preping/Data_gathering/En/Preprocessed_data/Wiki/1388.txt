medroxalol is a vasodilator beta blocker also classified as a mixed receptor blocker as it blocks both alpha and beta receptors
for the first step salicylamide is the subject of a friedel crafts acetylation and then the aromatic methylketone is halogenated
in the usual manner
the bromide in is then displaced by the nitrogen in n benzyl methylenedioxyphenyl butylamine which is itself prepared by reductive amination on the corresponding ketone
the product of the last step is catalytically hydrogenated
this serves the dual purpose both of reducing the ketone and removing the benzyl protecting group affording the product medroxalol
note that a benzyl protecting group is not necessarily used
labetalol
