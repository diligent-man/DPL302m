Inflammatory bowel disease IBD is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis being the principal types
Crohn's disease affects the small intestine and large intestine as well as the mouth esophagus stomach and the anus whereas ulcerative colitis primarily affects the colon and the rectum
IBD also occurs in dogs and is thought to arise from a combination of host genetics intestinal microenvironment environmental components and the immune system
There is an ongoing discussion however that the term chronic enteropathy might be better to use than inflammatory bowel disease in dogs because it differs from IBD in humans in how the dogs respond to treatment
For example many dogs respond to only dietary changes compared to humans with IBD who often need immunosuppressive treatment
Some dogs may also need immunosuppressant or antibiotic treatment when dietary changes are not enough
After having excluded other diseases that can lead to vomiting diarrhea and abdominal pain in dogs intestinal biopsies are often performed to investigate what kind of inflammation is occurring lymphoplasmacytic eosinophilic or granulomatous
In dogs low levels of cobalamin in the blood have been shown to be a risk factor for negative outcome
In spite of Crohn's and UC being very different diseases both may present with any of the following symptoms abdominal pain diarrhea rectal bleeding severe internal crampsmuscle spasms in the region of the pelvis and weight loss
Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease
Associated complaints or diseases include arthritis pyoderma gangrenosum primary sclerosing cholangitis and non-thyroidal illness syndrome NTIS
Associations with deep vein thrombosis DVT and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia BOOP have also been reported
Diagnosis is generally by assessment of inflammatory markers in stool followed by colonoscopy with biopsy of pathological lesions
IBD is a complex disease which arises as a result of the interaction of environmental and genetic factors leading to immunological responses and inflammation in the intestine
People living with IBD are very interested in diet but little is known about the impact of diet on these patients
Recent reviews underlined the important role of nutritional counselling in IBD patients
Patients should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation
A study found that diets with increased intake of fruits and vegetables reduction of processed meats and refined carbohydrates and preference of water for hydration were associated with lower risk of active symptoms with IBD although increased intake of fruits and vegetables alone did not reduce risk of symptoms with Crohn's disease
Dietary patterns are associated with a risk for ulcerative colitis
In particular subjects who were in the highest tertile of the healthy dietary pattern had a lower risk of ulcerative colitis
Gluten sensitivity is common in IBD and associated with having flareups
Gluten sensitivity was reported in and of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients respectively
A diet high in protein particularly animal protein andor high in sugar may be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses
As a result of microbial symbiosis and immunity alterations in the gut microbiome may contribute to inflammatory gut diseases
IBD-affected individuals have been found to have percent reduced biodiversity of commensal bacteria such as decreases in Bacillota namely Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidota
Further evidence of the role of gut flora in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease is that IBD-affected individuals are more likely to have been prescribed antibiotics in the year period before their diagnosis than unaffected individuals
The enteral bacteria can be altered by environmental factors such as concentrated milk fats a common ingredient of processed foods and confectionery or oral medications such as antibiotics and oral iron preparations
The mucosal microbiota in the large intestine of IBD patients with active inflammation was found to be associated with pro-inflammatory changes to the host epigenome
However large international studies have failed to identify a single microbial biomarker of IBD indicating it's not driven by any single micro-organism
Loss of integrity of the intestinal epithelium plays a key pathogenic role in IBD
Dysfunction of the innate immune system as a result of abnormal signaling through immune receptors called toll-like receptors TLRs—which activates an immune response to molecules that are broadly shared by multiple pathogens—contributes to acute and chronic inflammatory processes in IBD colitis and associated cancer
Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota are an important environmental factor in the development of IBD
Detrimental changes in the intestinal microbiota induce an inappropriate uncontrolled immune response that results in damage to the intestinal epithelium
Breaches in this critical barrier the intestinal epithelium allow further infiltration of microbiota that in turn elicit further immune responses
IBD is a multifactorial disease that is nonetheless driven in part by an exaggerated immune response to gut microbiota that causes defects in epithelial barrier function
reviewed evidence from numerous studies indicating that oxidative stress and DNA damage likely have a role in the pathophysiology of IBD
Oxidative DNA damage as measured by -OHdG levels was found to be significantly increased in patients with IBD compared to control patients and in inflamed mucosa compared with non-inflamed mucosa
A genetic component to IBD has been recognized for over a century
Research that has contributed to understanding of the genetics include studies of ethnic groups eg Ashkenazi Jews Irish familial clustering epidemiological studies and twin studies
With the advent of molecular genetics understanding of the genetic basis has expanded considerably particularly in the past decade
The first gene linked to IBD was NOD in
Genome-wide association studies have since added to understanding of the genomics and pathogenesis of the disease
More than single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs or snips are now known to be associated with susceptibility to IBD
One of the largest genetic studies of IBD was published in
The analysis explained more of the variance in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than previously reported
The results suggested that commensal microbiota are altered in such a way that they act as pathogens in inflammatory bowel diseases
Other studies show that mutations in IBD-associated genes might interfere with the cellular activity and interactions with the microbiome that promote normal immune responses
Many studies identified that microRNAs dysregulation involved in IBD and to promote colorectal cancer
By single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was launched by a small consortium using IBD patient biopsy material in a search for therapeutic targets
The diagnosis is usually confirmed by biopsies on colonoscopy
Fecal calprotectin is useful as an initial investigation which may suggest the possibility of IBD as this test is sensitive but not specific for IBD
Other diseases may cause an increased excretion of fecal calprotectin such as infectious diarrhea untreated coeliac disease necrotizing enterocolitis intestinal cystic fibrosis and neoplastic pediatric tumor cells
Conditions with similar symptoms as Crohn's disease includes intestinal tuberculosis Behet's disease ulcerative colitis nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy irritable bowel syndrome and coeliac disease
Conditions with similar symptoms as ulcerative colitis includes acute self-limiting colitis amebic colitis schistosomiasis Crohn's disease colon cancer irritable bowel syndrome intestinal tuberculosis and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy
Liver function tests are often elevated in inflammatory bowel disease and are often mild and generally return spontaneously to normal levels
The most relevant mechanisms of elevated liver functions tests in IBD are drug-induced hepatotoxicity and fatty liver
The chief types of inflammatory bowel disease are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis UC
Inflammatory bowel diseases fall into the class of autoimmune diseases in which the body's own immune system attacks elements of the digestive system
Accounting for fewer cases are other forms of IBD which are not always classified as typical IBD
Microscopic colitis subdivided into collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis
Indeterminate colitisNo disease specific markers are currently known in the blood enabling the reliable separation of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients
The way doctors can tell the difference between Crohn's disease and UC is the location and nature of the inflammatory changes
Crohn's can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus skip lesions although a majority of the cases start in the terminal ileum
Ulcerative colitis in contrast is restricted to the colon and the rectum
Microscopically ulcerative colitis is restricted to the mucosa epithelial lining of the gut while Crohn's disease affects the full thickness of the bowel wall transmural lesions
Lastly Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis present with extra-intestinal manifestations such as liver problems arthritis skin manifestations and eye problems in different proportions
In of cases a definitive diagnosis neither of Crohn's disease nor of ulcerative colitis can be made because of idiosyncrasies in the presentation
In this case a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis may be made
Although a recognised definition not all centres refer to this
CD and UC are chronic inflammatory diseases and are not medically curable
However ulcerative colitis can in most cases be cured by proctocolectomy although this may not eliminate extra-intestinal symptoms
An ileostomy will collect feces in a bag
Alternatively a pouch can be created from the small intestine this serves as the rectum and prevents the need for a permanent ileostomy
Between one-quarter and one-half of patients with ileo-anal pouches do have to manage occasional or chronic pouchitis
Surgery cannot cure Crohn's disease but may be needed to treat complications such as abscesses strictures or fistulae
Severe cases may require surgery such as bowel resection strictureplasty or a temporary or permanent colostomy or ileostomy
In Crohn's disease surgery involves removing the worst inflamed segments of the intestine and connecting the healthy regions but unfortunately it does not cure Crohn's or eliminate the disease
At some point after the first surgery Crohn's disease can recur in the healthy parts of the intestine usually at the resection site
For example if a patient with Crohn's disease has an ileocecal anastomosis in which the caecum and terminal ileum are removed and the ileum is joined to the ascending colon their Crohn's will nearly always flare-up near the anastomosis or in the rest of the ascending colon
Medical treatment of IBD is individualised to each patient
The choice of which drugs to use and by which route to administer them oral rectal injection infusion depends on factors including the type distribution and severity of the patient's disease as well as other historical and biochemical prognostic factors and patient preferences
For example mesalazine is more useful in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease
Generally depending on the level of severity IBD may require immunosuppression to control the symptoms with drugs such as prednisone tumor necrosis factor inhibitors TNF inhibitors azathioprine methotrexate or -mercaptopurine
Steroids such as the glucocorticoid prednisone are frequently used to control disease flares and were once acceptable as a maintenance drug
Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease especially the TNF inhibitors are used in people with more severe or resistant Crohn's disease and sometimes in ulcerative colitis
Treatment is usually started by administering drugs with high anti-inflammatory effects such as prednisone
Once the inflammation is successfully controlled another drug to keep the disease in remission such as mesalazine in UC is the main treatment
If further treatment is required a combination of an immunosuppressive drug such as azathioprine with mesalazine which may also have an anti-inflammatory effect may be needed depending on the patient
Controlled release budesonide is used for mild ileal Crohn's disease
Exclusive enteral nutrition is a first-line therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease with weaker data in adults
Evidence supporting exclusive enteral nutrition in ulcerative colitis is lacking
Nutritional deficiencies play a prominent role in IBD
Malabsorption diarrhea and GI blood loss are common features of IBD
Deficiencies of B vitamins fat-soluble vitamins essential fatty acids and key minerals such as magnesium zinc and selenium are extremely common and benefit from replacement therapy
Dietary interventions including certain exclusion diets like the specific carbohydrate diet SCD can be beneficial for symptom management
Dietary fiber interventions such as psyillium supplementation a mixture of soluble and insoluble fibers may relieve symptoms as well as inducemaintain remission by altering the microbiome composition of the GI tract thereby improving regulation of immune function reducing inflammation and helping to restore the intestinal mucosal lining
Anaemia is commonly present in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
Due to raised levels of inflammatory cytokines which lead to the increased expression of hepcidin parenteral iron is the preferred treatment option as it bypasses the gastrointestinal system has lower incidence of adverse events and enables quicker treatment
Hepcidin itself is also an anti-inflammatory agent
In the murine model very low levels of iron restrict hepcidin synthesis worsening the inflammation that is present
Enteral nutrition has been found to be efficient to improve hemoglobin level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease especially combined with erythropoietin
There is preliminary evidence of an infectious contribution to inflammatory bowel disease in some patients that may benefit from antibiotic therapy such as with rifaximin
The evidence for a benefit of rifaximin is mostly limited to Crohn's disease with less convincing evidence supporting use in ulcerative colitis
Fecal microbiota transplant is a relatively new treatment option for IBD which has attracted attention since
Some preliminary studies have suggested benefits similar to those in Clostridium difficile infection but a review of use in IBD shows that FMT is safe but of variable efficacy
A review stated that more randomized controlled trials were needed
Complementary and alternative medicine approaches have been used in inflammatory bowel disorders
Evidence from controlled studies of these therapies has been reviewed risk of bias was quite heterogeneous
The best supportive evidence was found for herbal therapy with Plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy wormwood in CD mindbody therapy and self-intervention in UC and acupuncture in UC and CD
Stem cell therapy is undergoing research as a possible treatment for IBD
A review of studies suggests a promising role although there are substantial challenges including cost and characterization of effects which limit the current use in clinical practice
Currently there is no evidence to recommend psychological treatment such as psychotherapy stress management and patient's education to all adults with IBD in general
These treatments had no effect on quality of life emotional well-being and disease activity
The need for these approaches should be individually assessed and further researched to identify subgroups and determine type of therapy that may benefit individuals with IBD
In adolescents population such treatments may be beneficial on quality of life and depression although only short-term effects have been found which also imposes the need for further research
Crohn's and Colitis Australia the peak body for IBD in Australia where prevalence is one of the highest in the world reviewed the quality of care for patients admitted to Australian hospitals
They found that only one hospital met accepted standards for multidisciplinary care but that care was improved with the availability of even minimal specialised services
While IBD can limit quality of life because of pain vomiting and diarrhea it is rarely fatal on its own
Fatalities due to complications such as toxic megacolon bowel perforation and surgical complications are also rare
Fatigue is a common symptom of IBD and can be a burden
Around one-third of individuals with IBD experience persistent gastrointestinal symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome IBS in the absence of objective evidence of disease activity
Despite enduring the side-effects of long-term therapies this cohort has a quality of life that is not significantly different to that of individuals with uncontrolled objectively active disease and escalation of therapy to biological agents is typically ineffective in resolving their symptoms
The cause of these IBS-like symptoms is unclear but it has been suggested that changes in the gut-brain axis epithelial barrier dysfunction and the gut flora may be partially responsible
While patients of IBD do have an increased risk of colorectal cancer this is usually caught much earlier than the general population in routine surveillance of the colon by colonoscopy and therefore patients are much more likely to survive
New evidence suggests that patients with IBD may have an elevated risk of endothelial dysfunction and coronary artery disease
The goal of treatment is toward achieving remission after which the patient is usually switched to a lighter drug with fewer potential side effects
Every so often an acute resurgence of the original symptoms may appear this is known as a flare-up
Depending on the circumstances it may go away on its own or require medication
The time between flare-ups may be anywhere from weeks to years and varies wildly between patients a few have never experienced a flare-up
Life with IBD can be challenging however many with the conditionlead relatively normal lives
IBD carries a psychological burden due to stigmatization of being diagnosed leading to high levels of anxiety depression and a general reduction in the quality of life
Although living with IBD can be difficult there are numerous resources available to help families navigate the ins and out of IBD such as the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America CCFA
IBD resulted in a global total of deaths in and deaths in
The increased incidence of IBD since World War has been correlated to the increase in meat consumption worldwide supporting the claim that animal protein intake is associated with IBD
However there are many environmental risk factors that have been linked to the increased and decreased risk of IBD such as smoking air pollution and greenspace urbanization and Westernization
Inflammatory bowel diseases are increasing in Europe
Incidence and prevalence of IBD has risen steadily for the last decades in Asia which could be related changes in diet and other environmental factors
Around of people in the UK have IBD
Similarly around of people in Canada have IBD with that number expected to rise to by
The following treatment strategies are not used routinely but appear promising in some forms of inflammatory bowel disease
Initial reports suggest that helminthic therapy may not only prevent but even control IBD a drink with roughly ova of the Trichuris suis helminth taken twice monthly decreased symptoms markedly in many patients
It is even speculated that an effective immunization procedure could be developed—by ingesting the cocktail at an early age
Prebiotics and probiotics are focusing increasing interest as treatments for IBD
Currently there is evidence to support the use of certain probiotics in addition to standard treatments in people with ulcerative colitis but there is no sufficient data to recommend probiotics in people with Crohn's disease
Further research is required to identify specific probiotic strains or their combinations and prebiotic substances for therapies of intestinal inflammation
Currently the probiotic strain frequency dose and duration of the probiotic therapy are not established
In severely ill people with IBD there is a risk of the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia which can cause serious adverse health consequences
Live bacteria might not be essential because of beneficial effects of probiotics seems to be mediated by their DNA and by secreted soluble factors and their therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic administration rather than oral administration
In New Scientist published a joint study by Bristol University and the University of Bath on the apparent healing power of cannabis on IBD
Reports that cannabis eased IBD symptoms indicated the possible existence of cannabinoid receptors in the intestinal lining which respond to molecules in the plant-derived chemicals
CB cannabinoid receptors which are known to be present in the brain exist in the endothelial cells which line the gut it is thought that they are involved in repairing the lining of the gut when damaged
The team deliberately damaged the cells to cause inflammation of the gut lining and then added synthetically produced cannabinoids the result was that gut started to heal the broken cells were repaired and brought back closer together to mend the tears
It is believed that in a healthy gut natural endogenous cannabinoids are released from endothelial cells when they are injured which then bind to the CB receptors
The process appears to set off a wound-healing reaction and when people use cannabis the cannabinoids bind to these receptors in the same way
Previous studies have shown that CB receptors located on the nerve cells in the gut respond to cannabinoids by slowing gut motility therefore reducing the painful muscle contractions associated with diarrhea
CB another cannabinoid receptor predominantly expressed by immune cells was detected in the gut of people with IBD at a higher concentration
These receptors which also respond to chemicals in cannabis appear to be associated with apoptosis programmed cell death and may have a role in suppressing the overactive immune system and reducing inflammation by mopping up excess cells
Activation of the endocannabinoid system was found efficient in ameliorating colitis and increasing the survival rate of mice and reducing remote organ changes induced by colitis further suggest that modulation of this system is a potential therapeutic approach for IBDs and the associated remote organ lesions
Alicaforsen is a first generation antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM- messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-
ICAM- propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes white blood cells into inflamed tissue
Increased expression of ICAM- has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of people with ulcerative colitis pouchitis and Crohn's where ICAM- over production correlated with disease activity
This suggests that ICAM- is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of these diseases
Cannabinoid CB receptor agonists are found to decrease the induction of ICAM- and VCAM- surface expression in human brain tissues and primary human brain endothelial cells BMVEC exposed to various pro-inflammatory mediators
In an alliance among the Broad Institute Amgen and Massachusetts General Hospital formed with the intention to collect and analyze patient DNA samples to identify and further validate genetic targets
In a meta-analysis on IBD patients and controls IBD was significantly associated with having higher odds of vitamin D deficiency
Gram-positive bacteria present in the lumen could be associated with extending the time of relapse for ulcerative colitis
Bidirectional pathways between depression and IBD have been suggested and psychological processes have been demonstrated to influence self-perceived physical and psychological health over time
IBD-disease activity may impact quality of life and over time may significantly affect individual's mental well-being which may be related to the increased risk to develop anxiety andor depression
On the other hand psychological distress may also influence IBD activity
Higher rates of anxiety and depression are observed among those with IBD compared to healthy individuals which correlated with disease severity
Moreover anxiety and depression rates increase during active disease compared with inactive phases
