The Rothschild family ˈʁoːtʃɪlt is a wealthy Ashkenazi Jewish family originally from Frankfurt that rose to prominence with Mayer Amschel Rothschild a court factor to the German Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel in the Free City of Frankfurt Holy Roman Empire who established his banking business in the s
Unlike most previous court factors Rothschild managed to bequeath his wealth and established an international banking family through his five sons who established businesses in London Paris Frankfurt Vienna and Naples
The family was elevated to noble rank in the Holy Roman Empire and the United Kingdom
The family's documented history starts in th century Frankfurt its name is derived from the family house Rothschild built by Isaak Elchanan Bacharach in Frankfurt in
During the th century the Rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world as well as in modern world history
The family's wealth declined over the th century and was divided among many descendants
Today their interests cover a diverse range of fields including financial services real estate mining energy agriculture winemaking and nonprofits
Many examples of the family's rural architecture exist across northwestern Europe
The Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories many of which have antisemitic origins
The first member of the family who was known to use the name Rothschild was Izaak Elchanan Rothschild born in
The name is derived from the German zum rothen Schild with the old spelling th meaning at the red shield in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations in those days houses were designated not by numbers but by signs displaying different symbols or colours
A red shield can still be seen at the centre of the Rothschild coat of arms
The family's ascent to international prominence began in with the birth of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in Frankfurt am Main Germany
He was the son of Amschel Moses Rothschild born circa a money changer who had traded with the Prince of Hesse
Born in the Judengasse the ghetto of Frankfurt Mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main European financial centres to conduct business
The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild in a reference to Psalm Like arrows in the hands of a warrior so are the children of one's youth The family motto appears below the shield Concordia Integritas Industria Unity Integrity Industry
Paul Johnson writes The Rothschilds are elusive
There is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate
Libraries of nonsense have been written about them
A woman who planned to write a book entitled Lies about the Rothschilds abandoned it saying 'It was relatively easy to spot the lies but it proved impossible to find out the truth' He writes that unlike the court factors of earlier centuries who had financed and managed European noble houses but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation the new kind of international bank created by the Rothschilds was impervious to local attacks
Their assets were held in financial instruments circulating through the world as stocks bonds and debts
Changes made by the Rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence Henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs Johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by Nathan Mayer Rothschild in London however more recent research by Niall Ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other Rothschild dynasties including James Mayer de Rothschild in Paris Carl Mayer von Rothschild in Naples and Amschel Mayer Rothschild in Frankfurt
Another essential part of Mayer Rothschild's strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes
In about the Jewish Encyclopedia noted The practice initiated by the Rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other Jewish financiers like the Bischoffsheims Pereires Seligmans Lazards and others and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their Jewish confrres but with the banking fraternity in general
By this means Jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the th century
The head of the whole group was the Rothschild family It also says Of more recent years non-Jewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method and on the whole the control is now rather less than more in Jewish hands than formerly
Mayer Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages often between first- or second-cousins similar to royal intermarriage
By the late th century however almost all Rothschilds had started to marry outside the family usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties
Amschel Mayer Rothschild Frankfurt died childless as his fortune passed to the sons of Salomon and Calmann
Jakob Mayer Rothschild ParisThe German family name Rothschild is pronounced ˈʁoːtʃɪlt in German unlike ˈrɒθstʃaɪld in English
The surname Rothschild is rare in Germany
Rothschild banking family of FranceThe five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the Austrian nobility by Emperor Francis I of Austria and they were all granted the Austrian hereditary title of Freiherr baron on September
The British branch of the family was elevated by Queen Victoria who granted the hereditary title of baronet and later the hereditary peerage title of Baron Rothschild
The Rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the Napoleonic Wars and the family had gained preeminence in the bullion trade by this time
From London in to Nathan Mayer Rothschild was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort organising the shipment of bullion to the Duke of Wellington's armies across Europe as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies
In alone the Rothschilds provided £ million in currency which is about £ million € million or US million today when using the retail price index and £ billion € billion or US billion when using average earnings in subsidy loans to Britain's continental allies
The brothers helped coordinate Rothschild activities across the continent and the family developed a network of agents shippers and couriers to transport gold across war-torn Europe
The family network was also to provide Nathan Rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of Rothschild still more invaluable to the British government
In one instance the family network enabled Nathan to receive in London the news of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo a full day ahead of the government's official messengers
Rothschild's first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him he and his courier immediately took the news to the government
That he used the news for financial advantage was a fiction then repeated in later popular accounts such as that of Morton
The basis for the Rothschild's most famously profitable move was made after the news of British victory had been made public
Nathan Rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in British government bonds after a two-year stabilisation which would finalise the post-war restructuring of the domestic economy
In what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history Nathan immediately bought up the government bond market for what at the time seemed an excessively high price before waiting two years then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in for a profit
Given the sheer power of leverage the Rothschild family had at their disposal this profit was an enormous sum
Nathan Mayer Rothschild started his business in Manchester in and gradually moved it to London where in he acquired the location at New Court in St
Swithin's Lane City of London where it operates today he established N M Rothschild Sons in
In he arranged a £ million equal to £ million in loan to the Prussian government and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank's business
He gained a position of such power in the City of London that by he was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a market liquidity crisis
Rothschild family banking businesses pioneered international high finance during the industrialisation of Europe and were instrumental in supporting railway systems across the world and in complex government financing for projects such as the Suez Canal
From through they loaned nearly adjusted to inflation in to European governments
During the th century the family bought up a large proportion of the property in Mayfair London
The Rothschild family was directly involved in the Independence of Brazil from Portugal in the early th century
Upon an agreement the Brazilian government should pay a compensation of two million pounds sterling to the Kingdom of Portugal to accept Brazil's independence
N M Rothschild Sons was pre-eminent in raising this capital for the government of the newly formed Empire of Brazil on the London market
In Nathan Rothschild raised £ and indeed was probably discreetly involved in the earlier tranche of this loan which raised £ in
Part of the price of Portuguese recognition of Brazilian independence secured in was that Brazil should take over repayment of the principal and interest on a £ loan made to the Portuguese government in by N M Rothschild Sons
in suggests the close involvement of the Rothschilds in the occasion
Major th-century businesses founded with Rothschild family capital include
The Rio Tinto mining company from the s onwards the Rothschilds had full control of Rio Tinto
De Beers The family funded Cecil Rhodes in the creation of the African colony of Rhodesia
From the late s onwards the family took over control of the Rio Tinto mining company
The Japanese government approached the London and Paris families for funding during the Russo-Japanese War
The London consortium's issue of Japanese war bonds would total £ million at currency rates £ billion in currency terms
The name of Rothschild became synonymous with extravagance and great wealth and the family was renowned for its art collecting for its palaces as well as for its philanthropy
By the end of the century the family owned or had built at the lowest estimates over palaces of a scale and luxury perhaps unparalleled even by the richest royal families
The British Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George claimed in that Nathan Lord Rothschild was the most powerful man in Britain
Niles' Weekly Register Volume had the following to say about the Rothschilds influence on international high finance in
The Neapolitan Rothschilds was the first branch of the family to decline when revolution broke out and Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Naples on September and set up a provisional Italian government
Because of the family's close political connections with Austria and France Adolphe Carl von Rothschild fr was caught in a delicate position
He chose to take temporary sanctuary in Gaeta with the last Neapolitan king Francis II of the Two Sicilies
However the Rothschild branches in London Paris and Vienna were not prepared nor willing to financially support the deposed king
With the ensuing unification of Italy and the mounting tension between Adolph and the rest of the family the Naples house closed in after forty-two years in business
In the German branch closed its doors after more than a century in business following the death of Wilhelm Rothschild with no male heirs
It was not until that the family returned when N
Rothschild Sons the British branch plus Bank Rothschild AG the Swiss branch set up a representative banking office in Frankfurt
By the start of the th century the introduction of national taxation systems had ended the Rothschild's policy of operating with a single set of commercial account records which resulted in the various branches gradually going their own separate ways as independent banks
The system of the five brothers and their successor sons would all but disappear by World War I
The rise of Nazi Germany in the s led to a precarious situation for the Austrian Rothschilds under the Annexation of Austria in when the family was pressured to sell its banking operations at a fraction of its real worth
While other Rothschilds had escaped the Nazis Louis Rothschild was imprisoned for a year and only released after a substantial ransom was paid by his family
After Louis was allowed to leave the country in March the Nazis placed the firm of S M von Rothschild under compulsory administration
Nazi officers and senior staff from Austrian museums also emptied the Rothschild family estates of all their valuables
Following the war the Austrian Rothschilds were unable to reclaim much of their former assets and properties
Later the fall of France during the Second World War led to the seizure of the property of the French Rothschilds under German occupation
Despite having their bank restored to them at the end of the war the French Rothschilds were powerless in as the family business was nationalised by the socialist government of newly elected President Franois Mitterrand
In addition The New York Times wrote that the Rothschilds grossly misjudged the opportunities directly across the Atlantic and quoted Evelyn Robert de Rothschild as saying that despite the accomplishments made by the various branches of the family in international high finance for over years we never seized the initiative in America and that was one of the mistakes my family made

Through the creation of a network of agents couriers and shippers the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the Duke of Wellington in Portugal and Spain therefore funding the war
The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century

The C M de Rothschild Figli bank arranged substantial loans to the Papal States and to various Kings of Naples plus the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany
However in the s Naples followed Spain with a gradual shift away from conventional bond issues that began to affect the bank's growth and profitability
The Unification of Italy in with the ensuing decline of the Italian aristocracy who had been the Rothschild's primary clients eventually brought about the closure of their Naples bank due to a forecasted decline in the sustainability of the business over the long-term
However in the early th century the Rothschild family of Naples built up close relations with the Holy See and the association between the family and the Vatican continued into the th century
In when Pope Gregory XVI was seen meeting Carl von Rothschild to arrange the Rothschild loan to the Holy See for £ worth € in observers were shocked that Rothschild was not required to kiss the Pope's feet as was then required for all other visitors to the Pope including monarchs
