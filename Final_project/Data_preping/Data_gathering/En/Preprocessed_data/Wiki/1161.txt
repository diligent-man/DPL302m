the rothschild family o t lt is a wealthy ashkenazi jewish family originally from frankfurt that rose to prominence with mayer amschel rothschild a court factor to the german landgraves of hesse kassel in the free city of frankfurt holy roman empire who established his banking business in the s
unlike most previous court factors rothschild managed to bequeath his wealth and established an international banking family through his five sons who established businesses in london paris frankfurt vienna and naples
the family was elevated to noble rank in the holy roman empire and the united kingdom
the family s documented history starts in th century frankfurt its name is derived from the family house rothschild built by isaak elchanan bacharach in frankfurt in
during the th century the rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world as well as in modern world history
the family s wealth declined over the th century and was divided among many descendants
today their interests cover a diverse range of fields including financial services real estate mining energy agriculture winemaking and nonprofits
many examples of the family s rural architecture exist across northwestern europe
the rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories many of which have antisemitic origins
the first member of the family who was known to use the name rothschild was izaak elchanan rothschild born in
the name is derived from the german zum rothen schild with the old spelling th meaning at the red shield in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations in those days houses were designated not by numbers but by signs displaying different symbols or colours
a red shield can still be seen at the centre of the rothschild coat of arms
the family s ascent to international prominence began in with the birth of mayer amschel rothschild in frankfurt am main germany
he was the son of amschel moses rothschild born circa a money changer who had traded with the prince of hesse
born in the judengasse the ghetto of frankfurt mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main european financial centres to conduct business
the rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of mayer rothschild in a reference to psalm like arrows in the hands of a warrior so are the children of one s youth the family motto appears below the shield concordia integritas industria unity integrity industry
paul johnson writes t he rothschilds are elusive
there is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate
libraries of nonsense have been written about them
a woman who planned to write a book entitled lies about the rothschilds abandoned it saying it was relatively easy to spot the lies but it proved impossible to find out the truth he writes that unlike the court factors of earlier centuries who had financed and managed european noble houses but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation the new kind of international bank created by the rothschilds was impervious to local attacks
their assets were held in financial instruments circulating through the world as stocks bonds and debts
changes made by the rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by nathan mayer rothschild in london however more recent research by niall ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other rothschild dynasties including james mayer de rothschild in paris carl mayer von rothschild in naples and amschel mayer rothschild in frankfurt
another essential part of mayer rothschild s strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes
in about the jewish encyclopedia noted the practice initiated by the rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other jewish financiers like the bischoffsheims pereires seligmans lazards and others and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their jewish confr res but with the banking fraternity in general
by this means jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the th century
the head of the whole group was the rothschild family it also says of more recent years non jewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method and on the whole the control is now rather less than more in jewish hands than formerly
mayer rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages often between first or second cousins similar to royal intermarriage
by the late th century however almost all rothschilds had started to marry outside the family usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties
his sons were

the british branch of the family was elevated by queen victoria who granted the hereditary title of baronet and later the hereditary peerage title of baron rothschild
the rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the napoleonic wars and the family had gained preeminence in the bullion trade by this time
from london in to nathan mayer rothschild was instrumental in almost single handedly financing the british war effort organising the shipment of bullion to the duke of wellington s armies across europe as well as arranging the payment of british financial subsidies to their continental allies
in alone the rothschilds provided million in currency which is about million million or us million today when using the retail price index and billion billion or us billion when using average earnings in subsidy loans to britain s continental allies
the brothers helped coordinate rothschild activities across the continent and the family developed a network of agents shippers and couriers to transport gold across war torn europe
the family network was also to provide nathan rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of rothschild still more invaluable to the british government
in one instance the family network enabled nathan to receive in london the news of wellington s victory at the battle of waterloo a full day ahead of the government s official messengers
rothschild s first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him he and his courier immediately took the news to the government
that he used the news for financial advantage was a fiction then repeated in later popular accounts such as that of morton
the basis for the rothschild s most famously profitable move was made after the news of british victory had been made public
nathan rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in british government bonds after a two year stabilisation which would finalise the post war restructuring of the domestic economy
in what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history nathan immediately bought up the government bond market for what at the time seemed an excessively high price before waiting two years then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in for a profit
given the sheer power of leverage the rothschild family had at their disposal this profit was an enormous sum
nathan mayer rothschild started his business in manchester in and gradually moved it to london where in he acquired the location at new court in st
swithin s lane city of london where it operates today he established n m rothschild sons in
in he arranged a million equal to million in loan to the prussian government and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank s business

rothschild family banking businesses pioneered international high finance during the industrialisation of europe and were instrumental in supporting railway systems across the world and in complex government financing for projects such as the suez canal
from through they loaned nearly adjusted to inflation in to european governments
during the th century the family bought up a large proportion of the property in mayfair london
the rothschild family was directly involved in the independence of brazil from portugal in the early th century
upon an agreement the brazilian government should pay a compensation of two million pounds sterling to the kingdom of portugal to accept brazil s independence
n m rothschild sons was pre eminent in raising this capital for the government of the newly formed empire of brazil on the london market
in nathan rothschild raised and indeed was probably discreetly involved in the earlier tranche of this loan which raised in
part of the price of portuguese recognition of brazilian independence secured in was that brazil should take over repayment of the principal and interest on a loan made to the portuguese government in by n m rothschild sons
a correspondence from samuel phillips co
in suggests the close involvement of the rothschilds in the occasion
