the caucasian race also caucasoid or europid europoid is an obsolete racial classification of human beings based on a now disproven theory of biological race
the caucasian race was historically regarded as a biological taxon which depending on which of the historical race classifications was being used usually included ancient and modern populations from all or parts of europe western asia central asia south asia north africa and the horn of africa
first introduced in the s by members of the g ttingen school of history the term denoted one of three purported major races of humankind those three being caucasoid mongoloid and negroid
in biological anthropology caucasoid has been used as an umbrella term for phenotypically similar groups from these different regions with a focus on skeletal anatomy and especially cranial morphology without regard to skin tone
ancient and modern caucasoid populations were thus not exclusively white but ranged in complexion from white skinned to dark brown
since the second half of the th century physical anthropologists have switched from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population based perspective and have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors as the concept is also understood in the social sciences
in the united states the root term caucasian is still in use as a synonym for white or of european middle eastern or north african ancestry a usage that has been criticized
in the eighteenth century the prevalent view among european scholars was that the human species had its origin in the region of the caucasus mountains
this view was based upon the caucasus being the location for the purported landing point of noah s ark from whom the bible states that humanity is descended and the location for the suffering of prometheus who in hesiod s myth had crafted humankind from clay
in addition the most beautiful humans were reputed by europeans to be the stereotypical circassian beauties and the georgian people both georgia and circassia are in the caucasus region
the circassian beauty stereotype had its roots in the middle ages while the reputation for the attractiveness of the georgian people was developed by early modern travellers to the region such as jean chardin
the term caucasian as a racial category was first introduced in the s by members of the g ttingen school of history notably christoph meiners in and johann friedrich blumenbach in it had originally referred in a narrow sense to the native inhabitants of the caucasus region
in his the outline of history of mankind the german philosopher christoph meiners first used the concept of a caucasian kaukasisch race in its wider racial sense
meiners term was given wider circulation in the s by many people
meiners imagined that the caucasian race encompassed all of the ancient and most of the modern native populations of europe the aboriginal inhabitants of west asia including the phoenicians hebrews and arabs the autochthones of northern africa berbers egyptians abyssinians and neighboring groups the indians and the ancient guanches
it was johann friedrich blumenbach a colleague of meiners who later came to be considered one of the founders of the discipline of anthropology who gave the term a wider audience by grounding it in the new methods of craniometry and linnean taxonomy
blumenbach did not credit meiners with his taxonomy although his justification clearly points to meiners aesthetic viewpoint of caucasus origins
in contrast to meiners however blumenbach was a monogenist he considered all humans to have a shared origin and to be a single species
blumenbach like meiners did rank his caucasian grouping higher than other groups in terms of mental faculties or potential for achievement despite pointing out that the transition from one race to another is so gradual that the distinctions between the races presented by him are very arbitrary
alongside the anthropologist georges cuvier blumenbach classified the caucasian race by cranial measurements and bone morphology in addition to skin pigmentation
following meiners blumenbach described the caucasian race as consisting of the native inhabitants of europe west asia the indian peninsula and north africa
this usage later grew into the widely used color terminology for race contrasting with the terms negroid mongoloid and australoid
there was never consensus among the proponents of the caucasoid race concept regarding how it would be delineated from other groups such as the proposed mongoloid race
carleton s
coon included the populations native to all of central and northern asia including the ainu people under the caucasoid label
however many scientists maintained the racial categorizations of color established by meiners and blumenbach s works along with many other early steps of anthropology well into the late th and mid to late th centuries increasingly used to justify political policies such as segregation and immigration restrictions and other opinions based in prejudice
for example thomas henry huxley classified all populations of asian nations as mongoloid
lothrop stoddard in turn classified as brown most of the populations of the middle east north africa the horn of africa central asia and south asia
he counted as white only european peoples and their descendants as well as a few populations in areas adjacent to or opposite southern europe in parts of anatolia and parts of the rif and atlas mountains
in coon argued that the caucasian race had originated through admixture between homo neanderthalensis and homo sapiens of the mediterranean type which he considered to be distinct from caucasians rather than a subtype of it as others had done
while blumenbach had erroneously thought that light skin color was ancestral to all humans and the dark skin of southern populations was due to sun coon thought that caucasians had lost their original pigmentation as they moved north
coon used the term caucasoid and white race synonymously
in coon published the origin of races wherein he proposed a polygenist view that human races had evolved separately from local varieties of homo erectus
dividing humans into five main races and argued that each evolved in parallel but at different rates so that some races had reached higher levels of evolution than others
he argued that the caucasoid race had evolved years prior to the congoid race and hence represented a higher evolutionary stage
coon argued that caucasoid traits emerged prior to the cro magnons and were present in the skhul and qafzeh hominids
however these fossils and the predmost specimen were held to be neanderthaloid derivatives because they possessed short cervical vertebrae lower and narrower pelves and had some neanderthal skull traits
coon further asserted that the caucasoid race was of dual origin consisting of early dolichocephalic e g

coon s theories on race were much disputed in his lifetime and are considered pseudoscientific in modern anthropology
after discussing various criteria used in biology to define subspecies or races alan r
templeton concludes in t he answer to the question whether races exist in humans is clear and unambiguous no
drawing from petrus camper s theory of facial angle blumenbach and cuvier classified races through their skull collections based on their cranial features and anthropometric measurements
caucasoid traits were recognised as thin nasal aperture nose narrow a small mouth facial angle of and orthognathism exemplified by what blumenbach saw in most ancient greek crania and statues
later anthropologists of the th and early th century such as james cowles prichard charles pickering broca paul topinard samuel george morton oscar peschel charles gabriel seligman robert bennett bean william zebina ripley alfred cort haddon and roland dixon came to recognize other caucasoid morphological features such as prominent supraorbital ridges and a sharp nasal sill
many anthropologists in the th century used the term caucasoid in their literature such as william clouser boyd reginald ruggles gates carleton s
coon sonia mary cole alice mossie brues and grover krantz replacing the earlier term caucasian as it had fallen out of usage
in the th century meyers konversations lexikon caucasoid was one of the three great races of humankind alongside mongoloid and negroid
the taxon was taken to consist of a number of subtypes
the caucasoid peoples were usually divided into three groups on ethnolinguistic grounds termed aryan indo european semitic semitic languages and hamitic hamitic languages i e
berber cushitic egyptian
th century classifications of the peoples of india were initially uncertain if the dravidians and the sinahalese were caucasoid or a separate dravida race but by and in the th century anthropologists predominantly declared dravidians to be caucasoid
historically the racial classification of the turkic peoples was sometimes given as turanid
turanid racial type or minor race subtype of the europid caucasian race with mongoloid admixtures situated at the boundary of the distribution of the mongoloid and europid great races
there was no universal consensus of the validity of the caucasoid grouping within those who attempted to categorize human variation
thomas henry huxley in wrote that the absurd denomination of caucasian was in fact a conflation of his xanthochroi nordic and melanochroi mediterranean types
the postulated subraces vary depending on the author including but not limited to mediterranean atlantid nordic east baltic alpine dinaric turanid armenoid iranid indid arabid and hamitic
wells argued that across europe north africa the horn of africa west asia central asia and south asia a caucasian physical stock existed
he divided this racial element into two main groups a shorter and darker mediterranean or iberian race and a taller and lighter nordic race
wells asserted that semitic and hamitic populations were mainly of mediterranean type and aryan populations were originally of nordic type
he regarded the basques as descendants of early mediterranean peoples who inhabited western europe before the arrival of aryan celts from the direction of central europe
the northcaucasian race is a sub race proposed by carleton s
it comprises the native populations of the north caucasus the balkars karachays and vainakh chechens and ingushs
an introduction to anthropology published in gives a more complex classification scheme
archaic caucasoid races ainu people in japan australoid race dravidian peoples and vedda
primary caucasoid races alpine race armenoid race mediterranean race and nordic race
secondary or derived caucasoid races dinaric race east baltic race and polynesian racebesides its use in anthropology and related fields the term caucasian has often been used in the united states in a different social context to describe a group commonly called white people
white also appears as a self reporting entry in the u s
census
naturalization as a united states citizen was restricted to free white persons by the naturalization act of and later extended to other resident populations by the naturalization act of indian citizenship act of and immigration and nationality act of
the supreme court in united states v
bhagat singh thind decided that asian indians were ineligible for citizenship because though deemed caucasian anthropologically they were not white like european descendants since most laypeople did not consider them to be white people
this represented a change from the supreme court s earlier opinion in ozawa v
united states in which it had expressly approved of two lower court cases holding high caste hindus to be free white persons within the meaning of the naturalization act
government lawyers later recognized that the supreme court had withdrawn this approval in thind
in the u s
congress passed a new law establishing a small immigration quota for indians which also permitted them to become citizens
major changes to immigration law however only later came in when many earlier racial restrictions on immigration were lifted
this resulted in confusion about whether american hispanics are included as white as the term hispanic originally applied to spanish heritage but has since expanded to include all people with origins in spanish speaking countries
in other countries the term hispanic is rarely used
the united states national library of medicine often used the term caucasian as a race in the past
however it later discontinued such usage in favor of the more narrow geographical term european which traditionally only applied to a subset of caucasoids
