the hungarian grand prix was a formula one motor race held at hungaroring on august
it was the eleventh race of the formula one world championship
the lap race was won by brazilian driver ayrton senna driving a mclaren honda
briton nigel mansell finished second in his williams renault to clinch the drivers championship with five races still to run with austrian gerhard berger third in the other mclaren honda
the race also marked the final appearance of the brabham team which had been competing in formula one since and had won four drivers championships and two constructors championships
after the previous grand prix in germany the fondmetal team replaced andrea chiesa with brabham driver eric van de poele
brabham did not replace van de poele and reduced their entry to one car
this meant the pre qualifying pool could be reduced by one and thus larrousse driver bertrand gachot was no longer required to pre qualify
the session proved practically unnecessary as again the andrea moda team did not make a serious attempt to run their second car driven by perry mccarthy
his team mate roberto moreno had used both cars to pre qualify and mccarthy was only allowed to leave the pits seconds before the end of the session leaving him no chance to reach the start finish line to begin a timed lap before the chequered flag was waved
this being the latest in a succession of similar incidents fisa formally warned andrea moda to make a proper effort to run both cars at the next grand prix in belgium or face suspension from the following event in italy
the other four cars in the session thus all pre qualified with the fondmetals taking the first two places as gabriele tarquini outpaced van de poele by nearly a second
ukyo katayama was another second further back in the remaining larrousse with moreno seconds slower in fourth only his second pre qualification success this season
mccarthy was the sole entrant to fail to pre qualify
after the race the brabham team withdrew entirely removing the necessity for further pre qualifying sessions
to date this pre qualifying session was the last to be held in formula one
this was the chance for williams to seal both titles and they were dominant but it was patrese who took pole ahead of teammate nigel mansell ayrton senna michael schumacher gerhard berger and martin brundle
at the start gerhard berger passed michael schumacher and then mansell lost momentum and senna passed him with berger following his teammate through
the order was patrese senna berger mansell schumacher and brundle
there was a collision on the first lap between rik comas johnny herbert thierry boutsen and gabriele tarquini who all retired on the first lap meaning both ligiers of comas and boutsen retired on the first lap before eric van de poele spun into retirement at the first corner on lap as both fondmetals retired after only two laps
mansell passed berger on lap and set off after senna
however as hard as he tried the combination of the small circuit and senna s skills in defending meant that he could not pass
another multi car collision came on lap which eliminated bertrand gachot aguri suzuki olivier grouillard karl wendlinger and stefano modena forcing all five drivers to retire on the same lap
alesi in the leading ferrari behind the leading pack spun out with the rear wheels in the gravel trap by lap
after these accidents which took place in three separate sections of the track modena s disabled jordan blocking turn was the most precariously positioned cars of all the sc sign meaning the safety car was going to be deployed for the first time since the sc rule had been in place
double yellow flags were waved around the track
controversially no further action was taken and the safety car was never deployed
murray walker and james hunt in the bbc booth phrased the situation shambolic
on lap mansell made a mistake and went wide and rejoined behind berger just in the very moment when murray walker was talking about the track not providing any overtaking opportunities
two laps later mansell passed berger to get back third
then a pivotal movement came on lap when patrese spun off going into turn
he rejoined in seventh outside the points which meant that mansell would be the world champion if results stayed the same
however on lap mansell had to go to the pits with tyre troubles and rejoined in sixth just ahead of patrese
mansell quickly passed h kkinen but before patrese who was right behind could take sixth patrese s engine blew
he was out and would get no points
mansell quickly caught and passed brundle on lap and four laps later he was up to third when michael schumacher s rear wing broke on his benetton spinning him out and retired on lap
senna a minute at the front made a precautionary stop just as h kkinen passed brundle for fourth
mansell passed berger for second and now had a toehold on the championship
soon afterwards h kkinen tried to pass berger and spun into brundle s path
brundle was forced to spin to avoid a collision and both rejoined without losing places with h kkinen staying ahead
senna won ahead of new world champion mansell berger h kkinen brundle and capelli scoring his last point for ferrari as well as the last point of his career
