animatronics refers to mechatronic puppets
they are a modern variant of the automaton and are often used for the portrayal of characters in films and in theme park attractions
it is a multidisciplinary field integrating puppetry anatomy and mechatronics
animatronic figures can be implemented with both computer and human control including teleoperation
motion actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions
figures are usually encased in body shells and flexible skins made of hard and soft plastic materials and finished with colors hair feathers and other components to make them more lifelike
animatronics stem from a long tradition of mechanical automata powered by hydraulics pneumatics and clockwork
greek mythology and ancient chinese writings mention early examples of automata
the oldest extant automaton is dated to the th century
before the term animatronics became common they were usually referred to as robots
since then robots have become known as more practical programmable machines that do not necessarily resemble living creatures
robots or other artificial beings designed to convincingly resemble humans are known as androids
the term animatronics is a portmanteau of animate and electronics
the term audio animatronics was coined by walt disney in when he started developing animatronics for entertainment and film
audio animatronics does not differentiate between animatronics and androids
autonomatronics was also defined by disney imagineers to describe more advanced audio animatronic technology featuring cameras and complex sensors to process and respond to information in the character s environment
sparko the robot dog pet of elektro performs in front of the public but sparko unlike many depictions of robots in that time represented a living animal thus becoming the very first modern day animatronic character along with an unnamed horse which was reported to gallop realistically
the animatronic galloping horse was also on display at the world s fair in a different exhibit than sparko s new york world s fair

sparko the robot dog the pet of elektro the robot is considered the first modern day animatronic character as it represented a living animal rather than a purely mechanical figure
an unnamed animatronic horse which was reported to gallop realistically was also exhibited
laffing sal was one of several automated characters used to attract carnival and amusement park patrons to funhouses and dark rides throughout the united states
its movements were accompanied by a raucous recorded laugh that sometimes frightened small children and annoyed adults
walt disney is often credited for popularizing animatronics for entertainment after he bought an animatronic bird while vacationing in either new orleans or europe
disney s vision for audio animatronics was primarily focused on patriotic displays rather than amusements
in two years after disney developed animatronics he commissioned machinist roger broggie and sculptor wathel rogers to lead a team tasked with creating a figure that could talk and recreate dance routines performed by actor buddy ebsen
the figure dubbed project little man was never finished
a year later walt disney imagineering was created
disney used what appeared as an animatronic bird in his film mary poppins which was actually controlled by bicycle cables
after project little man the imagineering team s first project was a chinese head which was on display in the lobby of their office
customers could ask the head questions and it replied with words of wisdom
the eyes blinked and its mouth opened and closed
walt disney productions started using animatronics in for disneyland s jungle cruise ride then for its walt disney s enchanted tiki room attraction which featured animatronic tropical birds and other characters
the first fully audio animatronic human figure was that of abraham lincoln created by disney for the world s fair in new york
in disney upgraded the figure dubbed the lincoln mark ii to appear at the opera house at disneyland resort in california
for three months while the original lincoln performed in new york the lincoln mark ii gave five performances per hour at disneyland
actor royal dano voiced both versions of the figure

the attraction is currently deployed at hong kong disneyland in hong kong
the film industry has been a driving force revolutionizing the technology used to develop animatronics
animatronics are used in situations where a creature does not exist the action is too risky or costly to use real actors or animals or the action could never be obtained with a living person or animal
its main advantage over cgi and stop motion is that the simulated creature has a physical presence moving in front of the camera in real time
the technology behind animatronics has become more advanced and sophisticated over the years making the puppets even more lifelike
animatronics were first introduced by disney in the film mary poppins which featured an animatronic bird
since then animatronics have been used extensively in such movies as jaws and e t
the extra terrestrial which relied heavily on animatronics
directors such as steven spielberg and jim henson have been pioneers in using animatronics in the film industry a film co directed by the latter the dark crystal was promoted as the first to feature no human characters and showcased groundbreaking puppets designed by brian froud and created by henson s then recently established creature shop in london
the film jurassic park used a combination of computer generated imagery in conjunction with life sized animatronic dinosaurs built by stan winston and his team
winston s animatronic t
rex stood almost feet m
feet m in length and even the largest animatronics weighing pounds kg were able to perfectly recreate the
appearance and natural movement on screen of a full sized tyrannosaurus rex
jack horner called it the closest i ve ever been to a live dinosaur
critics referred to spielberg s dinosaurs as breathtakingly and terrifyingly realistic
the bbc miniseries walking with dinosaurs was produced using a combination of about cgi and animatronic models
the quality of computer imagery of the day was good but animatronics were still better at distance shots as well as closeups of the dinosaurs
animatronics for the series were designed by british animatronics firm crawley creatures
the show was followed up in with a live adaptation of the series walking with dinosaurs the arena spectacular
geoff peterson is an animatronic human skeleton that serves as the sidekick on the late night talk show the late late show with craig ferguson
often referred to as a robot skeleton peterson is a radio controlled animatronic robot puppet designed and built by grant imahara of mythbusters
the british advertisement campaign for cadbury schweppes titled gorilla featured an actor inside a gorilla suit with an animatronically animated face
the slowskys was an advertising campaign for comcast cable s xfinity broadband internet service
the ad features two animatronic turtles and it won the gold effie award in
some examples of animatronic toys include teddy ruxpin big mouth billy bass furreal kota the triceratops pleo wowwee alive chimpanzee microsoft actimates and furby
well known brands include cuddle barn gemmy industries tickle me elmo and dan dee
an animatronics character is built around an internal supporting frame usually made of steel
attached to these bones are the muscles which can be manufactured using elastic netting composed of styrene beads
the frame provides the support for the electronics and mechanical components as well as providing the shape for the outer skin
the skin of the figure is most often made of foam rubber silicone or urethane poured into moulds and allowed to cure
to provide further strength a piece of fabric is cut to size and embedded in the foam rubber after it is poured into the mould
once the mould has fully cured each piece is separated and attached to the exterior of the figure providing the appearance and texture similar to that of skin
an animatronics character is typically designed to be as realistic as possible and thus is built similarly to how it would be in real life
the framework of the figure is like the skeleton
joints motors and actuators act as the muscles
connecting all the electrical components together are wires such as the nervous system of a real animal or person
steel aluminum plastic and wood are all commonly used in building animatronics but each has its best purpose
the relative strength as well as the weight of the material itself should be considered when determining the most appropriate material to use
the cost of the material may also be a concern
several materials are commonly used in the fabrication of an animatronics figure s exterior
dependent on the particular circumstances the best material will be used to produce the most lifelike form
for example eyes and teeth are commonly made completely out of acrylic
latex white latex is commonly used as a general material because it has a high level of elasticity
it is also pre vulcanized making it easy and fast to apply
latex is produced in several grades
grade is a popular form of latex that dries rapidly and can be applied very thick making it ideal for developing molds
foam latex is a lightweight soft form of latex which is used in masks and facial prosthetics to change a person s outward appearance and in animatronics to create a realistic skin
the wizard of oz was one of the first films to make extensive use of foam latex prosthetics in the s
silicone disney has a research team devoted to improving and developing better methods of creating more lifelike animatronics exteriors with silicone
rtv silicone room temperature vulcanization silicone is used primarily as a molding material as it is very easy to use but is relatively expensive
few other materials stick to it making molds easy to separate
bubbles are removed from silicone by pouring the liquid material in a thin stream or processing in a vacuum chamber prior to use
fumed silica is used as a bulking agent for thicker coatings of the material
polyurethane polyurethane rubber is a more cost effective material to use in place of silicone
polyurethane comes in various levels of hardness which are measured on the shore scale
rigid polyurethane foam is used in prototyping because it can be milled and shaped in high density
flexible polyurethane foam is often used in the actual building of the final animatronic figure because it is flexible and bonds well with latex
plaster as a commonplace construction and home decorating material plaster is widely available
its rigidity limits its use in moulds and plaster moulds are unsuitable when undercuts are present
this may make plaster far more difficult to use than softer materials like latex or silicone pneumatic actuators can be used for small animatronics but are not powerful enough for large designs and must be supplemented with hydraulics
to create more realistic movement in large figures an analog system is generally used to give the figures a full range of fluid motion rather than simple two position movements
mimicking the often subtle displays of humans and other living creatures and the associated movement is a challenging task when developing animatronics
one of the most common emotional models is the facial action coding system facs developed by ekman and friesen
facs defines that through facial expression humans can recognize basic emotions anger disgust fear joy sadness and surprise
another theory is that of ortony clore and collins or the occ model which defines different emotional categories
in disney revealed its new animatronics robot that can breathe move its eyes very much like humans and identify people around it in order to select an appropriate response as opposed to previous disney animatronics that were used in purely scripted non interactive situations like theme park rides
animatronics has been developed as a career which combines the disciplines of mechanical engineering casting sculpting control technologies electrical electronic systems radio control and airbrushing
some colleges and universities do offer degree programs in animatronics
individuals interested in animatronics typically earn a degree in robotics which closely relate to the specializations needed in animatronics engineering
students achieving a bachelor s degree in robotics commonly complete courses in
mechanical engineering
industrial robotics
mechatronics systems
modeling of robotics systems
robotics engineering
foundational theory of robotics
introduction to robotics the disney company is about to use animatronics and artificial intelligence to simulate one of their characters in real life pascal one of the characters in the movie tangled
on the other hand dubai is already using police robots created by pal robotics
animatronic characters appear in both films and video games most notably in horror genre and survival horror video games that generally features possessed animatronics as antagonists
the banana splits movie a american comedy horror film starring dani kind steve lund sara canning and the voice of eric bauza follows a young boy and his family who as a birthday present attend a live taping of a successful children s television series featuring fleegle bingo drooper and snorky four goofy like animatronic characters
however their new software updates go haywire upon learning the upcoming cancellation of their show and the characters start a killing spree that the crew and audience must survive
it is a horror reimagining of the hanna barbera s television series of the same name
ek hasina thi a neo noir thriller indian movie directed by sriram raghavan starring saif ali khan and urmila matondkar in the lead roles revolves around sarika urmila matondkar who is betrayed by the man whom she loves karan saif ali khan
the climax of the movie features sarika killing karan with animatronic rats thus fulfilling her quest for revenge
willy s wonderland a american action comedy horror film starring nicolas cage emily tosta david sheftell and beth grant follows a quiet drifter who is tricked into cleaning up a once successful abandoned family entertainment center while battling the restaurant s eight murderous animatronic characters possessed by souls of cannibalistic serial killers with the aid of a teenager and her friends the hug a horror short film directed by jack bishop and justin nijm and starring nick armstrong and roman george follows a bratty birthday boy at pandory s pan pizza palace a showbiz pizza place like restaurant who has an awkward situation with pandory the panda the pizzeria s giant panda animatronic mascot

they are seen in photos in not what he seems five nights at freddy s a horror video game series features various animatronic entertainers as antagonists who try to kill the player character who is typically a nighttime security guard or employee at one of the facilities usually a pizzeria where the animatronics reside
in the first game of the series the animatronics violent attitude towards humans at night is explained away as faulty programming which causes them to mistake the protagonist for an endoskeleton without a character suit on which goes against the establishment s rules
as a result the animatronics try to forcefully stuff the player character into a suit resulting in their death
however the games feature a deep lore gradually revealed through various minigames and easter eggs which reveals that many of the animatronics are actually haunted by the spirits of children whose deaths are somehow connected to the fictional restaurant franchise freddy fazbear s pizza
at least six of these children were murdered by william afton a k a
the purple guy one of the co founders of the original restaurant and the series overarching villain who would go on to possess an animatronic of his own after his death
since the original game five nights at freddy s has evolved into a large media franchise comprising various sequels prequels and spin offs a novel trilogy and an anthology series of short stories
a film adaptation is also in development automaton
