miguel de cervantes saavedra spanish mi el de e antes saa e a september assumed april ns was an early modern spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest writer in the spanish language and one of the world s pre eminent novelists
he is best known for his novel don quixote a work often cited as both the first modern novel and one of the pinnacles of world literature
much of his life was spent in poverty and obscurity while the bulk of his surviving work was produced in the three years preceding his death when he was supported by the count of lemos and did not have to work
despite this his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that spanish is often referred to as the language of cervantes
in cervantes was forced to leave spain and move to rome where he worked in the household of a cardinal
in he enlisted in a spanish navy infantry regiment and was badly wounded at the battle of lepanto in october
he served as a soldier until when he was captured by barbary pirates after five years in captivity he was ransomed and returned to madrid
his first significant novel titled la galatea was published in but he continued to work as a purchasing agent and later as government tax collector
part one of don quixote was published in and part two in
other works include the novelas ejemplares exemplary novels a long poem the viaje del parnaso journey to parnassus and ocho comedias y ocho entremeses eight plays and eight interludes
los trabajos de persiles y sigismunda the travails of persiles and sigismunda was published posthumously in
despite his subsequent renown much of cervantes s life is uncertain including his name background and what he looked like
although he signed himself cerbantes his printers used cervantes which became the common form
in later life cervantes used saavedra the name of a distant relative rather than the more usual cortinas after his mother
but historian luce l pez baralt claimed that it comes from the word shaibedraa that in arabic dialect is one handed his nickname during his captivity
another area of dispute is his religious background
it has been suggested that not only cervantes s father but also his mother may have been new christians
according to anthony cascardi while the family might have had some claim to nobility they often found themselves in financial straits
moreover they were almost certainly of converso origin that is converts to catholicism of jewish ancestry
in the spain of cervantes days this meant living under clouds of official suspicion and social mistrust with far more limited opportunities than were enjoyed by members of the old christian caste
it is generally accepted miguel de cervantes was born around september in alcal de henares
he was the second son of barber surgeon rodrigo de cervantes and his wife leonor de cortinas c
rodrigo came from c rdoba andalusia where his father juan de cervantes was an influential lawyer
no authenticated portrait of the author is known to exist
the one most often associated with cervantes is attributed to juan de j uregui but both names were added at a later date
the el greco painting in the museo del prado known as retrato de un caballero desconocido or portrait of an unknown gentleman is cited as possibly depicting cervantes but there is no evidence for this
the portrait by luis de madrazo at the biblioteca nacional de espa a was painted in based on his imagination
the image that appears on spanish euro coins of and is based on a bust created in
rodrigo was frequently in debt or searching for work and moved constantly
leonor came from arganda del rey and died in october at the age of surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children could read and write and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business
when rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from october to april she supported the family on her own
cervantes s siblings were andr s born andrea born luisa born rodrigo born magdalena born and juan
they lived in c rdoba until when his grandfather died
for reasons that are unclear rodrigo did not benefit from his will and the family disappears until when he filed a lawsuit in seville
seville was then in the midst of an economic boom and rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother andres who was a junior magistrate
it is assumed cervantes attended the jesuit college in seville where one of the teachers was jesuit playwright pedro pablo acevedo who moved there in from c rdoba
however legal records show his father got into debt once more and in the family moved to madrid
in the th century a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a miguel de cervantes dated september who was charged with wounding antonio de sigura in a duel
although disputed at the time largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author it is now accepted as the most likely reason for cervantes leaving madrid
he eventually made his way to rome where he found a position in the household of giulio acquaviva an italian bishop who spent to in madrid and was appointed cardinal in
when the to ottoman venetian war began spain formed part of the holy league a coalition formed to support the venetian republic
possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded cervantes went to naples then part of the crown of aragon
the military commander in naples was alvaro de sande a friend of the family who gave cervantes a commission under the marquis de santa cruz
at some point he was joined in naples by his younger brother rodrigo
in september cervantes sailed on board the marquesa part of the holy league fleet under don john of austria illegitimate half brother of phillip ii of spain on october they defeated the ottoman fleet at the battle of lepanto
according to his own account although suffering from malaria cervantes was given command of a man skiff a small boat used for assaulting enemy galleys
the marquesa lost dead and wounded including cervantes who received three separate wounds two in the chest and another that rendered his left arm useless
his actions at lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life while don john approved no less than four separate pay increases for him
in journey to parnassus published two years before his death in cervantes claimed to have lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right
as with much else the extent of his disability is unclear the only source being cervantes himself while commentators cite his habitual tendency to praise himself
however they were serious enough to earn him six months in the civic hospital at messina sicily
although he returned to service in july records show his chest wounds were still not completely healed in february
based mainly in naples he joined expeditions to corfu and navarino and took part in the occupation of tunis and la goulette which were recaptured by the ottomans in
despite lepanto the war overall was an ottoman victory and the loss of tunis a military disaster for spain
cervantes returned to palermo where he was paid off by the duke of sessa who gave him letters of commendation
in early september cervantes and rodrigo left naples on the galley sol as they approached barcelona on september their ship was captured by ottoman corsairs and the brothers taken to algiers to be sold as slaves or as was the case of cervantes and his brother held for ransom if this would be more lucrative than their sale as slaves
rodrigo was ransomed in but his family could not afford the fee for cervantes who was forced to remain
turkish historian rasih nuri i leri found evidence suggesting cervantes worked on the construction of the k l ali pasha complex which means he spent at least part of his captivity in istanbul
by spain was occupied with integrating portugal and suppressing the dutch revolt while the ottomans were at war with persia the two sides agreed a truce leading to an improvement of relations
after almost five years and four escape attempts in cervantes was set free by the trinitarians a religious charity that specialised in ransoming christian captives and returned to madrid
while cervantes was in captivity both don john and the duke of sessa died depriving him of two potential patrons while the spanish economy was in dire straits
this made finding employment difficult other than a period in to when he was employed as an intelligence agent in north africa little is known of his movements prior to
in april of that year cervantes visited esquivias to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet pedro lainez
here he met catalina de salazar y palacios c eldest daughter of the widowed catalina de palacios her husband died leaving only debts but the elder catalina owned some land of her own
this may be why in december cervantes married her daughter then between and years old
the first use of the name cervantes saavedra appears in on documents related to his marriage
shortly before this his illegitimate daughter isabel was born in november
her mother ana franca was the wife of a madrid inn keeper they apparently concealed it from her husband but cervantes acknowledged paternity
when ana franca died in he asked his sister magdalena to take care of her
in cervantes was appointed as a government purchasing agent then became a tax collector in
they were also subject to price fluctuations which could go either way he was briefly jailed several times for irregularities but quickly released
several applications for positions in spanish america were rejected although modern critics note images of the colonies appear in his work
from to he lived primarily in seville then returned to madrid in where he remained for the rest of his life
in later years he received some financial support from the count of lemos although he was excluded from the retinue lemos took to naples when appointed viceroy in
in july he joined the third order franciscans then a common way for catholics to gain spiritual merit
it is generally accepted cervantes died on april ns the gregorian calendar had superseded the julian in in spain and some other countries the symptoms described including intense thirst correspond to diabetes then untreatable
in accordance with his will cervantes was buried in the convent of the barefoot trinitarians in central madrid
his remains went missing when moved during rebuilding work at the convent in and in historian fernando de prado launched a project to rediscover them
in january francisco etxeberria the forensic anthropologist leading the search reported the discovery of caskets containing bone fragments and part of a board with the letters m c
based on evidence of injuries suffered at lepanto on march they were confirmed as belonging to cervantes along with his wife and others
they were formally reburied at a public ceremony in june
cervantes claimed to have written over plays such as el trato de argel based on his experiences in captivity
such works were extremely short lived and even lope de vega the best known playwright of the day could not live on their proceeds
in he published la galatea a conventional pastoral romance that received little contemporary notice despite promising to write a sequel he never did so
aside from these and some poems by cervantes had not been published for years
in don quixote he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine vain and empty chivalric romances
his portrayal of real life and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative and proved instantly popular
first published in january don quixote and sancho panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of philip iv on april
he finally achieved a degree of financial security while its popularity led to demands for a sequel
in the foreword to his work novelas ejemplares dedicated to his patron the count of lemos cervantes promises to produce one but was pre empted by an unauthorised version published in published under the name alonso fern ndez de avellaneda
it is possible this delay was deliberate to ensure support from his publisher and reading public cervantes finally produced the second part of don quixote in
the two parts of don quixote are different in focus but similar in their clarity of prose and realism the first was more comic and had greater popular appeal
the second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight
in addition to this he produced a series of works between and his death in
they include a collection of tales titled exemplary novels
this was followed by viaje del parnaso or eight comedies and eight new interludes and los trabajos de persiles y sigismunda completed just before his death and published posthumously in january
he was rediscovered by english writers in the mid th century literary editor john bowle argued cervantes was as significant as any of the greek and roman authors then popular and published an annotated edition in
now viewed as a significant work at the time it proved a failure
however don quixote has been translated into all major languages in editions
mexican author carlos fuentes suggested cervantes and his contemporary william shakespeare form part of a narrative tradition which includes homer dante defoe dickens balzac and joyce
sigmund freud claimed he learnt spanish to read cervantes in the original he particularly admired the dialogue of the dogs el coloquio de los perros from exemplary tales
two dogs cipi n and berganza share their stories as one talks the other listens occasionally making comments
from to freud and his close friend eduard silberstein wrote letters to each other using the pennames cipi n and berganza
the tricentennial of don quixote s publication in was marked with celebrations in spain the th anniversary of his death in saw the production of cervantina a celebration of his plays by the compa a nacional de teatro cl sico in madrid
