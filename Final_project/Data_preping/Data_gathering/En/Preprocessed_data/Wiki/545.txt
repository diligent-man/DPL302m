Grand Principality of Serbia Serbian Великожупанска Србија romanized Velikožupanska Srbija or Rascia Serbian Рашка romanized Raška was a medieval Serbian state that existed from the second half of the th century up until when it was transformed into the Kingdom of Serbia Initially the Grand Principality of Serbia emerged in the historical region of Raška Serbian Cyrillic Рашка Latin Rascia and gradually expanded during the th century encompassing various neighboring regions including territories of modern Montenegro Herzegovina and southern Dalmatia It was founded by Grand Prince Vukan who initially c served as regional governor of Raška appointed by King Constantine Bodin During Byzantine Serbian wars c Vukan gained prominence and became self governing ruler in inner Serbian regions He founded the Vukanović dynasty that ruled the Grand Principality Through diplomatic ties with the Kingdom of Hungary Vukan′s successors managed to retain their self governance while also recognizing the supreme overlordship of the Byzantine Empire up to Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja gained full independence and united almost all Serbian lands His son Grand Prince Stefan was crowned King of Serbia in while his younger son Saint Sava became the first Archbishop of Serbs in
According to the De Administrando Imperio DAI the Serbs settled the Balkans under the protection of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius r and were ruled by a dynasty known in historiography as the Vlastimirović dynasty Slavs had begun settling the region in the early th century after raiding deep into the Empire They settled baptized Serbia the Serbian hinterland anachronistically known as Raška which included Bosnia and the maritime lands Pomorje of Travunija Zahumlje and Paganija while maritime Duklja was held by the Byzantines it was presumably settled with Serbs as well All of the maritime lands bordered baptized Serbia to the north In the mid th century the hitherto peaceful neighbour of Bulgaria invaded but was defeated in war Serbia was Christianized in ca although missions had been made during Heraclius' reign In the following decades members of the dynasty fought succession wars and Serbia became a matter of Byzantine Bulgarian rivalry The written information regarding the dynasty ends with the DAI and Prince Časlav's death ca after which the realm crumbled into pieces The Byzantines established a short lived catepanate at Ras with military governorship ending soon thereafter with the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria and was re established only ca with the short lived Theme of Sirmium which however did not extend much into Raška
Meanwhile Duklja emerged as the dominant Serbian principality that gradually also including Travunija Zahumlje Bosnia and Raška Initially a vassal of the Byzantine Empire Stefan Vojislav fl rose up and managed to take over the territories of the earlier Serbian principality founding the Vojislavljević dynasty Between and under Mihailo Vojislavljević r and his son Constantine Bodin r Duklja saw its apogee Mihailo was given the nominal title King of Slavs by the Pope after having left the Byzantine camp and supported a Slavic uprising in the Balkans in which his son Bodin played a central part Having incorporated the Serbian hinterland and installed vassal rulers there it emerged as the most powerful Serb polity seen in the titles used by its rulers Prince of Serbia of Serbs However its rise was short lived as Bodin was defeated by the Byzantines and imprisoned pushed to the background his relative and vassal Vukan became independent in Raška which continued the fight against the Byzantines while Duklja was struck with civil wars
In or Vukan became independent taking the title of Grand Prince veliki župan His state was centered at Ras around present day Novi Pazar Subordinate to him were local counts titled župan who seem to have been more or less autonomous in the internal affairs of their counties but who obliged loyalty and support in warfare It seems that the counts were hereditary holders holding their land before Duklja annexed Raška Vukan began raiding Byzantine territory in the vicinity of Kosovo in ca the Byzantines initially being unable to take counter measures as they faced invading Pechenegs
After defeating the Pechenegs Alexios I Komnenos sent an army with the strategos of Dyrrhachium which was defeated by Vukan in Alexios then mobilized a much larger army led by himself and marched onto Raška Vukan sent envoys seeking peace which Alexios quickly accepted as problems arose at home with Cumans plundering as far as Adrianople Immediately after the Emperor's departure Vukan broke the treaty and began to expand along the Vardar obtaining much booty and taking the cities of Vranje Skopje and Tetovo In or Alexios marched out and met Vukan who offered peace and gave twenty hostages including his cousin Uroš and son Stefan it was usual for relatives of rulers to stay at the Imperial court as hostages of peace At this time Vukan acted entirely on his own no longer a vassal of Duklja which because of its civil war did not involve itself in the conflicts
Following Bodin's death in Vukan took advantage of the dynastic civil wars in Duklja and forged an alliance with Kočapar with whom he invaded Duklja in Kočapar's reign was short lived as he fell in battle during a conflict with Zahumlje Vukan installed another member of the dynasty Vladimir to whom he married his daughter Upon spreading his influence in Duklja Vukan invaded Byzantium once more in the spring of taking advantage of the Norman campaign defeating co emperor John II Komnenos but then sent hostages in return for peace in November There is no written record of Vukan after this war and he is believed to have died in ca succeeded by his cousin Uroš
In or the Byzantine army of Dyrrhachium invaded Duklja and captured its capital of Scutari They subsequently installed their protégé while ruler Đorđe took refuge in Raška under the protection of Uroš and married his relative The two led an army into Duklja in successfully retaining most of its territory After a Byzantine invasion of the maritime they nominally recognized Gradinja resulting in a guerrilla war which ended with Đorđe's capture Gradinja however only ruled a small portion of Duklja and subsequently strengthened ties with Raška In ca a Byzantine Hungarian war broke out with the Hungarians taking over Belgrade then penetrating to Niš Sofia and Philippopolis after which John defeated them with infantry and navy on the Danube The Serbs who had in the meantime recognized Byzantine rule expelled the Byzantine governor at Ras Kritopl who fled to Constantinople where he was ridiculed
Uroš I had three sons Uroš II Desa and Beloš and one daughter Jelena from a marriage with Anna Diogenissa the granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes On March he married his daughter to King Béla II of Hungary Béla II being blind relied entirely on Jelena who acted as a co ruler Jelena is sourced as having decided to massacre aristocrats at the Arad assembly due to their persuasion of Coloman to blind her husband earlier In Ladislaus II the son of Béla II and Jelena became the titular Ban of Bosnia When Béla II died on February the eldest son Géza II ascended the throne still a child Therefore Jelena and her brother Beloš whom she had invited to the court ruled the Kingdom of Hungary as regents until September when he came of age In Beloš received the title of comes palatinus count palatine the highest court title — meaning he could substitute for the King whenever necessary Since Beloš served as the Ban of Croatia
Uroš I was succeeded by his son Uroš II Beloš had close ties with Uroš II and they were able to count on each other in times of trouble In ca the political situation in the Balkans was divided by two sides one being the alliance of the Byzantines and Venice the other the Normans and Hungarians The Normans were sure of the danger that the battlefield would move from the Balkans to their area in Italy Emperor Manuel I Komnenos also allied himself with the Germans after defeating the Cumans in The Serbs Hungarians and Normans exchanged envoys being in the interest of the Normans to stop Manuel's plans to recover Italy In Beloš's Hungarian army aided Uroš II against the Byzantines The Serbs under brothers Uroš II and Desa revolted against the Byzantines when Manuel was in Avlona planning an offensive across the Adriatic and this revolt posed danger to the Emperor if he would attack Italy as the Serbs could strike at the Adriatic bases
Uroš II and Desa next undertook an offensive against Radoslav of Duklja who was a loyal Byzantine vassal Radoslav was pushed to the southwestern corner of Duklja to Kotor and retained only the coastal area with the brothers holding much of inland Duklja and Trebinje over two thirds of Duklja Radoslav sought help from the Emperor who sent aid from Dyrrhachium At this moment the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja ends presumably because the author of the original text had died A major war was about to erupt in the Balkans Uroš II and Desa in light of Byzantine retaliation sought aid from their brother Beloš the count palatine of Hungary By Hungarian troops played an active role in Serbia
In Desa was mentioned in a charter as dux of Duklja Travunija and Zahumlje In Uroš II swore loyalty to the Byzantine Emperor and demanded that Desa be put in prison He recovered his title and lands and Desa also swore loyalty and was recognized as ruler of the Dalmatian lands The two brothers were to rule the appointed regions as Manuel's vassals The event is part of what would become a competition between the Byzantine Emperor and Holy Roman Emperor that would soon move into Hungary In Manuel I declared war on Hungary This was due to the fact that Hungary had aided Serbia in its revolts against Byzantine rule Byzantine troops were sent into Syrmia and across the Danube The Byzantines caused great destruction and then withdrew the operation being strictly punitive with no occupation of lands Géza II soon signed a peace treaty Over the next years there were to be campaigns against Hungary Manuel I was able to keep the Hungarians under control in the Balkans at the expense of abandoning the Norman conflict In Desa ousted Uroš II the pro Hungarian faction at the Serbian court was upset with the Byzantine overlordship In autumn Manuel I settled the dispute between Uroš II and Desa The Emperor restored Uroš II in or and gave Desa the appanage of Dendra near Niš In Uroš II was briefly replaced by Beloš who then returned to his office in Hungary and Croatia Uroš II seems to have died in or
Manuel I now put Tihomir at the Serbian throne he was the son of Zavida a close relative to Uroš II who had held Zahumlje The rule was divided between Tihomir and his three younger brothers Tihomir held supreme rule while Stracimir ruled West Morava Miroslav ruled Hum and Travunija and Stefan Nemanja ruled Toplica Ibar Rasina and Reke The youngest of the brothers Nemanja was also given the county of Dubočica by Manuel I he had aided the Byzantines against the Hungarians in Syrmia Tihomir most likely saw Nemanja's ties with Manuel I as a threat Nemanja had monasteries built in Kuršumlija and near Kosanica without the approval of Tihomir Nemanja thought he had the freedom to do so while Tihomir disagreed thinking that Nemanja sought independence as he had close relations with Manuel I
Tihomir had Nemanja imprisoned and his lands taken Nemanja's supporters conspired to the church that Tihomir had done all this because of his disapproval of church building thus the Serbian church turned against him Nemanja managed to escape and returned to his lands Now Nemanja mobilized an army possibly with Byzantine help Manuel I might have been displeased with Tihomir's acting and headed for the crown Tihomir Stracimir and Miroslav were defeated and expelled to Byzantium in As Nemanja had now become very powerful and the Byzantines had wanted to see Serbia weak by dividing it Manuel I now turned to the expelled brothers Tihomir provided with an army was dispatched from Skopje and met Nemanja's large army near Zvečan Nemanja decisively defeated him at Pantino with Tihomir drowning in the Sitnica river and then proceeded to capture his other brothers with whom he made peace and offered their former lands in return for recognizing him as the only ruler of Serbia
The important Via de Zenta a trade route connecting the Adriatic with Serbia started from the mouth of the Bojana the Shkodër Skadar port alternatively Bar then Cetinje along the Drin Valley to Prizren then to Lipljan then through Novo Brdo to Vranje and Niš The Republic of Venice and Ragusa used the road for trade with Serbia and Bulgaria
John Kinnamos writing about the Byzantine conquest of Galič near Kosovska Mitrovica in said that many barbarians were imprisoned who were partly warriors and partly cattle breeders
William the archbishop of Tyre when crossing Serbia for the Holy Land in he described the Serbs They are rich in herds and flocks and unusually well supplied with milk cheese butter meat honey and wax
In th and th centuries the Republic of Ragusa benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost of the rising and prosperous Serbian state specially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First Crowned Later in Uroš signed a treaty with Ragusa imposing the so called St Demetrious Revenue Svetodimitarski dohodak by which Ragusans were to pay to Serbian king hyperperi a year
