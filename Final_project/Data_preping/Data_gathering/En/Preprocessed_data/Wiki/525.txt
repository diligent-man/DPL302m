The Turkish coup d'état Turkish Mayıs Darbesi was the first coup d'état in the Republic of Turkey It took place on May The coup was staged by a group of young Turkish military officers acting outside the military chain of command The officers were de facto led by Cemal Madanoğlu until the actual coup date After a threat by Ragıp Gümüşpala that he would move to quell the coup unless it is led by someone with a higher military rank than himself the officers brought in General Cemal Gürsel as their leader The coup was carried out against the democratically elected government of the Democrat Party and ultimately resulted in the execution of its prime minister Adnan Menderes alongside two of his ministers Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Hasan Polatkan
The incident took place at a time of both socio political turmoil and economic hardship as US aid from the Truman doctrine and the Marshall Plan was running out and so Prime Minister Adnan Menderes planned to visit Moscow in the hope of establishing alternative lines of credit
Colonel Alparslan Türkeş was among the officers who led the coup He was a member of the junta National Unity Committee and had been among the first officers trained by the United States in to form a stay behind counter guerrilla As such he explicitly stated his anticommunism and his faith and allegiance to NATO and CENTO in his short address to nation but he remained vague on the reasons of the coup On the morning of May Türkeş declared the coup over radio which ultimately announced the end of one period in Turkish history and usher in a new one
In a press conference on the following day Cemal Gürsel emphasized that the purpose and the aim of the coup is to bring the country with all speed to a fair clean and solid democracy I want to transfer power and the administration of the nation to the free choice of the people However a younger group tr within the junta around Türkeş supported a steadfast military leadership an authoritarian rule similar as it was in Ottoman times or during Mustafa Kemal Atatürks Government This group then attempted to discharge from their offices University teachers This then led to a reaction from the officers within the junta who demanded a return to democracy and a multiparty system following which Türkeş and his group were sent abroad
The junta forced generals and more than other commissioned officers into retirement purged more than judges and public prosecutors and university faculty members and put the chief of the General Staff the president the prime minister and other members of the administration under arrest Several hundred Kurdish Alevi notables were detained in a Camp in Sivas of which most were affiliated with the DP and several were Kurdish Members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey were deported to western provinces It followed by the appointment of the commander of the army General Cemal Gürsel as the provisional head of state prime minister and the minister of defense
