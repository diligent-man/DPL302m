it took place on may
the coup was staged by a group of young turkish military officers acting outside the military chain of command
the officers were de facto led by cemal madano lu until the actual coup date
after a threat by rag p g m pala that he would move to quell the coup unless it is led by someone with a higher military rank than himself the officers brought in general cemal g rsel as their leader
the coup was carried out against the democratically elected government of the democrat party and ultimately resulted in the execution of its prime minister adnan menderes alongside two of his ministers fatin r t zorlu and hasan polatkan
the incident took place at a time of both socio political turmoil and economic hardship as us aid from the truman doctrine and the marshall plan was running out and so prime minister adnan menderes planned to visit moscow in the hope of establishing alternative lines of credit

in a press conference on the following day cemal g rsel emphasized that the purpose and the aim of the coup is to bring the country with all speed to a fair clean and solid democracy
i want to transfer power and the administration of the nation to the free choice of the people however a younger group tr within the junta around t rke supported a steadfast military leadership an authoritarian rule similar as it was in ottoman times or during mustafa kemal atat rks government
this group then attempted to discharge from their offices university teachers
this then led to a reaction from the officers within the junta who demanded a return to democracy and a multiparty system following which t rke and his group were sent abroad
