shams al d n ab abd all h mu ammad ibn a mad ibn ab bakr al maqdis arabic better known as al maqdis arabic or al muqaddas arabic c
was a medieval arab geographer author of a san al taq s m f ma rifat al aq l m the best divisions in the knowledge of the regions as well as author of the book description of syria including palestine
he is one of the earliest known historical figures to self identify as a palestinian during his travels
outside of his own work there is little biographical information available about al maqdisi
he is neither found in the voluminous biographies of ibn khallikan d
nor were the aspects of his life mentioned in the works of his contemporaries
he was born in jerusalem in c and belonged to a middle class family whose roots in the city s environs dated from the period approximate to the th century muslim conquest
according to historian andr miquel al maqdisi was very much attached to the palestine of his birth and to the town whose name he bears
al maqdis or alternatively al muqaddas was a nisba indicating that he was from bayt al maqdis or bayt al muqaddas the muslim names for jerusalem
his paternal grandfather abu bakr al banna had been responsible for the construction of acre s maritime fortifications under orders from ahmad ibn tulun r
the autonomous abbasid governor of egypt and syria
al maqdisi s maternal grandfather abu tayyib al shawwa moved to jerusalem from biyar in khurasan and was also an architect
as can be inferred by his work and social background al maqdisi was likely well educated
miquel asserts that al maqdisi s use of rhymed prose even poetry is indicative of a strong knowledge in arabic grammar and literature
likewise his writings show that he possessed an early interest in islamic jurisprudence history philology and hadith
al maqdisi made his first hajj pilgrimage to mecca in
during this period he became determined to devote himself to the study of geography
to acquire the necessary information he undertook a series of journeys throughout the islamic world ultimately visiting all of its lands with the exception of al andalus iberian peninsula sindh and sistan
the known dates or date ranges of al maqdisi s travels include his journey to aleppo sometime between and his second pilgrimage to mecca in a visit to khurasan in and his stay in shiraz in when he decided to compose his material
the finished work was titled a san al taq s m fi ma arfat al aqal m the best divisions for the knowledge of the provinces
though possibly influenced by predecessors al jahiz d
who introduced the science of countries and ibn al faqih fl
al maqdisi surpassed both all to the advantage of what certainly should be called a true geography according to miquel
moreover miquel surmises that al maqdisi was probably the first to have desired and conceived true geography as an original science an assertion that al maqdisi himself makes in the preface of a san al taq s m
he belonged to the school known as the atlas of islam inaugurated by abu zayd al balkhi d
and developed by istakhri d
and al maqdisi s contemporary ibn hawqal d
al balkhi s school almost exclusively dealt with the islamic world to which al maqdisi too devoted his studies
al maqdisi refers to this world as al mamlaka or al isl m the domain of islam a unique concept in which all of the lands of islam constituted a single domain
he subdivided this domain into two parts mamlakat al arab domain of the arabs and mamlakat al ajam domain of the non arabs
the former consisted from east to west of the six provinces of iraq aqur upper mesopotamia arabia syria egypt and the maghreb while the latter consisted of the eight provinces of the mashriq sistan afghanistan khurasan and transoxiana sindh kirman fars khuzistan jibal daylam and rihab armenia adharbayjan and aran
a san al taq s m gives a systematic account of all the places and regions al maqdisi had visited
he devoted a section of his book to bilad al sham the levant with a particular focus on palestine
in contrast to travelers to palestine such as arculf c
s nasir khusraw c
s and others who were pilgrims al maqdisi gave detailed insights into the region s population way of life economy and climate
he paid special attention to jerusalem detailing its layout walls streets markets public structures and landmarks particularly the haram ash sharif temple mount and the latter s dome of the rock and al aqsa mosque
he described the city s people and customs focusing on its muslims but also its christian and jewish communities whose significant presence he lamented
al maqdisi also gave extensive overviews of ramla and tiberias the capitals of the palestine and jordan districts respectively
to a lesser extent he described acre beisan bayt jibrin caesarea amman and aila
in his descriptions of the aforementioned cities al maqdisi noted their prosperity and stability and gave a general impression of palestine as densely populated and wealthy with numerous localities
guy le strange comments on al maqdisi s work al maqdisi mentioned regions in eastern arabia which form parts of what are now saudi arabia the uae and oman
al hasa is an important oasis region in the eastern part of saudi arabia whereas tuwwam is another oasis region split between the uae and oman comprising the modern settlements of al ain and al buraimi on different sides of the omani uae border
