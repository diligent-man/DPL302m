david langford wrote review seems entirely logical christopher priest's latest novel centre stage magic magicians
particular brand misdirection lie heart theatrical conjuring also favourite priest literary ploy art much fooling audience encouraging fool themselves
final section strange indeed gothic science fiction flavour heavy metaphorical power
revelation implied peculiar nature angiertesla effect's payoff 'prestige' term used sense magicians
trick done priest ha rolled sleeve hand empty fix honest look
extraordinary performance best book year perhaps best ever
publisher weekly said complex tale must extremely difficult tell exactly right sequence still maintaining series shock end
fair say though book's considerable narrative grip principal virtue
character incident decidedly gothic cast restraint mark story's telling keep rails
elizabeth hand wrote certain amount grim humor prestige blatant can-you-top-this careerism dueling prestidigitator whose feud carried lush backdrop fin-de-sicle london
novel provides pleasure mystery well reader attempt find man men behind curtain discover true parentage andrew westley may may related borden
core prestige horror novel particularly terrifying one secret revealed slowly splendid language
prestige disturbing exhilarating one close book shaken wondering wa done eager see master illusionist produce next trick
priest weave together tale two feuding stage magician turn century dark mesmerising story see two men become consumed eventually destroyed obsession
film hammer head clue final twist much feel embarrassed re-watching priest's novel subtle although smart reader trick start
real beauty novel character fleshed fully screen magical element story achieve fantastical creepy edge
enjoyed film priest's novel grander scope chilling nature gem ignored
guardian review said behind surface trickery lie intelligent thoughtful novel nature illusion secrecy damage done appoint keeper dangerous secrets
review kliatt audiobook version narrated simon vance described spellbinding entirely original neo-gothic thriller move listener adroitly world staged illusion otherworldly historicalto horror-laden sort strange dazzling stop along way
plot convoluted occasionally technical spanning generation incorporating multiple narrator large cast characters
lesser audiobook narrator might inadvertently muddle story usual vance display dramatic vocal range equal task
