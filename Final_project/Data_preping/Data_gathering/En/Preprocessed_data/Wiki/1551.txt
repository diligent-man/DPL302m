the ewart park phase is a period of the later bronze age britain
it is named after a founder s hoard discovered in ewart park in northumberland and is the twelfth in a sequence of industrial stages that cover the period bc to bc
the ewart park phase dates from to bc preceded by the wilburton complex in the south and the wallington complex and poldar phase in the north
there are several regional sub groups including the carp s tongue complex in the south east the llantwit stogursey tradition in south wales the broadward complex in the welsh marches the heathery burn tradition in the north and the scottish duddington covesea and ballimore traditions
the irish parallel is the dowris phase
alloying metal with lead became a common practice during the period and numerous hoards date to this period
in common with the continental hallstatt culture horse harnesses and vehicle fittings were developed and links with the late urnfield culture and hallstatt early c are apparent
recently the ewart park phase and related atlantic phases have come to be seen as the probable point of origin of some developments in metalwork that then spread widely across inland continental europe
this reverses the previously assumed direction of travel
the types concerned include swords winged chapes and buckets
according to the portable antiquities scheme
most bronze age swords in museum collections in britain come from the ewart park phase
generally these swords have a bulging shape in the blade at the midway point before narrowing towards the shoulders and the terminal which is fan shaped
size and number of rivets vary greatly
these swords developed from the wilburton swords with little influence from the continent and it appears they first occurred in northern britain
the ewart park phase was succeeded by the llyn fawr phase which is parallel to hallstatt c proper
