A number of elements from the novel are believed to reflect MacLennan's life
Catherine Stewart is believed to have been inspired by MacLennan's first wife Dorothy Duncan who was dying of the same ailment Catherine suffers from while MacLennan was writing the novel
Another major character Jerome Martell is generally thought to have been inspired by Norman Bethune a claim the author denied
MacLennan's biographer Elspeth Cameron points to F
Scott and Samuel MacLennan the author's father as models for Martell
MacLennan in a newspaper article referring to his neurologist Dr
Reuben Rabinovitch of Montreal wrote When my novel ‘The Watch That Ends The Night’ appeared it was widely believed that its doctor-protagonist Dr
Jerome Martell was modeled on the famous Dr
He wasn’t for I never knew Bethune
But Martell’s way of dealing with his patients was Dr
This is not to suggest that Martell was modeled off him he wasn’t
But if I had not known Dr
Rab I could never have understood Dr
Martell's life history was also notably quite similar to that of Dr
Douglas Gibson Hugh MacLennan's friend and publisher wrote Hugh later suggested that a real-life model for Jerome Martell was actually Frank Scott the poet McGill Law School scholar and leader of Montreal left-wing politics who became one of the founders of the CCF party
