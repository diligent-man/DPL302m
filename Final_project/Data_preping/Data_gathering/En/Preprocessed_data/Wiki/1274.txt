Worcester v Georgia US Pet was a landmark case in which the United States Supreme Court vacated the conviction of Samuel Worcester and held that the Georgia criminal statute that prohibited non Native Americans from being present on Native American lands without a license from the state was unconstitutional
The opinion is most famous for its dicta which laid out the relationship between tribes and the state and federal governments It is considered to have built the foundations of the doctrine of tribal sovereignty in the United States
Samuel Austin Worcester was a missionary to the Cherokee translator of the Bible printer and defender of the Cherokee's sovereignty He collaborated with Elias Boudinot in the American Southeast to establish the Cherokee Phoenix the first Native American newspaper
During this period the westward push of European American settlers was continually encroaching on Cherokee territory even after they had made some land cessions to the US government With the help of Worcester and his sponsor the American Board they made a plan to fight the encroachment by using the courts They wanted to take a case to the US Supreme Court to define the relationship between the federal and state governments and establish the sovereignty of the Cherokee nation Hiring William Wirt a former US Attorney General the Cherokee argued their position before the US Supreme Court in Georgia v Tassel the court granted a writ of error for a Cherokee convicted in a Georgia court for a murder occurring in Cherokee territory though the state refused to accept the writ and Cherokee Nation v Georgia the court dismissed this on technical grounds for lack of jurisdiction In writing the majority opinion Chief Justice Marshall described the Cherokee Nation as a domestic dependent nation with no rights binding on a state
Worcester and eleven other missionaries met and published a resolution in protest of an Georgia law prohibiting all white men from living on Native American land without a state license While the state law was an effort to restrict white settlement on Cherokee territory Worcester reasoned that obeying the law would in effect be surrendering the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation to manage their own territory Once the law had taken effect Governor George Rockingham Gilmer ordered the militia to arrest Worcester and the others who signed the document and refused to get a license
After two series of trials all eleven men were convicted and sentenced to four years of hard labor at the state penitentiary in Milledgeville Nine accepted pardons but Worcester and Elizur Butler declined their pardons so the Cherokee could take the case to the Supreme Court William Wirt argued the case but Georgia refused to have a legal counsel represent it because the state believed the Supreme Court did not have authority to hear the case
Chief Justice John Marshall laid out in this opinion that the relationship between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations He reasoned that the United States in the character of the federal government inherited the legal rights of The Crown Those rights he stated included the sole right to negotiate with the Indian nations of North America to the exclusion of all other European powers This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion but those are in the hands of the federal government and individual states had no authority in American Indian affairs Georgia's statute was therefore invalid
Associate Justice Henry Baldwin dissented stating that in his opinion the record was not properly returned upon the writ of error and ought to have been returned by the State court of Georgia and not by the clerk of the Court of Gwinnett County As to the merits he said that his opinion remained the same as was expressed by him in the case of the Cherokee Nation v Georgia in
Marshall's language in Worcester may have been motivated by his regret that his earlier opinions in Fletcher v Peck and Johnson v M'Intosh had been used as a justification for Georgia's actions Joseph Story considered it similarly writing in a letter to his wife dated March Thanks be to God the Court can wash their hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights
In a popular quotation that is believed to be apocryphal President Andrew Jackson reportedly responded John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it This quotation first appeared twenty years after Jackson had died in newspaper publisher Horace Greeley's history of the US Civil War The American Conflict It was however reported in the press in March that Jackson was unlikely to aid in carrying out the court's decision if his assistance were to be requested In an April letter to John Coffee Jackson wrote that the decision of the Supreme Court has fell still born and they find that they cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate In a letter in March Virginia politician David Campbell reported a private conversation in which Jackson had sportively suggested calling on the Massachusetts state militia to enforce the order if the Supreme Court requested he intervene because Jackson believed Northern partisans had brought about the court's ruling
The Court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision Worcester thus imposed no obligations on Jackson there was nothing for him to enforce although Jackson's' political enemies conspired to find evidence to be used in the forthcoming political election to claim that he would refuse to enforce the Worcester decision Under the Judiciary Act of Supreme Court cases were to be remanded back down to the lower court for final execution of the Supreme Court's judgment The Supreme Court could only execute the final judgment in cases where the lower court failed to act on the Supreme Court's directive Shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling had been issued in March the court recessed for the term and would not convene again for the following term until January
The Supreme Court's March ruling ordered that Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler be freed from prison On March Worcester's lawyers petitioned the Georgia court to release Worcester but the court refused Over the following months Worcester's lawyers petitioned the newly elected governor of Georgia Wilson Lumpkin to offer an unconditional pardon but Lumpkin declined on the basis that the federal government was overstepping its authority At the same time the federal government under Secretary of War Lewis Cass began an intensive campaign to secure a removal treaty with the Cherokee nation which would render the Supreme Court decision and Worcester's continued political imprisonment inconsequential On November Lumpkin delivered his annual message to the Georgia state legislature announcing he would continue to resist the Supreme Court's decision
Eighteen days later on November the state of South Carolina issued an Ordinance of Nullification a separate attempt to defy federal authority This began a series of events known as the Nullification Crisis In an effort to isolate Georgia from South Carolina the Jackson administration changed course in their approach to the Worcester decision Secretary of War Lewis Cass US Senator John Forsyth of Georgia incoming Vice President Martin Van Buren and Van Buren's political allies of the Albany Regency began to lobby Lumpkin to offer a pardon citing the probability that a removal treaty with the Cherokees could be achieved once Worcester and Butler were released from prison To sustain his states' rights position Lumpkin stipulated that Worcester and Butler had to petition for the pardon with an admission they had violated state law The two missionaries at first refused because the Supreme Court decision had ruled they had not broken any law The two decided to continue their appeal once the Supreme Court convened in early
The national situation began to deteriorate in December On December Andrew Jackson issued a Nullification Proclamation denouncing nullification in South Carolina declaring secession to be unconstitutional and proclaiming the United States government would resort to force if South Carolina did not back down Further entreaties by Georgia politicians and representatives of the federal government convinced Worcester and Butler of the risk to the Cherokee nation if Georgia were to join South Carolina's attempt at secession Worcester and Butler began to reconsider their appeal to the Supreme Court
On December Georgia repealed the law that had put Worcester and Butler in prison allowing them to petition for a pardon without having to take an oath to leave the state of Georgia or Cherokee land On January the missionaries petitioned for their pardon but it did not contain an admission they had broken state law and Lumpkin believed its wording was insulting to the state of Georgia Representatives for both sides negotiated for a new letter to be drafted by the missionaries which was delivered to Lumpkin the following day In the final letter Worcester and Butler appealed to the magnanimity of the State of Georgia to end their prison sentences On January Lumpkin issued a general proclamation not a formal pardon Worcester and Butler were freed from prison
Two days later on January President Andrew Jackson sent a message to Congress requesting the military power to put down the South Carolina insurrection This request would be granted in the form of the Force Bill Worcester and Butler were criticized by supporters of the Nullification effort accusing them of aiding Jackson's effort to inaugurate war against South Carolina
On January Worcester and Butler arrived back at New Echota the capital of the Cherokee Nation In February they sent a letter to the Missionary Herald explaining that their abandonment of the Supreme Court case was not from any change in our views but on account of changing circumstances
On December members of the Cherokee nation signed the controversial removal treaty the Treaty of New Echota which was immediately protested by the large majority of the Cherokees Samuel Worcester moved to the Cherokee nation's western Indian Territory in after removal had commenced Worcester resumed his ministry continued translating the Bible into Cherokee and established the first printing press in that part of the United States working with the Cherokee to publish their newspaper
In his Pulitzer Prize winning book The Supreme Court in United States History Charles Warren asserted that the sequence of events in the aftermath of the Worcester case allowed the Supreme Court to go from its lowest point in history in late to its strongest position in fifteen years by early In Justice Stephen Breyer observed that the Supreme Court was an obvious winner in the case once its judgment was enforced but the Cherokee nation was the obvious loser since the judgment did not benefit them in any way Because Jackson proceeded with Cherokee removal Worcester did not aid indigenous rights at the time Removal of the Cherokee nation would begin just three years after Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler were released from Georgia prison and forced migration would commence via the Trail of Tears in
Worcester has been cited in several later opinions on the subject of tribal sovereignty in the United States
