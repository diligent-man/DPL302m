in he was decorated with the dsc for torpedoing a german destroyer off the french coast part of an action which defeated the only remaining surface force that might have interfered with the normandy landings
reading friedrich hayek s the road to serfdom on his destroyer aroused his interest in attending the lse where hayek taught
a first in political science and a prize winning essay won him a henry ford fellowship to yale where he graduated ma in

that metaphysical propositions can influence scientific theorizing is indeed arguably watkins most lasting contribution to philosophy
he introduced a distinction between confirmable and influential metaphysics
according to fred d agostino
in watkins published hobbes s system of ideas in which he argued that thomas hobbes s political theory follows from his philosophical ideas
at an international symposium on criticism and the growth of knowledge held in london in watkins replied to a paper in which thomas s
kuhn had compared his own theory of scientific revolutions with popper s falsificationism
he saw a clash between
kuhn s view of the scientific community as an essentially closed society intermittently shaken by collective nervous breakdowns followed by restored mental unison and popper s view that the scientific community ought to be and to a considerable degree actually is an open society in which no theory however dominant and successful no paradigm to use kuhn s term is ever sacred his most important work was science and scepticism published in
in it he tried to succeed where descartes failed and show how science could survive in the face of scepticism
in his book human freedom after darwin posthumously published in he returned to a problem that had long occupied him besides those about the influence of metaphysics on science watkins wrote classic and much anthologised papers about methodological individualism and about historical explanation
hobbes s system of ideas a study in the political significance of philosophical theories
