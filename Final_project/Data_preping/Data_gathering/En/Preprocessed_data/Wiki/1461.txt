That metaphysical propositions can influence scientific theorizing is indeed arguably Watkins' most lasting contribution to philosophy He introduced a distinction between confirmable and influential metaphysics According to Fred D'Agostino
In Watkins published Hobbes's System of Ideas in which he argued that Thomas Hobbes's political theory follows from his philosophical ideas
At an international symposium on Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge held in London in Watkins replied to a paper in which Thomas S Kuhn had compared his own theory of scientific revolutions with Popper's falsificationism He saw a clash between
Kuhn's view of the scientific community as an essentially closed society intermittently shaken by collective nervous breakdowns followed by restored mental unison and Popper's view that the scientific community ought to be and to a considerable degree actually is an open society in which no theory however dominant and successful no 'paradigm' to use Kuhn's term is ever sacred His most important work was Science and Scepticism published in In it he tried to succeed where Descartes failed and show how science could survive in the face of scepticism In his book Human Freedom after Darwin posthumously published in he returned to a problem that had long occupied him Besides those about the influence of metaphysics on science Watkins wrote classic and much anthologised papers about methodological individualism and about historical explanation
