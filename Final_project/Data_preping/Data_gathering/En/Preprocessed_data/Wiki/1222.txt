red blood cells rbcs also referred to as red cells red blood corpuscles in humans or other animals not having nucleus in red blood cells haematids erythroid cells or erythrocytes from greek erythros for red and kytos for hollow vessel with cyte translated as cell in modern usage are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate s principal means of delivering oxygen o to the body tissues via blood flow through the circulatory system
rbcs take up oxygen in the lungs or in fish the gills and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body s capillaries
the cytoplasm of a red blood cell is rich in hemoglobin an iron containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells and the blood
each human red blood cell contains approximately million hemoglobin molecules
the cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability of the blood cell while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network
in humans mature red blood cells are flexible biconcave disks
they lack a cell nucleus and organelles to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin with a plasma membrane as the sack
approximately million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults
the cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages
each circulation takes about seconds one minute
approximately of the cells in the human body are trillion red blood cells
nearly half of the blood s volume to is red blood cells
packed red blood cells prbc are red blood cells that have been donated processed and stored in a blood bank for blood transfusion
the vast majority of vertebrates including mammals and humans have red blood cells
red blood cells are cells present in blood to transport oxygen
the only known vertebrates without red blood cells are the crocodile icefish family channichthyidae they live in very oxygen rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood
while they no longer use hemoglobin remnants of hemoglobin genes can be found in their genome
vertebrate red blood cells consist mainly of hemoglobin a complex metalloprotein containing heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily bind to oxygen molecules o in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body
oxygen can easily diffuse through the red blood cell s cell membrane
hemoglobin in the red blood cells also carries some of the waste product carbon dioxide back from the tissues most waste carbon dioxide however is transported back to the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs as bicarbonate hco dissolved in the blood plasma
myoglobin a compound related to hemoglobin acts to store oxygen in muscle cells
the color of red blood cells is due to the heme group of hemoglobin
the blood plasma alone is straw colored but the red blood cells change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color
however blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin
pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques
hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color
flushed confused patients with a saturation reading of on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning
having oxygen carrying proteins inside specialized cells as opposed to oxygen carriers being dissolved in body fluid was an important step in the evolution of vertebrates as it allows for less viscous blood higher concentrations of oxygen and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues
the size of red blood cells varies widely among vertebrate species red blood cell width is on average about larger than capillary diameter and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from red blood cells to tissues
the red blood cells of mammals are typically shaped as biconcave disks flattened and depressed in the center with a dumbbell shaped cross section and a torus shaped rim on the edge of the disk
this shape allows for a high surface area to volume sa v ratio to facilitate diffusion of gases
however there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order even toed ungulates including cattle deer and their relatives which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels family camelidae tiny spherical cells in mouse deer family tragulidae and cells which assume fusiform lanceolate crescentic and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti family cervidae
members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm
overall mammalian red blood cells are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape where they efficiently release their oxygen load
red blood cells in mammals are unique amongst vertebrates as they do not have nuclei when mature
they do have nuclei during early phases of erythropoiesis but extrude them during development as they mature this provides more space for hemoglobin
the red blood cells without nuclei called reticulocytes subsequently lose all other cellular organelles such as their mitochondria golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum
the spleen acts as a reservoir of red blood cells but this effect is somewhat limited in humans
in some other mammals such as dogs and horses the spleen sequesters large numbers of red blood cells which are dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity
a typical human red blood cell has a disk diameter of approximately m and a thickness at the thickest point of m and a minimum thickness in the centre of m being much smaller than most other human cells
these cells have an average volume of about fl with a surface area of about m and can swell up to a sphere shape containing fl without membrane distension
adult humans have roughly trillion red blood cells at any given time constituting approximately of all cells by number
women have about million red blood cells per microliter cubic millimeter of blood and men about million people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will have more
red blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles there are about white blood cells and about platelets per microliter
human red blood cells take on average seconds to complete one cycle of circulation
the blood s red color is due to the spectral properties of the hemic iron ions in hemoglobin
each hemoglobin molecule carries four heme groups hemoglobin constitutes about a third of the total cell volume
hemoglobin is responsible for the transport of more than of the oxygen in the body the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the blood plasma
the red blood cells of an average adult human male store collectively about grams of iron representing about of the total iron contained in the body
red blood cells in mammals anucleate when mature meaning that they lack a cell nucleus
in comparison the red blood cells of other vertebrates have nuclei the only known exceptions are salamanders of the genus batrachoseps and fish of the genus maurolicus
the elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate red blood cells has been offered as an explanation for the subsequent accumulation of non coding dna in the genome
the argument runs as follows efficient gas transport requires red blood cells to pass through very narrow capillaries and this constrains their size
in the absence of nuclear elimination the accumulation of repeat sequences is constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus which increases with genome size
nucleated red blood cells in mammals consist of two forms normoblasts which are normal erythropoietic precursors to mature red blood cells and megaloblasts which are abnormally large precursors that occur in megaloblastic anemias
red blood cells are deformable flexible are able to adhere to other cells and are able to interface with immune cells
their membrane plays many roles in this
these functions are highly dependent on the membrane composition
the red blood cell membrane is composed of layers the glycocalyx on the exterior which is rich in carbohydrates the lipid bilayer which contains many transmembrane proteins besides its lipidic main constituents and the membrane skeleton a structural network of proteins located on the inner surface of the lipid bilayer
half of the membrane mass in human and most mammalian red blood cells are proteins
the other half are lipids namely phospholipids and cholesterol
the red blood cell membrane comprises a typical lipid bilayer similar to what can be found in virtually all human cells
simply put this lipid bilayer is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal proportions by weight
the lipid composition is important as it defines many physical properties such as membrane permeability and fluidity
additionally the activity of many membrane proteins is regulated by interactions with lipids in the bilayer
unlike cholesterol which is evenly distributed between the inner and outer leaflets the major phospholipids are asymmetrically disposed as shown below
outer monolayer
phosphatidylcholine pc
sphingomyelin sm inner monolayer
phosphatidylethanolamine pe
phosphoinositol pi small amounts
phosphatidylserine ps this asymmetric phospholipid distribution among the bilayer is the result of the function of several energy dependent and energy independent phospholipid transport proteins
proteins called flippases move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer while others called floppases do the opposite operation against a concentration gradient in an energy dependent manner
additionally there are also scramblase proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the same time down their concentration gradients in an energy independent manner
there is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane
the maintenance of an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the bilayer such as an exclusive localization of ps and pis in the inner monolayer is critical for the cell integrity and function due to several reasons
macrophages recognize and phagocytose red cells that expose ps at their outer surface
thus the confinement of ps in the inner monolayer is essential if the cell is to survive its frequent encounters with macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system especially in the spleen
premature destruction of thallassemic and sickle red cells has been linked to disruptions of lipid asymmetry leading to exposure of ps on the outer monolayer
an exposure of ps can potentiate adhesion of red cells to vascular endothelial cells effectively preventing normal transit through the microvasculature
thus it is important that ps is maintained only in the inner leaflet of the bilayer to ensure normal blood flow in microcirculation
both ps and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate pip can regulate membrane mechanical function due to their interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and protein r
recent studies have shown that binding of spectrin to ps promotes membrane mechanical stability
pip enhances the binding of protein band r to glycophorin c but decreases its interaction with protein band and thereby may modulate the linkage of the bilayer to the membrane skeleton the presence of specialized structures named lipid rafts in the red blood cell membrane have been described by recent studies
these are structures enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids associated with specific membrane proteins namely flotillins stomatins band g proteins and adrenergic receptors
lipid rafts that have been implicated in cell signaling events in nonerythroid cells have been shown in erythroid cells to mediate adregenic receptor signaling and increase camp levels and thus regulating entry of malarial parasites into normal red cells
the proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the deformability flexibility and durability of the red blood cell enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter of the red blood cell m and recovering the discoid shape as soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces in a similar fashion to an object made of rubber
there are currently more than known membrane proteins which can exist in a few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell
approximately of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens such as the a b and rh antigens among many others
these membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells as signaling receptors as well as other currently unknown functions
the blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells
disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis hereditary elliptocytosis hereditary stomatocytosis and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

the zeta potential is an electrochemical property of cell surfaces that is determined by the net electrical charge of molecules exposed at the surface of cell membranes of the cell
the normal zeta potential of the red blood cell is millivolts mv
much of this potential appears to be contributed by the exposed sialic acid residues in the membrane their removal results in zeta potential of mv
recall that respiration as illustrated schematically here with a unit of carbohydrate produces about as many molecules of carbon dioxide co as it consumes of oxygen o
displaystyle ce hcoh o co h o
thus the function of the circulatory system is as much about the transport of carbon dioxide as about the transport of oxygen
as stated elsewhere in this article most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is in the form of bicarbonate ion
the bicarbonate provides a critical ph buffer
thus unlike hemoglobin for o transport there is a physiological advantage to not having a specific co transporter molecule
red blood cells nevertheless play a key role in the co transport process for two reasons
first because besides hemoglobin they contain a large number of copies of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase on the inside of their cell membrane
carbonic anhydrase as its name suggests acts as a catalyst of the exchange between carbonic acid and carbon dioxide which is the anhydride of carbonic acid
because it is a catalyst it can affect many co molecules so it performs its essential role without needing as many copies as are needed for o transport by hemoglobin
in the presence of this catalyst carbon dioxide and carbonic acid reach an equilibrium very rapidly while the red cells are still moving through the capillary
thus it is the rbc that ensures that most of the co is transported as bicarbonate
at physiological ph the equilibrium strongly favors carbonic acid which is mostly dissociated into bicarbonate ion
displaystyle ce co h o h co hco h
the h ions released by this rapid reaction within rbc while still in the capillary act to reduce the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin the bohr effect
the second major contribution of rbc to carbon dioxide transport is that carbon dioxide directly reacts with globin protein components of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin compounds
as oxygen is released in the tissues more co binds to hemoglobin and as oxygen binds in the lung it displaces the hemoglobin bound co this is called the haldane effect
despite the fact that only a small amount of the co in blood is bound to hemoglobin in venous blood a greater proportion of the change in co content between venous and arterial blood comes from the change in this bound co
that is there is always an abundance of bicarbonate in blood both venous and arterial because of its aforementioned role as a ph buffer
in summary carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration diffuses very rapidly to areas of lower concentration specifically into nearby capillaries
when it diffuses into a rbc co is rapidly converted by the carbonic anhydrase found on the inside of the rbc membrane into bicarbonate ion
the bicarbonate ions in turn leave the rbc in exchange for chloride ions from the plasma facilitated by the band anion transport protein colocated in the rbc membrane
the bicarbonate ion does not diffuse back out of the capillary but is carried to the lung
in the lung the lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli causes carbon dioxide to diffuse rapidly from the capillary into the alveoli
the carbonic anhydrase in the red cells keeps the bicarbonate ion in equilibrium with carbon dioxide
so as carbon dioxide leaves the capillary and co is displaced by o on hemoglobin sufficient bicarbonate ion converts rapidly to carbon dioxide to maintain the equilibrium
when red blood cells undergo shear stress in constricted vessels they release atp which causes the vessel walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow
when their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated red blood cells release s nitrosothiols which also act to dilate blood vessels thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen
red blood cells can also synthesize nitric oxide enzymatically using l arginine as substrate as do endothelial cells
exposure of red blood cells to physiological levels of shear stress activates nitric oxide synthase and export of nitric oxide which may contribute to the regulation of vascular tonus
red blood cells can also produce hydrogen sulfide a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls
it is believed that the cardioprotective effects of garlic are due to red blood cells converting its sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfide
red blood cells also play a part in the body s immune response when lysed by pathogens such as bacteria their hemoglobin releases free radicals which break down the pathogen s cell wall and membrane killing it
as a result of not containing mitochondria red blood cells use none of the oxygen they transport instead they produce the energy carrier atp by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the resulting pyruvate
furthermore the pentose phosphate pathway plays an important role in red blood cells see glucose phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency for more information
as red blood cells contain no nucleus protein biosynthesis is currently assumed to be absent in these cells
because of the lack of nuclei and organelles mature red blood cells do not contain dna and cannot synthesize any rna and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities
the inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells
however infection with parvoviruses such as human parvovirus b can affect erythroid precursors while they still have dna as recognized by the presence of giant pronormoblasts with viral particles and inclusion bodies thus temporarily depleting the blood of reticulocytes and causing anemia
human red blood cells are produced through a process named erythropoiesis developing from committed stem cells to mature red blood cells in about days
when matured in a healthy individual these cells live in blood circulation for about to days and to days in a full term infant
at the end of their lifespan they are removed from circulation
in many chronic diseases the lifespan of the red blood cells is reduced
erythropoiesis is the process by which new red blood cells are produced it lasts about days
through this process red blood cells are continuously produced in the red bone marrow of large bones
in the embryo the liver is the main site of red blood cell production the production can be stimulated by the hormone erythropoietin epo synthesised by the kidney
just before and after leaving the bone marrow the developing cells are known as reticulocytes these constitute about of circulating red blood cells
the functional lifetime of a red blood cell is about days during which time the red blood cells are continually moved by the blood flow push in arteries pull in veins and a combination of the two as they squeeze through microvessels such as capillaries
they are also recycled in the bone marrow
the aging red blood cell undergoes changes in its plasma membrane making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system spleen liver and lymph nodes thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood
this process is termed eryptosis red blood cell programmed death
this process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis balancing the total circulating red blood cell count
eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis haemolytic uremic syndrome malaria sickle cell anemia beta thalassemia glucose phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency phosphate depletion iron deficiency and wilson s disease
eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock oxidative stress and energy depletion as well as by a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics
excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cgmp dependent protein kinase type i or the amp activated protein kinase ampk
inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin nitric oxide catecholamines and high concentrations of urea
much of the resulting breakdown products are recirculated in the body
the heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into iron fe and biliverdin
the biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin which is released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to albumin
the iron is released into the plasma to be recirculated by a carrier protein called transferrin
almost all red blood cells are removed in this manner from the circulation before they are old enough to hemolyze
hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called haptoglobin which is not excreted by the kidney
blood diseases involving the red blood cells include
anemias or anaemias are diseases characterized by low oxygen transport capacity of the blood because of low red cell count or some abnormality of the red blood cells or the hemoglobin iron deficiency anemia is the most common anemia it occurs when the dietary intake or absorption of iron is insufficient and hemoglobin which contains iron cannot be formedsickle cell disease is a genetic disease that results in abnormal hemoglobin molecules
when these release their oxygen load in the tissues they become insoluble leading to mis shaped red blood cells
these sickle shaped red cells are less deformable and viscoelastic meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage pain strokes and other tissue damage thalassemia is a genetic disease that results in the production of an abnormal ratio of hemoglobin subunits hereditary spherocytosis syndromes are a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in the red blood cell s cell membrane causing the cells to be small sphere shaped and fragile instead of donut shaped and flexible
these abnormal red blood cells are destroyed by the spleen
several other hereditary disorders of the red blood cell membrane are known pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease wherein the body lacks intrinsic factor required to absorb vitamin b from food
vitamin b is needed for the production of hemoglobin aplastic anemia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells pure red cell aplasia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce only red blood cells hemolysis is the general term for excessive breakdown of red blood cells
it can have several causes and can result in hemolytic anemia the malaria parasite spends part of its life cycle in red blood cells feeds on their hemoglobin and then breaks them apart causing fever
both sickle cell disease and thalassemia are more common in malaria areas because these mutations convey some protection against the parasite polycythemias or erythrocytoses are diseases characterized by a surplus of red blood cells
the increased viscosity of the blood can cause a number of symptoms in polycythemia vera the increased number of red blood cells results from an abnormality in the bone marrow several microangiopathic diseases including disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies present with pathognomonic diagnostic red blood cell fragments called schistocytes
these pathologies generate fibrin strands that sever red blood cells as they try to move past a thrombus red blood cells may be given as part of a blood transfusion
blood may be donated from another person or stored by the recipient at an earlier date
donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood borne diseases or will not suffer themselves by giving blood
blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious blood borne diseases including hepatitis b hepatitis c and hiv
the blood type a b ab or o or the blood product is identified and matched with the recipient s blood to minimise the likelihood of acute hemolytic transfusion reaction a type of transfusion reaction
this relates to the presence of antigens on the cell s surface
after this process the blood is stored and within a short duration is used
blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells
blood is often transfused when there is known anaemia active bleeding or when there is an expectation of serious blood loss such as prior to an operation
before blood is given a small sample of the recipient s blood is tested with the transfusion in a process known as cross matching
in it was reported that human embryonic stem cells had been successfully coaxed into becoming red blood cells in the lab
the difficult step was to induce the cells to eject their nucleus this was achieved by growing the cells on stromal cells from the bone marrow
it is hoped that these artificial red blood cells can eventually be used for blood transfusions
several blood tests involve red blood cells
these include a rbc count the number of red blood cells per volume of blood calculation of the hematocrit percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate
the blood type needs to be determined to prepare for a blood transfusion or an organ transplantation
many diseases involving red blood cells are diagnosed with a blood film or peripheral blood smear where a thin layer of blood is smeared on a microscope slide
this may reveal poikilocytosis which are variations in red blood cell shape
when red blood cells sometimes occur as a stack flat side next to flat side
this is known as rouleaux formation and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated as for instance during inflammation
red blood cells can be obtained from whole blood by centrifugation which separates the cells from the blood plasma in a process known as blood fractionation
packed red blood cells which are made in this way from whole blood with the plasma removed are used in transfusion medicine
during plasma donation the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected
some athletes have tried to improve their performance by blood doping first about litre of their blood is extracted then the red blood cells are isolated frozen and stored to be reinjected shortly before the competition
red blood cells can be conserved for weeks at c or f or over years using cryoprotectants this practice is hard to detect but may endanger the human cardiovascular system which is not equipped to deal with blood of the resulting higher viscosity
another method of blood doping involves injection with erythropoietin to stimulate production of red blood cells
both practices are banned by the world anti doping agency
the first person to describe red blood cells was the young dutch biologist jan swammerdam who had used an early microscope in to study the blood of a frog
unaware of this work anton van leeuwenhoek provided another microscopic description in this time providing a more precise description of red blood cells even approximating their size times smaller than a fine grain of sand
in the s vincenzo menghini in bologna was able to demonstrate the presence of iron by passing magnets over the powder or ash remaining from heated red blood cells
in karl landsteiner published his discovery of the three main blood groups a b and c which he later renamed to o
landsteiner described the regular patterns in which reactions occurred when serum was mixed with red blood cells thus identifying compatible and conflicting combinations between these blood groups
a year later alfred von decastello and adriano sturli two colleagues of landsteiner identified a fourth blood group ab
