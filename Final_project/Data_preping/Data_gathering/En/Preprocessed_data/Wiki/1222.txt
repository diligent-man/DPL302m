red blood cell membrane comprises typical lipid bilayer similar found virtually human cells
simply put lipid bilayer composed cholesterol phospholipid equal proportion weight
lipid composition important defines many physical property membrane permeability fluidity

protein called flippases move phospholipid outer inner monolayer others called floppases opposite operation concentration gradient energy-dependent manner
additionally also scramblase protein move phospholipid direction time concentration gradient energy-independent manner
still considerable debate ongoing regarding identity membrane maintenance protein red cell membrane
maintenance asymmetric phospholipid distribution bilayer exclusive localization p pi inner monolayer critical cell integrity function due several reasons
macrophage recognize phagocytose red cell expose p outer surface
thus confinement p inner monolayer essential cell survive frequent encounter macrophage reticuloendothelial system especially spleen
premature destruction thallassemic sickle red cell ha linked disruption lipid asymmetry leading exposure p outer monolayer

recall respiration illustrated schematically unit carbohydrate produce many molecule carbon dioxide co consumes oxygen o
thus function circulatory system much transport carbon dioxide transport oxygen
stated elsewhere article carbon dioxide blood form bicarbonate ion
thus unlike hemoglobin transport physiological advantage specific co transporter molecule
red blood cell nevertheless play key role co transport process two reasons
first besides hemoglobin contain large number copy enzyme carbonic anhydrase inside cell membrane
carbonic anhydrase name suggests act catalyst exchange carbonic acid carbon dioxide anhydride carbonic acid
catalyst affect many co molecule performs essential role without needing many copy needed transport hemoglobin
presence catalyst carbon dioxide carbonic acid reach equilibrium rapidly red cell still moving capillary
physiological ph equilibrium strongly favor carbonic acid mostly dissociated bicarbonate ion
h ion released rapid reaction within rbc still capillary act reduce oxygen binding affinity hemoglobin bohr effect
second major contribution rbc carbon dioxide transport carbon dioxide directly reacts globin protein component hemoglobin form carbaminohemoglobin compounds
oxygen released tissue co bind hemoglobin oxygen bind lung displaces hemoglobin bound co called haldane effect
despite fact small amount co blood bound hemoglobin venous blood greater proportion change co content venous arterial blood come change bound co
always abundance bicarbonate blood venous arterial aforementioned role ph buffer
summary carbon dioxide produced cellular respiration diffuses rapidly area lower concentration specifically nearby capillaries
diffuses rbc co rapidly converted carbonic anhydrase found inside rbc membrane bicarbonate ion
bicarbonate ion turn leave rbc exchange chloride ion plasma facilitated band anion transport protein colocated rbc membrane
bicarbonate ion doe diffuse back capillary carried lung
lung lower partial pressure carbon dioxide alveolus cause carbon dioxide diffuse rapidly capillary alveoli
carbonic anhydrase red cell keep bicarbonate ion equilibrium carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide leaf capillary co displaced hemoglobin sufficient bicarbonate ion convert rapidly carbon dioxide maintain equilibrium

red blood cell also play part body's immune response lysed pathogen bacteria hemoglobin release free radical break pathogen's cell wall membrane killing it
