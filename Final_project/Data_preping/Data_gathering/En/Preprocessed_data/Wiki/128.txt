Bradley left his studies to join the Los Angeles Police Department in
He became one of black officers in a police department that had officers
He recalled the downtown department store that refused him credit although he was a police officer and the restaurants that would not serve blacks He told a Times reporter
When I came on the department there were literally two assignments for black officers
You either worked Newton Street Division which has a predominantly black community or you worked traffic downtown
You could not work with a white officer and that continued until Bradley and Ethel Arnold met at the New Hope Baptist Church and were married May

Upon his leaving the office of mayor in he joined the law offices of Brobeck Phleger Harrison specializing in international trade issues
His entry into politics came when he decided to become the president of the United Club
The club was part of the California Democratic Council a liberal reformist group organized in the s by young Democrats energized by Adlai E
It was predominantly white and had many Jewish members thus marking the beginnings of the coalition which along with Latinos that would carry him to electoral victory so many times
His choice of a Democratic circle also put him at odds with another political force in the African American community representatives of poor all-black areas who were associated with the political organization of Jesse M
The early stage of Bradley's political career was marked by clashes with African American leaders like onetime California Lieutenant Governor and former US
In June the post for th District was vacated by Charles Navarro when he was elected city controller
Bradley a police lieutenant living at Welland Avenue was one of people to apply for the position
The City Council which had the power to fill a vacancy instead appointed Joe E
When the position was up for election again in April Bradley ran against Hollingsworth
There were only two candidates Hollingsworth and Bradley and also two elections — one for the unexpired term left by Controller Navarro ending June and one for a full four-year term starting July
Bradley won the first to votes and the second election to votes
By then he had retired from the police force and he was sworn in as a councilman at the age of on April the first African-American elected to City Council
One of the first votes was in opposition to a proposed study by City Attorney Roger Arnebergh and Police Chief William H
Parker of the Dictionary of American Slang ordered in an vote by the council
Councilman Tom Shepard's motion said the book was saturated not only with phrases of sexual filth but wordage defamatory of minority ethnic groups and definitions insulting religions and races

He expressed a desire to establish a human relations commission for the city
In Bradley first challenged incumbent Mayor Sam Yorty a conservative Democrat later Republican though the election was nonpartisan
Armed with key endorsements including the Los Angeles Times Bradley held a substantial lead over Yorty in the primary but was a few percentage points shy of winning the race outright
However Yorty pulled an amazing come from behind victory to win reelection
Yorty questioned Bradley's credibility in fighting crime and painted a picture of Bradley his fellow Democrat as a threat to Los Angeles because he would supposedly open up the city to feared Black Nationalists
Bradley did not use his record as a police officer in the election
With the racial factor even many liberal white voters became hesitant to support Bradley
It would be another four years in before Bradley would unseat Yorty
Powerful downtown business interests at first opposed him
But with passage of the redevelopment plan and the inclusion of business leaders on influential committees corporate chiefs moved comfortably in behind him
A significant feature of this plan was the development and building of numerous skyscrapers in the Bunker Hill financial district

Bradley introduced President Carter at the May dedication ceremony for the Los Angeles Placita de Dolores
Although Bradley was a political liberal he believed that business prosperity was good for the entire city and would generate jobs an outlook like that of his successor Riordan
For most of Bradley's long administration the city appeared to agree with him
But in his fourth term with traffic congestion air pollution and the condition of Santa Monica Bay worsening and with residential neighborhoods threatened by commercial development the tide began to turn
In he was elected to a fifth term but the ability of opponent Nate Holden to attract one-third of the vote despite being a neophyte to the Los Angeles City Council and a very late entrant to the mayoral race signaled that Bradley's era was drawing to a close
Other factors in the waning of his political strength were his decision to reverse himself and support a controversial oil drilling project near the Pacific Palisades and his reluctance to condemn Louis Farrakhan the Black Muslim minister who made speeches in Los Angeles and elsewhere that many considered anti-Semitic
Further some key Bradley supporters lost their City Council reelection bids among them veteran Westside Councilwoman Pat Russell
Bradley chose to leave office in rather than seek election to a sixth term
Bradley ran for Governor of California twice in and but lost both times to Republican George Deukmejian
