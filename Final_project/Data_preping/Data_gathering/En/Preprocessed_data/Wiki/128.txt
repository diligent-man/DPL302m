stevenson s presidential campaigns
it was predominantly white and had many jewish members thus marking the beginnings of the coalition which along with latinos that would carry him to electoral victory so many times
his choice of a democratic circle also put him at odds with another political force in the african american community representatives of poor all black areas who were associated with the political organization of jesse m
unruh then an up and coming state assemblyman
the early stage of bradley s political career was marked by clashes with african american leaders like onetime california lieutenant governor and former u s
representative mervyn dymally an unruh ally
in june the post for th district was vacated by charles navarro when he was elected city controller
bradley a police lieutenant living at welland avenue was one of people to apply for the position

one of the first votes was in opposition to a proposed study by city attorney roger arnebergh and police chief william h
parker of the dictionary of american slang ordered in an vote by the council

however yorty pulled an amazing come from behind victory to win reelection
yorty questioned bradley s credibility in fighting crime and painted a picture of bradley his fellow democrat as a threat to los angeles because he would supposedly open up the city to feared black nationalists
bradley did not use his record as a police officer in the election
with the racial factor even many liberal white voters became hesitant to support bradley
it would be another four years in before bradley would unseat yorty

city after new york also in
bradley introduced president carter at the may dedication ceremony for the los angeles placita de dolores
although bradley was a political liberal he believed that business prosperity was good for the entire city and would generate jobs an outlook like that of his successor riordan
for most of bradley s long administration the city appeared to agree with him
but in his fourth term with traffic congestion air pollution and the condition of santa monica bay worsening and with residential neighborhoods threatened by commercial development the tide began to turn
in he was elected to a fifth term but the ability of opponent nate holden to attract one third of the vote despite being a neophyte to the los angeles city council and a very late entrant to the mayoral race signaled that bradley s era was drawing to a close
other factors in the waning of his political strength were his decision to reverse himself and support a controversial oil drilling project near the pacific palisades and his reluctance to condemn louis farrakhan the black muslim minister who made speeches in los angeles and elsewhere that many considered anti semitic
