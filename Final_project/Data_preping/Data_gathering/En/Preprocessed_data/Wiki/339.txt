Yes My Darling Daughter is a song by Jack Lawrence first introduced by Dinah Shore on Eddie Cantor's radio program on October
It was Shore's first solo record released by Bluebird and peaked at No
The music used by Lawrence was borrowed from a Ukrainian folk-song Oi ne khody Hrytsju
The same melody had also been borrowed by Catterino Cavos for his vaudeville The Cossack-Poet although in the Cavos version it had had an entirely different text Yes of course he is my lover Так конечно он мой милый
Israeli musicologist Yakov Soroker posited the end of the first melodic phrase of Oi ne khody Hrytsiu contains a signature melody common in Ukrainian songs in general which he calls the Hryts sequence and gives a list of hundreds of Ukrainian folk songs from the Carpathians to the Kuban that contain this particular sequence
Lysko's collection of Ukrainian melodies was that of Ukrainian folk songs contain the sequence
Other scholars have also addressed the unique character and expressiveness of the Hryts sequence such as Alexander Serov who stated that the refrain exudes a spirit of freedom that transports the listener to the steppes and is mixed with the sorrow of some unexpected tragedy
Soroker notes the Hryts signature was used by composers Joseph Haydn String Quartet no
