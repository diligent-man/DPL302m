"Yes, My Darling Daughter" is a 1940 song by Jack Lawrence first introduced by Dinah Shore on Eddie Cantor's radio program on October 24, 1940
It was Shore's first solo record, released by  Bluebird, and peaked at No
10 on the Billboard magazine chart.
The music used by Lawrence was borrowed from a Ukrainian folk-song "Oi ne khody, Hrytsju",
The same melody had also been borrowed by Catterino Cavos for his vaudeville The Cossack-Poet, although in the Cavos version it had had an entirely different text: "Yes, of course, he is my lover..." ("Так, конечно, он мой милый...").
Israeli musicologist Yakov Soroker posited the end of the first melodic phrase of "Oi ne khody Hrytsiu" contains a "signature" melody common in Ukrainian songs in general which he calls the "Hryts sequence" and gives a list of hundreds of Ukrainian folk songs from the Carpathians to the Kuban that contain this particular sequence
His estimation, after studying Z
Lysko's collection of 9,077 Ukrainian melodies was that 6% of Ukrainian folk songs contain the sequence.
Other scholars have also addressed the unique character and expressiveness of the Hryts sequence, such as Alexander Serov, who stated that "the refrain exudes a spirit of freedom that transports the listener to the steppes and is mixed with the sorrow of some unexpected tragedy."
