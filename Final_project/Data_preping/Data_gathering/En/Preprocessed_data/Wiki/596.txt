The fourth encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet Chinese was the fourth campaign launched by the Chinese Nationalist Government in hope to destroy the Red Army in Jiangxi The Nationalist headquarters in the provincial border of Jiangxi Guangdong Fujian organized nearly men and prepared for another major encirclement on the Chinese Soviet Republic As a response the Jiangxi Soviet launched the fourth counter encirclement campaign at the Central Soviet Chinese also called as the fourth counter encirclement campaign at the Central Revolutionary Base Chinese Although the Red Army achieved victory once again their counter encirclement was not as successful as the previous ones this time and the Red Army elsewhere suffered considerable loss when many other communist bases were lost including two major ones
While launching encirclement campaigns against communist bases in the border region of Hunan western Hubei and the border region of Hubei Henan Anhui plans of the fourth encirclement against Jiangxi Soviet was already begun Nationalists planned to annihilate the first two communist bases and then concentrate on the last one He Yingqing was named as the frontline commander in chief and by October the nationalists had successfully completed the first half of their objective by destroying the communist bases in the border region of Hunan western Hubei and the border region of Hubei Henan Anhui and thus turned their attention to Jiangxi Soviet
In December He Yingqin had completed the mobilization of more than three dozen nationalist divisions totaling over half a million troops for the fourth encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet The nationalist troops were divided into three fronts with Chiang Kai shek's own troops as the central front totaling more than The central front shouldered the main responsibility of attacking the communist enemy while the left and right fronts were tasked to assist the main attack in the central front The rest of the nationalist force consisting around sixty percent of the half a million mobilized troops were tasked to develop and man the blockade line an effective strategy which would be proven in the next encirclement campaigns The nationalists planned to annihilate the communist main force in the regions of Jianning and Lichuan In January Chen Cheng the commander of nationalist central front further divided the nationalist troops under his command into three columns and begun their offensive against their communist enemy
The communists originally planned according to the new doctrines of Wang Ming by launching a preemptive strike against the nationalists before their mobilization and deployment was complete Communists would concentrate their forces to destroy nationalists in the regions of Fu River Fu Jiang first and then went on to score their victory in entire Jiangxi province To achieve this goal the th Army of the Chinese Red Army crossed Letter River Xin Jiang and jointed forces with the st Division of the Chinese Red Army forming the th Army of the Chinese Red Army By mid March communist formed the Chinese Red Army Southeastern Front Command which was in charge of communist forces organized into five columns in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian to coordinate their actions with the communists in the north bearing the brunt of the fighting

st Front Army of Chinese Red Army totaling over
nd ArmyIn early February the nationalist successful strategy of holding their position in the newly built fortifications with large troops prevailed Zhu De and Zhou Enlai the communist commander in chief and general political commissar of the Chinese Red Army realized it was simply impossible to destroy nationalist forces on the eastern bank of Fu River and decided to lead the communist main force to cross the Fu River and attack the town of Southern Abundance Nanfeng instead The two communist commanders also acknowledged that it was quite possible that the nationalists would not fall for the communist trick and communists had to give up the attempt to take the town of Southern Abundance Nanfeng and attack Yihuang and Yue'an instead so that the nationalists could be ambushed in mobile warfare in the mountains where the numerically and technically inferior communists had advantages over their nationalist adversary In the evening on February communist rd and th Legions of Chinese Red Army begun their attack on nationalist positions in the northwestern suburb of the town of Southern Abundance Nanfeng However the two brigades of the nationalist th Division successfully fended off the communist attacks by adopting the successful tactic of holding on to their positions in the fortifications instead of getting out and engaging the enemy in the open
Chen Cheng learned the news and immediately ordered the nationalist th Division to reinforce the town of Southern Abundance Nanfeng and in the meantime Chen Cheng also ordered the nationalist central front to speed southward to the region in order to trap and annihilate the communist main force Realizing the danger they would be in Zhu De and Zhou Enlai decided to give up the attempt to take town of Southern Abundance Nanfeng On February the th Army of the Chinese Red Army was ordered to disguise as the main force to move toward Lichuan by cross the Fu River at the region of New Abundance Street Xinfengjie While the nationalists were distracted the communist main force secretly moved to the regions of Dongshao and Luokou to wait for other opportunities to attack their nationalist adversary
He Yingqin erroneously believed that the communist main force had gathered in the region of Lichuan and ordered the nationalist central front to attack toward Lichuan and Guangchang The nationalist st Column was to attack and take Guangchang and Ningdu from Yihuang and Yue'an The nationalist nd Column was to attack Kangdu and take from Southern City Nancheng Southern Abundance Nanfeng The two nationalist columns would meet at Guangchang after annihilating their communist enemy The nationalist st Column had marched into mountains covered with thick forest and it was isolated from the nationalist nd and rd Columns so the communists decided to concentrate their forces to ambush nationalist nd and th Divisions of the st Column in the regions of Huangbi and Yihuang
On February the nationalist nd Division and th Division marched toward Huangbi from Yue'an on different routes separated by Moluozhang Mountain and they were ambushed by the waiting communists From the morning of February thru the afternoon of February after fierce fighting the nationalist nd Division was completely destroyed with its divisional commander Li Ming captured alive by the enemy The nationalist th Division suffered similar fate with its divisional commander Chen Shiji also captured alive by the enemy but a single regiment was successful in escape the enemy onslaught
After defeat at Huangbi the nationalists changed their strategy in the middle of March by attempting to break through in the center To do so the nationalist force was redeployed the nationalist nd Column became the vanguard while the nationalist st Column and the th Division and the th Division of the nationalist rd Column became the rearguard and two other divisions acted as the general reserve Nationalists attacked from regions of Dongbi and Huangbi toward Guangchang in attempt to lure out the communist main force for a decisive engagement The communists in turn deployed their th Army disguised as their main force in to the northwest of Guangchang to lure the nationalist vanguard further south while the communist main force itself moved northward to ambush the nationalist rearguard
On March the th Division of the nationalist rearguard had reached the region between Grass Stage Hill Caotaigang and Village of Xu Xuzhuang with the surviving regiment of the nationalist th Division following behind The nationalist th Division was still near Dongbi and was more than fifty kilometers away from the near nationalist forces On dawn of March the communist first launched the surprise attack on the unsuspecting nationalist th Division succeeding in completely destroying it in the region of Grass Stage Hill Caotaigang The next day the nationalist th Division at Dongbi was badly mauled by the communists Hearing the news of the disaster all other overstretched nationalist forces withdrew and ended the campaign to rest and regroup for future actions
The communist victory resulted in annihilating over thirty thousands nationalist troops including capturing more than ten thousands in addition the communists also managed to capture over ten thousands guns from the nationalists Although Mao Zedong had already lost power to Wang Ming in the internal power struggle his successful strategies proven in the previous encirclement campaigns were adopted one last time by Zhou Enlai who was the prot g of Wang Ming at the time and unlike other communists elsewhere who suffered disastrous defeats resulted in another victory However the communist jubilation would not last long for that as Wang Ming's new strategies were adopted in full the communist defeat in Jiangxi Soviet in the next encirclement campaigns would be far more catastrophic
Although the nationalist offensive was successfully repelled by the communists their victory was not complete in that most of the nationalist forces withdrawn did not return to their original posts but instead started building blockade lines along the border of Jiangxi Soviet thus begun the very successful tactic used in the next encirclement campaign Furthermore as Mao Zedong had lost power to Wang Ming his proven successful strategies were abolished and this campaign was the last time it was adopted Elsewhere communists suffered huge losses as Wang Ming's new strategies of static defense and clashing head on with numerical and technical superior nationalist forces were adopted resulting in communists losing most of their other bases including two major ones plus all of the smaller ones
