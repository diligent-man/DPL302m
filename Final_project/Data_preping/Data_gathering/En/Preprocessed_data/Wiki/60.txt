the tocharians or tokharians us to k ri n or to k ri n uk t k ri n were speakers of tocharian languages indo european languages known from around documents from around to ad found on the northern edge of the tarim basin modern xinjiang china
the name tocharian was given to these languages in the early th century by scholars who identified their speakers with a people known in ancient greek sources as the t kharoi latin tochari who inhabited bactria from the nd century bc
this identification is generally considered erroneous but the name tocharian remains the most common term for the languages and their speakers
their actual ethnic name is unknown although they may have referred to themselves as agni ku i and kror n or agniya kuchiya as known from sanskrit texts
agricultural communities first appeared in the oases of the northern tarim circa bc
some scholars have linked these communities to the afanasievo culture found earlier c bc in siberia north of the tarim or central asian bmac culture
the earliest tarim mummies which may not be connected to the tocharians date from c bc
by the nd century bc these settlements had developed into city states overshadowed by nomadic peoples to the north and chinese empires to the east
these cities the largest of which was kucha also served as way stations on the branch of the silk road that ran along the northern edge of the taklamakan desert
for several centuries the tarim basin was ruled by the xiongnu the han dynasty the tibetan empire and the tang dynasty
from the th century ad the uyghurs speakers of a turkic language settled in the region and founded the kingdom of qocho that ruled the tarim basin
the peoples of the tarim city states intermixed with the uyghurs whose old uyghur language spread through the region
the tocharian languages are believed to have become extinct during the th century
around the beginning of the th century archaeologists recovered a number of manuscripts from oases in the tarim basin written in two closely related but previously unknown indo european languages which were easy to read because they used a close variation of the already deciphered indian middle brahmi script
these languages were designated in similar fashion by their geographical neighbours
a buddhist work in old turkic uighur included a colophon stating that the text had been translated from sanskrit via toxr tyly t ry tyly the language of the togari
manichean texts in several languages of neighbouring regions used the expression the land of the four toghar to ar to ar written tw r to designate the area from kucha and karashar to qocho and beshbalik friedrich w
m ller was the first to propose a characterization for the newly discovered languages
m ller called the languages tocharian german tocharisch linking this toxr t ry togari with the ethnonym t kharoi ancient greek applied by strabo to one of the scythian tribes from the country on the other side of the iaxartes that overran the greco bactrian kingdom present day afghanistan pakistan in the second half of the nd century bc
this term also appears in indo iranian languages sanskrit tushara tukh ra old persian tux ri khotanese ttahv ra and became the source of the term tokharistan usually referring to st millennium bactria as well as the takhar province of afghanistan
the t kharoi are often identified by modern scholars with the yuezhi of chinese historical accounts who founded the kushan empire
m ller s identification became a minority position among scholars when it turned out that the people of tokharistan bactria spoke bactrian an eastern iranian language which is quite distinct from the tocharian languages
nevertheless tocharian remained the standard term for the languages of the tarim basin manuscripts and for the people who produced them
a few scholars argue that the yuezhi were originally speakers of tocharian who later adopted the bactrian language
the name of kucha in tocharian b was ku i with adjectival form ku i e
the word may be derived from proto indo european keuk shining white
the tocharian b word ake e may have referred to people of agni with a derivation meaning borderers marchers
one of the tocharian a texts has r i k ntw as a name for their own language so that r i may have meant agnean though monk is also possible
tocharian kings apparently gave themselves the title ktemts soy in tocharian b an equivalent of the title devaputra son of god of the kushans
the tocharian languages are known from around documents dating from about to ad found at sites in the northeast tarim area
the manuscripts are written in two distinct but closely related indo european languages conventionally known as tocharian a and tocharian b
tocharian a agnean or east tocharian was found in the northeastern oases known to the tocharians as r i later agni i e
chinese yanqi modern karasahr and turpan including khocho or qo o known in chinese as gaochang
some manuscripts have been studied in detail mostly coming from buddhist monasteries
many authors take this to imply that tocharian a had become a purely literary and liturgical language by the time of the manuscripts but it may be that the surviving documents are unrepresentative
tocharian b kuchean or west tocharian was found at all the tocharian a sites and also in several sites further west including kuchi later kucha
it appears to have still been in use in daily life at that time
over manuscripts have been studied in detail
the languages had significant differences in phonology morphology and vocabulary making them mutually unintelligible at least as much as modern germanic or romance languages
tocharian a shows innovations in the vowels and nominal inflection whereas tocharian b has changes in the consonants and verbal inflection
many of the differences in vocabulary between the languages concern buddhist concepts which may suggest that they were associated with different buddhist traditions
the differences indicate that they diverged from a common ancestor between and years before the earliest documents that is some time in the st millennium bc
common indo european vocabulary retained in tocharian includes words for herding cattle sheep pigs dogs
horses textiles farming wheat gold silver and wheeled vehicles
prakrit documents from rd century kror n andir and niya on the southeast edge of the tarim basin contain around loanwords and proper names that cannot be traced to an indic or iranian source
thomas burrow suggested that they come from a variety of tocharian dubbed tocharian c or kror nian which may have been spoken by at least some of the local populace
burrow s theory is widely accepted but the evidence is meagre and inconclusive and some scholars favour alternative explanations
mallory and victor h
mair wrote that the tarim was first settled by proto tocharian speakers from an eastern offshoot of the afanasevo culture to the north who migrated to the south and occupied the northern and eastern edges of the tarim basin
the afanasevo culture itself resulted from an eastern offshoot of the yamnaya culture originally based in the pontic steppe north of the caucasus mountains
the afanasevo culture c bc displays cultural and genetic connections with the indo european associated cultures of the central asian steppe yet predates the specifically indo iranian associated andronovo culture c bc
the early eastward expansion of the yamnaya culture circa bc is enough to account for the isolation of the tocharian languages from indo iranian linguistic innovations like satemization
micha l peyrot argues that several of the most striking typological peculiarities of tocharian are rooted in a prolonged contact of proto tocharian speaking afanasievans with speakers of an early stage of proto samoyedic in south siberia
among others this might explain the merger of all three stop series e g
t d d t which must have led to a huge amount of homonyms as well as the development of an agglutinative case system
the taklamakan desert is roughly oval in shape about km long and km wide surrounded on three sides by high mountains
the main part of the desert is sandy surrounded by a belt of gravel desert
the desert is completely barren but in the late spring the melting snows of the surrounding mountains feed streams which have been altered by human activity to create oases with mild microclimates and supporting intensive agriculture
on the northern edge of the basin these oases occur in small valleys before the gravels
on the southern edge they occur in alluvial fans on the edge of the sand zone
isolated alluvial fan oases also occur in the gravel deserts of the turpan depression to the east of the taklamakan
from around bc these oases supported bronze age settled agricultural communities of steadily increasing sophistication
the necessary irrigation technology was first developed during the rd millennium bc in the bactria margiana archaeological complex bmac to the west of the pamir mountains but it is unclear how it reached the tarim
the staple crops wheat and barley also originated in the west
the oldest of the tarim mummies bodies preserved by the desert conditions date from bc and were found on the eastern edge of the tarim basin
they seem to be caucasoid types with light colored hair
a genetic study of remains from the oldest layer of the xiaohe cemetery found that the maternal lineages were a mixture of east and west eurasian types while all the paternal lineages were of west eurasian type
it is unknown whether they are connected with the frescoes painted at tocharian sites more than two millennia later which also depict light eyes and hair color
the mummies were found with plaid woven tapestries that are notably similar to the weaving pattern of the tartan style of the hallstatt culture of central europe associated with celts the wool used in the tapestries was found to come from sheep with european ancestry
a genetic study demonstrated the tarim mummies are remains of locals descending from ancient north eurasians and northeast asians and instead suggested that tocharian may have been plausibly introduced to the dzungarian basin by afanasievo migrants i e
the afanasievo herders of the altai sayan region in southern siberia bc who in turn have close genetic ties with the yamnaya bc of the pontic caspian steppe located km to the west before being recorded in ce s buddhist scriptures
later groups of nomadic pastoralists moved from the steppe into the grasslands to the north and northeast of the tarim
they were the ancestors of peoples later known to chinese authors as the wusun and yuezhi
it is thought that at least some of them spoke iranian languages
but a minority of scholars suggest that the yuezhi were tocharian speakers
from the nd century bce the loulan kingdom was established around the area of lopnur using a variety of the tocharian language tocharian c
during the st millennium bc a further wave of immigrants the saka speaking iranian languages arrived from the west and settled along the southern rim of the tarim
they are believed to be the source of iranian loanwords in tocharian languages particularly related to commerce and warfare
most of the tocharian inscriptions are based on buddhist monastical texts which suggests that the tocharians largely embraced buddhism
the pre buddhist beliefs of the tocharians are largely unknown but several chinese goddesses are similar to the reconstructed proto indo european sun goddess and the dawn goddess which implies that the chinese were influenced by the pre buddhist beliefs of the tocharians when they traveled on trade routes which were located in tocharian territories
tocharian b has a noun sw co derived from the name of the proto indo european sun goddess while tocharian a has ko a loanword etymologically connected to the turkic sun goddess gun ana
besides this they might have also worshipped a lunar deity me and an earth one ke
the murals found in the tarim basin especially those of the kizil caves mostly depict jataka stories avadanas and legends of the buddha and are an artistic representation in the tradition of the hinayana school of the sarvastivadas
when the chinese monk xuanzang visited kucha in ce he received the favours of the tocharian king suvarnadeva the son and successor of suvarnapushpa whom he described as a believer of hinayana buddhism
in the account of his travel to kucha he stated that there are about one hundred convents sa gh r mas in this country with five thousand and more disciples
these belong to the little vehicle of the school of the sarv stiv das zhuyiqieyoubu
their doctrine teaching of s tras and their rules of discipline principles of the vinaya are like those of india and those who read them use the same originals
the first record of the oasis states is found in chinese histories
the book of han lists statelets in the tarim basin in the last two centuries bc
these oases served as waystations on the trade routes forming part of the silk road passing along the northern and southern edges of the taklamakan desert
zhang qian travelled the area westward to visit central asia during the nd century bc
the largest were kucha with inhabitants and agni yanqi or karashar with
chinese histories give no evidence of ethnic changes in these cities between that time and the period of the tocharian manuscripts from these sites
situated on the northern edge of the tarim these small urban societies were overshadowed by nomadic peoples to the north and chinese empires to the east
they conceded tributary relations with the larger powers when required and acted independently when they could
in bc the xiongnu drove the yuezhi from western gansu causing most of them to flee west to the ili valley and then to bactria
the xiongnu then overcame the tarim statelets which became a vital part of their empire
the chinese han dynasty was determined to weaken their xiongnu enemies by depriving them of this area
this was achieved in a series of campaigns beginning in bc and culminating in the establishment of the protectorate of the western regions in bc under zheng ji
the han government used a range of tactics including plots to assassinate local rulers direct attacks on a few states e g
kucha in bc to cow the rest and the massacre of the entire population of luntai km east of kucha when they resisted
during the later han ad the whole tarim basin again became a focus of rivalry between the xiong nu to the north and the chinese to the east
in ad chinese troops started to take control of the tarim basin with the conquest of turfan
during the st century ad kucha resisted the chinese invasion and allied itself with the xiong nu and the yuezhi against the chinese general ban chao
even the kushan empire of kujula kadphises sent an army to the tarim basin to support kucha but they retreated after minor encounters
in kucha formally submitted to the chinese court and by china had conquered the whole of the tarim basin
china s control of the silk road facilitated the exchange of art and the progation of buddhism from central asia
the roman maes titianus is known to have visited the area in the nd century ad as did numerous great buddhist missionaries such as the parthian an shigao the yuezhis lokaksema and zhi qian or the indian chu sho fu
the han controlled the tarim states until their final withdrawal in ad
the kushan empire expanded into the tarim during the nd century ad bringing buddhism kushan art sanskrit as a liturgical language and prakrit as an administrative language in the southern tarim states
with these indic languages came scripts including the brahmi script later adapted to write tocharian and the kharosthi script
from the rd century kucha became a centre of buddhist studies
buddhist texts were translated into chinese by kuchean monks the most famous of whom was kum raj va
captured by l guang of the later liang in an attack on kucha in kum raj va learned chinese during his years of captivity in gansu
in he was brought to the later qin capital of chang an where he remained as head of a translation bureau until his death in
the kizil caves lie km west of kucha and contain over buddhist temples
their murals date from the rd to the th century
many of these murals were removed by albert von le coq and other european archaeologists in the early th century and are now held in european museums but others remain in their original locations
an increasingly dry climate in the th and th centuries led to the abandonment of several of the southern cities including niya and kror n with a consequent shift of trade from the southern route to the northern one
confederations of nomadic tribes also began to jostle for supremacy
the northern oasis states were conquered by rouran in the late th century leaving the local leaders in place
kucha the largest of the oasis cities was ruled by royal families sometimes autonomously and sometimes as vassals of outside powers
the chinese named these kuchean kings by adding the prefix bai meaning white probably pointing to the fair complexion of the kucheans
the government included some named posts below the king with all but the highest ranking titles occurring in pairs of left and right
other states had similar structures though on a smaller scale
the book of jin says of the city
the inhabitants grew red millet wheat rice legumes hemp grapes and pomegranates and reared horses cattle sheep and camels
they also extracted a wide range of metals and minerals from the surrounding mountains
handicrafts included leather goods fine felts and rugs
in the kizil caves appear portraits of royal families composed of the king queen and young prince
they are accompanied by monks and men in caftan
according to historian of art benjamin rowland these portraits show that the tocharians were european rather than mongol in appearance with light complexions blue eyes and blond or reddish hair and the costumes of the knights and their ladies have haunting suggestions of the chivalric age of the west
kucha ambassador are known to have visited the chinese court of emperor yuan of liang in his capital jingzhou in ad at or around the same time as the hepthalite embassies there
an ambassador from kucha is illustrated in portraits of periodical offering of liang painted in ad an th century song copy of which as remained
in the late th century ad the hephthalites based in tokharistan bactria expanded eastward through the pamir mountains which are comparatively easy to cross as did the kushans before them due to the presence of convenient plateaus between high peaks
they occupied the western tarim basin kashgar and khotan taking control of the area from the ruanruans who had been collecting heavy tribute from the oasis cities but were now weakening under the assaults of the chinese wei dynasty
in they took the east end of the tarim basin around the region of turfan
in they pushed north of turfan to the urumchi region
in the early years of the th century they were sending embassies from their dominions in the tarim basin to the wei dynasty
the hephthalites continued to occupy the tarim basin until the end of their empire circa ad
as the territories ruled by the hephthalites expanded into central asia and the tarim basin the art of the hephthalites with characteristic clothing and hairstyles also came to be used in the areas they ruled such as sogdiana bamiyan or kucha in the tarim basin kizil caves kumtura caves subashi reliquary
in these areas appear dignitaries with caftans with a triangular collar on the right side crowns with three crescents some crowns with wings and a unique hairstyle
another marker is the two point suspension system for swords which seems to have been an hephthalite innovation and was introduced by them in the territories they controlled
the paintings from the kucha region particularly the swordmen in the kizil caves appear to have been made during hephthalite rule in the region circa ad
the influence of the art of gandhara in some of the earliest paintings at the kizil caves dated to circa ad is considered as a consequence of the political unification of the area between bactria and kucha under the hephthalites
the early turks of the first turkic khaganate then took control of the turfan and kucha areas from around ad and in alliance with the sasanian empire became instrumental in the fall of the hepthalite empire
the turks then split into western and eastern khaganates by ad
tocharian royal families continued to rule kucha as vassals of the western turks to whom they provided tribute and troops
many surviving texts in tocharian date from this period and deal with a wide variety of administrative religious and everyday topics
they also include travel passes small slips of poplar wood giving the size of the permitted caravans for officials at the next station along the road
in king suvarnapushpa of kucha sent an embassy to the court of the tang dynasty acknowledging vassalship
the chinese monk xuanzang in ad visited the cities of the tarim basin and described in many details the characteristics of kucha in tang dynasty account of the western regions
the style of writing is indian with some differences
they clothe themselves with ornamental garments of silk and embroidery
they cut their hair and wear a flowing covering over their heads
the king is of kuchean race
there are about one hundred convents sa gh r mas in this country with five thousand and more disciples
these belong to the little vehicle of the school of the sarv stiv das shwo yih tsai yu po
their doctrine teaching of s tras and their rules of discipline principles of the vinaya are like those of india and those who read them use the same originals
about li to the north of this desert city there are two convents close together on the slope of a mountain
in the th century emperor taizong of tang china having overcome the eastern turks sent his armies west to attack the western turks and the oasis states
the first oasis to fall was turfan which was captured in and annexed as part of china
next to the west lay the city of agni which had been a tributary of the tang since
alarmed by the nearby chinese armies agni stopped sending tribute to china and formed an alliance with the western turks
they were aided by kucha who also stopped sending tribute
the tang captured agni in defeating a western turk relief force and made the king of kucha suvarnadeva chinese sufadie resume tribute
when that king was deposed by a relative named haripushpa chinese helibushibi in the tang sent an army under the turk general ashina she er to install a compliant member of the local royal family a younger brother of haripushpa
ashina she er continued to capture kucha and made it the headquarters of the tang protectorate general to pacify the west
kuchean forces recaptured the city and killed protector general guo xiaoke but it fell again to ashina she er who had of the inhabitants executed in reprisal for the killing of guo
the tocharian cities never recovered from the tang conquest
the tang lost the tarim basin to the tibetan empire in but regained it in and continued to rule there until it was recaptured by the tibetans in
the ruling bai family of kucha are last mentioned in chinese sources in
there is little mention of the region in chinese sources for the th and th centuries
the uyghur khaganate took control of the northern tarim in
after their capital in mongolia was sacked by the yenisei kyrgyz in they established a new state the kingdom of qocho with its capital at gaochang near turfan in
over centuries of contact and intermarriage the cultures and populations of the pastoralist rulers and their agriculturalist subjects blended together
the uighurs abandoned their state religion of manichaeism in favour of buddhism and adopted the agricultural lifestyle and many of the customs of the oasis dwellers
the tocharian language gradually disappeared as the urban population switched to the old uyghur language
most of the texts known from the tocharians are religious except for one known love poem in tocharian b manuscript b found in kizil
names of the rulers of kucha are known mainly from chinese sources
