stone mountain is a quartz monzonite dome monadnock and the site of stone mountain park miles km east of atlanta georgia
outside the park is the small city of stone mountain georgia
the park is the most visited tourist site in the state of georgia
the park is owned by the state of georgia and is currently managed by herschend family entertainment
at its summit the elevation is feet m above sea level and feet m above the surrounding area
stone mountain is well known for not only its geology but also the enormous rock relief on its north face the largest bas relief artwork in the world
the carving completed in depicts three confederate leaders jefferson davis robert e
lee and stonewall jackson
stone mountain once owned by the venable brothers was seen from the outset as a memorial to the confederacy stone mountain park officially opened on april years to the day after lincoln s assassination although the park had already been in use for a few years
the mountain which ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite is more than miles km in circumference at its base
the summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the skyride aerial tram
stone mountain is a pluton a type of igneous intrusion
primarily composed of quartz monzonite the dome of stone mountain was formed during the formation of the blue ridge mountains around million years ago during the carboniferous period part of the appalachian mountains
it formed as a result of the upwelling of magma from within the earth s crust
this magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface
the stone mountain pluton continues underground miles km at its longest point into gwinnett county
numerous reference books and georgia literature have dubbed stone mountain as the largest exposed piece of granite in the world
this misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration
stone mountain though often called a pink granite dome actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite
the minerals within the rock include quartz plagioclase feldspar microcline and muscovite with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline
the tourmaline is mostly black in color and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal crystals but much larger euhedral pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain s numerous cross cutting felsic dikes
embedded in the granite are xenoliths or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma
the granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the piedmont region during the last stages of the alleghenian orogeny which was the time when north america and north africa collided
over time erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock
this intrusion of granite also gave rise to panola mountain and arabia mountain both in dekalb county smaller outcroppings farther south of stone mountain
the top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock pools and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of downtown atlanta often kennesaw mountain and on very clear days even the appalachian mountains
on some days the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog and visibility may be limited to only a few feet
the clear freshwater pools on the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions and are home to unusual clam shrimp and fairy shrimp
the tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season
through the process of cryptobiosis the tiny shrimp eggs or cysts can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions awaiting favorable conditions
these vernal pools are also home to several federally listed rare and endangered plant species such as black spored quillwort isoetes melanospora and pool sprite also called snorkelwort gratiola amphiantha
the mountain s lower slopes are wooded
the rare georgia oak was first discovered at the summit and several specimens can easily be found along the walk up trail and in the woods around the base of the mountain
in the fall the confederate yellow daisy helianthus porteri flowers appear on the mountain growing in rock crevices and in the large wooded areas
more than wildflowers most of them native to the southern appalachians and including several rare or federally protected species have been identified on the mountain
the largest bas relief sculpture in the world the confederate memorial carving depicts three confederate leaders of the civil war president jefferson davis and generals robert e

david freeman writing on the origins of the memorial states who first conceived of a confederate memorial on the side of stone mountain has long been a matter of debate
the written evidence points to francis ticknor a nineteenth century physician and poet from jones county georgia in an poem
william h
terrell an atlanta attorney and son of a confederate veteran suggested it publicly on may in an editorial for the atlanta constitution three weeks later georgian john temple graves editor of the new york american suggested it should have a foot m statue of robert e
the project was greatly advanced by c
helen plane a charter member of the united daughters of the confederacy udc and first president and honorary life president of the georgia state division
after obtaining the approval of the georgia udc she set up the udc stone mountain memorial association
she chose the sculptor gutzon borglum for the project and invited him to visit the mountain although despite his ku klux klan involvement she would not shake his hand he was after all a yankee
she met him at the atlanta train station took him to her family s summer home mont rest at the foot of the mountain and introduced him to sam venable an active klan member and owner of the mountain
borglum also enlisted luigi del bianco whom he would also involve in mount rushmore
borglum s original plan was five groups of figures sixty five mounted officers representing the states to be chosen by the states general nathan bedford forrest and his cavalry some to figures each from feet m to feet m high
in addition borglum planned a room cut feet m into the mountain feet m wide and feet m high faced by columns
venable deeded the north face of the mountain to the udc in on condition that it complete a sizable civil war monument in years
finances as well as technical problems slowed progress
the us mint issued a commemorative silver us half dollar bearing the words stone mountain as a fundraiser for the monument
this issue which required the approval of both the congress and president calvin coolidge was the largest issue of commemorative coins by the u s
government up to that time
financial conflicts between borglum and the association led to his firing in
he destroyed his models claiming that they were his property but the association disagreed and had a warrant issued for his arrest
he was warned of the arrest and narrowly escaped to north carolina whose governor angus mclean refused to extradite him though he could not return to georgia
the affair was highly publicized and there was much discussion and discord including discord between sam venable the association and its president hollins randolph
the face of lee that borglum had partially completed was blasted off the mountain in
borglum s next major project was mount rushmore
after a number of sculptors turned them down augustus lukeman took up the work in with a different smaller design
fundraising was even more difficult after the public debate and name calling and work stopped in
in segregationist governor eugene talmadge formed the stone mountain memorial association smma to continue work on the memorial but the project was delayed once again by the u s
entry into world war ii
in response to brown v
board of education of and the birth of the civil rights movement in at the urging of segregationist governor marvin griffin the georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase stone mountain at a price of
in walker hancock was selected to complete the carving and work began in
the carving was dedicated in a ceremony on may
the carving was completed by roy faulkner on march
faulkner in opened the stone mountain carving museum now closed on nearby memorial drive commemorating the carving s history
an extensive archival collection related to the project is now at emory university with the bulk of the materials dating from to the finding aid provides a history of the project and an index of the papers contained in the collection
four flags of the confederacy are flown at the site
the stone mountain memorial lawn contains thirteen terraces one for each confederate state
each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the confederacy
in there opened beneath the sculpture a replica plantation where slave quarters were described as neat and well furnished in promotional materials
the slaves were called hands or workers and black actress butterfly mcqueen from gone with the wind was hired to guide and inform visitors
the park states that the plantation was inspired by gone with the wind
the plantation has been renamed historic square
according to sociologist james w
loewen stone mountain was the sacred site to members of the second and third national klans loewen alleges that the rebirth of the ku klux klan the second klan was inspired by d
griffith s klan glorifying film the birth of a nation
it was followed in august by the highly publicized lynching of leo frank who had been wrongly convicted of murder in nearby marietta georgia
loewen further alleges that on november of the same year thanksgiving day a small group including fifteen robed and hooded charter members of the new organization met at the summit of stone mountain to create a new iteration of the klan
led by william j
simmons it included two elderly members of the original klan
as part of their ceremony they set up on the summit an altar covered with a flag opened a bible and burned a foot cross
james r
venable attended the revival of the kkk on top of stone mountain and later became an imperial wizard of the national knights of the ku klux klan which was one of the later kkk factions
he owned land at the base of the mountain that he had inherited from his ancestors and in october of he granted the klan an easement with perpetual right to hold celebrations as they desired
however the property was condemned in at the behest of the stone mountain memorial association
the klan also held cross burnings at the summit of the mountain on different occasions from onward
this practice came to an end in when the klan attempted to hold a mountaintop cross burning in response to the naacp holding its national convention in atlanta
the stone mountain memorial association did not want either group using state property for demonstrations and convinced governor ernest vandiver to order state troopers to stop the event
seventy troopers attempted to stop several hundred klansmen gathered at the base of the mountain from climbing to the summit but the klansmen were armed with billy clubs flashlights and stones and greatly outnumbered the officers
the police negotiated a truce with the local klan grand dragon under which the klansmen would refrain from further violence but of their number would be allowed climb the mountain for a religious ceremony and the crossburning was substituted with the lighting of a flare
in august of the klan was denied a permit for a mountaintop cross burning
fundraising for the monument resumed in
the influence of the udc continued in support of mrs
plane s vision of a carving explicitly for the purpose of creating a confederate memorial
she suggested in a letter to the first sculptor gutzon borglum
the udc established the stone mountain confederate memorial association smcma for fundraising and on site supervision of the project
venable and borglum both closely associated with the klan arranged to pack the smcma with klan members
the smcma along with the united daughters of the confederacy continued fundraising efforts
of the raised part came from the federal government which in issued commemorative fifty cent coins with the soldiers robert e

after the charleston church shooting in mid stone mountain was the subject of a political debate related to the removal of symbols of the confederacy
this controversy was stimulated by a movement in other states to remove the confederate battle flag and statues of confederate leaders from public areas
in july the atlanta naacp proposed removing the confederate carving from stone mountain park
however this would require the approval of the georgia legislature as would any change to a military monument in the state
on october the atlanta journal constitution reported the park was considering a proposal of a permanent freedom bell honoring martin luther king jr
and the line let freedom ring from stone mountain of georgia from king s i have a dream speech
the proposed monument is inspired by a bell ringing ceremony held in honoring the th anniversary of king s speech
it is not supported by the naacp or king founded southern christian leadership conference sclc who want the confederate symbols removed rather than a king symbol added
advance local reported in that both the dekalb county branch of the naacp and the sons of confederate veterans were opposed to the bell because it would have been put next to a confederate monument
representatives of the naacp were quoted in the article saying it s an attempt to gain support from blacks to keep these racist and demeaning symbols
in august after the unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia a white nationalist protest against the removal of the robert e
lee monument and stonewall jackson sculpture turned violent many people across the country again demanded the removal of many confederate monuments and memorials as a part of a national political debate

when the mountain was first encountered by european explorers its summit was encircled by a rock wall similar to that still to be found on georgia s fort mountain
the wall is believed to have been built by early native american inhabitants of the area although its purpose remains unclear
by the beginning of the th century the wall had disappeared the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs rolled down the rockface or removed by the commercial quarrying operation
the mountain was the eastern end of the campbellton trail a native american path that ran through what is now the atlanta area
