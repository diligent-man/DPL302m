the dogon are an ethnic group indigenous to the central plateau region of mali in west africa south of the niger bend near the city of bandiagara and in burkina faso
the population numbers between and
they speak the dogon languages which are considered to constitute an independent branch of the niger congo language family meaning that they are not closely related to any other languages
the dogon are best known for their religious traditions their mask dances wooden sculpture and their architecture
since the twentieth century there have been significant changes in the social organisation material culture and beliefs of the dogon in part because dogon country is one of mali s major tourist attractions
the principal dogon area is bisected by the bandiagara escarpment a sandstone cliff of up to metres ft high stretching about km miles
to the southeast of the cliff the sandy s no gondo plains are found and northwest of the cliff are the bandiagara highlands
historically dogon villages were established in the bandiagara area a thousand years ago because the people collectively refused to convert to islam and retreated from areas controlled by muslims
dogon insecurity in the face of these historical pressures caused them to locate their villages in defensible positions along the walls of the escarpment
the other factor influencing their choice of settlement location was access to water
the niger river is nearby and in the sandstone rock a rivulet runs at the foot of the cliff at the lowest point of the area during the wet season
among the dogon several oral traditions have been recorded as to their origin
one relates to their coming from mande located to the southwest of the bandiagara escarpment near bamako
according to this oral tradition the first dogon settlement was established in the extreme southwest of the escarpment at kani na
archaeological and ethnoarchaeological studies in the dogon region have been especially revealing about the settlement and environmental history and about social practices and technologies in this area over several thousands of years
over time the dogon moved north along the escarpment arriving in the sanga region in the th century
other oral histories place the origin of the dogon to the west beyond the river niger or tell of the dogon coming from the east
it is likely that the dogon of today are descendants of several groups of diverse origin who migrated to escape islamization
it is often difficult to distinguish between pre muslim practices and later practices
but islamic law classified the dogon and many other ethnicities of the region mossi gurma bobo busa and the yoruba as being within the non canon dar al harb and consequently fair game for slave raids organized by merchants
as the growth of cities increased the demand for slaves across the region of west africa also increased
the historical pattern included the murder of indigenous males by raiders and enslavement of women and children
for almost years the dogon people an ancient ethnic group of mali had faced religious and ethnic persecution through jihads by dominant muslim communities
these jihadic expeditions formed themselves to force the dogon to abandon their traditional religious beliefs for islam
such jihads caused the dogon to abandon their original villages and moved up to the cliffs of bandiagara for better defense and to escape persecution often building their dwellings in little nooks and crannies
dogon art consists primarily of sculptures
dogon art revolves around religious values ideals and freedoms laude
dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families sanctuaries or kept with the hogon laude
the importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made
themes found throughout dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms superimposed bearded figures horsemen stools with caryatids women with children figures covering their faces women grinding pearl millet women bearing vessels on their heads donkeys bearing cups musicians dogs quadruped shaped troughs or benches figures bending from the waist mirror images aproned figures and standing figures laude
signs of other contacts and origins are evident in dogon art
the dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of bandiagara
influence from tellem art is evident in dogon art because of its rectilinear designs laude
today at least of the dogon practice islam
another practices christianity
dogon society is organized by a patrilineal kinship system
each dogon village or enlarged family is headed by one male elder
this chief head is the oldest living son of the ancestor of the local branch of the family
the blind dogon elder ogotemmeli taught the main symbols of the dogon religion to french anthropologist marcel griaule in october
griaule had lived amongst the dogon people for fifteen years before this meeting with ogotemmeli took place
ogotemmeli taught griaule the religious stories in the same way that ogotemmeli had learned them from his father and grandfather oral instruction which he had learned over the course of more than twenty years
what makes the record so important from a historical perspective is that the dogon people were still living in their oral culture at the time their religion was recorded
they were one of the last people in west africa to lose their independence and come under french rule
the dogon people with whom french anthropologists griaule and germaine dieterlen worked during the s and s had a system of signs which ran into the thousands including their own systems of astronomy and calendrical measurements methods of calculation and extensive anatomical and physiological knowledge as well as a systematic pharmacopoeia
the religion embraced many aspects of nature which are found in other traditional african religions
the key spiritual figures in the religion were the nummo nommo twins
according to ogotemm li s description of them the nummo whom he also referred to as the serpent were amphibians that were often compared to serpents lizards chameleons and occasionally the mammals sloths because of their being slow moving and having a shapeless neck
they were also described as fish capable of walking on land while they were on land the nummo stood upright on their tails
the nummos skin was primarily green but like the chameleon it sometimes changed colours
at times the skin was said to have all the colours of the rainbow
in other instances the nummo were referred to as water spirits
although the nummo were identified as being dieux d eau gods of water by marcel griaule ogotemm li classified the nummo as hermaphrodites
their images or figures appeared on the female side of the dogon sanctuary
they were primarily symbolized by the sun which was a female symbol in the religion
in the dogon language the sun s name nay had the same root as mother na and cow n
they were symbolized by the colour red a female symbol
the problem of twin births versus single births or androgyny versus single sexed beings was said to contribute to a disorder at the beginning of time
this theme was fundamental to the dogon religion
the jackal was alone from birth said ogotemm li and because of this he did more things than can be told dogon males were primarily associated with the single sexed male jackal and the sigui festival which was associated with death on the earth
it was held once every sixty years and allegedly celebrated the white dwarf star sirius b
there has been extensive speculation about the origin of such astronomical knowledge
the colour white was a symbol of males
the ritual language sigi so or language of the sigui which was taught to male dignitaries of the society of the masks awa was considered a poor language
it contained only about a quarter of the full vocabulary of dogo so the dogon language
the sigi so was used to tell the story of creation of the universe of human life and the advent of death on the earth during both funeral ceremonies and the rites of the end of mourning dama
because of the birth of the single sexed male jackal who was born without a soul all humans eventually had to be turned into single sexed beings
this was to prevent a being like the jackal from ever being born on earth again
the nummo foresaw that the original rule of twin births was bound to disappear and that errors might result comparable to those of the jackal whose birth was single
because of his solitary state the first son of god acted as he did the removal of the second sex and soul from humans is what the ritual of circumcision represents in the dogon religion
the dual soul is a danger a man should be male and a woman female
circumcision and excision are once again the remedy
the dogon religion was centered on this loss of twinness or androgyny
griaule describes it in this passage
the birth of human twins was celebrated in the dogon culture in griaule s day because it recalled the fabulous past when all beings came into existence in twos symbols of the balance between humans and the divine
according to griaule the celebration of twin births was a cult that extended all over africa
today a significant minority of the dogon practice islam
another minority practices christianity
the vast majority of marriages are monogamous but nonsororal polygynous marriages are allowed in the dogon culture
however even in polygynous marriages it is rare for a man to have more than two wives
in a polygynous marriage the wives reside in separate houses within the husband s compound
the first wife or ya biru holds a higher position in the family relative to any wives from later marriages
formally wives join their husband s household only after the birth of their first child
the selection of a wife is carried out by the man s parents
marriages are endogamous in that the people are limited to marry only persons within their clan and within their caste
women may leave their husbands early in their marriage before the birth of their first child
after a couple has had children together divorce is a rare and serious matter and it requires the participation of the whole village
divorce is more common in polygynous marriages than in monogamous marriages
in the event of a divorce the woman takes only the youngest child with her and the rest remain as a part of the husband s household
an enlarged family can count up to a hundred persons and is called guinna
the dogon are strongly oriented toward harmony which is reflected in many of their rituals
for instance in one of their most important rituals the women praise the men the men thank the women the young express appreciation for the old and the old recognize the contributions of the young
another example is the custom of elaborate greetings whenever one dogon meets another
this custom is repeated over and over throughout a dogon village all day
during a greeting ritual the person who has entered the contact answers a series of questions about his or her whole family from the person who was already there
the answer is sewa which means that everything is fine
then the dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual asking the resident how his or her whole family is
because the word sewa is so commonly repeated throughout a dogon village neighboring peoples have dubbed the dogon the sewa people
the hogon is the spiritual and political leader of the village
he is elected from among the oldest men of the dominant lineage of the village
after his election he has to follow a six month initiation period during which he is not allowed to shave or wash
he wears white clothes and nobody is allowed to touch him
a virgin who has not yet had her period takes care of him cleans his house and prepares his meals
she returns to her home at night
after initiation the hogon wears a red fez
he has an armband with a sacred pearl that symbolises his function
the virgin is replaced by one of his wives and she also returns to her home at night
the hogon has to live alone in his house
the dogon believe the sacred snake l b comes during the night to clean him and to transfer wisdom
the dogon are primarily agriculturalists and cultivate millet sorghum and rice as well as onions tobacco peanuts and some other vegetables
griaule encouraged the construction of a dam near sangha and persuaded the dogon to cultivate onions
the economy of the sangha region has doubled since then and its onions are sold as far as the market of bamako and those of the ivory coast
grain is stored in granaries
in addition to agriculture the women gather wild fruits tubers nuts and honey in the bush outside of village borders
some young men will hunt for small game but wild animals are relatively scarce near villages
while the people keep chickens or herds of sheep and goats in dogon villages animal husbandry holds little economic value
individuals with high status may own a small number of cattle
since the late th century the dogon have developed peaceful trading relationships with other societies and have thereby increased variety in their diets
every four days dogon people participate in markets with neighboring tribes such as the fulani and the dyula
the dogon primarily sell agricultural commodities onions grain cotton and tobacco
they purchase sugar salt european merchandise and many animal products such as milk butter and dried fish
there are two endogamous castes in dogon society the smiths and the leather workers
members of these castes are physically separate from the rest of the village and live either at the village edge or outside of it entirely
while the castes are correlated to profession membership is determined by birth
the smiths have important ritual powers and are characteristically poor
the leather workers engage in significant trade with other ethnic groups and accumulate wealth
unlike norms for the rest of society parallel cousin marriage is allowed within castes
caste boys do not get circumcised
in dogon thought males and females are born with both sexual components
the clitoris is considered male while the foreskin is considered female
originally for the dogon man was endowed with a dual soul
circumcision is believed to eliminate the superfluous one rites of circumcision enable each sex to assume its proper physical identity
boys are circumcised in age groups of three years counting for example all boys between and years old
this marks the end of their youth and they are initiated
the blacksmith performs the circumcision
afterwards the boys stay for a few days in a hut separated from the rest of the village people until the wounds have healed
the circumcision is celebrated and the initiated boys go around and receive presents
they make music on a special instrument that is made of a rod of wood and calabashes that makes the sound of a rattle
the newly circumcised youths now considered young men walk around naked for a month after the procedure so that their achievement in age can be admired by the tribe
this practice has been passed down for generations and is always followed even during winter
once a boy is circumcised he transitions into young adulthood and moves out of his father s house
all of the men in his age set live together in a du e until they marry and have children
the dogon are among several african ethnic groups that practice female genital mutilation including a type i circumcision meaning that the clitoris is removed
the village of songho has a circumcision cave ornamented with red and white rock paintings of animals and plants
nearby is a cave where music instruments are stored
the awa is a masked dance society that holds ritual and social importance
it has a strict code of etiquette obligations interdicts and a secret language sigi so
all initiated dogon men participate in awa with the exception of some caste members
women are forbidden from joining and prohibited from learning sigi so
the awa is characterized by the intricate masks worn by members during rituals
there are two major events at which the awa perform the sigi ritual and dama funeral rituals
sigi is a society wide ritual to honor and recognize the first ancestors
thought to have originated as a method to unite and keep peace among dogon villages the sigi involves all members of the dogon people
starting in the northeastern part of dogon territory each village takes turns celebrating and hosting elaborate feasts ceremonies and festivities
during this time new masks are carved and dedicated to their ancestors
each village celebrates for around a year before the sigi moves to the next village
a new sigi is started every years
dogon funeral rituals come in two parts
the first occurs immediately after the death of a person and the second can occur years after the death
due to the expense the second traditional funeral rituals or damas are becoming very rare
damas that are still performed today are not usually performed for their original intent but instead are performed for tourists interested in the dogon way of life
the dogon use this entertainment to earn income by charging tourists money for the masks they want to see and for the ritual itself davis
the traditional dama consists of a masquerade intended to lead the souls of the departed to their final resting places through a series of ritual dances and rites
dogon damas include the use of many masks which they wore by securing them in their teeth and statuettes
each dogon village may differ in the designs of the masks used in the dama ritual
similarly each village may have their own way of performing the dama rituals
the dama consists of an event known as the halic that is held immediately after the death of a person and lasts for one day davis
according to shawn r
davis this particular ritual incorporates the elements of the yingim and the danyim
during the yincomoli ceremony a gourd is smashed over the deceased s wooden bowl hoe and bundukamba burial blanket
this announces the entrance of persons wearing the masks used in this ceremony while the deceased s entrance to his home in the family compound is decorated with ritual elements davis
masks used during the yincomoli ceremony include the yana gulay satimbe sirige and kanaga
the yana gulay mask s purpose is to impersonate a fulani woman and is made from cotton cloth and cowl shells
the satimbe mask represents the women ancestors who are said to have discovered the purpose of the masks by guiding the spirits of the deceased into the afterlife davis
the sirige mask is a tall mask used in funerals only for men who were alive during the holding of the sigui ceremony see below davis
the kanaga masqueraders at one point dance and sit next to the bundkamba which represents the deceased
the yingim and the danyim rituals each last a few days
these events are held annually to honor the elders who have died since the last dama
the yingim consists of both the sacrifice of cows or other valuable animals and mock combat
large mock battles are performed in order to help chase the spirit known as the nyama from the deceased s body and village and towards the path to the afterlife davis
the danyim is held a couple of months later
during the danyim masqueraders perform dances every morning and evening for any period up to six days depending on that village s practice
the masqueraders dance on the rooftops of the deceased s compound throughout the village and in the area of fields around the village davis
until the masqueraders have completed their dances and every ritual has been performed any misfortune can be blamed on the remaining spirits of the dead davis
dogon society is composed of several different sects
the sect of the creator god amma
the celebration is once a year and consists of offering boiled millet on the conical altar of amma colouring it white
all other sects are directed to the god amma
sigui is the most important ceremony of the dogon
it takes place every years and can take several years
the last one started in and ended in the next one will start in
the sigui ceremony symbolises the death of the first ancestor not to be confused with l b until the moment that humanity acquired the use of the spoken word
the sigui is a long procession that starts and ends in the village of youga dogorou and goes from one village to another during several months or years
all men wear masks and dance in long processions
the sigui has a secret language sigui so which women are not allowed to learn
the secret society of sigui plays a central role in the ceremony
they prepare the ceremonies a long time in advance and they live for three months hidden outside of the villages while nobody is allowed to see them
the men from the society of sigui are called the olubaru
the villagers are afraid of them and fear is cultivated by a prohibition to go out at night when sounds warn that the olubaru are out
the most important mask that plays a major role in the sigui rituals is the great mask or the mother of masks
it is several meters long held by hand and not used to hide a face
this mask is newly created every years
the binou sect uses totems common ones for the entire village and individual ones for totem priests
a totem animal is worshiped on a binou altar
totems are for example the buffalo for ogol du haut and the panther for ogol du bas
normally no one is harmed by their totem animal even if this is a crocodile as it is for the village of amani where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers
however a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong
a worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem
for example an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat to use leather from its skin nor to see a buffalo die
if this happens by accident he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the binou altar
boiled millet is offered and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a binou altar
this colours the altar white and red
binou altars look like little houses with a door
they are bigger when the altar is for an entire village
a village altar also has the cloud hook to catch clouds and make it rain
the l b sect worships the ancestor l b serou the first mortal human being who in dogon myth was transformed into a snake
the celebration takes place once a year and lasts for three days
the altar is a pointed conic structure on which the hogon offers boiled millet while mentioning in his benediction eight grains plus one
afterwards the hogon performs some rituals in his house which is the home of l b
the last day all the village men visit all the binou altars and dance three times around the l b altar
the hogon invites everybody who assisted to drink the millet beer
the twin sect the birth of twins is a sign of good luck
the extended dogon families have common rituals during which they evoke all their ancestors back to their origin the ancient pair of twins from the creation of the world
the mono sect the mono altar is at the entry of every village
unmarried young men celebrate the mono sect once a year in january or february
they spend the night around the altar singing and screaming and waving with fire torches
they hunt for mice that will be sacrificed on the altar at dawn villages are built along escarpments and near a source of water
on average a village contains around houses organized around the ginna or head man s house
each village is composed of one main lineage occasionally multiple lineages make up a single village traced through the male line
houses are built extremely close together many times sharing walls and floors
dogon villages have different buildings
male granary storage place for pearl millet and other grains
building with a pointed roof
this building is well protected from mice
the amount of filled male granaries is an indication for the size and the richness of a guinna
female granary storage place for a woman s things her husband has no access
building with a pointed roof
it looks like a male granary but is less protected against mice
here she stores her personal belongings such as clothes jewelry money and some food
a woman has a degree of economic independence and earnings and things related to her merchandise are stored in her personal granary
she can for example make cotton or pottery
the number of female granaries is an indication for the number of women living in the guinna
t gu n a kind of case palabres a building only for men
they rest here much of the day throughout the heat of the dry season discuss affairs and take important decisions in the toguna
the roof of a toguna is made by layers of millet stalks
it is a low building in which one cannot stand upright
this helps with avoiding violence when discussions get heated
punulu a house for menstruating women this house is on the outside of the village
it is constructed by women and is of lower quality than the other village buildings
women having their period are considered to be unclean and have to leave their family house to live during five days in this house
they use kitchen equipment only to be used here
they bring with them their youngest children
this house is a gathering place for women during the evening
this hut is also thought to have some sort of reproductive symbolism due to the fact that the hut can be easily seen by the men who are working the fields who know that only women who are on their period and thus not pregnant can be there dogon has been frequently referred to as a single language
there are at least five distinct groups of dialects
the most ancient dialects are dyamsay and tombo the former being most frequently used for traditional prayers and ritual chants
the dogon dialects are highly distinct from one another and many varieties are not mutually intelligible actually amounting to some dialects and sub dialects
there is also a secret ritual language sigi s language of sigi which is taught to dignitaries olubar of the society of the masks during their enthronement at the sigui ceremony
women have no right to learn sigui so
it is generally accepted that the dogon language belongs to the niger congo language family though the evidence is weak
they have been linked to the mande subfamily but also to gur
in a recent overview of the niger congo family dogon is treated as an independent branch
the dogon languages show few remnants of a unique noun class system an example of which is that human nouns take a distinct plural suffix
this leads linguists to conclude that dogon is likely to have diverged from niger congo very early
another indication of this is the subject object verb basic word order which dogon shares with such early niger congo branches as ijoid and mande
about ethnic dogon in seven villages in southern mali speak the bangime language which is unrelated to the other dogon languages and presumed by linguists to be an ancient pre dogon language isolate although a minority of linguists most notably roger blench hypothesise that it may be related to proto nilo saharan
starting with the french anthropologist marcel griaule several authors have claimed that dogon traditional religion incorporates details about extrasolar astronomical bodies that could not have been discerned from naked eye observation
the idea has entered the new age and ancient astronaut literature as evidence that extraterrestrial aliens visited mali in the distant past
other authors have argued that previous th century european visitors to the dogon are a far more plausible source of such information and dispute whether griaule s account accurately describes dogon myths at all
from to griaule studied the dogon in field missions ranging from several days to two months in and and then annually from until
in late griaule spent a consecutive days in conversations with the dogon wiseman ogotemmeli the source of much of griaule and germaine dieterlen s future publications
they reported that the dogon believe that the brightest star in the night sky sirius sigi tolo or star of the sigui has two companion stars p tolo the digitaria star and mm ya tolo the female sorghum star respectively the first and second companions of sirius a
sirius in the dogon system formed one of the foci for the orbit of a tiny star the companionate digitaria star
when digitaria is closest to sirius that star brightens when it is farthest from sirius it gives off a twinkling effect that suggests to the observer several stars
the orbit cycle takes years
they also claimed that the dogon appeared to know of the rings of saturn and the moons of jupiter
griaule and dieterlen were puzzled by this sudanese star system and prefaced their analysis with the disclaimer the problem of knowing how with no instruments at their disposal men could know the movements and certain characteristics of virtually invisible stars has not been settled nor even posed
more recently doubts have been raised about the validity of griaule and dieterlen s work
in a article in current anthropology anthropologist wouter van beek concluded after his research among the dogon that though they do speak about sigu tolo which is what griaule claimed the dogon called sirius they disagree completely with each other as to which star is meant for some it is an invisible star that should rise to announce the sigu festival for another it is venus that through a different position appears as sigu tolo
all agree however that they learned about the star from griaule
griaule s daughter genevi ve calame griaule responded in a later issue arguing that van beek did not go through the appropriate steps for acquiring knowledge and suggesting that van beek s dogon informants may have thought that he had been sent by the political and administrative authorities to test the dogon s muslim orthodoxy
an independent assessment is given by andrew apter of the university of california
in a critique skeptic ian ridpath concluded there are any number of channels by which the dogon could have received western knowledge long before they were visited by griaule and dieterlen in his book sirius matters noah brosch postulates that the dogon may have had contact with astronomers based in dogon territory during a five week expedition led by henri alexandre deslandres to study the solar eclipse of april
robert todd carroll also states that a more likely source of the knowledge of the sirius star system is from contemporary terrestrial sources who provided information to interested members of the tribes
james oberg however citing these suspicions notes their completely speculative nature writing that the obviously advanced astronomical knowledge must have come from somewhere but is it an ancient bequest or a modern graft although temple fails to prove its antiquity the evidence for the recent acquisition of the information is still entirely circumstantial additionally james clifford notes that griaule sought informants best qualified to speak of traditional lore and deeply mistrusted converts to christianity islam or people with too much contact with whites
oberg points out a number of errors contained in the dogon beliefs including the number of moons possessed by jupiter that saturn was the furthest planet from the sun and the only planet with rings
interest in other seemingly falsifiable claims namely concerning a red dwarf star orbiting around sirius not hypothesized until the s led him to entertain a previous challenge by temple asserting that temple offered another line of reasoning
we have in the dogon information a predictive mechanism which it is our duty to test regardless of our preconceptions one example if a sirius c is ever discovered and found to be a red dwarf i will conclude that the dogon information has been fully validated
this alludes to reports that the dogon knew of another star in the sirius system mm ya or a star larger than sirius b but lighter and dim in magnitude
in gravitational studies indeed showed the possible presence of a brown dwarf star orbiting around sirius a sirius c with a six year orbital period
a more recent study using advanced infrared imaging concluded that the probability of the existence of a triple star system for sirius is now low but could not be ruled out because the region within au of sirius a had not been covered
