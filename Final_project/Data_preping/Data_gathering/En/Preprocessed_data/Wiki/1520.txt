the monarchy of thailand whose monarch is referred to as the king of thailand thai or historically king of siam thai refers to the constitutional monarchy and monarch of the kingdom of thailand formerly siam
the king of thailand is the head of state and head of the ruling royal house of chakri
although the current chakri dynasty was created in the existence of the institution of monarchy in thailand is traditionally considered to have its roots from the founding of the sukhothai kingdom in with a brief interregnum from the death of ekkathat to the accession of taksin in the th century
the institution was transformed into a constitutional monarchy in after the bloodless siamese revolution of
the monarchy s official ceremonial residence is the grand palace in bangkok while the private residence has been at the dusit palace
the current king vajiralongkorn resides in quarantine at the grand hotel sonnenbichl in germany
the king of thailand s titles include head of state head of the royal thai armed forces adherent of buddhism and upholder of religions
the current concept of thai kingship evolved through years of absolute rule
the first king of a unified thailand was the founder of the kingdom of sukhothai king sri indraditya in
the idea of this early kingship is said to be based on two concepts derived from hinduism and theravada buddhist beliefs
the first concept is based on the vedic hindu caste of kshatriya thai or warrior ruler in which the king derives his powers from military might
the second is based on the buddhist concept of dhammaraja thai buddhism having been introduced to thailand around the th century ce
the idea of the dhammaraja or kingship under dharma is that the king should rule his people in accordance with dharma and the teachings of the buddha
these ideas were briefly replaced in when king ramkhamhaeng came to the throne
ramkhamhaeng departed from tradition and created instead a concept of paternal rule thai in which the king governs his people as a father would govern his children
this idea is reinforced in the title and name of the king as he is still known today pho khun ramkhamhaeng thai meaning father ruler ramkhamhaeng
this lasted briefly
by the end of the kingdom the two old concepts returned as symbolized by the change in the style of the kings pho was changed to phaya or lord
the kingdom of sukhothai was supplanted by the kingdom of ayutthaya which was founded in by king ramathibodhi i
during the ayutthayan period the idea of kingship changed
due to ancient khmer tradition in the region the hindu concept of kingship was applied to the status of the leader
brahmins took charge in the royal coronation
the king was treated as a reincarnation of hindu gods
ayutthaya historical documents show the official titles of the kings in great variation indra shiva and vishnu or rama
seemingly rama was the most popular as in ramathibodhi
however buddhist influence was also evident as many times the king s title and unofficial name dhammaraja an abbreviation of the buddhist dharmaraja
the two former concepts were re established with a third older concept taking hold
this concept was called devaraja thai or divine king which was an idea borrowed by the khmer empire from the hindu buddhist kingdoms of java especially the idea of a scholar class based on hindu brahmins
the concept centered on the idea that the king was an incarnation avatar of the god vishnu and that he was a bodhisattva enlightened one therefore basing his power on his religious power his moral power and his purity of blood
the king portrayed by state interests as a semi divine figure then became through a rigid cultural implementation an object of worship and veneration to his people
from then on the monarchy was largely removed from the people and continued under a system of absolute rule
living in palaces designed after mount meru home of the gods in hinduism the kings turned themselves into a chakravartin where the king became an absolute and universal lord of his realm
kings demanded that the universe be envisioned as revolving around them and expressed their powers through elaborate rituals and ceremonies
for four centuries these kings ruled ayutthaya presiding over some of the greatest period of cultural economic and military growth in thai history
the kings of ayutthaya created many institutions to support their rule
whereas feudalism developed in the european middle ages ayutthayan king trailokanat instituted sakdina a system of social hierarchy which ranked the king s subjects according to the amount of land they were entitled to according to their rank and position
rachasap is required by court etiquette as an honorific register consisting of a special vocabulary used exclusively for addressing the king or for talking about royalty
the king was chief administrator chief legislator and chief judge with all laws orders verdict and punishments theoretically originating from his person
the king s sovereignty was reflected in the titles lord of the land phra chao phaen din and lord of life chao chiwit
the king s powers and titles were seen by foreign observers as proof that the king was an absolute monarch in the european sense
however in siamese tradition the duty and responsibility of the king was seen as developed from the ancient indian theories of royal authority which resemble enlightened absolutism although the emphasis is not on rationality but on dhamma
this was disrupted in when thai digests of the dhammas t were lost when a burmese army under the alaungpaya dynasty invaded sacked and burned the city of ayutthaya
an interlude filled by a short civil war was ended when taksin restored the country under what has been called the thonburi kingdom
in buddha yodfa chulaloke ascended the throne and moved the capital from the thonburi side to the bangkok side of the chao phraya river
there he established the house of chakri the current ruling dynasty of thailand
this first reign was later designated as that of rama i in the list of rama kings of thailand he also established the office of supreme patriarch as the head of the sangha the order of buddhist monks
during the rattanakosin period the chakri kings tried to continue the concepts of ayutthayan kingship once again emphasizing the connection between the sovereign and his subjects
on the other hand they continued to not relinquish any authority of the throne
kings buddha loetla nabhalai rama ii and nangklao rama iii created a semblance of a modern administration by creating a supreme council and appointing chief officers to help with the running of the government
mongkut rama iv marked a significant break in tradition when he spent the first years of his adult life as a buddhist monk during which time he became proficient in the english language before ascending the throne
as king he continued the appointment of officers to his supreme council the most notable being somdet chao phraya prayurawongse and si suriyawongse both of whom acted as chief ministers for king mongkut and the latter as regent from the king s death in until
chulalongkorn rama v ascended the throne as a minor at age in and as king of siam on november
as a prince he had been tutored in western traditions by the governess anna leonowens
intent on reforming the monarchy along western lines during his minority he traveled extensively to observe western administrative methods
he transformed the monarchy along western lines of an enlightened ruler
he abolished the practice of prostration in front of the monarch and repealed many laws concerning the relationship between the monarch and his people while continuing many of the ancient aspects and rituals of the old kingship
in he created a privy council copied from the european tradition to help him rule his kingdom
during his reign siam was pressured to relinquish control of its old tributaries of laos and northern malaya to western powers siam itself narrowly avoided being colonized
in years after his coronation chulalongkorn ended slavery with the slave abolition act
in slaves accounted for one third of the siamese population
his son vajiravudh rama vi ascended to the throne in and continued his father s zeal for reform to bring the monarchy into the th century
the perceived slow pace of reform resulted in the palace revolt of
in vajiravudh determined that the act providing for invoking martial law first promulgated by his father in was not consistent with modern laws of war nor convenient for the preservation of the security of the state so it was amended to a more modern form that with minor amendments continued in force through subsequent changes in government
prajadhipok rama vii succeeded his brother in
the eton and sandhurst educated monarch created a council similar to a cabinet where the most important government officials could meet to decide state affairs
this advisory and legislative council styled the supreme council of state of siam thai was founded on november and existed until
in june a group of foreign educated students and military men called the promoters carried out a bloodless revolution seized power and demanded that king prajadhipok grant the people of siam a constitution
the king agreed and in december the people were granted a constitution ending years of absolute chakri rule
from then on the role of the monarch was relegated to that of a symbolic head of state
his powers from then on were exercised by a prime minister and the national assembly
in pradhipok rama vii abdicated the throne following disagreements with the government
he lived in exile in the united kingdom until his death in
the king was replaced by his young nephew ananda mahidol rama viii
the new king was years old and was living abroad in switzerland
a council of regents was appointed in his place
during this period the roles and powers of the king were entirely usurped by the fascist government of plaek phibunsongkhram who changed the name of the kingdom from siam to thailand and aligned it on the side of the axis powers in the pacific theatre of world war ii
by the end of the war phibunsongkhram was removed and the young king returned
the free thai movement provided resistance to foreign occupation during the war and helped rehabilitate thailand after the war
after rama viii s sudden death from a bullet wound in prince bhumibol adulyadej rama ix aged years old became the new monarch
in establishing his rule the king was aided by the efforts of the us government who used the monarchy as a bulwark against communist gains in southeast asia
king bhumibol was the world s longest reigning monarch at the time of his death in october
he died on october at the age of
since the role of the thai monarchy has been increasingly challenged by scholars students media observers and traditionalists and as more educated pro democracy interests began to express their speech
many deemed that a series of laws and measures relating to l se majest in thailand are hindrances to freedom of expression
dozens of arrests hundreds of criminal investigations and multiple imprisonments have been made based on these laws
king bhumibol adulyadej s speech in his national birthday broadcast could be interpreted that he welcomed criticism
the l se majest law is part of thailand s criminal code and has been described as world s harshest l se majest law and possibly the strictest criminal defamation law anywhere
political scientist giles ungpakorn noted that the l se majest laws are not really designed to protect the institution of the monarchy
in the past the laws have been used to protect governments and to shield military coups from lawful criticism
this whole royal image is created to bolster a conservative elite well beyond the walls of the palace thai activist and magazine editor somyot prueksakasemsuk who was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for l se majest in is a designated prisoner of conscience by amnesty international
the king is assisted in his work and duties by the private secretary to the king of thailand and the privy council of thailand in consultation with the head of the cabinet the prime minister
in accordance with the constitution the king is no longer the originator of all laws in the kingdom that prerogative is entrusted to the national assembly of thailand
all bills passed by the legislature however require his royal assent to become law
the monarchy s household and finances are managed by the bureau of the royal household and the crown property bureau respectively these agencies are not considered part of the thai government and all personnel are appointed by the king
the junta which took power in has been aggressive in jailing critics of the monarchy
in it spent us million more than the budget of the ministry of foreign affairs on a promotional campaign called worship protect and uphold the monarchy the campaign includes television commercials seminars in schools and prisons singing contests and competitions to write stories and films praising the king
this is not propaganda prayut chan o cha the leader of the junta said
the youth must be educated on what the king has done
