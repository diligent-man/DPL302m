The Reformation in Ireland was a movement for the reform of religious life and institutions that was introduced into Ireland by the English administration at the behest of King Henry VIII of England
His desire for an annulment of his marriage was known as the King's Great Matter
Ultimately Pope Clement VII refused the petition consequently in order to give legal effect to his wishes it became necessary for the King to assert his lordship over the Catholic Church in his realm
In passing the Acts of Supremacy in the English Parliament confirmed the King's supremacy over the Church in the Kingdom of England
This challenge to Papal supremacy resulted in a breach with the Catholic Church
By the Irish Parliament had agreed to the change in status of the country from that of a Lordship to that of Kingdom of Ireland
Unlike similar movements for religious reform on the continent of Europe the various phases of the English Reformation as it developed in Ireland were largely driven by changes in government policy to which public opinion in England gradually accommodated itself
In Ireland however the government's policy was not embraced by public opinion the majority of the population continued to adhere to Roman Catholicism
Norman and English monarchs used the title Lord of Ireland to refer to their Irish conquests dating from the Norman invasion of Ireland
In passing the Crown of Ireland Act the Irish Parliament granted Henry by his command a new title King of Ireland
The state was renamed the Kingdom of Ireland
The King desired this innovation because the Lordship of Ireland had been granted by the Papacy technically he held the Lordship in fief from the Pope
As Henry had been excommunicated in and again in he worried that his title could be withdrawn by his overlord the Pope
Henry also arranged for the Irish Parliament to declare him the head of the Church in Ireland
The main instrument of state power in the establishment of the state church in the new Kingdom of Ireland was the Archbishop of Dublin George Brown
He was appointed by the King upon the death of the incumbent though without the approval of the Pope
The reforms were continued by Henry's successor Edward VI of England
The Church of Ireland claims Apostolic succession because of the continuity in the hierarchy however this claim is disputed by the Roman Catholic Church which asserts that only those bishops approved by and in communion with the Holy See are legitimate
Henry's sanctions on outspoken Catholics and Lutherans differed Catholics loyal to the Holy See were to be prosecuted as traitors while Lutherans much rarer in Ireland were to be burned at the stake as heretics
He promulgated the Six Articles Act in
In his reign prayers remained the same with the Latin Breviary still used until the Book of Common Prayer in English was introduced from
From for the first time Irish Communicants were given wine and bread the former Roman Rite of the Mass allowed a congregation to be given bread only with wine taken by the priest
The dissolutions in Ireland followed a very different course from those in England and Wales
There were around religious houses in Ireland in â€”many more relative to population and material wealth than in England and Wales
In marked distinction to the situation in England in Ireland the houses of friars had flourished in the th century attracting popular support and financial endowments undertaking many ambitious building schemes and maintaining a regular conventual and spiritual life
They constituted around half of the total number of religious houses
Irish monasteries by contrast had experienced a catastrophic decline in numbers such that by the th century it appears that only a minority maintained the daily religious observance of the Divine Office
Henry's direct authority as Lord of Ireland and from as King of Ireland only extended to the area of the Pale immediately around Dublin
From the late s his administrators temporarily succeeded in persuading some clan chiefs to adopt his policy of surrender and regrant including the adoption of his state religion
Nevertheless Henry was determined to carry through a policy of dissolution in Ireland and in introduced legislation into the Irish Parliament to legalise the closure of monasteries
The process faced considerable opposition and only sixteen houses were suppressed
Henry remained resolute however and from as part of the Tudor conquest of Ireland he continued to press for the area of successful dissolution to be extended
For the most part this involved making deals with local lords under which monastic property was granted away in exchange for oaths of allegiance to the new Irish Crown and consequently Henry acquired little if any of the wealth of the Irish houses
By the time of Henry's death around half of the Irish monastic houses had been suppressed but many houses of friars continued to resist dissolution until well into the reign of Elizabeth I
During the English Reformation the Church of Ireland suffered in its temporal affairsmore than half the clerical property in the kingdom being vested in lay hands but that of Ireland was in a manner annihilated
Bishopricks colleges glebes and tithes were divided without mercy amongst the great men of the time or leased out on small rents for ever to the friends and relations of the incumbents
Many Irish bishopricks never recovered this devastation as Aghadoe Kilfenora and others
The Bishoprick of Ferns was left not worth one shilling
Killala the best in Ireland was worth only l
per annum Clonfert l the Archbishoprick of Cashel l Waterford l Cork only l Ardagh l
d and the rest at even a lower rateHenry's son Edward VI of England formally established Protestantism as the state religion which was as much a religious matter as his father's reformation had been political
His reign only lasted for six years and his principal reform the Act of Uniformity had much less impact in Ireland than in England
He abolished the crime of heresy in
During his reign attempts were made to introduce Protestant liturgy and bishops to Ireland
These attempts were met with hostility from within the Church even by those who had previously conformed
In a printing press was established in Dublin which printed a Book of Common Prayer in English
Henry's and Edward's efforts were then reversed by Queen Mary I of England who had always been Roman Catholic
On her ascent to the throne Mary reimposed orthodox Roman Catholicism by the First and Second Statute of Repeal of and
When some Episcopal sees in Ireland became vacant clerics loyal to Rome were chosen by Mary with the approval of the Pope
In other cases bishops in possession of dioceses that had been appointed by her father without the approval of the Pope were deposed
She arranged for the Act of Supremacy which asserted England's independence from papal authority to be repealed in and also revived the Heresy Acts
In turn it was agreed that the former monasteries would stay dissolved so as to preserve the loyalty of those who had sinfully bought monastic lands by an Act passed in January and the agreement of Pope Julius III
In Ireland Mary started the first planned wholesale plantations of settlers from England that ironically soon came to be associated with Protestantism
In she married Philip Prince of Asturias who in became the King of Spain
Philip and Mary were also granted a papal bull in by Pope Paul IV to reconfirm their status as the Catholic King and Queen of the new Kingdom of Ireland
Also in the Peace of Augsburg established the principle of Cuius regio eius religio requiring Christians to follow their ruler's version of Christianity and it must have seemed that the experiment of reformation had ended
Mary's Protestant half-sister Queen Elizabeth I succeeded in having Parliament pass another Act of Supremacy in
The Act of had declared the English crown to be 'the only supreme head on earth of the Church in England' in place of the Pope
Any act of allegiance to the Papacy was considered treasonous because the Papacy claimed both spiritual and political power over its followers
Additionally the Irish Act of Uniformity passed in made worship in churches adhering to the Church of Ireland compulsory
Anyone who took office in the Irish church or government was required to take the Oath of Supremacy penalties for violating it included hanging and quartering
Attendance at Church of Ireland services became obligatory those who refused to attend whether Roman Catholics or Protestant nonconformists could be fined and physically punished as recusants by the civil powers
Initially Elizabeth tolerated non-Anglican observance but after the promulgation in of the Papal Bull Regnans in Excelsis Roman Catholics were increasingly seen as a threat to the security of the state
Nevertheless the enforcement of conformity in Ireland was sporadic and limited for much of the sixteenth century
The issue of religious and political rivalry continued during the two Desmond Rebellions and the Nine Years' War both of which overlapped with the Anglo-Spanish War during which some rebellious Irish nobles were helped by the Papacy and by Elizabeth's arch-enemy Philip II of Spain
Due to the unsettled state of the country Protestantism made little progress unlike in Celtic Scotland and Wales at that time
It came to be associated with military conquest and colonisation and was therefore hated by many
The political-religious overlap was personified by Adam Loftus who served as Archbishop and as Lord Chancellor of Ireland
The bulk of Protestants in Ireland during Elizabeth's reign were confined to the ranks of new settlers and government officials who formed a small minority
Amongst the native Gaelic Irish and Old English recusancy pre-dominated and was tolerated by Elizabeth for fear of alienating the Old English further
To them the official state religion had already changed several times since and might well change again as Elizabeth's heir until was the Roman Catholic Mary Queen of Scots
Elizabeth established Trinity College Dublin in partly in order to train clergy to preach the reformed faith
In a Gaelic printing typeface was created and brought to Ireland by dignitaries of St
Patrick's Cathedral Dublin to print documents in the Irish language for the purposes of evangelisation
The liturgy that was intended to be printed was to be used for the preaching in Irish in specially appointed churches in the main town of every diocese
The first translation of the New Testament into Irish was done in and a translation of the Gospels was sponsored by Richard Boyle
The reign of James I started tolerantly and the Treaty of London was signed with Spain but the Gunpowder Plot in caused him and his officials to adopt a harder line against Roman Catholics who remained in the majority even in the Irish House of Lords
So few had converted to Protestantism that the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation was introduced in much later than in the rest of Europe typically marked by the Council of Trent convened in
The Flight of the Earls in led on to the Plantation of Ulster but many of the new settlers were Presbyterian and not Anglican reformed but not entirely acceptable to the Dublin administration
The settlers allowed James to create a slight Protestant majority in the Irish House of Commons in
The work of translating the Old Testament into Irish for the first time was undertaken by William Bedell Bishop of Kilmore who completed his translation within the reign of Charles I although it was not published until in a revised version by Narcissus Marsh Archbishop of Dublin
Bedell had undertaken a translation of the Book of Common Prayer published in
In the Primate James Ussher published A Discourse of the Religion Anciently professed by the Irish and Brittish arguing that the earlier forms of Irish Christianity were self-governing and were not subject to control by the Papacy
Ussher is more famous for calculating from the Bible that the earth was created on October BCE
The final stage was marked by the Irish Rebellion of by those groups of the Irish nobility that continued in their loyalty to the crown Roman Catholicism or both
The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in briefly introduced Puritanism as the state religion
The Restoration period that followed and the brief reign of the Roman Catholic James II were characterised by unusual state tolerance for religions in their kingdoms
During the Patriot Parliament of James II while remaining Catholic also refused to abolish his position as head of the Church of Ireland so ensuring that Protestant bishops attended its sessions
In the Williamite War in Ireland that followed absolutism was destroyed but the majority of the population felt more conquered than ever
The Irish parliament introduced a series of Penal Laws with the ostensible purpose of displacing Roman Catholicism as the majority religion
However there was no consistent attempt by the Protestant Ascendancy to actively convert the bulk of the population to Anglicanism which suggests that their main purposes were economic to transfer wealth from Roman Catholic hands to Protestant hands and to persuade Catholic property owners to convert to Protestantism
An Irish translation of the revised Book of Common Prayer of was effected by John Richardson and was published in
Despite the Reformation's association with military conquest the country produced outstanding philosophers who were Anglican Irish philosophers and writers some of whom were Church of Ireland clergy such as James Ussher Archbishop of Dublin Jonathan Swift priest John Toland essayist philosopher and free thinker George Berkeley bishop
The Presbyterian philosopher Francis Hutcheson had a notable impact in Colonial America
