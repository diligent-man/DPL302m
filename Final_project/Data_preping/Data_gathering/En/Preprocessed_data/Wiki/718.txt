the use of the english language in current and former member countries of the commonwealth of nations was largely inherited from british colonisation
english serves as the medium of inter commonwealth relations
many regions notably australia brunei canada hong kong india ireland malaysia new zealand pakistan singapore south africa sri lanka and the caribbean have developed their own native varieties of the language
mozambique which joined the commonwealth in is a special case english is widely spoken there despite it being a former portuguese colony though the port of chinde was leased by britain from to

southern hemisphere native varieties of english began to develop during the th century with the colonisation of australasia and south africa
