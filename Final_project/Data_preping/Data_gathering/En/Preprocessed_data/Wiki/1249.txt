the rosewood massacre was a racially motivated massacre of black people and the destruction of a black town that took place during the first week of january in rural levy county florida
at least six black people and two white people were killed though eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of to
the town of rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot
florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre including a well publicized incident in december
before the massacre the town of rosewood had been a quiet primarily black self sufficient whistle stop on the seaboard air line railway
trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter
a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in rosewood
for several days survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car
no arrests were made for what happened in rosewood
the town was abandoned by its former black and white residents none of them ever moved back none of them were ever compensated for the loss of their land and the town ceased to exist
although the rioting was widely reported around the united states at the time few official records documented the event
the survivors their descendants and the perpetrators all remained silent about rosewood for decades
sixty years after the rioting the story of rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early s
the survivors and their descendants all organized to sue the state for having failed to protect rosewood s black community
in the florida legislature commissioned a report on the incident
as a result of the findings florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence
the incident was the subject of a feature film which was directed by john singleton
in the state designated the site of rosewood as a florida heritage landmark
officially the recorded death toll during the first week of january was eight six blacks and two whites
some survivors stories claim that up to black residents were killed and they also assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths
minnie lee langley who was in the carrier house when it was besieged recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house
a newspaper article which was published in stated that estimates of up to victims may have been exaggerations
several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave which was filled with the bodies of black people one of them remembers seeing bodies being covered with a plow which was brought from cedar key
however by the time authorities investigated these claims most of the witnesses were dead or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories
rosewood was settled in nine miles km east of cedar key near the gulf of mexico
most of the local economy drew on the timber industry the name rosewood refers to the reddish color of cut cedar wood
two pencil mills were founded nearby in cedar key local residents also worked in several turpentine mills and a sawmill three miles km away in sumner in addition to farming of citrus and cotton
the hamlet grew enough to warrant the construction of a post office and train depot on the florida railroad in but it was never incorporated as a town
initially rosewood had both black and white settlers
when most of the cedar trees in the area had been cut by the pencil mills closed and many white residents moved to sumner
by the population in rosewood had become predominantly black
the village of sumner was predominantly white and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable
two black families in rosewood named goins and carrier were the most powerful
the goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area and in the years preceding the attacks were the second largest landowners in levy county
to avoid lawsuits from white competitors the goins brothers moved to gainesville and the population of rosewood decreased slightly
the carriers were also a large family primarily working at logging in the region
by the s almost everyone in the close knit community was distantly related to each other
the population of rosewood peaked in at people
florida had effectively disenfranchised black voters since the start of the th century by high requirements for voter registration both sumner and rosewood were part of a single voting precinct counted by the u s
census
in the combined population of both towns was black and white
as was common in the late th century south florida had imposed legal racial segregation under jim crow laws requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation
black and white residents created their own community centers by the residents of rosewood were mostly self sufficient
they had three churches a school a large masonic hall a turpentine mill a sugarcane mill a baseball team named the rosewood stars and two general stores one of which was white owned
the village had about a dozen two story wooden plank homes other small two room houses and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures
some families owned pianos organs and other symbols of middle class prosperity
survivors of rosewood remember it as a happy place
in survivor robie mortin recalled at age that when she was a child there that rosewood was a town where everyone s house was painted
there were roses everywhere you walked
lovely
racial violence at the time was common throughout the nation manifested as individual incidents of extra legal actions or attacks on entire communities
lynchings reached a peak around the start of the th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the south
in florida as did many southern states passed laws called black codes disenfranchising black citizens
although these were quickly overturned and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing by the late th century black political influence was virtually nil
the white democratic dominated legislature passed a poll tax in which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters
losing political power black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following
without the right to vote they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office effectively excluding them from the political process
the united states as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes an influx of european immigrants industrialization and the growth of cities and political experimentation in the north
in the south black americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second class citizens
elected officials in florida represented the voting white majority
governor napoleon bonaparte broward suggested finding a location out of state for black people to live separately
tens of thousands of people moved to the north during and after world war i in the great migration unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities
they were recruited by many expanding northern industries such as the pennsylvania railroad the steel industry and meatpacking
florida governors park trammell and sidney catts generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the north and its causes
while trammell was state attorney general none of the lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted nor were any of the that occurred while he was governor
catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti catholic sentiment he openly criticized the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in florida
catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state
by black people had left florida to find employment but also to escape the oppression of segregation underfunded education and facilities violence and disenfranchisement
when u s
troop training began for world war i many white southerners were alarmed at the thought of arming black soldiers
a confrontation regarding the rights of black soldiers culminated in the houston riot of
german propaganda encouraged black soldiers to turn against their real enemies american whites
rumors reached the u s
that french women had been sexually active with black american soldiers which university of florida historian david colburn argues struck at the heart of southern fears about power and miscegenation
colburn connects growing concerns of sexual intimacy between the races to what occurred in rosewood southern culture had been constructed around a set of mores and values which places white women at its center and in which the purity of their conduct and their manners represented the refinement of that culture
an attack on women not only represented a violation of the south s foremost taboo but it also threatened to dismantle the very nature of southern society the transgression of sexual taboos subsequently combined with the arming of black citizens to raise fears among whites of an impending race war in the south
the influx of black people into urban centers in the northeast and midwest increased racial tensions in those cities
between and racial disturbances erupted in numerous cities throughout the u s motivated by economic competition between different racial groups for industrial jobs
one of the first and most violent instances was a riot in east st
louis sparked in
in the red summer of racially motivated mob violence erupted in cities including chicago omaha and washington d c caused by competition for jobs and housing by returning world war i veterans of both races and the arrival of waves of new european immigrants
further unrest occurred in tulsa in when whites attacked the black greenwood community
david colburn distinguishes two types of violence against black people up to northern violence was generally spontaneous mob action against entire communities
southern violence on the other hand took the form of individual incidents of lynchings and other extrajudicial actions
the rosewood massacre according to colburn resembled violence more commonly perpetrated in the north in those years
in the mid s the ku klux klan kkk reached its peak membership in the south and midwest after a revival beginning around
its growth was due in part to tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities in the midwest and west its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from southern and eastern europe
the kkk was strong in the florida cities of jacksonville and tampa miami s chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the miami country club
the klan also flourished in smaller towns of the south where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the reconstruction era
an editor of the gainesville daily sun admitted that he was a member of the klan in and praised the organization in print
despite governor catts change of attitude white mob action frequently occurred in towns throughout north and central florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement
extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom was covered by newspapers
in whites removed four black men from jail who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in macclenny and lynched them
in ocoee the same year two black citizens armed themselves to go to the polls during an election
a confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot after which a white mob destroyed ocoee s black community causing as many as deaths and destroying homes two churches and a masonic lodge
just weeks before the rosewood massacre the perry race riot occurred on and december in which whites burned charles wright at the stake and attacked the black community of perry florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered
on the day following wright s lynching whites shot and hanged two more black men in perry next they burned the town s black school masonic lodge church amusement hall and several families homes
the rosewood massacre occurred after a white woman in sumner claimed she had been assaulted by a black man
frances fannie taylor was years old in and married to james a year old millwright employed by cummer sons in sumner
they lived there with their two young children
james job required him to leave each day during the darkness of early morning
neighbors remembered fannie taylor as very peculiar
she was meticulously clean scrubbing her cedar floors with bleach so that they shone white
other women attested that taylor was aloof no one knew her very well
on january the taylors neighbor reported that she heard a scream while it was still dark grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find fannie bruised and beaten with scuff marks across the white floor
taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby
she said a black man was in her house he had come through the back door and assaulted her
the neighbor found the baby but no one else
taylor s initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her
rumors circulated widely believed by whites in sumner that she was both raped and robbed
the charge of rape of a white woman by a black man was inflammatory in the south the day before the klan had held a parade and rally of over hooded klansmen miles km away in gainesville under a burning cross and a banner reading first and always protect womanhood
the neighbor also reported the absence that day of taylor s laundress sarah carrier whom the white women in sumner called aunt sarah
philomena goins carrier s granddaughter told a different story about fannie taylor many years later
she joined her grandmother carrier at taylor s home as usual that morning
they watched a white man leave by the back door later in the morning before noon
she said taylor did emerge from her home showing evidence of having been beaten but it was well after morning
carrier s grandson and philomena s brother arnett goins sometimes went with them he had seen the white man before
carrier told others in the black community what she had seen that day the black community of rosewood believed that fannie taylor had a white lover they got into a fight that day and he beat her
when the man left taylor s house he went to rosewood
quickly levy county sheriff robert elias walker raised a posse and started an investigation
when they learned that jesse hunter a black prisoner had escaped from a chain gang they began a search to question him about taylor s attack
men arrived from cedar key otter creek chiefland and bronson to help with the search
adding confusion to the events recounted later as many as white men began to gather
sheriff walker deputized some of them but was unable to initiate them all
walker asked for dogs from a nearby convict camp but one dog may have been used by a group of men acting without walker s authority
dogs led a group of about to men to the home of aaron carrier sarah s nephew
aaron was taken outside where his mother begged the men not to kill him
he was tied to a car and dragged to sumner
sheriff walker put carrier in protective custody at the county seat in bronson to remove him from the men in the posse many of whom were drinking and acting on their own authority
worried that the group would quickly grow further out of control walker also urged black employees to stay at the turpentine mills for their own safety
a group of white vigilantes who had become a mob by this time seized sam carter a local blacksmith and teamster who worked in a turpentine still
they tortured carter into admitting that he had hidden the escaped chain gang prisoner
carter led the group to the spot in the woods where he said he had taken hunter but the dogs were unable to pick up a scent
to the surprise of many witnesses someone fatally shot carter in the face
the group hung carter s mutilated body from a tree as a symbol to other black men in the area
some in the mob took souvenirs of his clothes
survivors suggest that taylor s lover fled to rosewood because he knew he was in trouble and had gone to the home of aaron carrier a fellow veteran and mason
carrier and carter another mason covered the fugitive in the back of a wagon
carter took him to a nearby river let him out of the wagon then returned home to be met by the mob who was led by dogs following the fugitive s scent
after lynching sam carter the mob met sylvester carrier aaron s cousin and sarah s son on a road and told him to get out of town
carrier refused and when the mob moved on he suggested gathering as many people as possible for protection
despite the efforts of sheriff walker and mill supervisor w
pillsbury to disperse the mobs white men continued to gather
on the evening of january a mob of armed white men went to rosewood and surrounded the house of sarah carrier
it was filled with approximately to people seeking refuge including many children hiding upstairs under mattresses
some of the children were in the house because they were visiting their grandmother for christmas
they were protected by sylvester carrier and possibly two other men but carrier may have been the only one armed
he had a reputation of being proud and independent
in rosewood he was a formidable character a crack shot expert hunter and music teacher who was simply called man
many white people considered him arrogant and disrespectful
sylvester carrier was reported in the new york times saying that the attack on fannie taylor was an example of what negroes could do without interference
whether or not he said this is debated but a group of to white men inflamed by the reported statement went to the carrier house
they believed that the black community in rosewood was hiding escaped prisoner jesse hunter
reports conflict about who shot first but after two members of the mob approached the house someone opened fire
sarah carrier was shot in the head
her nine year old niece at the house minnie lee langley had witnessed aaron carrier taken from his house three days earlier
when langley heard someone had been shot she went downstairs to find her grandmother emma carrier
sylvester placed minnie lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door using the closet for cover he got behind me in the wood bin and he put the gun on my shoulder and them crackers was still shooting and going on
he put his gun on my shoulder
told me to lean this way and then poly wilkerson he kicked the door down
when he kicked the door down cuz syl let him have it
several shots were exchanged the house was riddled with bullets but the whites did not overtake it
the standoff lasted long into the next morning when sarah and sylvester carrier were found dead inside the house several others were wounded including a child who had been shot in the eye
two white men c
poly wilkerson and henry andrews were killed wilkerson had kicked in the front door and andrews was behind him
at least four white men were wounded one possibly fatally
the remaining children in the carrier house were spirited out the back door into the woods
they crossed dirt roads one at a time then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from rosewood
news of the armed standoff at the carrier house attracted white men from all over the state to take part
reports were carried in the st
petersburg independent the florida times union the miami herald and the miami metropolis in versions of competing facts and overstatement
the miami metropolis listed black people and four white people dead and characterized the event as a race war
national newspapers also put the incident on the front page
the washington post and st
louis dispatch described a band of heavily armed negroes and a negro desperado as being involved
most of the information came from discreet messages from sheriff walker mob rumors and other embellishments to part time reporters who wired their stories to the associated press
details about the armed standoff were particularly explosive
according to historian thomas dye the idea that blacks in rosewood had taken up arms against the white race was unthinkable in the deep south
black newspapers covered the events from a different angle
the afro american in baltimore highlighted the acts of african american heroism against the onslaught of savages
another newspaper reported two negro women were attacked and raped between rosewood and sumner
the sexual lust of the brutal white mobbists satisfied the women were strangled
the white mob burned black churches in rosewood
philomena goins cousin lee ruth davis heard the bells tolling in the church as the men were inside setting it on fire
the mob also destroyed the white church in rosewood
many black residents fled for safety into the nearby swamps some clothed only in their pajamas
wilson hall was nine years old at the time he later recounted his mother waking him to escape into the swamps early in the morning when it was still dark the lights from approaching cars of white men could be seen for miles
the hall family walked miles km through swampland to the town of gulf hammock
the survivors recall that it was uncharacteristically cold for florida and people suffered when they spent several nights in raised wooded areas called hammocks to evade the mob
some took refuge with sympathetic white families
sam carter s year old widow hid for two days in the swamps then was driven by a sympathetic white mail carrier under bags of mail to join her family in chiefland
white men began surrounding houses pouring kerosene on and lighting them then shooting at those who emerged
lexie gordon a light skinned year old woman who was ill with typhoid fever had sent her children into the woods
she was killed by a shotgun blast to the face when she fled from hiding underneath her home which had been set on fire by the mob
fannie taylor s brother in law claimed to be her killer
on january more whites converged on the area forming a mob of between and people
some came from out of state
mingo williams who was miles km away near bronson was collecting turpentine sap by the side of the road when a car full of whites stopped and asked his name
as was custom among many residents of levy county both black and white williams used a nickname that was more prominent than his given name when he gave his nickname of lord god they shot him dead
sheriff walker pleaded with news reporters covering the violence to send a message to the alachua county sheriff p
ramsey to send assistance
carloads of men came from gainesville to assist walker many of them had probably participated in the klan rally earlier in the week
pillsbury tried desperately to keep black workers in the sumner mill and worked with his assistant a man named johnson to dissuade the white workers from joining others using extra legal violence
armed guards sent by sheriff walker turned away black people who emerged from the swamps and tried to go home
pillsbury s wife secretly helped smuggle people out of the area
several white men declined to join the mobs including the town barber who also refused to lend his gun to anyone
he said he did not want his hands wet with blood
governor cary hardee was on standby ready to order national guard troops in to neutralize the situation
despite his message to the sheriff of alachua county walker informed hardee by telegram that he did not fear further disorder and urged the governor not to intervene
the governor s office monitored the situation in part because of intense northern interest but hardee would not activate the national guard without walker s request
walker insisted he could handle the situation records show that governor hardee took sheriff walker s word and went on a hunting trip
james carrier sylvester s brother and sarah s son had previously suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed
he left the swamps and returned to rosewood
he asked w
pillsbury the white turpentine mill supervisor for protection pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found carrier and tortured him to find out if he had aided jesse hunter the escaped convict
after they made carrier dig his own grave they fatally shot him
on january white train conductors john and william bryce managed the evacuation of some black residents to gainesville
the brothers were independently wealthy cedar key residents who had an affinity for trains
they knew the people in rosewood and had traded with them regularly
as they passed the area the bryces slowed their train and blew the horn picking up women and children
fearing reprisals from mobs they refused to pick up any black men
many survivors boarded the train after having been hidden by white general store owner john wright and his wife mary jo
over the next several days other rosewood residents fled to wright s house facilitated by sheriff walker who asked wright to transport as many residents out of town as possible
lee ruth davis her sister and two brothers were hidden by the wrights while their father hid in the woods
on the morning of poly wilkerson s funeral the wrights left the children alone to attend
davis and her siblings crept out of the house to hide with relatives in the nearby town of wylly but they were turned back for being too dangerous
the children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the wrights house
after spotting men with guns on their way back they crept back to the wrights who were frantic with fear
davis later described the experience i was laying that deep in water that is where we sat all day long
we got on our bellies and crawled
we tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes
we were trying to get back to mr
wright house
after we got all the way to his house mr
and mrs
wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us and when we answered they were so glad several other white residents of sumner hid black residents of rosewood and smuggled them out of town
gainesville s black community took in many of rosewood s evacuees waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked covered in sheets
on sunday january a mob of to whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of rosewood
many people were alarmed by the violence and state leaders feared negative effects on the state s tourist industry
governor cary hardee appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate the outbreak in rosewood and other incidents in levy county
in february the all white grand jury convened in bronson
over several days they heard witnesses eight of whom were black but found insufficient evidence to prosecute any perpetrators
the judge presiding over the case deplored the actions of the mob
by the end of the week rosewood no longer made the front pages of major white newspapers
the chicago defender the most influential black newspaper in the u s reported that people in rosewood s race war had died and a soldier named ted cole appeared to fight the lynch mobs then disappeared no confirmation of his existence after this report exists
a few editorials appeared in florida newspapers summarizing the event
the gainesville daily sun justified the actions of whites involved writing let it be understood now and forever that he whether white or black who brutally assaults an innocent and helpless woman shall die the death of a dog the tampa tribune in a rare comment on the excesses of whites in the area called it a foul and lasting blot on the people of levy county
northern publications were more willing to note the breakdown of law but many attributed it to the backward mindset in the south
the new york call a socialist newspaper remarked how astonishingly little cultural progress has been made in some parts of the world while the nashville banner compared the events in rosewood to recent race riots in northern cities but characterized the entire event as deplorable
a three day conference in atlanta organized by the southern methodist church released a statement that similarly condemned the chaotic week in rosewood
it concluded no family and no race rises higher than womanhood
hence the intelligence of women must be cultivated and the purity and dignity of womanhood must be protected by the maintenance of a single standard of morals for both races
officially the recorded death toll of the first week of january was eight people six black and two white
historians disagree about this number
some survivors stories claim there may have been up to black residents killed and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths
minnie lee langley who was in the carrier house siege recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house
several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people one remembers a plow brought from cedar key that covered bodies
however by the time authorities investigated these claims most of the witnesses were dead or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories
aaron carrier was held in jail for several months in early he died in
james carrier s widow emma was shot in the hand and the wrist and reached gainesville by train
she never recovered and died in
sarah carrier s husband haywood did not see the events in rosewood
he was on a hunting trip and discovered when he returned that his wife brother james and son sylvester had all been killed and his house destroyed by a white mob
following the shock of learning what had happened in rosewood haywood rarely spoke to anyone but himself he sometimes wandered away from his family unclothed
his grandson arnett goins thought that he had been unhinged by grief
haywood carrier died a year after the massacre
jesse hunter the escaped convict was never found
many survivors fled in different directions to other cities and a few changed their names from fear that whites would track them down
none ever returned to live in rosewood
fannie taylor and her husband moved to another mill town
she was very nervous in her later years until she succumbed to cancer
john wright s house was the only structure left standing in rosewood
he lived in it and acted as an emissary between the county and the survivors
after they left the town almost all of their land was sold for taxes
mary jo wright died around john developed a problem with alcohol
he was ostracized and taunted for assisting the survivors and rumored to keep a gun in every room of his house
he died after drinking too much one night in cedar key and was buried in an unmarked grave in sumner
the sawmill in sumner burned down in and the owners moved the operation to lacoochee in pasco county
some survivors as well as participants in the mob action went to lacoochee to work in the mill there
pillsbury was among them and he was taunted by former sumner residents
no longer having any supervisory authority pillsbury was retired early by the company
he moved to jacksonville and died in
despite nationwide news coverage in both white and black newspapers the incident and the small abandoned village slipped into oblivion
most of the survivors scattered around florida cities and started over with nothing
many including children took on odd jobs to make ends meet
education had to be sacrificed to earn an income
as a result most of the rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs working as maids shoe shiners or in citrus factories or lumber mills
although the survivors experiences after rosewood were disparate none publicly acknowledged what had happened
robie mortin sam carter s niece was seven years old when her father put her on a train to chiefland miles km east of rosewood on january
mortin s father avoided the heart of rosewood on the way to the depot that day a decision mortin believes saved their lives
mortin s father met them years later in riviera beach in south florida
none of the family ever spoke about the events in rosewood on order from mortin s grandmother she felt like maybe if somebody knew where we came from they might come at us
this silence was an exception to the practice of oral history among black families
minnie lee langley knew james and emma carrier as her parents
she kept the story from her children for years i didn t want them to know what i came through and i didn t discuss it with none of them
i just didn t want them to know what kind of way i come up
i didn t want them to know white folks want us out of our homes decades passed before she began to trust white people
some families spoke of rosewood but forbade the stories from being told arnett doctor heard the story from his mother philomena goins doctor who was with sarah carrier the day fannie taylor claimed she was assaulted and was in the house with sylvester carrier
she told her children about rosewood every christmas
doctor was consumed by his mother s story he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it
in an investigative reporter named gary moore from the st
petersburg times drove from the tampa area to cedar key looking for a story
when he commented to a local on the gloomy atmosphere of cedar key and questioned why a southern town was all white when at the start of the th century it had been nearly half black the local woman replied i know what you re digging for
you re trying to get me to talk about that massacre moore was hooked
he was able to convince arnett doctor to join him on a visit to the site which he did without telling his mother
moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history after a week of sensation the weeks of january seem to have dropped completely from florida s consciousness like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet
when philomena goins doctor found out what her son had done she became enraged and threatened to disown him shook him then slapped him
a year later moore took the story to cbs minutes and was the background reporter on a piece produced by joel bernstein and narrated by african american journalist ed bradley
philomena doctor called her family members and declared moore s story and bradley s television expos were full of lies
a psychologist at the university of florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder made worse by the secrecy
many years after the incident they exhibited fear denial and hypervigilance about socializing with whites which they expressed specifically regarding their children interspersed with bouts of apathy
despite such characteristics survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in rosewood to keep them from becoming bitter
michael d orso who wrote a book about rosewood said e veryone told me in their own way in their own words that if they allowed themselves to be bitter to hate it would have eaten them up robie mortin described her past this way i knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me
but i wasn t angry or anything
the legacy of rosewood remained in levy county
for decades no black residents lived in cedar key or sumner
robin raftis the white editor of the cedar key beacon tried to place the events in an open forum by printing moore s story
she had been collecting anecdotes for many years and said things happened out there in the woods
there s no doubt about that
how bad we don t know
so i said okay guys i m opening the closet with the skeletons because if we don t learn from mistakes we re doomed to repeat them raftis received notes reading we know how to get you and your kids
all it takes is a match
university of florida historian david colburn stated there is a pattern of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place and in fact they said to us on several occasions they don t want to talk about it they don t want to identify anyone involved and there s also a tendency to say that those who were involved were from elsewhere
in a black couple retired to rosewood from washington d c
they told the washington post when we used to have black friends down from chiefland they always wanted to leave before it got dark
they didn t want to be in rosewood after dark
we always asked but folks wouldn t say why
philomena goins doctor died in
her son arnett was by that time obsessed with the events in rosewood
although he was originally excluded from the rosewood claims case he was included after this was revealed by publicity
by that point the case had been taken on a pro bono basis by one of florida s largest legal firms
in the firm filed a lawsuit on behalf of arnett goins minnie lee langley and other survivors against the state government for its failure to protect them and their families
survivors participated in a publicity campaign to expand attention to the case
langley and lee ruth davis appeared on the maury povich show on martin luther king day in
gary moore published another article about rosewood in the miami herald on march he had to negotiate with the newspaper s editors for about a year to publish it
at first they were skeptical that the incident had taken place and secondly reporter lori rosza of the miami herald had reported on the first stage of what proved in december to be a deceptive claims case with most of the survivors excluded
if something like that really happened we figured it would be all over the history books an editor wrote
arnett doctor told the story of rosewood to print and television reporters from all over the world
he raised the number of historic residents in rosewood as well as the number who died at the carrier house siege he exaggerated the town s contemporary importance by comparing it to atlanta georgia as a cultural center
doctor wanted to keep rosewood in the news his accounts were printed with few changes
according to historian thomas dye doctor s forceful addresses to groups across the state including the naacp together with his many articulate and heart rending television appearances placed intense pressure on the legislature
to do something about rosewood
in december doctor told a meeting at jacksonville beach that women and children had been buried alive at rosewood and that his facts had been confirmed by journalist gary moore
he was embarrassed to learn that moore was in the audience
as the holland knight law firm continued the claims case they represented survivors people who had lived in rosewood at the time of the violence in the claim to the legislature
the lawsuit missed the filing deadline of january
the speaker of the florida house of representatives commissioned a group to research and provide a report by which the equitable claim bill could be evaluated
it took them nearly a year to do the research including interviews and writing
on december historians from florida state university florida a m university and the university of florida delivered a page report with pages of attached documentation on the rosewood massacre
it was based on available primary documents and interviews mostly with black survivors of the incident
due to the media attention received by residents of cedar key and sumner following filing of the claim by survivors white participants were discouraged from offering interviews to the historians
the report used a taped description of the events by jason mcelveen a cedar key resident who had since died and an interview with ernest parham who was in high school in and happened upon the lynching of sam carter
parham said he had never spoken of the incident because he was never asked
the report was titled documented history of the incident which occurred at rosewood florida in january
gary moore the investigative journalist who wrote the story in the st
petersburg times that reopened the rosewood case criticized demonstrable errors in the report
the commissioned group retracted the most serious of these without public discussion
they delivered the final report to the florida board of regents and it became part of the legislative record
florida s consideration of a bill to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any u s

opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on floridians who had nothing to do with the incident in rosewood
james peters who represented the state of florida argued that the statute of limitations applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit sheriff walker and governor hardee had died many years before
he also called into question the shortcomings of the report although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind they offered conclusions about the actions of sheriff walker and governor hardee
the report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died
critics thought that some of the report s writers asked leading questions in their interviews
even legislators who agreed with the sentiment of the bill asserted that the events in rosewood were typical of the era
one survivor interviewed by gary moore said that to single out rosewood as an exception as if the entire world was not a rosewood would be vile
florida representatives al lawson and miguel de grandy argued that unlike native americans or slaves who had suffered atrocities at the hands of whites the residents of rosewood were tax paying self sufficient citizens who deserved the protection of local and state law enforcement
while mob lynchings of black people around the same time tended to be spontaneous and quickly concluded the incident at rosewood was prolonged over a period of several days
some legislators began to receive hate mail including some claiming to be from ku klux klan members
one legislator remarked that his office received an unprecedented response to the bill with a proportion of ten constituents to one opposing it
in the state legislature held a hearing to discuss the merits of the bill
lee ruth davis died a few months before testimony began but minnie lee langley arnett goins wilson hall willie evans and several descendants from rosewood testified
other witnesses were a clinical psychologist from the university of florida who testified that survivors had suffered post traumatic stress and experts who offered testimony about the scale of property damages
langley spoke first the hearing room was packed with journalists and onlookers who were reportedly mesmerized by her statement
ernest parham also testified about what he saw
when asked specifically when he was contacted by law enforcement regarding the death of sam carter parham replied that he had been contacted for the first time on carter s death two weeks before testifying
the coroner s inquest for sam carter had taken place the day after he was shot in january he concluded that carter had been killed by unknown party
after hearing all the evidence the special master richard hixson who presided over the testimony for the florida legislature declared that the state had a moral obligation to make restitution to the former residents of rosewood
he said i truly don t think they cared about compensation
i think they simply wanted the truth to be known about what happened to them
whether they got fifty cents or a hundred and fifty million dollars
it didn t matter
black and hispanic legislators in florida took on the rosewood compensation bill as a cause and refused to support governor lawton chiles healthcare plan until he put pressure on house democrats to vote for the bill
chiles was offended as he had supported the compensation bill from its early days and the legislative caucuses had previously promised their support for his healthcare plan
the legislature passed the bill and governor chiles signed the rosewood compensation bill a million package to compensate survivors and their descendants
seven survivors and their family members were present at the signing to hear chiles say
because of the strength and commitment of these survivors and their families the long silence has finally been broken and the shadow has been lifted
instead of being forgotten because of their testimony the rosewood story is known across our state and across our nation
this legislation assures that the tragedy of rosewood will never be forgotten by the generations to come originally the compensation total offered to survivors was million which aroused controversy
the legislature eventually settled on million this would enable payment of to each person who could prove he or she lived in rosewood during and provide a pool for people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in rosewood during the same time
the four survivors who testified automatically qualified four others had to apply
more than applications were received from around the world
robie mortin came forward as a survivor during this period she was the only one added to the list who could prove that she had lived in rosewood in totaling nine survivors who were compensated
gaining compensation changed some families whose members began to fight among themselves
some descendants refused it while others went into hiding in order to avoid the press of friends and relatives who asked them for handouts
some descendants after dividing the funds among their siblings received not much more than each
later the florida department of education set up the rosewood family scholarship fund for rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities
the rosewood massacre the ensuing silence and the compensation hearing were the subject of the book titled like judgment day the ruin and redemption of a town called rosewood by mike d orso
it was a new york times bestseller and won the lillian smith book award bestowed by the university of georgia libraries and the southern regional council to authors who highlight racial and social inequality in their works
the dramatic feature film rosewood directed by john singleton was based on these historic events
minnie lee langley served as a source for the set designers and arnett doctor was hired as a consultant
recreated forms of the towns of rosewood and sumner were built in central florida far away from levy county
the film version written by screenwriter gregory poirier created a character named mann who enters rosewood as a type of reluctant western style hero
composites of historic figures were used as characters and the film offers the possibility of a happy ending
in the new york times e r
shipp suggests that singleton s youth and his background in california contributed to his willingness to take on the story of rosewood
she notes singleton s rejection of the image of black people as victims and the portrayal of an idyllic past in which black families are intact loving and prosperous and a black superhero who changes the course of history when he escapes the noose takes on the mob with double barreled ferocity and saves many women and children from death
singleton has offered his view i had a very deep i wouldn t call it fear but a deep contempt for the south because i felt that so much of the horror and evil that black people have faced in this country is rooted here
so in some ways this is my way of dealing with the whole thing
reception of the film was mixed
shipp commented on singleton s creating a fictional account of rosewood events saying that the film assumes a lot and then makes up a lot more
the film version alludes to many more deaths than the highest counts by eyewitnesses
gary moore believes that creating an outside character who inspires the citizens of rosewood to fight back condescends to survivors and he criticized the inflated death toll specifically saying the film was an interesting experience in illusion
on the other hand in stanley crouch of the new york times described rosewood as singleton s finest work writing never in the history of american film had southern racist hysteria been shown so clearly
color class and sex were woven together on a level that faulkner would have appreciated
the state of florida declared rosewood a florida heritage landmark in and subsequently erected a historical marker on state road that names the victims and describes the community s destruction
scattered structures remain within the community including a church a business and a few homes notably john wright s
mary hall daniels the last known survivor of the massacre at the time of her death died at the age of in jacksonville florida on may
vera goins hamilton who had not previously been publicly identified as a survivor of the rosewood massacre died at the age of in lacoochee florida in
rosewood descendants formed the rosewood heritage foundation and the real rosewood foundation in order to educate people both in florida and all over the world about the massacre
the rosewood heritage foundation created a traveling exhibit that tours internationally in order to share the history of rosewood and the attacks a permanent display is housed in the library of bethune cookman university in daytona beach
the real rosewood foundation presents a variety of humanitarian awards to people in central florida who help preserve rosewood s history
the organization also recognized rosewood residents who protected blacks during the attacks by presenting an unsung heroes award to the descendants of sheriff robert walker john bryce and william bryce
lizzie jenkins executive director of the real rosewood foundation and niece of the rosewood schoolteacher explained her interest in keeping rosewood s legacy current
it has been a struggle telling this story over the years because a lot of people don t want to hear about this kind of history
people don t relate to it or just don t want to hear about it
but mama told me to keep it alive so i keep telling it
it s a sad story but it s one i think everyone needs to hear the state of florida in established a rosewood family scholarship program paying up to each to up to students each year who are direct descendants of rosewood families
