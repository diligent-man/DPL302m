the history of wicca documents the rise of the neopagan religion of wicca and related witchcraft based neopagan religions
wicca originated in the early twentieth century when it developed amongst secretive covens in england who were basing their religious beliefs and practices upon what they read of the historical witch cult in the works of such writers as margaret murray
it was subsequently popularized in the s by a number of figures in particular gerald gardner who claimed to have been initiated into the craft as wicca is often known by the new forest coven in
gardner s form of wicca the gardnerian tradition was spread by both him and his followers like the high priestesses doreen valiente patricia crowther and eleanor bone into other parts of the british isles and also into other predominantly english speaking countries across the world
in the s new figures arose in britain who popularized their own forms of the religion including robert cochrane sybil leek and alex sanders and organizations began to be formed to propagate it such as the witchcraft research association
it was during this decade that the faith was transported to the united states where it was further adapted into new traditions such as feri and dianic wicca in the ensuing decades and where organizations such as the covenant of the goddess were formed
from the s onward books began to be published by such figures as paul huson scott cunningham and stewart and janet farrar which encouraged self initiation into the craft leading to a boost in the number of adherents and the development of traditions
with the rising popularity of wicca it was used as a partial basis for witchcraft based american films and television shows further increasing its profile particularly amongst younger people in the s
since the early s historians have published studies and research into the history of wicca including the american aidan kelly and the britons ronald hutton and philip heselton
during the th and th centuries a widespread moral panic took place across europe and the american colonies
the social and political turmoil following periods of widespread crop failure war and disease led to numerous men and women being accused of practicing malevolent witchcraft which resulted in the witch trials in the early modern period
the accused were put on trial and alleged to be witches who worshiped the devil and committed acts of diabolism that included the cannibalism of children and desecration of the eucharist
between and people were executed for witchcraft during this period
most scholars agree that the witch trials were the result of isolated incidents of hysteria in remote peasant communities
while many of the accused confessed to various acts of magic and satanism all did so under threat of torture and historians agree that there is no evidence any of the victims of the trials were practicing any real magic or any non christian religious or magical practices
an alternative explanation for the early modern witch trials known as the witch cult hypothesis was proposed by the german professor karl ernst jarcke in
jarcke s hypothesis claimed that the victims of the early modern witch trials were not innocents caught up in a moral panic but members of a previously unknown pan european pagan religion which had pre dated christianity been persecuted by the christian church as a rival religion and finally driven underground where it had survived in secret until being revealed in the confessions of those accused in the witch trials
this idea was later endorsed by german historian franz josef mone and french historian jules michelet
in the late th century variations on this hypothesis were adopted by two americans matilda joslyn gage and charles leland the latter of whom promoted it in his book aradia or the gospel of the witches
the witch cult hypothesis most prominent and influential advocate was the english egyptologist margaret murray who promoted it in a series of books most notably s the witch cult in western europe and s the god of the witches
murray s books were the sources of many well known motifs which have often been incorporated into wicca
the idea that covens should have members was developed by murray based on a single witness statement from one of the witch trials as was her assertion that covens met on the cross quarter days four times per year
murray was very interested in ascribing naturalistic or religious ceremonial explanations to some of the more fantastic descriptions found in witch trial testimony
murray suggested based in part on the work of james frazer in the golden bough that the witches accused in the early modern trials were not in fact satanists but worshiped a pre christian god associated with forests and the natural world
murray identified this god as janus or dianus following frazer s suggested etymology who she described as a horned god of the wilds in order to explain descriptions of a horned satan provided by witch trial confessions
because those accused of witchcraft often described witches meetings as involving sexual orgies with satan she suggested that a male priest representing dianus would have been present at each coven meeting dressed in horns and animals skins who engaged in sexual acts with the gathered women
murray further interpreted descriptions of sexual intercourse with satan as being cold and painful to mean that the priest would often use artificial implements on the witches when he became too exhausted to continue
unlike most modern forms of religious witchcraft murray s conception of the witch cult was therefore strictly patriarchal
in her hypothesis witches worshiped a single god and though a female figure in a role known as the maiden would be present at coven gatherings murray did not consider her to represent a goddess
in this way murray s hypothesis which had been based primarily of her interpretations of witch trial records differed strongly from leland s belief in a goddess centered witch cult focused on diana and aradia derived from supposed rural italian folk practices
one key aspect of murray s witch cult hypothesis later adopted by wicca was the idea that not only were historical accounts of witches based in truth but witches had originally been involved in benevolent fertility related functions rather than malevolent hexing and cursing as traditionally portrayed
in examining testimony from the early modern witch trials murray encountered numerous examples of the kinds of curses and nefarious activities the accused people confessed to
seeking to fit these into a framework in which descriptions of witchcraft had both a natural and pagan religious explanation murray posited that these malevolent actions were actually twisted interpretations of benevolent actions altered either under duress during the trials or by practitioners themselves who had over the years forgotten or changed the original intent of their practices
for example murray interpreted isobel gowdie s confession to cursing a farm field by setting loose a toad pulling a miniature plough as originally having been not a curse on the field as gowdie stated but a means of ensuring fertility of the crops
murray stated that these acts were misunderstood by the recorders and probably by the witches themselves
according to murray
with these kinds of interpretations murray created for the first time the idea of the witch as a practitioner of good magic and religious rites to ensure fertility of people and the land
this ran counter to all previous ideas about what witchcraft was in history and folklore even leland s variant of the witch cult hypothesis in aradia depicted witches as not fully benevolent but rather as revolutionary figures who would use cursing and black magic to exact revenge on their enemies the upper classes and the catholic church
murray combined testimony from several witch trials to arrive at the idea that witches met four times per year at coven meetings or sabbaths
she also used one piece of testimony to arrive at the conclusion that covens were usually composed of witches led by a male priest who would dress in animal skins horns and fork toed shoes to denote his authority the dress was assumed to be a naturalistic explanation for accused witch s descriptions of satan
the grand master according to murray not only represented the horned god but was believed to fully embody him allowing his presence at the sabbath
she wrote
according to murray the traditional name for coven gatherings sabbath was derived from s esbattre meaning to frolic
most historians disagree arguing instead that the organizers of the witch trials adopted terms predominantly associated with judaism including sabbath in order to denigrate witches as the equivalent to jews who were also highly denigrated in mainstream european culture during this period
in fact many witch trial accounts used not only sabbath but also synagogue in reference to gatherings of witches
most mainstream folklorists including most of murray s contemporaries did not take her hypothesis seriously
rather than accept murray s naturalistic explanation for the magical feats and rituals ascribed to witches during the early modern trials other folklorists argued that the entire scenario was always fictitious and did not require a naturalistic explanation
the supposed details of the rituals and witchcraft practices described in trial records were simply invented by victims under torture or threat of torture based on the kinds of diabolic rites that clergy of the time would have expected to hear about
almost all of murray s peers regarded the witch cult theory as incorrect and based on poor scholarship
modern scholars have notes that murray was highly selective in the evidence she pulled from trial accounts favoring details that supported her theory and ignoring details that clearly had no naturalistic analogue
murray often contradicted herself within her own books citing accounts in one chapter as evidence for naturalistic explanations while using exactly the same passages to argue opposite points in the next
despite these criticisms murray was invited to write the entry on witchcraft for the edition of the encyclop dia britannica which was reprinted for decades last appearing in the edition
rather than write an article that reflected the historical consensus on the witch trials murray used the opportunity to promote her own hypothesis in the encyclop dia presenting it as fact
it was so influential that according to folklorist jacqueline simpson murray s ideas became so entrenched in popular culture that they will probably never be uprooted
though most late th and early st century historians have been critical of murray s ideas and methods a few credit her hypothesis with least a bit of underlying truth
emmanuel le roy ladurie for example argued that while most of murray s arguments were near nonsense he also pointed to carlo ginzburg s discovery in the s of the italian benandanti folk magicians who practiced anti witchcraft magic and were themselves put on trial for witchcraft as evidence that in at least some cases the accusations of the witch trial organizers were not based entirely on panicked fantasy
ginzburg himself distanced himself from murray s hypothesis though he also argued that the benandanti were a continuation of a pre christian shamanic tradition an assertion which has itself been criticized by other scholars as lacking solid evidence
simpson noted that the only contemporary member of the folklore society who took murray s ideas seriously was gerald gardner who used them as the basis for wicca
the witch cult theory came to represent the historical narrative around which wicca built itself with early wiccans claiming to be members of murray s hypothesized secret religion
many wiccans particularly those of the early decades believed that their religion was a continuation of the witch cult
it was only during the s and s that some wiccans began to see the idea of the witch cult as a creation myth rather than as historical fact
for instance in wiccan jenny gibbons stated that
another hypothesis that would have major influence on wicca during its development was the idea of primitive matriarchal religions which derived from the work of the swiss lawyer johann jakob bachofen was popular in gardner s day both among academics e g erich neumann margaret murray and amateurs e g
robert graves
later scholars e g
carl jung and marija gimbutas continued research in this area and later still joseph campbell ashley montagu and others became admirers of gimbutas theories of matriarchies in ancient europe
matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continue to be matters of academic debate
some academics carry on research in this area such as the world congress on matriarchal studies
critics argue that such matriarchal societies never actually existed and are an invention of researchers such as margaret murray
this is disputed by documentaries such as blossoms of fire about contemporary zapotec society
the idea of a supreme mother goddess was common in victorian and edwardian literature the concept of a horned god especially related to the gods pan or faunus was less common but still significant
both of these ideas were widely accepted in academic literature and the popular press at the time
in gerald gardner a retired english civil servant who had spent most of his life in the far east and who was a member of the folklore society during margaret murray s tenure published witchcraft today in which he made the claim to have encountered surviving members of murray s hypothesized early modern witch cult
gardner claimed that he had been initiated into a practising coven of the cult in september a group that has become known as the new forest coven
gardner claimed that this group had met in the new forest in southern england and that he had met some of their members initially through the rosicrucian order crotona fellowship
he mentioned two of their members a local worthy called old dorothy in whose house he claimed to have been initiated and dafo who became a friend of his and would remain so for many years
doreen valiente undertook research into the identity of old dorothy whose surname was clutterbuck
she refuted the claims of those who had suggested that dorothy had been the product of gardner s imagination
more recently it has been doubted notably by ronald hutton whether the historical dorothy clutterbuck who was outwardly an observant christian and a pillar of the local community really was involved in occult activities
in hutton s view gardner may have used her name as a joke and or as a subterfuge to conceal the identity of dafo or some other individual
valiente also assumed that clutterbuck was the same individual as dafo
dafo herself seems to have been a teacher of music and elocution by the name of edith woodford grimes and there have been persistent suggestions that she and gardner were lovers
some such as isaac bonewits have argued that valiente and heselton s evidence points to an early th century revival predating gardner by the new forest coven perhaps rather than an intact old pagan religion
the argument points to historical claims of gardner s that agree with scholarship of a certain time period and contradict later scholarship
bonewits writes somewhere between and in england some folklorists appear to have gotten together with some golden dawn rosicrucians and a few supposed fam trads to produce the first modern covens in england grabbing eclectically from any source they could find in order to try and reconstruct the shards of their pagan past
it has been proposed originally in the druidic journal aisling that gardner s new forest coven was the pagan section of the order of woodcraft chivalry this order performed rituals in the new forest in the early s and its pagan section honoured a moon goddess and a horned god and believed in ritual nakedness
one of ronald hutton s informants reports that gardner was familiar with this order at least by the s
a major difficulty with identifying this group with the new forest coven is that it does not appear to have met in the new forest between and
gardner records a working by the coven in the new forest in against the projected nazi invasion
a theory advanced by bill liddell is that the new forest coven derived from a set of covens created by the nineteenth century cunning man george pickingill who lived in the essex village of canewdon
this claim is not widely accepted although it does focus attention on the well documented and widespread cunning folk and their contribution to the history of british witchcraft
gardner claiming to be fearful that the witch religion would die out began to propagate it by forming the bricket wood coven in hertfordshire circa
he acted as the high priest for the coven and edith woodford grimes a k a
dafo who also claimed to have been a member of the new forest coven acted as his high priestess
however woodford grimes became concerned that gardner s attempts to gain publicity would lead to a public backlash against her and so she left the bricket wood coven in
in gardner initiated a young woman named doreen valiente into the coven and she soon went on to become the new high priestess
around the same time gardner composed the coven s book of shadows a workbook of rituals although he claimed it was of ancient origins
valiente s influence on the developing religion was immediately felt
gardner s early conception of religious witchcraft closely paralleled the system outlined by margaret murray including a patriarchal structure which focused almost exclusively on the worship of murray s horned god
however under the influence of valiente emphasis soon shifted to emphasize the role of the goddess bringing gardner s witchcraft in line with pre murray sources like charles leland s aradia
gardner was also reportedly upset when valiente recognized that significant portions of his rituals had been adapted with very little change from those developed in aleister crowley s tradition of thelema
gardner asserted that he had simply used crowley s rituals to fill in the rather bare bones rituals he had been given by the new forest coven
nonetheless valiente helped gardner rewrite the book of shadows removing much of what she saw as crowleyanity and adding sections such as the charge of the goddess which she adapted from aradia in poetic verse
valiente and gardner later had a falling out when she became frustrated with his repeated attempts to gain publicity for the coven and when he tried to impose the so called wiccan laws something which he claimed were used by the witch cult but which valiente believed he had simply made up
she left along with several other members of the bricket wood coven to found their own
the bricket wood coven continued on with members that included jack bracelin dayonis frederic lamond and lois bourne
gardner also propagated his witchcraft tradition which came to be referred to as gardnerian witchcraft outside of his bricket wood coven
he initiated patricia crowther eleanor rae bone and monique wilson all of whom went on to propagate gardnerian witchcraft through their own covens
various other initiates began to spread the craft around britain for instance charles clark took the religion to england s northern neighbour scotland
gardner eventually succeeded in gaining greater publicity for his religion
he gave interviews to several newspapers some of which were positive although others turned very negative one even declaring witches devil worship in london
he also published a second non fiction book on the subject the meaning of witchcraft in as well as running the museum of magic and witchcraft on the isle of man up until his death in
gardner referred to members of his tradition as the wica although he called the religion itself witchcraft and never used the term wicca in the sense as it is now known
the ritual format of wicca shows the influence of late victorian era occultism even co founder doreen valiente admitted seeing influence from aleister crowley and there is very little in the ritual that cannot be shown to have come from earlier extant sources
the religion s spiritual content however is inspired by older pagan faiths for example in the veneration of historical pagan deities with buddhist and hindu influences e g
in the wiccan doctrine of reincarnation
it has been posited by authors such as aidan kelly and francis x
king that gardner himself created the religion that he claimed to have discovered rewriting the rituals of an older witchcraft tradition according to his own whim and incorporating elements from the thesis of dr
margaret murray sources such as aradia or the gospel of the witches by charles godfrey leland and the practices of ceremonial magic
the original material in the rituals brought to light by gardner is not cohesive and mostly takes the form of substitutions or expansions within unoriginal material
roger dearnaley in an annotated chronology and bibliography of the early gardnerian craft describes it as a patchwork
one element that is apparently distinctive is the use of ritual scourging and binding as a method of attaining an ecstatic trance for magical working
hutton argues strongly that this practice in wicca does not reflect sado masochistic sexuality he refers in this connection to gardner s own collection of very mild quasi pornographic material which showed no traces of such interests but is simply a practical method of work alternative to drugs or other more strenuous methods
heselton writing in wiccan roots and later in gerald gardner and the cauldron of inspiration argues that gardner was not the author of the wiccan rituals but received them in good faith from an unknown source
doreen valiente makes this claim regarding the basic skeleton of the rituals as margot adler puts it in drawing down the moon he notes that all the crowley material that is found in the wiccan rituals can be found in a single book the equinox vol no
or blue equinox
gardner is not known to have owned or had access to a copy of this book although he met with crowley towards the end of the latter s life
gardner admitted that the rituals he received from old dorothy s coven were very fragmentary and in order to make them workable he had to supplement them with other material
gardner was not the only person claiming to be a member of a surviving remnant of the witch cult several others also emerged in the s making this claim
they included sybil leek charles cardell raymond howard rolla nordic and robert cochrane
they claimed to have been initiated into the cult by their ancestors and described themselves as following hereditary or traditional forms of witchcraft whereas gardner some said was propagating a modern and invalid form
their beliefs and practices however were similar to those of gardner and some of their modern followers describe their faith as being a form of wicca whereas others insist it is different and call it traditional witchcraft
the terms wicca and wiccen were first used by charles cardell not to refer purely to gardnerians but to refer to all followers of the witch cult religion
in his notebooks he used the term wicca to refer to the religion and he called it the craft of the wiccens in a article in light magazine
initially there was an attempt to reconcile and unite all of these traditions claiming to be witch cult remnants for instance the witchcraft research association which was founded in by sybil leek
after leek emigrated to the united states doreen valiente took over presidency and began publication of a magazine pentagram
however both the magazine and the organisation collapsed amongst infighting by the various traditions with cochrane consistently insulting and even calling for a night of the long knives against gardnerians
within a few years of gardner s propagation of the craft wicca had spread from england into neighbouring scotland and ireland
however in the s it also began to spread much further abroad most notably in the english speaking nations of australia and the united states
in australia wicca found a receptive social environment because of the long standing presence and familiarity of aboriginal culture with its pagan i e
non christian beliefs and practices
gardnerian wicca came to the united states through an englishman who had recently emigrated to the us named raymond buckland and his wife rosemary
raymond working for british airways regularly returned to england and he began to correspond with gardner
in both bucklands were initiated into the gardnerian craft by monique wilson in a ceremony in britain
the couple returned to america where they founded the long island coven in new york state basing their practice upon the gardnerian book of shadows
the coven was later taken over by a couple known only as theos and phoenix who enlarged the book of shadows adding further degrees of initiation which were required before members could found their own covens
interest outstripped the ability of the mostly british based covens to train and propagate members the beliefs of the religion spread faster by the printed word or word of mouth than the initiatory system was prepared to handle
also in the s non gardnerian forms of witchcraft which are sometimes viewed as wicca or sometimes as traditional witchcraft made their way to the usa
the american joseph bearwalker wilson corresponded with the english robert cochrane prior to cochrane s ritual suicide in and from this he founded the tradition
sybil leek too an english witch from the new forest emigrated to california where she continued to practice her craft and teach others
in gavin and yvonne frost established the church and school of wicca which in became the first federally recognised wiccan church
it would be in the s that wicca would begin to gain a foothold in other nations for instance ipsita roy chakraverti began to publicise it in india and it also has a number of adherents in south africa
in the s an englishman called alex sanders emerged appearing in various newspapers
he claimed to be a hereditary witch having been initiated into the craft by his grandmother
later researchers such as ronald hutton have shown that he actually had been initiated into a gardnerian coven although hutton notes that sanders grandmother was in fact skilled in cunning craft
sanders had previously practiced as a spiritualist healer
his reputation in the tabloids increased when he married the much younger maxine sanders in a handfasting ceremony and subsequently the duo began to refer to themselves as the king and queen of the witches at one point claiming to have the allegiance of witches and northern covens
his tradition which was later coined as alexandrian by stewart farrar an initiate of sanders incorporated aspects from ceremonial magic and the qabalah as well as judeo christian iconography
sanders justified this by claiming that his version of wicca and christianity were both forces for good battling against the forces of darkness which were practised by satanists and black magicians
several gardnerians including patricia crowther and ray bone tried to denounce sanders as a charlatan but he simply responded by accusing them of being the charlatans and as being practitioners of black magic who abused their initiates
in alex and maxine separated but both continued to practice the craft
one of the key reasons for their separation was that neither would compromise on alex s bisexuality
after the divorce alex focused on formulating wicca so that it could be followed by homosexual men who had been partially prevented from involvement previously because of the religions focus on gender polarity
he also initiated a number of people from continental europe who then spread the faith there
in sanders issued an apology for his past hurts and many public stupidities and tried to encorouge co operation between gardnerians and alexandrians
he died in
in the united states several forms of wicca formed in the s based upon the gardnerian and alexandrian traditions but with certain differences
these traditions were actually formed by those who had previously been initiated into gardnerian or alexandrian crafts and so can still be traced to gardner and thereby are often considered to be forms of british traditional wicca
the first of these was algard wicca founded in by mary nesnick who had been initiated into both of the aforementioned traditions
algard attempted to fuse the two together thereby trying to prevent the arguments that were going on between the two
the following year in raymond buckland who had brought the gardnerian craft to the usa originally ceased to practice it and formed a new tradition known as seax wica
seax used the structure of traditional gardnerian covens but used the iconography of anglo saxon paganism so the god and the goddess were represented not as the traditional horned god and mother goddess but as woden and freya
seax was virtually unique amongst wicca at the time as it did not work on an initiatory basis of covens buckland deliberately published all its rites and rituals in a book the tree so that anyone could practice them
in a hungarian american named zsuzsanna budapest who had no connection to any gardnerian or alexandrian covens mixed wiccan practices with feminist politics forming dianic witchcraft although now it is better known as dianic wicca
she began this with a coven in los angeles that she named the susan b
anthony coven number one
dianic wicca focused almost exclusively upon the goddess and largely and in some covens completely ignoring the horned god
most covens were women only and some were designed specifically for lesbians
like seax wica which developed around the same time the rituals of dianic wicca were published by its creator so that any woman could practice it without having the need of a specific initiation into a lineage
indeed budapest believed that it was every woman s right to be able to practice the religion and she referred to it as being women s spirituality
dianic wicca was criticized by many gardnerians at the time for having an almost monotheistic view of theology in contrast with wicca s traditional duotheism
one gardnerian even declared spare us jahweh in drag in response to the focus on the one goddess
one gardnerian who went under the craft name of starhawk started practicing dianic wicca and tried to reconcile the two writing the book the spiral dance on the subject
the tradition she founded became known as reclaiming and mixed wicca with other forms of neopaganism such as feri along with strong principles of environmental protection
in traditional gardnerian and alexandrian craft initiates took an oath of secrecy never to reveal the rituals of it to outsiders
despite this both gardner and sanders sought publicity and allowed reporters to witness their practices
initiates such as valiente and buckland had been annoyed at this the first commenting that by speaking to the press gardner was compromising the security of the group and the sincerity of his own teachings
however the key rituals of the gardnerians which were the basis for most of the alexandrian ones were made public in the s when charles cardell in an act of spite against the recently deceased gardner published the gardnerian book of shadows
in paul huson published mastering witchcraft a book purportedly based upon non wiccan traditional british witchcraft and the first do it yourself manual for the would be witch which became one of the basic instruction books for a large number of covens
in lady sheba jessie wicker bell the kentucky born self styled queen of the american witches published what she claimed was her family s centuries old grimoire but which in fact contained material substantially plagiarised from the gardnerian book of shadows and also included poetry by doreen valiente that was and is still under copyright
doreen valiente also published information on the subject of pagan witchcraft such as the book an abc of witchcraft which contained a self initiation ritual for solitary practitioners
following this other wiccans decided that it would be better to simply reveal the wiccan mysteries to the public in their true form
these included stewart and janet farrar two alexandrian initiates
stewart prior to his marriage had already published information on wiccan rituals with sanders blessing in his book what witches do
together they published further works on the subjects such eight sabbats for witches and the witches way
from these published writings many other practitioners began to follow the witchcraft religion working either as solitary witches or in non lineaged covens
valiente herself considered all of these such people to be witches and she reserved the term wiccan to refer solely to gardnerians
despite this most of the newer followers used the term wiccan to describe themselves and in the united states it became the norm to refer to any neopagan witchcraft as wicca and so gardnerians alexandrians and algards wishing to emphasize their lineage that stretched back to gardner began referring to themselves as followers of british traditional wicca
in the s and s wicca began to become ingrained in popular culture
aspects of wicca were incorporated into the new age movement and many wiccans took on new age beliefs and practices
wicca was also taken up by popular entertainment in the american film the craft was released about four witches who are corrupted by their power
the same year the television series sabrina the teenage witch appeared which was followed the following year by buffy the vampire slayer and in by the series charmed and the film practical magic
whilst these were heavily criticized by many wiccans margot adler called the craft the worst movie ever made they did encourage many teenagers and young adults to investigate more about the religion
most covens and neopagan groups refused to allow under s into their ranks and so many teenagers turned to books to find out more
in turn several books were published to cater for them including silver ravenwolf s teen witch wicca for a new generation and scott cunningham s wicca a guide for the solitary practitioner
this helped to bring about the teen wicca movement and it has been suggested that the reason why so many young adults are attracted to the faith can be attributed to the fact that it tackles issues that teenagers are interested in in a way that other religions do not
the popularity of wicca amongst teens has also brought problems in a year old american schoolgirl named tempest smith committed suicide after being bullied for her faith
however the rise of this teenage focused new age pop culture wicca has been highly criticized by traditionalists many of whom refuse to accept it as wicca instead using terms like wicca lite
the historians brooks alexander and jeffrey russell commented that pop culture witchcraft is sufficiently vague in structure and content to qualify more as a lifestyle than a religion
the rise of the internet also had an effect on wicca
previously solitary wiccans around the world had little way of communicating amongst one another however the internet allowed them to do so
websites such as witchvox com were set up
historian brooks alexander commented that this was a form of minority empowerment
for a long time wicca was seen as being simply a minor sect or cult
however with the rise of solitary practitioners describing themselves as wiccans the faith went from becoming simply a mystery cult to becoming a public religion
groups were formed to represent the wiccan community such as the covenant of the goddess which was founded in
wiccans began to appear on various british television documentaries including the heaven earth show and desperately seeking something
in the us the court case of dettmer v
landon in established that wicca was a religion and therefore should be treated as such under the eyes of the law
the first wiccan wedding to be legally recognized in the uk by the registrars of scotland was performed in
