history wicca document rise neopagan religion wicca related witchcraft-based neopagan religions
wicca originated early twentieth century developed amongst secretive coven england basing religious belief practice upon read historical witch-cult work writer margaret murray
wa subsequently popularized number figure particular gerald gardner claimed initiated craft wicca often known new forest coven in
gardner's form wicca gardnerian tradition wa spread follower like high priestess doreen valiente patricia crowther eleanor bone part british isle also predominantly english-speaking country across world
new figure arose britain popularized form religion including robert cochrane sybil leek alex sander organization began formed propagate witchcraft research association
wa decade faith wa transported united state wa adapted new tradition feri dianic wicca ensuing decade organization covenant goddess formed
onward book began published figure paul huson scott cunningham stewart janet farrar encouraged self-initiation craft leading boost number adherent development traditions
rising popularity wicca wa used partial basis witchcraft-based american film television show increasing profile particularly amongst younger people s
since early historian published study research history wicca including american aidan kelly briton ronald hutton philip heselton
century widespread moral panic took place across europe american colonies
social political turmoil following period widespread crop failure war disease led numerous men woman accused practicing malevolent witchcraft resulted witch trial early modern period
accused put trial alleged witch worshiped devil committed act diabolism included cannibalism child desecration eucharist
scholar agree witch trial result isolated incident hysteria remote peasant communities
many accused confessed various act magic satanism threat torture historian agree evidence victim trial practicing real magic non-christian religious magical practices
alternative explanation early modern witch trial known witch-cult hypothesis wa proposed german professor karl ernst jarcke in
jarcke's hypothesis claimed victim early modern witch trial innocent caught moral panic member previously unknown pan-european pagan religion pre-dated christianity persecuted christian church rival religion finally driven underground survived secret revealed confession accused witch trials
idea wa later endorsed german historian franz josef mone french historian jules michelet
late century variation hypothesis adopted two american matilda joslyn gage charles leland latter promoted book aradia gospel witches
witch-cult hypothesis' prominent influential advocate wa english egyptologist margaret murray promoted series book notably 's witch-cult western europe 's god witches
murray's book source many well-known motif often incorporated wicca
idea coven member wa developed murray based single witness statement one witch trial wa assertion coven met cross-quarter day four time per year
murray wa interested ascribing naturalistic religious ceremonial explanation fantastic description found witch trial testimony
murray suggested based part work james frazer golden bough witch accused early modern trial fact satanist worshiped pre-christian god associated forest natural world
murray identified god janus dianus following frazer's suggested etymology described horned god wild order explain description horned satan provided witch trial confessions
accused witchcraft often described witch meeting involving sexual orgy satan suggested male priest representing dianus would present coven meeting dressed horn animal skin engaged sexual act gathered women
murray interpreted description sexual intercourse satan cold painful mean priest would often use artificial implement witch became exhausted continue
unlike modern form religious witchcraft murray's conception witch-cult wa therefore strictly patriarchal
hypothesis witch worshiped single god though female figure role known maiden would present coven gathering murray consider represent goddess
way murray's hypothesis based primarily interpretation witch trial record differed strongly leland's belief goddess-centered witch-cult focused diana aradia derived supposed rural italian folk practices
one key aspect murray's witch-cult hypothesis later adopted wicca wa idea historical account witch based truth witch originally involved benevolent fertility related function rather malevolent hexing cursing traditionally portrayed
examining testimony early modern witch trial murray encountered numerous example kind curse nefarious activity accused people confessed to
seeking fit framework description witchcraft natural pagan-religious explanation murray posited malevolent action actually twisted interpretation benevolent action altered either duress trial practitioner year forgotten changed original intent practices
example murray interpreted isobel gowdie's confession cursing farm field setting loose toad pulling miniature plough originally curse field gowdie stated mean ensuring fertility crops
murray stated act misunderstood recorder probably witch themselves
kind interpretation murray created first time idea witch practitioner good magic religious rite ensure fertility people land
ran counter previous idea witchcraft wa history folklore even leland's variant witch-cult hypothesis aradia depicted witch fully benevolent rather revolutionary figure would use cursing black magic exact revenge enemy upper class catholic church
murray combined testimony several witch trial arrive idea witch met four time per year coven meeting sabbaths
also used one piece testimony arrive conclusion coven usually composed witch led male priest would dress animal skin horn fork-toed shoe denote authority dress wa assumed naturalistic explanation accused witch's description satan
grand master according murray represented horned god wa believed fully embody allowing presence sabbath
according murray traditional name coven gathering sabbath wa derived s'esbattre meaning frolic
historian disagree arguing instead organizer witch trial adopted term predominantly associated judaism including sabbath order denigrate witch equivalent jew also highly denigrated mainstream european culture period
fact many witch trial account used sabbath also synagogue reference gathering witches
mainstream folklorists including murray's contemporary take hypothesis seriously
rather accept murray's naturalistic explanation magical feat ritual ascribed witch early modern trial folklorists argued entire scenario wa always fictitious require naturalistic explanation
supposed detail ritual witchcraft practice described trial record simply invented victim torture threat torture based kind diabolic rite clergy time would expected hear about
almost murray's peer regarded witch-cult theory incorrect based poor scholarship
modern scholar note murray wa highly selective evidence pulled trial account favoring detail supported theory ignoring detail clearly naturalistic analogue
murray often contradicted within book citing account one chapter evidence naturalistic explanation using exactly passage argue opposite point next
despite criticism murray wa invited write entry witchcraft edition encyclopdia britannica wa reprinted decade last appearing edition
rather write article reflected historical consensus witch trial murray used opportunity promote hypothesis encyclopdia presenting fact
wa influential according folklorist jacqueline simpson murray's idea became entrenched popular culture probably never uprooted
though late early st century historian critical murray's idea method credit hypothesis least bit underlying truth
emmanuel le roy ladurie example argued murray's argument near nonsense also pointed carlo ginzburg's discovery italian benandanti folk magician practiced anti-witchcraft magic put trial witchcraft evidence least case accusation witch trial organizer based entirely panicked fantasy
ginzburg distanced murray's hypothesis though also argued benandanti continuation pre-christian shamanic tradition assertion ha criticized scholar lacking solid evidence
simpson noted contemporary member folklore society took murray's idea seriously wa gerald gardner used basis wicca
witch-cult theory came represent historical narrative around wicca built early wiccan claiming member murray's hypothesized secret religion
many wiccan particularly early decade believed religion wa continuation witch-cult
wa wiccan began see idea witch-cult creation myth rather historical fact
another hypothesis would major influence wicca development wa idea primitive matriarchal religion derived work swiss lawyer johann jakob bachofen wa popular gardner's day among academic eg erich neumann margaret murray amateur eg
carl jung marija gimbutas continued research area later still joseph campbell ashley montagu others became admirer gimbutas' theory matriarchy ancient europe
matriarchal interpretation archaeological record criticism work continue matter academic debate
academic carry research area world congress matriarchal studies
critic argue matriarchal society never actually existed invention researcher margaret murray
idea supreme mother goddess wa common victorian edwardian literature concept horned god especially related god pan faunus wa le common still significant
idea widely accepted academic literature popular press time
gerald gardner retired english civil servant spent life far east wa member folklore society margaret murray's tenure published witchcraft today made claim encountered surviving member murray's hypothesized early modern witch-cult
gardner claimed initiated practising coven cult september group ha become known new forest coven
gardner claimed group met new forest southern england met member initially rosicrucian order crotona fellowship
mentioned two member local worthy called old dorothy whose house claimed initiated dafo became friend would remain many years
doreen valiente undertook research identity old dorothy whose surname wa clutterbuck
recently ha doubted notably ronald hutton whether historical dorothy clutterbuck wa outwardly observant christian pillar local community really wa involved occult activities
hutton's view gardner may used name joke andor subterfuge conceal identity dafo individual
dafo seems teacher music elocution name edith woodford-grimes persistent suggestion gardner lovers
isaac bonewits argued valiente heselton's evidence point early -century revival predating gardner new forest coven perhaps rather intact old pagan religion
argument point historical claim gardner's agree scholarship certain time period contradict later scholarship
bonewits writes somewhere england folklorists appear gotten together golden dawn rosicrucian supposed fam-trads produce first modern coven england grabbing eclectically source could find order try reconstruct shard pagan past
ha proposed originally druidic journal aisling gardner's new forest coven wa pagan section order woodcraft chivalry order performed ritual new forest early pagan section honoured moon goddess horned god believed ritual nakedness
one ronald hutton's informant report gardner wa familiar order least s
major difficulty identifying group new forest coven doe appear met new forest and
gardner record working coven new forest projected nazi invasion
theory advanced bill liddell new forest coven derived set coven created nineteenth century cunning man george pickingill lived essex village canewdon
claim widely accepted although doe focus attention well documented widespread cunning folk contribution history british witchcraft
gardner claiming fearful witch religion would die began propagate forming bricket wood coven hertfordshire circa
dafo also claimed member new forest coven acted high priestess
however woodford-grimes became concerned gardner's attempt gain publicity would lead public backlash left bricket wood coven in
gardner initiated young woman named doreen valiente coven soon went become new high priestess
around time gardner composed coven's book shadow workbook ritual although claimed wa ancient origins
gardner's early conception religious witchcraft closely paralleled system outlined margaret murray including patriarchal structure focused almost exclusively worship murray's horned god
however influence valiente emphasis soon shifted emphasize role goddess bringing gardner's witchcraft line pre-murray source like charles leland's aradia
gardner wa also reportedly upset valiente recognized significant portion ritual adapted little change developed aleister crowley's tradition thelema
gardner asserted simply used crowley's ritual fill rather bare bone ritual given new forest coven
nonetheless valiente helped gardner rewrite book shadow removing much saw crowleyanity adding section charge goddess adapted aradia poetic verse
valiente gardner later falling became frustrated repeated attempt gain publicity coven tried impose so-called wiccan law something claimed used witch-cult valiente believed simply made up
left along several member bricket wood coven found own
bricket wood coven continued member included jack bracelin dayonis frederic lamond lois bourne
gardner also propagated witchcraft tradition came referred gardnerian witchcraft outside bricket wood coven

also published second non-fiction book subject meaning witchcraft well running museum magic witchcraft isle man death in
gardner referred member tradition wica although called religion witchcraft never used term wicca sense known
ritual format wicca show influence late victorian era occultism even co-founder doreen valiente admitted seeing influence aleister crowley little ritual cannot shown come earlier extant sources
religion's spiritual content however inspired older pagan faith example veneration historical pagan deity buddhist hindu influence eg
king gardner created religion claimed discovered rewriting ritual older witchcraft tradition according whim incorporating element thesis dr
margaret murray source aradia gospel witch charles godfrey leland practice ceremonial magic
original material ritual brought light gardner cohesive mostly take form substitution expansion within unoriginal material
roger dearnaley annotated chronology bibliography early gardnerian craft describes patchwork
one element apparently distinctive use ritual scourging binding method attaining ecstatic trance magical working
hutton argues strongly practice wicca doe reflect sado-masochistic sexuality refers connection gardner's collection mild quasi-pornographic material showed trace interest simply practical method work alternative drug strenuous methods
heselton writing wiccan root later gerald gardner cauldron inspiration argues gardner wa author wiccan ritual received good faith unknown source
doreen valiente make claim regarding basic skeleton ritual margot adler put drawing moon note crowley material found wiccan ritual found single book equinox vol no
gardner known owned access copy book although met crowley towards end latter's life
gardner admitted ritual received old dorothy's coven fragmentary order make workable supplement material
gardner wa person claiming member surviving remnant witch-cult several others also emerged making claim
included sybil leek charles cardell raymond howard rolla nordic robert cochrane

sander justified claiming version wicca christianity force good battling force darkness practised satanist black magicians
several gardnerians including patricia crowther ray bone tried denounce sander charlatan simply responded accusing charlatan practitioner black magic abused initiates
one key reason separation wa neither would compromise alex's bisexuality

following year raymond buckland brought gardnerian craft usa originally ceased practice formed new tradition known seax-wica
seax used structure traditional gardnerian coven used iconography anglo-saxon paganism god goddess represented traditional horned god mother goddess woden freya
seax wa virtually unique amongst wicca time work initiatory basis coven buckland deliberately published rite ritual book tree anyone could practice them
hungarian-american named zsuzsanna budapest connection gardnerian alexandrian coven mixed wiccan practice feminist politics forming dianic witchcraft although better known dianic wicca
dianic wicca focused almost exclusively upon goddess largely coven completely ignoring horned god
like seax-wica developed around time ritual dianic wicca published creator woman could practice without need specific initiation lineage
