Thomas William Brown (born December 12, 1940) is a former professional football player and major league baseball player.
Brown briefly played for the Washington Senators of the American League early in the 1963 season, and then was a defensive back in the National Football League for six seasons with the Green Bay Packers and Washington Redskins
 He played college football at the University of Maryland in College Park, where he also played for the baseball team.
Born in Laureldale, Pennsylvania, Brown graduated from Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, a suburb north of Washington, D.C
 He then went to the University of Maryland in nearby College Park and played both baseball and football for the Terrapins.
Brown played outfield and first base for the Washington Senators in 1963
A switch hitter who threw left-handed, he was signed to a minor league contract in late February, played extremely well in spring training, batting .312, and earned a spot on the major league team
In the regular season, Brown batted a meek .147 in 61 games (23 as a starter), with 17 hits in 116 at bats, one home run, and four runs batted in
Sent down to the minors, he played parts of two seasons (1963–1964) in the Senators' farm system with the York White Roses of the Class AA Eastern League; in 470 at bats, he batted .223 with eight home runs and 47 RBI

Brown was selected in the second round (28th overall) of the 1963 NFL draft by the Packers, and twentieth overall in the AFL draft by the Buffalo Bills
After his stint in baseball with the Senators, he played defensive back for Green Bay from 1964 through 1968 and for the Washington Redskins in 1969.

Brown finished his NFL career with 13 interceptions and six fumble recoveries, including one for a touchdown, and also returned 27 punts and 7 kickoffs
His head coach for five seasons was Lombardi, four in Green Bay and one in Washington; the exception was in 1968, after Lombardi stepped down and was succeeded by Phil Bengtson
