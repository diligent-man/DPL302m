feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause and effect that forms a circuit or loop
the system can then be said to feed back into itself
the notion of cause and effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems
self regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity and the idea of feedback had started to enter economic theory in britain by the th century but it was not at that time recognized as a universal abstraction and so did not have a name
the first ever known artificial feedback device was a float valve for maintaining water at a constant level invented in bc in alexandria egypt
this device illustrated the principle of feedback a low water level opens the valve the rising water then provides feedback into the system closing the valve when the required level is reached
this then reoccurs in a circular fashion as the water level fluctuates
centrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the th century
in james watt designed his first centrifugal governor following a suggestion from his business partner matthew boulton for use in the steam engines of their production
early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion and were used for pumping water an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed but the use of steam engines for other applications called for more precise control of the speed
in james clerk maxwell wrote a famous paper on governors that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory
this was a landmark paper on control theory and the mathematics of feedback
the verb phrase to feed back in the sense of returning to an earlier position in a mechanical process was in use in the us by the s and in nobel laureate karl ferdinand braun used the term feed back as a noun to refer to undesired coupling between components of an electronic circuit
by the end of researchers using early electronic amplifiers audions had discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit would boost the amplification through regeneration but would also cause the audion to howl or sing
this action of feeding back of the signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term feedback as a distinct word by
the development of cybernetics from the s onwards was centred around the study of circular causal feedback mechanisms
over the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of feedback
according to cybernetician ashby mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of circularity of action which keeps the theory simple and consistent
for those with more practical aims feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection
focusing on uses in management theory ramaprasad defines feedback generally as information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter that is used to alter the gap in some way
he emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless translated into action
positive feedback if the signal feedback from output is in phase with the input signal the feedback is called positive feedback
negative feedback if the signal feedback is of opposite polarity or out of phase by with respect to input signal the feedback is called negative feedback
as an example of negative feedback the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car for example that matches a target speed such as the speed limit
the controlled system is the car its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road the disturbance
the car s speed status is measured by a speedometer
the error signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed set point
this measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator commanding the fuel flow to the engine the effector
the resulting change in engine torque the feedback combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed minimizing the road disturbance
the terms positive and negative were first applied to feedback prior to wwii
the idea of positive feedback was already current in the s with the introduction of the regenerative circuit
friis and jensen described regeneration in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where the feed back action is positive in contrast to negative feed back action which they mention only in passing
harold stephen black s classic paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers
according to black
according to mindell confusion in the terms arose shortly after this
even prior to the terms being applied james clerk maxwell had described several kinds of component motions associated with the centrifugal governors used in steam engines distinguishing between those that lead to a continual increase in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation and those that lead to a decrease of the same
the terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines
the altering of the gap between reference and actual values of a parameter based on whether the gap is widening positive or narrowing negative
the valence of the action or effect that alters the gap based on whether it has a happy positive or unhappy negative emotional connotation to the recipient or observer the two definitions may cause confusion such as when an incentive reward is used to boost poor performance narrow a gap
referring to definition some authors use alternative terms replacing positive negative with self reinforcing self correcting reinforcing balancing discrepancy enhancing discrepancy reducing or regenerative degenerative respectively
and for definition some authors advocate describing the action or effect as positive negative reinforcement or punishment rather than feedback
yet even within a single discipline an example of feedback can be called either positive or negative depending on how values are measured or referenced
this confusion may arise because feedback can be used for either informational or motivational purposes and often has both a qualitative and a quantitative component
as connellan and zemke put it
while simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type many systems with feedback loops cannot be so easily designated as simply positive or negative and this is especially true when multiple loops are present
in general feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system
the term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact the output of one affecting the input of another and vice versa
some systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as chaotic behaviors in non linear systems while others have much more predictable behaviors such as those that are used to make and design digital systems
feedback is used extensively in digital systems
for example binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it
by using feedback properties the behavior of a system can be altered to meet the needs of an application systems can be made stable responsive or held constant
it is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the edge of chaos
in biological systems such as organisms ecosystems or the biosphere most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions
the deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments
a change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function
the value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel
an example of this is insulin oscillations
biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits both positive and negative
as in other contexts positive and negative do not imply that the feedback causes good or bad effects
a negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it
the mirror neurons are part of a social feedback system when an observed action is mirrored by the brain like a self performed action
normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function
in an injured or infected tissue inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells which alter gene expression and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function
this type of feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and recovery from infections and injuries
during cancer key elements of this feedback fail
this disrupts tissue function and immunity
mechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria where a nutrient elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions
feedback is also central to the operations of genes and gene regulatory networks
repressor see lac repressor and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons which were identified by fran ois jacob and jacques monod in as feedback loops
these feedback loops may be positive as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell or negative as is often the case in metabolic consumption
on a larger scale feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes although time lags in feedback response can give rise to predator prey cycles
in zymology feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product s or downstream metabolite s in the metabolic pathway see allosteric regulation
the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is largely controlled by positive and negative feedback much of which is still unknown
in psychology the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of hormones
release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released causing a positive feedback loop
this cycle is also found in certain behaviour
for example shame loops occur in people who blush easily
when they realize that they are blushing they become even more embarrassed which leads to further blushing and so on
the climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere ocean and land
a simple example is the ice albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground of lower albedo which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt
feedback is extensively used in control theory using a variety of methods including state space controls full state feedback and so forth
in the context of control theory feedback is traditionally assumed to specify negative feedback
the most common general purpose controller using a control loop feedback mechanism is a proportional integral derivative pid controller
heuristically the terms of a pid controller can be interpreted as corresponding to time the proportional term depends on the present error the integral term on the accumulation of past errors and the derivative term is a prediction of future error based on current rate of change

in ancient times the float valve was used to regulate the flow of water in greek and roman water clocks similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a carburettor and also used to regulate tank water level in the flush toilet
the dutch inventor cornelius drebbel built thermostats c to control the temperature of chicken incubators and chemical furnaces
in the windmill was improved by blacksmith edmund lee who added a fantail to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind
in tom mead regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a centrifugal pendulum to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone i e to adjust the load
the use of the centrifugal governor by james watt in to regulate the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the industrial revolution
steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices
a mathematical analysis of watt s governor was done by james clerk maxwell in
the great eastern was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in by john mcfarlane gray
joseph farcot coined the word servo in to describe steam powered steering systems
hydraulic servos were later used to position guns
elmer ambrose sperry of the sperry corporation designed the first autopilot in
nicolas minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in and described the pid controller
internal combustion engines of the late th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the vacuum timing advance but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic engine management systems once small robust and powerful single chip microcontrollers became affordable
the use of feedback is widespread in the design of electronic components such as amplifiers oscillators and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip flops and counters
electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to control mechanical thermal and other physical processes
if the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop the system is said to have negative feedback otherwise the feedback is said to be positive
negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes
this scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it
when this happens the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in over correction causing the output to oscillate or hunt
while often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators
harry nyquist at bell labs derived the nyquist stability criterion for determining the stability of feedback systems
an easier method but less general is to use bode plots developed by hendrik bode to determine the gain margin and phase margin
design to ensure stability often involves frequency compensation to control the location of the poles of the amplifier
electronic feedback loops are used to control the output of electronic devices such as amplifiers
a feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input
a device is said to be operating open loop if no output feedback is being employed and closed loop if feedback is being used
when two or more amplifiers are cross coupled using positive feedback complex behaviors can be created
these multivibrators are widely used and include
astable circuits which act as oscillators
monostable circuits which can be pushed into a state and will return to the stable state after some time
bistable circuits which have two stable states that the circuit can be switched betweennegative feedback occurs when the fed back output signal has a relative phase of with respect to the input signal upside down
this situation is sometimes referred to as being out of phase but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations as in out of phase
negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations
in feedback amplifiers this correction is generally for waveform distortion reduction or to establish a specified gain level
a general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the asymptotic gain model
positive feedback occurs when the fed back signal is in phase with the input signal
under certain gain conditions positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states
positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit
this can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones
it is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal
under some circumstances positive feedback may cause a device to latch i e to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state
this fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information
the loud squeals that sometimes occurs in audio systems pa systems and rock music are known as audio feedback
if a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker that it is connected to sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the speaker and is picked up by the microphone and re amplified
if the loop gain is sufficient howling or squealing at the maximum power of the amplifier is possible
an electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic oscillating electronic signal often a sine wave or a square wave
oscillators convert direct current dc from a power supply to an alternating current signal
they are widely used in many electronic devices
common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games
oscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal
a low frequency oscillator lfo is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below hz
this term is typically used in the field of audio synthesizers to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator
an audio oscillator produces frequencies in the audio range about hz to khz
an rf oscillator produces signals in the radio frequency rf range of about khz to ghz oscillators designed to produce a high power ac output from a dc supply are usually called inverters
there are two main types of electronic oscillator the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation oscillator
a latch or a flip flop is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information
they typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit to provide the circuit with a state
the circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs
it is the basic storage element in sequential logic
latches and flip flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers communications and many other types of systems
latches and flip flops are used as data storage elements
such data storage can be used for storage of state and such a circuit is described as sequential logic
when used in a finite state machine the output and next state depend not only on its current input but also on its current state and hence previous inputs
it can also be used for counting of pulses and for synchronizing variably timed input signals to some reference timing signal
flip flops can be either simple transparent or opaque or clocked synchronous or edge triggered
although the term flip flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits in modern usage it is common to reserve the term flip flop exclusively for discussing clocked circuits the simple ones are commonly called latches
using this terminology a latch is level sensitive whereas a flip flop is edge sensitive
that is when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent while a flip flop s output only changes on a single type positive going or negative going of clock edge
feedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running maintenance and evolution of software and computing systems
feedback loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the adaptation process to guarantee system properties at run time
feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems
in particular they have been applied to the development of products such as ibm db and ibm tivoli
from a software perspective the autonomic mape monitor analyze plan execute loop proposed by researchers of ibm is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems
feedback is also a useful design principle for designing user interfaces
video feedback is the video equivalent of acoustic feedback
it involves a loop between a video camera input and a video output e g a television screen or monitor
aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based on the feedback
