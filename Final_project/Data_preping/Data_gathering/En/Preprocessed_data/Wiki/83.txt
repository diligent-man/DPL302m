The Golden Raspberry Awards (also known as the Razzies and Razzie Awards) is a parody award show honoring the worst of cinematic under-achievements
Co-founded by UCLA film graduates and film industry veterans John J
B
Wilson and Mo Murphy, the Razzie Awards' satirical annual ceremony has preceded its opposite, the Academy Awards, for four decades
The term raspberry is used in its irreverent sense, as in "blowing a raspberry"
The statuette itself is a golf ball-sized raspberry atop a Super 8mm film reel spray-painted gold, with an estimated street value of $4.97
The Golden Raspberry Foundation has claimed that the award "encourages well-known filmmakers and top notch performers to own their bad."
The first Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony was held on March 31, 1981, in John J
B
Wilson's living-room alcove in Hollywood, to honor the perceived worst films of the 1980 film season
To date, Sylvester Stallone is the most awarded actor ever with 10 awards won while Madonna is the most awarded actress with nine awards.

Wilson had been seeing a 99-cent double feature of Can't Stop the Music and Xanadu and thought in his drive home that those movies deserved awards for their low quality, and subsequently started thinking of all the other films that disappointed him in 1980, particularly as he had watched hundreds of productions in his job making trailers
 So, the following year, in the potluck parties he usually held at his home in Hollywood on the night of the Academy Awards,  after the 53rd Academy Awards had completed for the evening, Wilson passed ballots regarding the worst in film to the attendees, and invited his friends to give random award presentations in his living room
Wilson stood at a podium made of cardboard in a tacky tuxedo, with a foam ball attached to a broomstick as a fake microphone, and announced Can't Stop the Music as the first Golden Raspberry Award Winner for Worst Picture
The impromptu ceremony was a success and the following week a press release about his event was picked up by a few local newspapers, including a mention in the Los Angeles Daily News with the headline: "Take These Envelopes, Please".
Approximately three dozen people came to the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards
The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the attendance, and the 3rd awards ceremony had doubled that number
By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event
Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: "We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press from all over the world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on," he said to BBC News.
In 2022, a dedicated award category, Worst Bruce Willis Performance in a 2021 Movie, was created after Bruce Willis starred in a number of poorly received low-budget films
On March 30, of that year, Willis's family announced that he had been diagnosed with aphasia, a disorder that damages the area of the brain that controls language expression and comprehension
The Golden Raspberry Awards subsequently retracted the award category, saying it was inappropriate to award a Golden Raspberry to someone whose performance was affected by a medical condition
At the same time, the Awards retroactively retracted their 1980 Worst Actress nomination of Shelley Duvall in The Shining, stating "We have since discovered that Duvall's performance was impacted by Stanley Kubrick's treatment of her throughout the production".
Members of the Golden Raspberry Award Organization pay for membership, and number 650 from 19 countries
After three editions held during Wilson's potluck Oscar parties, Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage, and the fourth edition happened at Los Angeles' Third Street Elementary School
 The ceremonies have kept this scheduling with both nominations and awards revealed in the day before the Academy Awards, with only two exceptions ever since, that only used the day before the Oscars to reveal the nominees: 2012's 32nd Golden Raspberry Awards, where the ceremony happened on April 1 for being April Fool's Day; and 2020, where the plans for the milestone 40th Golden Raspberry Awards was a bigger, televised ceremony in March, which wound up cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and just had the winners revealed online.
Paul Verhoeven was the first person to go to the ceremony to receive his awards for the movie Showgirls
Other recipients who have accepted their Golden Raspberry Award include Tom Green (Worst Actor/Worst Director), Halle Berry and Sandra Bullock (Worst Actress), Michael Ferris and J
D
Shapiro (Worst Screenplay), eight-time Oscar winner Alan Menken, Dinesh D'Souza, Fifty Shades of Grey producers Dana Brunetti and Michael De Luca.
Several people have received Razzie nominations while simultaneously receiving award nominations from other organizations, sometimes for the same work or role.
Three people won both a Razzie and an Oscar the same weekend: composer Alan Menken in 1993, screenwriter Brian Helgeland in 1997, and actress Sandra Bullock in 2010, though all three won for different films (for example, Helgeland won a Razzie for The Postman and an Oscar for L.A
Confidential)

Joker (2019) was the most nominated film at the 92nd Academy Awards, with 11 nominations including the Best Picture, and won two including the Best Actor
However, the film's polarized critical reception resulted in it earning a nomination in the special Razzie category of Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property, which it lost to Rambo: Last Blood
This nomination also made Joker the second film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a Razzie, after 1990's The Godfather Part III.

B
Wilson to an individual whose achievements are not covered by the Razzies' other categories
It was awarded in 2003 to Travis Payne for "Distinguished Under-Achievement in Choreography" in the film From Justin to Kelly.
This award is given to a critical and financial failure that would have been nominated if it had received an eligible release
It was awarded in 2015 to United Passions, to Misconduct in 2016, in 2017 to CHiPs and in 2018 to Billionaire Boys Club.
The Razzies have received criticism, including from news sources such as Indiewire  and The Daily Telegraph, for several issues, including that members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation are not required to watch the nominated films, it follows different set of rules which is different from the invitation-only Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
Critics take issue with the Razzies picking "easy targets" and critically panned mainstream films instead of those perceived as less popular but more deserving productions, continuing to appeal to celebrities, seemingly for publicity and attention, over other, worthier films and performances.
Sam Adams of Indiewire has said the Razzies are "like hecklers hurling insults at comedians or a concertgoer yelling out 'Whoo!' during a quiet song, they're not-so-secretly crying out to be noticed
The Razzies, properly enough, avoid pouncing on the little guy; they don't trash no-budget indies no one has seen for having bad lighting or terrible sound"
Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph has said, "the Razzies' ongoing failure to train its sights on anything but the most obvious targets means it grows more tired and redundant by the year"
CraveOnline's William Bibbiani stated that the Razzies follow "a cheap shot of pranksterism", and "with only a handful of exceptions, only seen fit to nominate the most infamous movies of the year, and not necessarily the worst." In 2018, Scott Meslow, writing for GQ, accused the Razzies of being "pretty lazy, very sexist, and a little racist" in their choices, reiterating criticism that voters were overreliant on films already widely perceived as notorious, and further asserting they disproportionally nominated films directed by and starring Tyler Perry and films marketed towards women.
