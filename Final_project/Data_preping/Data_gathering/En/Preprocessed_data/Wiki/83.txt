The Razzies have received criticism including from news sources such as Indiewire and The Daily Telegraph for several issues including that members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation are not required to watch the nominated films it follows different set of rules which is different from the invitation-only Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
Critics take issue with the Razzies picking easy targets and critically panned mainstream films instead of those perceived as less popular but more deserving productions continuing to appeal to celebrities seemingly for publicity and attention over other worthier films and performances
Sam Adams of Indiewire has said the Razzies are like hecklers hurling insults at comedians or a concertgoer yelling out 'Whoo' during a quiet song they're not-so-secretly crying out to be noticed
The Razzies properly enough avoid pouncing on the little guy they don't trash no-budget indies no one has seen for having bad lighting or terrible sound
Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph has said the Razzies' ongoing failure to train its sights on anything but the most obvious targets means it grows more tired and redundant by the year
CraveOnline's William Bibbiani stated that the Razzies follow a cheap shot of pranksterism and with only a handful of exceptions only seen fit to nominate the most infamous movies of the year and not necessarily the worst In Scott Meslow writing for GQ accused the Razzies of being pretty lazy very sexist and a little racist in their choices reiterating criticism that voters were overreliant on films already widely perceived as notorious and further asserting they disproportionally nominated films directed by and starring Tyler Perry and films marketed towards women
