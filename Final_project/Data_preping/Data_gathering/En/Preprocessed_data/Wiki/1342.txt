Checkered Flag is the third studio album of surf music by surf music pioneer Dick Dale and his Del-Tones, released in 1963
This is Dale's first entry into the "Hot Rod" style of surf music, which The Beach Boys, among others, were beginning to perform and record
Here the style shifts somewhat and features slightly altered beats and some added sounds to give the impression of the energy of Hot-rodding (this is not always the case though)
The majority of the songs on this album are titled with themes of racing and Hot-rodding
Dale's next album Mr
Eliminator is basically a follow-up to this, featuring more surf songs of Hot-Rod nature.
