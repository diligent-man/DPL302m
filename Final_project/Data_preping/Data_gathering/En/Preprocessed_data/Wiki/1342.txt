Checkered Flag is the third studio album of surf music by surf music pioneer Dick Dale and his Del Tones released in This is Dale's first entry into the Hot Rod style of surf music which The Beach Boys among others were beginning to perform and record Here the style shifts somewhat and features slightly altered beats and some added sounds to give the impression of the energy of Hot rodding this is not always the case though The majority of the songs on this album are titled with themes of racing and Hot rodding Dale's next album Mr Eliminator is basically a follow up to this featuring more surf songs of Hot Rod nature
