zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance an inquiry into values is a book by robert m
pirsig first published in
it is a work of fictionalized autobiography and is the first of pirsig s texts in which he explores his concept of quality
the title is an apparent play on the title of the book zen in the art of archery by eugen herrigel
in its introduction pirsig explains that despite its title it should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox zen buddhist practice
it s not very factual on motorcycles either
pirsig received rejections before an editor finally accepted the book for publication and he did so thinking it would never generate a profit
it was subsequently featured on best seller lists for decades with initial sales of at least million copies worldwide
the book is a fictionalized autobiography of a day journey that pirsig made on a motorcycle from minnesota to northern california along with his son chris in
the story of this journey is recounted in a first person narrative although the author is not identified
father and son are also accompanied for the first nine days of the trip by close friends john and sylvia sutherland with whom they part ways in montana
the trip is punctuated by numerous philosophical discussions referred to as chautauquas by the author on topics including epistemology the history of philosophy and the philosophy of science
many of these discussions are tied together by the story of the narrator s own past self who is referred to in the third person as phaedrus after plato s dialogue
phaedrus a teacher of creative and technical writing at montana state college became engrossed in the question of what defines good writing and what in general defines good or quality which he understands similar to tao
phaedrus s philosophical investigations eventually drove him insane and he was subjected to electroconvulsive therapy which permanently changed his personality
towards the end of the book phaedrus s strong and unorthodox personality presented as dangerous to the narrator begins to re emerge and the narrator is reconciled with his past
in a interview with national public radio pirsig stated that the book took him four years to write
during two of these years pirsig continued working at his job of writing computer manuals
this caused him to fall into an unorthodox schedule waking up very early and writing zen from a m
until a m then eating and going to his day job
he would sleep during his lunch break and then go to bed around in the evening
pirsig joked that his co workers noticed that he was a lot less perky than everyone else
in the book the narrator describes the romantic approach to life of his friend john sutherland who chooses not to learn how to maintain his expensive new motorcycle
john simply hopes for the best with his bike and when problems do occur he often becomes frustrated and is forced to rely on professional mechanics to repair it
in contrast the classical narrator has an older motorcycle which he is usually able to diagnose and repair himself through the use of rational problem solving skills
in an example of the classical approach the narrator explains that one must pay continual attention when the narrator and his friends come into miles city montana he notices the engine running roughly a possible indication that the fuel air mixture is too rich
the next day he is thinking of this as he is going through his ritual to adjust the jets on his motorcycle s carburetor
during the adjustment he notes that both spark plugs are black confirming a rich mixture
he recognizes that the higher elevation is causing the engine to run rich
the narrator rectifies this by installing new jets and adjusting the valves and the engine runs well again
with this the book details two types of personalities those who are interested mostly in gestalt romantic viewpoints focused on being in the moment and not on rational analysis and those who seek to know details understand inner workings and master mechanics viewpoints with application of rational analysis vis a vis motorcycle maintenance
the sutherlands represent an exclusively romantic attitude toward the world
the narrator initially appears to prefer the classic approach
it later becomes apparent that he understands both viewpoints and is aiming for the middle ground
he understands that technology and the dehumanized world it carries with it appears ugly and repulsive to a romantic person
he knows that such persons are determined to shoehorn all of life s experience into the romantic view
pirsig is capable of seeing the beauty of technology and feels good about mechanical work where the goal is to achieve an inner peace of mind
the book demonstrates that motorcycle maintenance may be dull and tedious drudgery or an enjoyable and pleasurable pastime depending on attitude
the narrator examines the modern pursuit of pure truths claiming it derives from the work of early greek philosophers who were establishing the concept of truth in opposition to the force of the good
he argues that although rational thought may find a truth or the truth it may never be fully and universally applicable to every individual s experience
therefore what is needed is an approach to life that is more inclusive and has a wider range of application
he makes a case that originally the greeks did not distinguish between quality and truth they were one and the same arete and that the divorce was in fact artificial though needed at the time and is now a source of much frustration and unhappiness in the world particularly overall dissatisfaction with modern life
the narrator aims towards a perception of the world that embraces both sides the rational and the romantic
this means encompassing irrational sources of wisdom and understanding as well as science reason and technology
in particular this must include bursts of creativity and intuition that seemingly come from nowhere and are not in his view rationally explicable
he seeks to demonstrate that rationality and zen like being in the moment can harmoniously coexist
he suggests such a combination of rationality and romanticism can potentially bring a higher quality of life
it has been noted that pirsig s romantic classical dichotomy resembles nietzsche s dionysian apollonian dichotomy as described in the birth of tragedy
for example in his book the person of the therapist edward smith writes in his popular novel
pirsig also addressed the apollonian and dionysian worldviews naming them respectively classical understanding and romantic understanding
beverly gross writes that pirsig is seeking a synthesis of the normal everyday functioning self with the person given to extremes excesses dizzying heights obsessions our crazy self with our sane self the greatness in us with our ordinariness
the exceptional in the narrator is represented by phaedrus who despite the narrator s attempt to keep him in the past pushes to the foreground of his mind toward the book s end threatening the narrator s stability and relationship with his son
however the narrator s difficulties with his son during the journey also question whether giving up parts of himself in exchange for sanity has even helped this relationship
gross writes he relates to mechanical things not to people
there is beauty in his recognition that personality inheres in motorcycles riding gloves there is sadness and sickness in his removal from the personality of people his own most notably
the chautauquas which emphasize the narrator s tendency toward solitary thought and over analysis may reflect his avoidance of the problems before him his relationships and the resurrection of phaedrus
to the extent that the narrator denies phaedrus the chautauquas are practical but when he decides that he will admit himself to hospital again he realizes the undeniable presence of phaedrus in him and the chautauquas are given over to those more abstruse topics
according to the author a gumption trap is an event or mindset that can cause a person to lose enthusiasm and become discouraged from starting or continuing a project
the word gumption denotes a combination of common sense shrewdness and a sense of initiative
although the last of these traits is the primary victim of the gumption trap the first two suffer indirectly in that a reduction in initiative results in a reduction in constructive activity and therefore inhibits one s development of the first two traits
pirsig goes on to inform his readers that the trap portion of the term refers to the positive feedback loop that the event or mindset creates the reduction in the person s enthusiasm and initiative decreases both the person s likelihood of success in that project and the degree of success likely thus doubly affecting the expected outcome of the person s efforts
the usual result further discourages the person whether it be a mere lack of success or a bigger outright failure complete with embarrassment and loss of the resources initially invested
the specific term gumption trap was coined by pirsig and the associated concept plays an important part in the practical application of his metaphysics of quality
pirsig refers to two types of gumption traps setbacks which arise from external exogenous events and hang ups which are the product of internal endogenous factors such as a poor fit between one s psychological state and the requirements of a project
the nature of setbacks can vary considerably
for example a minor setback might result from a minor injury
larger setbacks include the lack of knowledge that a certain procedural step or other condition is necessary for a project s success if one attempts to keep working despite the lack of knowledge that this obstacle exists let alone how to deal with it one s lack of progress may prompt one to take long breaks from the project to focus one s attention on other endeavors or even to lose interest in the project altogether
pirsig suggests preventing these kinds of gumption traps by being slow and meticulous taking notes that might help later and troubleshooting in advance e g by laying out the requirements for one s project in logical and or conceptual order and looking for procedural problems ranging from unaccounted for prerequisites to gaps in one s instructions or plans
hang ups stem from internal factors that can get in the way of starting or completing a project
examples of such hang ups include anxiety boredom impatience and the failure often borne of excessive egotism to realize that a one might not have all the information necessary to succeed and or b certain aspects of the problem might be more or less important than one believes
dealing with hang ups can be as simple as reducing hyperfocus on a specific aspect of a problem by taking a short break from working on the problem or that specific aspect of it
pirsig notes several aspects of hang ups
affective i e
receptive or dynamic understanding or value traps these can be described generally as an inability or reluctance to re evaluate notions due to a commitment to previous values
on the whole these types of issues can be addressed by rediscovering facts as they arise recognizing that the facts are available and apparent deliberately slowing down to allow unstructured processing of information and reassessing the weight attached to the current knowledge egotism may encourage one to believe misleading information or disbelieve a potentially inconvenient fact
appropriate recourses include humility modesty attentiveness and skepticism
anxiety may preclude the confidence necessary to begin a project or the self assurance needed to patiently work through a project systematically
appropriate recourses include research study and preparation prior to beginning the project detailing the anticipated steps required to accomplish the task and understanding the personhood and fallibility of professionals
boredom may cause sloppy work and inattention to detail
appropriate recourses include taking a break to allow interest in the project to rebuild or ritualizing common practices
pirsig notes that at the first sign of boredom it is important to stop work immediately
impatience like boredom may cause sloppy work and inattention to detail
appropriate recourses include allowing indefinite time for the project and value flexibility to rediscover aspects of the project cognitive understanding or truth traps these can be described as misunderstanding the feedback of a given action reliance on yes no duality may cause misinterpretation of results
pirsig notes the concept of mu and suggests the answer to a particular question may indicate that the question does not match the situation
an appropriate recourse may be to reconsider the context of the inquiry psychomotor behavior or muscle traps these surround the interaction of the environment machinist and machine inadequate tools may lead to a feeling of frustration
appropriate recourses include proper equipment acquisition
environmental factors may lead to frustration including inadequate lighting temperature extremes and physically uncomfortable positions
muscular insensitivity or lack of proprioception may lead to a disproportionate amount of force being applied to a material that leads to frustration
misunderstanding of different tolerances of various materials may lead to broken parts or inadequate tension at the time of its publication christopher lehmann haupt in his book review for the new york times wrote
i now regret that i lack the expertise in philosophy to put mr
pirsig s ideas to a proper test for this book may very well be a profoundly important one a great one even full of insights into our most perplexing contemporary dilemmas
i just don t know
but whatever its true philosophical worth it is intellectual entertainment of the highest order since then zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance has become the best selling philosophy book of all time
