among modern political theorist three contending conception democracy aggregative democracy deliberative democracy radical democracy
theory aggregative democracy claim aim democratic process solicit citizens' preference aggregate together determine social policy society adopt
therefore proponent view hold democratic participation primarily focus voting policy vote get implemented
minimalism democracy system government citizen given team political leader right rule periodic elections
according minimalist conception citizen cannot rule example issue time clear view view well-founded
joseph schumpeter articulated view famously book capitalism socialism democracy
according theory direct democracy hand citizen vote directly representative legislative proposals
proponent direct democracy offer varied reason support view
political activity valuable socialises educates citizen popular participation check powerful elites
importantly citizen rule unless directly decide law policies
government tend produce law policy close view median voterwith half left half right
desirable outcome represents action self-interested somewhat unaccountable political elite competing votes
anthony suggests ideological political party necessary act mediating broker individual governments
dahl argues fundamental democratic principle come binding collective decision person political community entitled hisher interest given equal consideration necessarily people equally satisfied collective decision
us term polyarchy refer society exists certain set institution procedure perceived leading democracy
first foremost among institution regular occurrence free open election used select representative manage public policy society
however polyarchic procedure may create full democracy example poverty prevents political participation
similarly ronald dworkin argues democracy substantive merely procedural ideal
unlike aggregative democracy deliberative democracy hold democratic decision legitimate must preceded authentic deliberation merely aggregation preference occurs voting
authentic deliberation deliberation among decision-makers free distortion unequal political power power decision-maker obtained economic wealth support interest groups
decision-makers cannot reach consensus authentically deliberating proposal vote proposal using form majority rule

given constraint acquiring reliable data within-country variation aspect democracy academic largely studied cross-country variations
yet variation democratic institution large across country constrains meaningful comparison using statistical approaches
since democracy typically measured aggregately macro variable using single observation country year studying democracy face range econometric constraint limited basic correlations
cross-country comparison composite comprehensive qualitative concept like democracy may thus always many purpose methodologically rigorous useful
dieter fuchs edeltraud roller suggest order truly measure quality democracy objective measurement need complemented subjective measurement based perspective citizens
similarly quinton mayne brigitte geiel also defend quality democracy doe depend exclusively performance institution also citizens' disposition commitment
variety democracy provide better representation freedom citizen others
however democracy structured prohibit government excluding people legislative process branch government altering separation power favour branch system accumulate much power destroy democracy
following kind democracy exclusive one another many specify detail aspect independent one another co-exist single system
several variant democracy exist two basic form concern whole body eligible citizen executes will
one form democracy direct democracy eligible citizen active participation political decision making example voting policy initiative directly
modern democracy whole body eligible citizen remain sovereign power political power exercised indirectly elected representative called representative democracy
direct democracy political system citizen participate decision-making personally contrary relying intermediary representatives

representative democracy also incorporate element direct democracy referendums
characteristic representative democracy representative elected people act people's interest retain freedom exercise judgement best so
reason driven criticism upon representative democracy pointing contradiction representation mechanism democracy
parliamentary democracy representative democracy government appointed dismissed representative opposed presidential rule wherein president head state head government elected voters
parliamentary democracy government exercised delegation executive ministry subject ongoing review check balance legislative parliament elected people
parliamentary system right dismiss prime minister point time feel job expectation legislature
done vote confidence legislature decides whether remove prime minister office majority support dismissal
country prime minister also call election whenever chooses typically prime minister hold election know good favour public get re-elected
parliamentary democracy extra election virtually never held minority government preferred next ordinary elections
essence concept second largest political party coalition opposes governing party coalition still remaining loyal state democratic principles
president serf head state head government controlling executive powers
president serf specific term cannot exceed amount time
president ha direct control cabinet specifically appointing cabinet members
president cannot easily removed office legislature cannot remove member legislative branch easily
consequence however president legislature may end control separate party allowing one block thereby interfere orderly operation state
may reason presidential democracy common outside america africa central southeast asia

modern democracy predominantly representative nature also heavily rely upon form political action directly democratic
