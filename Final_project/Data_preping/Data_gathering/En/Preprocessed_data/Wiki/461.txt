democracy from greek d mokrat a d mos people and kratos rule is a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation direct democracy or to choose governing officials to do so representative democracy
who is considered part of the people and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries but over time more and more of a democratic country s inhabitants have generally been included
cornerstones of democracy include freedom of assembly association property rights freedom of religion and speech inclusiveness and equality citizenship consent of the governed voting rights freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty and minority rights
the notion of democracy has evolved over time considerably
the original form of democracy was a direct democracy
the most common form of democracy today is a representative democracy where the people elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy
prevalent day to day decision making of democracies is the majority rule though other decision making approaches like supermajority and consensus have also been integral to democracies
they serve the crucial purpose of inclusiveness and broader legitimacy on sensitive issues counterbalancing majoritarianism and therefore mostly take precedence on a constitutional level
in the common variant of liberal democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights e g
freedom of speech or freedom of association
the term appeared in the th century bc to denote the political systems then existing in greek city states notably classical athens to mean rule of the people in contrast to aristocracy aristokrat a meaning rule of an elite
western democracy as distinct from that which existed in antiquity is generally considered to have originated in city states such as those in classical athens and the roman republic where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in the west at the beginning of late antiquity
in virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the th and th centuries
democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual as in autocratic systems like absolute monarchy or where power is held by a small number of individuals as in an oligarchy oppositions inherited from ancient greek philosophy
karl popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution
world public opinion strongly favors democratic systems of government
although democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy
karl popper says that the classical view of democracy is simply in brief the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule kofi annan states that there are as many different forms of democracy as there are democratic nations in the world one study identified adjectives used to describe democracy in the english language
democratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes
for example in a representative democracy every vote has equal weight no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically protected by a constitution
other uses of democracy include that of direct democracy in which issues are directly voted on by the constituents
one theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles upward control sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority political equality and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality
legal equality political freedom and rule of law are often identified as foundational characteristics for a well functioning democracy
the term democracy is sometimes used as shorthand for liberal democracy which is a variant of representative democracy that may include elements such as political pluralism equality before the law the right to petition elected officials for redress of grievances due process civil liberties human rights and elements of civil society outside the government
roger scruton argued that democracy alone cannot provide personal and political freedom unless the institutions of civil society are also present
in some countries notably in the united kingdom which originated the westminster system the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty while maintaining judicial independence
in india parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the constitution of india which includes judicial review
though the term democracy is typically used in the context of a political state the principles also are applicable to private organisations
there are many decision making methods used in democracies but majority rule is the dominant form
without compensation like legal protections of individual or group rights political minorities can be oppressed by the tyranny of the majority
majority rule is a competitive approach opposed to consensus democracy creating the need that elections and generally deliberation are substantively and procedurally fair i e
just and equitable
in some countries freedom of political expression freedom of speech freedom of the press and internet democracy are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed enabling them to vote according to their own interests
it has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society
with its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking
republics though often associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by consent of the governed are not necessarily democracies as republicanism does not specify how the people are to rule
classically the term republic encompassed both democracies and aristocracies
in a modern sense the republican form of government is a form of government without monarch
because of this democracies can be republics or constitutional monarchies such as the united kingdom
historically democracies and republics have been rare
republican theorists linked democracy to small size as political units grew in size the likelihood increased that the government would turn despotic
at the same time small political units were vulnerable to conquest
montesquieu wrote if a republic be small it is destroyed by a foreign force if it be large it is ruined by an internal imperfection according to johns hopkins university political scientist daniel deudney the creation of the united states with its large size and its system of checks and balances was a solution to the dual problems of size
retrospectively different polities outside of declared democracies have been described as proto democratic
the term democracy first appeared in ancient greek political and philosophical thought in the city state of athens during classical antiquity
the word comes from d mos common people and kr tos force might
under cleisthenes what is generally held as the first example of a type of democracy in bc was established in athens
cleisthenes is referred to as the father of athenian democracy
athenian democracy took the form of a direct democracy and it had two distinguishing features the random selection of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices and a legislative assembly consisting of all athenian citizens
all eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly which set the laws of the city state
however athenian citizenship excluded women slaves foreigners m toikoi and youths below the age of military service
effectively only in residents in athens qualified as citizens
owning land was not a requirement for citizenship
the exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship
in most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns
athenian democracy was not only direct in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people but also the most direct in the sense that the people through the assembly boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business
even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the athenian constitution in the modern sense the ancient greeks had no word for rights those who were citizens of athens enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person
range voting appeared in sparta as early as bc
the apella was an assembly of the people held once a month in which every male citizen of at least years of age could participate
in the apella spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting the vote is then decided on how loudly the crowd shouts
aristotle called this childish as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the athenian citizenry
sparta adopted it because of its simplicity and to prevent any biased voting buying or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections
even though the roman republic contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy only a minority of romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives
the votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of gerrymandering so most high officials including members of the senate came from a few wealthy and noble families
in addition the overthrow of the roman kingdom was the first case in the western world of a polity being formed with the explicit purpose of being a republic although it didn t have much of a democracy
the roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries and today s modern representative democracies imitate more the roman than the greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives and which had an elected or nominated leader
vaishali capital city of the vajjika league vrijji mahajanapada of india was also considered one of the first examples of a republic around the th century bc
other cultures such as the iroquois nation in the americas also developed a form of democratic society between and and possibly in well before contact with the europeans
this democracy continues to the present day and is the world s oldest standing representative democracy
this indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world
while most regions in europe during the middle ages were ruled by clergy or feudal lords there existed various systems involving elections or assemblies although often only involving a small part of the population
in scandinavia bodies known as things consisted of freemen presided by a lawspeaker
these deliberative bodies were responsible for settling political questions and variants included the althing in iceland and the l gting in the faeroe islands
the veche found in eastern europe was a similar body to the scandinavian thing
in the roman catholic church the pope has been elected by a papal conclave composed of cardinals since
the first documented parliamentary body in europe was the cortes of le n
established by alfonso ix in the cortes had authority over setting taxation foreign affairs and legislating though the exact nature of its role remains disputed
the republic of ragusa established in and centered around the city of dubrovnik provided representation and voting rights to its male aristocracy only
various italian city states and polities had republic forms of government
for instance the republic of florence established in was led by the signoria whose members were chosen by sortition
in th th century frisia a distinctly non feudal society the right to vote on local matters and on county officials was based on land size
the kouroukan fouga divided the mali empire into ruling clans lineages that were represented at a great assembly called the gbara
however the charter made mali more similar to a constitutional monarchy than a democratic republic
the parliament of england had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into magna carta which explicitly protected certain rights of the king s subjects and implicitly supported what became the english writ of habeas corpus safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal
the first representative national assembly in england was simon de montfort s parliament in
the emergence of petitioning is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people
however the power to call parliament remained at the pleasure of the monarch
studies have linked the emergence of parliamentary institutions in europe during the medieval period to urban agglomeration and the creation of new classes such as artisans as well as the presence of nobility and religious elites
scholars have also linked the emergence of representative government to europe s relative political fragmentation
political scientist david stasavage links the fragmentation of europe and its subsequent democratization to the manner in which the roman empire collapsed roman territory was conquered by small fragmented groups of germanic tribes thus leading to the creation of small political units where rulers were relatively weak and needed the consent of the governed to ward off foreign threats
in poland noble democracy was characterized by an increase in the activity of the middle nobility which wanted to increase their share in exercising power at the expense of the magnates
magnates dominated the most important offices in the state secular and ecclesiastical and sat on the royal council later the senate
the growing importance of the middle nobility had an impact on the establishment of the institution of the land sejmik local assembly which subsequently obtained more rights
during the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century sejmiks received more and more powers and became the most important institutions of local power
in casimir iv jagiellon granted the sejmiks the right to decide on taxes and to convene a mass mobilization in the nieszawa statutes
he also pledged not to create new laws without their consent
in th century england there was renewed interest in magna carta
the parliament of england passed the petition of right in which established certain liberties for subjects
the english civil war was fought between the king and an oligarchic but elected parliament during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the putney debates of
subsequently the protectorate and the english restoration restored more autocratic rule although parliament passed the habeas corpus act in which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence
after the glorious revolution of the bill of rights was enacted in which codified certain rights and liberties and is still in effect
the bill set out the requirement for regular elections rules for freedom of speech in parliament and limited the power of the monarch ensuring that unlike much of europe at the time royal absolutism would not prevail
economic historians douglass north and barry weingast have characterized the institutions implemented in the glorious revolution as a resounding success in terms of restraining the government and ensuring protection for property rights
renewed interest in the magna carta the english civil war and the glorious revolution in the th century prompted the growth of political philosophy on the british isles
thomas hobbes was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed social contract theory
writing in leviathan hobbes theorized that individuals living in the state of nature led lives that were solitary poor nasty brutish and short and constantly waged a war of all against all
in order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong authoritarian government
later philosopher and physician john locke would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory
writing in his two treatises of government locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life liberty and estate property
according to locke individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights
particularly important for locke were property rights whose protection locke deemed to be a government s primary purpose
furthermore locke asserted that governments were legitimate only if they held the consent of the governed
for locke citizens had the right to revolt against a government that acted against their interest or became tyrannical
although they were not widely read during his lifetime locke s works are considered the founding documents of liberal thought and profoundly influenced the leaders of the american revolution and later the french revolution
his liberal democratic framework of governance remains the preeminent form of democracy in the world
in the cossack republics of ukraine in the th and th centuries the cossack hetmanate and zaporizhian sich the holder of the highest post of hetman was elected by the representatives from the country s districts
in north america representative government began in jamestown virginia with the election of the house of burgesses forerunner of the virginia general assembly in
english puritans who migrated from established colonies in new england whose local governance was democratic although these local assemblies had some small amounts of devolved power the ultimate authority was held by the crown and the english parliament
the puritans pilgrim fathers baptists and quakers who founded these colonies applied the democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in worldly matters
the first parliament of great britain was established in after the merger of the kingdom of england and the kingdom of scotland under the acts of union
although the monarch increasingly became a figurehead parliament was only elected by male property owners which amounted to of the population in
the first known british person of african heritage to vote in a general election ignatius sancho voted in and
during the age of liberty in sweden civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament
the taxed peasantry was represented in parliament although with little influence but commoners without taxed property had no suffrage
the creation of the short lived corsican republic in was an early attempt to adopt a democratic constitution all men and women above age of could vote
this corsican constitution was the first based on enlightenment principles and included female suffrage something that was not included in most other democracies until the th century
in the american colonial period before and for some time after often only adult white male property owners could vote enslaved africans most free black people and most women were not extended the franchise
this changed state by state beginning with the republican state of new connecticut soon after called vermont which on declaring independence of great britain in adopted a constitution modelled on pennsylvania s with citizenship and democratic suffrage for males with or without property and went on to abolish slavery
the american revolution led to the adoption of the united states constitution in the oldest surviving still active governmental codified constitution
the constitution provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties for some but did not end slavery nor extend voting rights in the united states instead leaving the issue of suffrage to the individual states
generally states limited suffrage to white male property owners and taxpayers
at the time of the first presidential election in about of the population was eligible to vote
the naturalization act of limited u s
citizenship to whites only
the bill of rights in set limits on government power to protect personal freedoms but had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first years after ratification
in revolutionary france adopted the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen and although short lived the national convention was elected by all men in
the polish lithuanian constitution of may sought to implement a more effective constitutional monarchy introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom
in force for less than months it was declared null and void by the grodno sejm that met in
nonetheless the constitution helped keep alive polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country s sovereignty over a century later
however in the early th century little of democracy as theory practice or even as word remained in the north atlantic world
during this period slavery remained a social and economic institution in places around the world
this was particularly the case in the united states where eight serving presidents had owned slaves and the last fifteen slave states kept slavery legal in the american south until the civil war
advocating the movement of black people from the us to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom and equality in the s the abolitionist members of the acs established the settlement of liberia
the united kingdom s slave trade act banned the trade across the british empire which was enforced internationally by the royal navy under treaties britain negotiated with other states
in the uk passed the slavery abolition act which took effect across the british empire although slavery was legally allowed to continue in areas controlled by the east india company in ceylon and in saint helena for an additional ten years
in the united states the presidential election was the first in which non property holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states
voter turnout soared during the s reaching about of the adult white male population in the presidential election
north carolina was the last state to abolish property qualification in resulting in a close approximation to universal white male suffrage however tax paying requirements remained in five states in and survived in two states until the th century
in the united states census the slave population had grown to four million and in reconstruction after the civil war three constitutional amendments were passed the th amendment that ended slavery the th amendment that gave black people citizenship and the th amendment that gave black males a nominal right to vote
full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the civil rights movement gained passage by the us congress of the voting rights act of
the voting franchise in the united kingdom was expanded and made more uniform in a series of reforms that began with the reform act and continued into the th century notably with the representation of the people act and the equal franchise act
universal male suffrage was established in france in march in the wake of the french revolution of
in several revolutions broke out in europe as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government
in the ottoman empire transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one and held two elections the next year to elect members to her newly formed parliament
provisional electoral regulations were issued stating that the elected members of the provincial administrative councils would elect members to the first parliament
later that year a new constitution was promulgated which provided for a bicameral parliament with a senate appointed by the sultan and a popularly elected chamber of deputies
only men above the age of who were competent in turkish and had full civil rights were allowed to stand for election
reasons for disqualification included holding dual citizenship being employed by a foreign government being bankrupt employed as a servant or having notoriety for ill deeds
full universal suffrage was achieved in
in the self governing colony new zealand became the first country in the world except for the short lived th century corsican republic to establish active universal suffrage by recognizing women as having the right to vote
th century transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive waves of democracy variously resulting from wars revolutions decolonisation and religious and economic circumstances
global waves of democratic regression reversing democratization have also occurred in the s and s in the s and s and in the s
world war i and the dissolution of the autocratic ottoman and austro hungarian empires resulted in the creation of new nation states in europe most of them at least nominally democratic
in the s democratic movements flourished and women s suffrage advanced but the great depression brought disenchantment and most of the countries of europe latin america and asia turned to strong man rule or dictatorships
fascism and dictatorships flourished in nazi germany italy spain and portugal as well as non democratic governments in the baltics the balkans brazil cuba china and japan among others
world war ii brought a definitive reversal of this trend in western europe
the democratisation of the american british and french sectors of occupied germany disputed austria italy and the occupied japan served as a model for the later theory of government change
however most of eastern europe including the soviet sector of germany fell into the non democratic soviet dominated bloc
the war was followed by decolonisation and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions
india emerged as the world s largest democracy and continues to be so
countries that were once part of the british empire often adopted the british westminster system
by the vast majority of country states were nominally democracies although most of the world s populations lived in nominal democracies that experienced sham elections and other forms of subterfuge particularly in communist states and the former colonies
a subsequent wave of democratisation brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many states dubbed third wave of democracy portugal spain and several of the military dictatorships in south america returned to civilian rule in the s and s
this was followed by countries in east and south asia by the mid to late s
economic malaise in the s along with resentment of soviet oppression contributed to the collapse of the soviet union the associated end of the cold war and the democratisation and liberalisation of the former eastern bloc countries
the most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western europe and they are now either part of the european union or candidate states
in after the toppling of the most prominent asian dictatorship the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the philippines with the rise of corazon aquino who would later be known as the mother of asian democracy
the liberal trend spread to some states in africa in the s most prominently in south africa
some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the indonesian revolution of the bulldozer revolution in yugoslavia the rose revolution in georgia the orange revolution in ukraine the cedar revolution in lebanon the tulip revolution in kyrgyzstan and the jasmine revolution in tunisia
according to freedom house in there were electoral democracies up from in
according to world forum on democracy electoral democracies now represent of the existing countries and constitute percent of the world s population
at the same time liberal democracies i e
countries freedom house regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are in number and represent percent of the global population
also in the united nations declared september the international day of democracy
most electoral democracies continue to exclude those younger than from voting
the voting age has been lowered to for national elections in a number of countries including brazil austria cuba and nicaragua
in california a proposal to permit a quarter vote at and a half vote at was ultimately defeated
in the german parliament proposed but shelved a bill that would grant the vote to each citizen at birth to be used by a parent until the child claims it for themselves
according to freedom house starting in there have been eleven consecutive years in which declines in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world have outnumbered improvements as populist and nationalist political forces have gained ground everywhere from poland under the law and justice party to the philippines under rodrigo duterte
in a freedom house report released in democracy scores for most countries declined for the th consecutive year
the christian science monitor reported that nationalist and populist political ideologies were gaining ground at the expense of rule of law in countries like poland turkey and hungary
for example in poland the president appointed new supreme court judges over legal objections from the european commission
in turkey thousands of judges were removed from their positions following a failed coup attempt during a government crackdown
democratic backsliding in the s were attributed to economic inequality and social discontent personalism poor management of covid pandemic as well as other factors such as government manipulation of civil society toxic polarization foreign disinformation campaigns racism and nativism excessive executive power and decreased power of the opposition
within english speaking western democracies protection based attitudes combining cultural conservatism and leftist economic attitudes were the strongest predictor of support for authoritarian modes of governance
aristotle contrasted rule by the many democracy timocracy with rule by the few oligarchy aristocracy and with rule by a single person tyranny or today autocracy absolute monarchy
he also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy
a common view among early and renaissance republican theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities
heeding the lessons of the roman republic s shift to monarchism as it grew larger or smaller these republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny
democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically as it could only survive in small political units which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units
montesquieu famously said if a republic is small it is destroyed by an outside force if it is large it is destroyed by an internal vice rousseau asserted it is therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic of middling ones to be subject to a monarch and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince
among modern political theorists there are three contending conceptions of democracy aggregative democracy deliberative democracy and radical democracy
the theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt
therefore proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting where the policy with the most votes gets implemented
different variants of aggregative democracy exist
under minimalism democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections
according to this minimalist conception citizens cannot and should not rule because for example on most issues most of the time they have no clear views or their views are not well founded
joseph schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book capitalism socialism and democracy
contemporary proponents of minimalism include william h
riker adam przeworski richard posner
according to the theory of direct democracy on the other hand citizens should vote directly not through their representatives on legislative proposals
proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view
political activity can be valuable in itself it socialises and educates citizens and popular participation can check powerful elites
most importantly citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies
governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter with half to their left and the other half to their right
this is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes
anthony downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments
downs laid out this view in his book an economic theory of democracy
robert a
dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that when it comes to binding collective decisions each person in a political community is entitled to have his her interests be given equal consideration not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision
he uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy
first and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society
however these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if for example poverty prevents political participation
similarly ronald dworkin argues that democracy is a substantive not a merely procedural ideal
deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation
unlike aggregative democracy deliberative democracy holds that for a democratic decision to be legitimate it must be preceded by authentic deliberation not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting
authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power such as power a decision maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups
if the decision makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule
citizens assemblies are considered by many scholars as practical examples of deliberative democracy with a recent oecd report identifying citizens assemblies as an increasingly popular mechanism to involve citizens in governmental decision making
radical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society
democracy s role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference dissent and antagonisms in decision making processes
ranking of the degree of democracy are published by several organisations according to their own various definitions of the term and relying on different types of data
the v dem institute s varieties of democracy report is published each year since by the swedish research institute v dem
it includes separate indices measuring five different types of democracy electoral democracy liberal democracy participatory democracy deliberative democracy and egalitarian democracy
the democracy index published by the uk based economist intelligence unit is an assessment of countries democracy
countries are rated to be either full democracies flawed democracies hybrid regimes or authoritarian regimes
full democracies flawed democracies and hybrid regimes are considered to be democracies and the authoritarian states are considered to be dictatorial or oligarchic
the index is based on indicators grouped in five different categories
the u s based polity data series is a widely used data series in political science research
it contains coded annual information on regime authority characteristics and transitions for all independent states with greater than total population and covers the years
polity s conclusions about a state s level of democracy are based on an evaluation of that state s elections for competitiveness openness and level of participation
the polity work is sponsored by the political instability task force pitf which is funded by the u s
central intelligence agency
however the views expressed in the reports are the authors alone and do not represent the views of the us government
maxrange a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure regime type on a graded scale where every value represents a unique regime type
values are sorted from based on level of democracy and political accountability
maxrange defines the value corresponding to all states and every month from to and updating
maxrange is created and developed by max range and is now associated with the university of halmstad sweden other indices measuring freedom and human rights include degree of democracy as an element
some of these include the freedom in the world ranking the worldwide press freedom index the index of freedom in the world and the ciri human rights data project
because democracy is an overarching concept that includes the functioning of diverse institutions which are not easy to measure strong limitations exist in quantifying and econometrically measuring the potential effects of democracy or its relationship with other phenomena whether inequality poverty education etc
given the constraints in acquiring reliable data with within country variation on aspects of democracy academics have largely studied cross country variations
yet variations between democratic institutions are very large across countries which constrains meaningful comparisons using statistical approaches
since democracy is typically measured aggregately as a macro variable using a single observation for each country and each year studying democracy faces a range of econometric constraints and is limited to basic correlations
cross country comparison of a composite comprehensive and qualitative concept like democracy may thus not always be for many purposes methodologically rigorous or useful
dieter fuchs and edeltraud roller suggest that in order to truly measure the quality of democracy objective measurements need to be complemented by subjective measurements based on the perspective of citizens
similarly quinton mayne and brigitte gei el also defend that the quality of democracy does not depend exclusively on the performance of institutions but also on the citizens own dispositions and commitment
democracy has taken a number of forms both in theory and practice
some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others
however if any democracy is not structured to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its favour then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy
the following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co exist in a single system
several variants of democracy exist but there are two basic forms both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will
one form of democracy is direct democracy in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making for example voting on policy initiatives directly
in most modern democracies the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives this is called a representative democracy
direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision making personally contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives
a direct democracy gives the voting population the power to
change constitutional laws
put forth initiatives referendums and suggestions for laws
give binding orders to elective officials such as revoking them before the end of their elected term or initiating a lawsuit for breaking a campaign promise within modern day representative governments certain electoral tools like referendums citizens initiatives and recall elections are referred to as forms of direct democracy
however some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of face to face discussion
direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the swiss cantons of appenzell innerrhoden and glarus the rebel zapatista autonomous municipalities communities affiliated with the cipo rfm the bolivian city councils of fejuve and kurdish cantons of rojava
the use of a lot system a characteristic of athenian democracy is a feature of some versions of direct democracies
in this system important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery
representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented
if the head of state is also democratically elected then it is called a democratic republic
the most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a plurality of the votes
most western countries have representative systems
representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district or constituency or represent the entire electorate through proportional systems with some using a combination of the two
some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy such as referendums
a characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people s interest they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so
such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy
parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by or can be dismissed by representatives as opposed to a presidential rule wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters
under a parliamentary democracy government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people
parliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a prime minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature
this is done through a vote of no confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the prime minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal
in some countries the prime minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses and typically the prime minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re elected
in other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections
an important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the loyal opposition
the essence of the concept is that the second largest political party or coalition opposes the governing party or coalition while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles
presidential democracy is a system where the public elects the president by election
the president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers
the president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time
elections typically have a fixed date and aren t easily changed
the president has direct control over the cabinet specifically appointing the cabinet members
the president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily
this provides some measure of separation of powers
in consequence however the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state
this may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the americas africa and central and southeast asia
a semi presidential system is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president
the particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country
some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic
these democracies which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy are termed hybrid democracies semi direct democracies or participatory democracies
examples include switzerland and some u s
states where frequent use is made of referendums and initiatives
the swiss confederation is a semi direct democracy
at the federal level citizens can propose changes to the constitution federal popular initiative or ask for a referendum to be held on any law voted by the parliament
between january and june swiss citizens voted times to answer questions during the same period french citizens participated in only two referendums
although in the past years less than initiatives have been put to referendum
examples include the extensive use of referendums in the us state of california which is a state that has more than million voters
in new england town meetings are often used especially in rural areas to manage local government
this creates a hybrid form of government with a local direct democracy and a representative state government
for example most vermont towns hold annual town meetings in march in which town officers are elected budgets for the town and schools are voted on and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters
many countries such as the united kingdom spain the netherlands belgium scandinavian countries thailand japan and bhutan turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or often gradually merely symbolic roles
for example in the predecessor states to the united kingdom constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the glorious revolution of and passage of the bill of rights
strongly limited constitutional monarchies such as the united kingdom have been referred to as crowned republics by writers such as h
wells
in other countries the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system as in france china russia germany austria hungary italy greece and egypt
an elected person with or without significant powers became the head of state in these countries
elite upper houses of legislatures which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure were common in many states
over time these either had their powers limited as with the british house of lords or else became elective and remained powerful as with the australian senate
the term republic has many different meanings but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected head of state such as a president serving for a limited term in contrast to states with a hereditary monarch as a head of state even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed head of government such as a prime minister
the founding fathers of the united states rarely praised and often criticised democracy which in their view often came without the protection of a constitution enshrining inalienable rights james madison argued especially in the federalist no
that what distinguished a direct democracy from a republic was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure
professors richard ellis of willamette university and michael nelson of rhodes college argue that much constitutional thought from madison to lincoln and beyond has focused on the problem of majority tyranny they conclude the principles of republican government embedded in the constitution represent an effort by the framers to ensure that the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness would not be trampled by majorities what was critical to american values john adams insisted was that the government be bound by fixed laws which the people have a voice in making and a right to defend as benjamin franklin was exiting after writing the u s
constitution elizabeth willing powel asked him well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy
he replied a republic if you can keep it
a liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision making power is subject to the rule of law and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities see civil liberties
in a liberal democracy it is possible for some large scale decisions to emerge from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make
in other words citizens can vote with their feet or vote with their dollars resulting in significant informal government by the masses that exercises many powers associated with formal government elsewhere
socialist thought has several different views on democracy
social democracy democratic socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat usually exercised through soviet democracy are some examples
many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of participatory industrial economic and or workplace democracy combined with a representative democracy
within marxist orthodoxy there is a hostility to what is commonly called liberal democracy which is simply referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature
because of orthodox marxists desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism marxists leninists and trotskyists believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of communes which are sometimes called soviets
this system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy
anarchists are split in this domain depending on whether they believe that a majority rule is tyrannic or not
to many anarchists the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy
pierre joseph proudhon argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority even when unanimous
however anarcho communist murray bookchin criticised individualist anarchists for opposing democracy and says majority rule is consistent with anarchism
some anarcho communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt in favour of a non majoritarian form of consensus democracy similar to proudhon s position on direct democracy
henry david thoreau who did not self identify as an anarchist but argued for a better government and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent
sometimes called democracy without elections sortition chooses decision makers via a random process
the intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large and be more fair and impartial than an elected official
the technique was in widespread use in athenian democracy and renaissance florence and is still used in modern jury selection
a consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno religious constituencies and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them
a consensus democracy in contrast would not be dichotomous
instead decisions would be based on a multi option approach and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support either in a purely verbal agreement or via a consensus vote a multi option preference vote
if the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level minorities would be as it were protected automatically
furthermore any voting would be ethno colour blind
qualified majority voting is designed by the treaty of rome to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the european council of ministers
this system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states
this might be seen as a form of representative democracy but representatives to the council might be appointed rather than directly elected
inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for direct democracy in all fields of social life political democracy in the form of face to face assemblies which are confederated economic democracy in a stateless moneyless and marketless economy democracy in the social realm i e
self management in places of work and education and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature
the theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher takis fotopoulos in towards an inclusive democracy and was further developed in the journal democracy nature and its successor the international journal of inclusive democracy
the basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly i e
the assembly of demos the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages or even neighbourhoods of large cities
an inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face to face democratic assemblies in the various demoi
thus their role is purely administrative and practical not one of policy making like that of representatives in representative democracy
the citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision taker
authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties for example to serve as members of popular courts or of regional and confederal councils
such delegation is made in principle by lot on a rotation basis and is always recallable by the citizen body
delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates
a parpolity or participatory polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a nested council structure
the guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision
local councils of people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council
a council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the tyranny of the majority and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue
delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council
delegates are recallable at any time
referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower level councils however not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time
a parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a participatory economy
cosmopolitan democracy also known as global democracy or world federalism is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale either directly or through representatives
an important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who by definition cannot vote
by contrast in a cosmopolitan democracy the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them
according to its supporters any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy
the general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy including the rule of law the non violent resolution of conflicts and equality among citizens beyond the limits of the state
to be fully implemented this would require reforming existing international organisations e g
the united nations as well as the creation of new institutions such as a world parliament which ideally would enhance public control over and accountability in international politics
cosmopolitan democracy has been promoted among others by physicist albert einstein writer kurt vonnegut columnist george monbiot and professors david held and daniele archibugi
the creation of the international criminal court in was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy
creative democracy is advocated by american philosopher john dewey
the main idea about creative democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society
dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of creative democracy the task before us and an experience built on faith in human nature faith in human beings and faith in working with others
democracy in dewey s view is a moral ideal requiring actual effort and work by people it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves
the task of democracy dewey concludes is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute
guided democracy is a form of democracy that incorporates regular popular elections but which often carefully guides the choices offered to the electorate in a manner that may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them
such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority
russian style democracy has often been referred to as a guided democracy russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power authority as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government
aside from the public sphere similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups
many non governmental organisations decide policy and leadership by voting
most trade unions and cooperatives are governed by democratic elections
corporations are ultimately governed by their shareholders through shareholder democracy
corporations may also employ systems such as workplace democracy to handle internal governance
amitai etzioni has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with sharia law termed islamocracy
there is also a growing number of democratic educational institutions such as sudbury schools that are co governed by students and staff
shareholder democracy is a concept relating to the governance of corporations by their shareholders
in the united states shareholders are typically granted voting rights according to the one share one vote principle
shareholders may vote annually to elect the company s board of directors who themselves may choose the company s executives
the shareholder democracy framework may be inaccurate for companies which have different classes of stock that further alter the distribution of voting rights
several justifications for democracy have been postulated
social contract theory argues that the legitimacy of government is based on consent of the governed i e
an election and that political decisions must reflect the general will
some proponents of the theory like jean jacques rousseau advocate for a direct democracy on this basis
condorcet s jury theorem is logical proof that if each decision maker has a better than chance probability of making the right decision then having the largest number of decision makers i e
a democracy will result in the best decisions
this has also been argued by theories of the wisdom of the crowd
democratic peace theory claims that liberal democracies do not go to war against each other while territorial peace theory claims that peace facilitates democracy
in why nations fail economists daron acemoglu and james a
robinson argue that democracies are more economically successful because undemocratic political systems tend to limit markets and favor monopolies at the expense of the creative destruction which is necessary for sustained economic growth
a study by acemoglu and others estimated that countries switching to democratic from authoritarian rule had on average a higher gdp after years than if they had remained authoritarian
the study examined transitions to democracy and transitions to authoritarian rule occurring from to
acemoglu said this was because democracies tended to invest more in health care and human capital and reduce special treatment of regime allies
arrow s impossibility theorem suggests that democracy is logically incoherent
this is based on a certain set of criteria for democratic decision making being inherently conflicting i e
these three fairness criteria
kenneth arrow summarised the implications of the theorem in a non mathematical form stating that no voting method is fair every ranked voting method is flawed and the only voting method that isn t flawed is a dictatorship
however arrow s formal premises can be considered overly strict and with their reasonable weakening the logical incoherence of democracy looks much less critical
some economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy citing the premise of the irrational voter or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision
another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision
a common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by china a non democratic one party ruling communist state as compared to india a democratic multi party state
according to economists the lack of democratic participation in countries like china allows for unfettered economic growth
on the other hand socrates believed that democracy without educated masses educated in the broader sense of being knowledgeable and responsible would only lead to populism being the criteria to become an elected leader and not competence
this would ultimately lead to a societal demise
this was quoted by plato in book of the republic in socrates conversation with adimantus
socrates was of the opinion that the right to vote must not be an indiscriminate right for example by birth or citizenship but must be given only to people who thought sufficiently of their choice
xi jinping general secretary of the chinese communist party warned joe biden u s
president via a phone call that democracy was dying
democracies require consensus and it takes time and you don t have the time xi jinping added
the th century italian thinkers vilfredo pareto and gaetano mosca independently argued that democracy was illusory and served only to mask the reality of elite rule
indeed they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature due largely to the apathy and division of the masses as opposed to the drive initiative and unity of the elites and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation
as louis brandeis once professed we may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can t have both
british writer ivo mosley grandson of blackshirt oswald mosley describes in in the name of the people pseudo democracy and the spoiling of our world how and why current forms of electoral governance are destined to fall short of their promise
a study led by princeton professor martin gilens of u s
government decisions concluded that
elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on u s
government policy while average citizens and mass based interest groups have little or no independent influence
plato s the republic presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of socrates democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike in his work plato lists forms of government from best to worst
assuming that the republic was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in athens plato argues that only kallipolis an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher kings the wisest men is a just form of government
james madison critiqued democracy in federalist no
arguing that a republic is a preferable form of government saying democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against tyranny of the majority stating in federalist no
the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy in controlling the effects of faction is enjoyed by a large over a small republic
thomas jefferson warned that an elective despotism is not the government we fought for
more recently democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability
as governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally
even if a political party maintains power vociferous headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden unexpected political change
frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth
for this reason many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities
this opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government
biased media has been accused of causing political instability resulting in the obstruction of democracy rather than its promotion
democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government and many times it has faced opposition from social elites
the implementation of a democratic government within a non democratic state is typically brought about by democratic revolution
several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy
other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development
in a related theory ronald inglehart suggests that improved living standards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted leading to increased emphasis on self expression values which correlates closely with democracy
douglas m
gibler and andrew owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy
it has often been assumed that democracy causes peace but this study shows that historically peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy
carroll quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy democracy this scenario tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use
by the s guns were the best personal weapons available and in the united states of america already nominally democratic almost everyone could afford to buy a gun and could learn how to use it fairly easily
governments couldn t do any better it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns
similarly periclean greece was an age of the citizen soldier and democracy
other theories stressed the relevance of education and of human capital and within them of cognitive ability to increasing tolerance rationality political literacy and participation
two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished
a cognitive effect competence to make rational choices better information processing
an ethical effect support of democratic values freedom human rights etc which itself depends on intelligence evidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by
statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier more educated or less unequal
in fact empirical evidence shows that economic growth and education may not lead to increased demand for democratization as modernization theory suggests historically most countries attained high levels of access to primary education well before transitioning to democracy
rather than acting as a catalyst for democratization in some situations education provision may instead be used by non democratic regimes to indoctrinate their subjects and strengthen their power
the assumed link between education and economic growth is called into question when analyzing empirical evidence
across different countries the correlation between education attainment and math test scores is very weak
a similarly weak relationship exists between per pupil expenditures and math competency
additionally historical evidence suggests that average human capital measured using literacy rates of the masses does not explain the onset of industrialization in france from to despite arguments to the contrary
together these findings show that education does not always promote human capital and economic growth as is generally argued to be the case
instead the evidence implies that education provision often falls short of its expressed goals or alternatively that political actors use education to promote goals other than economic growth and development
some scholars have searched for the deep determinants of contemporary political institutions be they geographical or demographic
more inclusive institutions lead to democracy because as people gain more power they are able to demand more from the elites who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position
this virtuous circle may end up in democracy
an example of this is the disease environment
places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world
for example in africa the tsetse fly which afflicts humans and livestock reduced the ability of africans to plow the land
this made africa less settled
as a consequence political power was less concentrated
this also affected the colonial institutions european countries established in africa
whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths
this also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take
as a result some african countries ended up having democracies and others autocracies
an example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers
this natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of trade
trade brought economic development which in turn broadened power
rulers wanting to increase revenues had to protect property rights to create incentives for people to invest
as more people had more power more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many places this process lead to democracy
these determinants defined the structure of the society moving the balance of political power
robert michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy
the peasant in the fable when on his deathbed tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field
after the old man s death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure
they do not find it
but their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well being
the treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy some democratic governments have experienced sudden state collapse and regime change to an undemocratic form of government
domestic military coups or rebellions are the most common means by which democratic governments have been overthrown
see list of coups and coup attempts by country and list of civil wars examples include the spanish civil war the coup of brumaire that ended the first french republic and the may coup d tat which ended the first portuguese republic
some military coups are supported by foreign governments such as the guatemalan coup d tat and the iranian coup d tat
other types of a sudden end to democracy include
invasion for example the german occupation of czechoslovakia and the fall of south vietnam
self coup in which the leader of the government extra legally seizes all power or unlawfully extends the term in office
this can be done through
suspension of the constitution by decree such as with the peruvian coup d tat
an electoral self coup using election fraud to obtain re election of a previously fairly elected official or political party
for example in the ukrainian presidential election russian legislative election and russian presidential election
royal coup in which a monarch not normally involved in government seizes all power
for example the january dictatorship begun in when king alexander i of yugoslavia dismissed parliament and started ruling by decree democratic backsliding can end democracy in a gradual manner by increasing emphasis on national security and eroding free and fair elections freedom of expression independence of the judiciary rule of law
a famous example is the enabling act of which lawfully ended democracy in weimar germany and marked the transition to nazi germany
temporary or long term political violence and government interference can prevent free and fair elections which erode the democratic nature of governments
this has happened on a local level even in well established democracies like the united states for example the wilmington insurrection of and african american disfranchisement after the reconstruction era
the theory of democracy relies on the implicit assumption that voters are well informed about social issues policies and candidates so that they can make a truly informed decision
since the late th century there has been a growing concern that voters may be poorly informed because the news media are focusing more on entertainment and gossip and less on serious journalistic research on political issues
the media professors michael gurevitch and jay blumler have proposed a number of functions that the mass media are expected to fulfill in a democracy
surveillance of the sociopolitical environment
meaningful agenda setting
platforms for an intelligible and illuminating advocacy
dialogue across a diverse range of views
mechanisms for holding officials to account for how they have exercised power
incentives for citizens to learn choose and become involved
a principled resistance to the efforts of forces outside the media to subvert their independence integrity and ability to serve the audience
a sense of respect for the audience member as potentially concerned and able to make sense of his or her political environmentthis proposal has inspired a lot of discussions over whether the news media are actually fulfilling the requirements that a well functioning democracy requires
commercial mass media are generally not accountable to anybody but their owners and they have no obligation to serve a democratic function
they are controlled mainly by economic market forces
fierce economic competition may force the mass media to divert themselves from any democratic ideals and focus entirely on how to survive the competition
the tabloidization and popularization of the news media is seen in an increasing focus on human examples rather than statistics and principles
there is more focus on politicians as personalities and less focus on political issues in the popular media
election campaigns are covered more as horse races and less as debates about ideologies and issues
the dominating media focus on spin conflict and competitive strategies has made voters perceive the politicians as egoists rather than idealists
this fosters mistrust and a cynical attitude to politics less civic engagement and less interest in voting
the ability to find effective political solutions to social problems is hampered when problems tend to be blamed on individuals rather than on structural causes
this person centered focus may have far reaching consequences not only for domestic problems but also for foreign policy when international conflicts are blamed on foreign heads of state rather than on political and economic structures
a strong media focus on fear and terrorism has allowed military logic to penetrate public institutions leading to increased surveillance and the erosion of civil rights
the responsiveness and accountability of the democratic system is compromised when lack of access to substantive diverse and undistorted information is handicapping the citizens capability of evaluating the political process
the fast pace and trivialization in the competitive news media is dumbing down the political debate
thorough and balanced investigation of complex political issues does not fit into this format
the political communication is characterized by short time horizons short slogans simple explanations and simple solutions
this is conducive to political populism rather than serious deliberation
commercial mass media are often differentiated along the political spectrum so that people can hear mainly opinions that they already agree with
too much controversy and diverse opinions are not always profitable for the commercial news media
political polarization is emerging when different people read different news and watch different tv channels
this polarization has been worsened by the emergence of the social media that allow people to communicate mainly with groups of like minded people the so called echo chambers
extreme political polarization may undermine the trust in democratic institutions leading to erosion of civil rights and free speech and in some cases even reversion to autocracy
many media scholars have discussed non commercial news media with public service obligations as a means to improve the democratic process by providing the kind of political contents that a free market does not
provide
the world bank has recommended public service broadcasting in order to strengthen democracy in developing countries
these broadcasting services should be accountable to an independent regulatory body that is adequately protected from interference from political and economic interests
public service media have an obligation to provide reliable information to voters
many countries have publicly funded radio and television stations with public service obligations especially in europe and japan while such media are weak or non existent in other countries including the
several studies have shown that the stronger the dominance of commercial broadcast media over public service media the less the amount of policy relevant information in the media and the more focus on horse race journalism personalities and the pecadillos of politicians
public service broadcasters are characterized by more policy relevant information and more respect for journalistic norms and impartiality than the commercial media
however the trend of deregulation has put the public service model under increased pressure from competition with commercial
media
the emergence of the internet and the social media has profoundly altered the conditions for political communication
the social media have given ordinary citizens easy access to voice their opinion and share information while bypassing the filters of the large news media
this is often seen as an advantage for democracy
the new possibilities for communication have fundamentally changed the way social movements and protest movements operate and organize
the internet and social media have provided powerful new tools for democracy movements in developing countries and emerging democracies enabling them to bypass censorship voice their opinions and organize protests
a serious problem with the social media is that they have no truth filters
the established news media have to guard their reputation as trustworthy while ordinary citizens may post unreliable information
in fact studies show that false stories are going more viral than true stories
the proliferation of false stories and conspiracy theories may undermine public trust in the political system and public officials
reliable information sources are essential for the democratic process
less democratic governments rely heavily on censorship propaganda and misinformation in order to stay in power while independent sources of information are able to undermine their legitimacy
