psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior
psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena including feelings and thoughts
it is an academic discipline of immense scope crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences
psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains linking the discipline to neuroscience
as social scientists psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups
or psi is a greek letter which is commonly associated with the science of psychology
a professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist
some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists
some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior
others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors
psychologists are involved in research on perception cognition attention emotion intelligence subjective experiences motivation brain functioning and personality
psychologists interests extend to interpersonal relationships psychological resilience family resilience and other areas within social psychology
they also consider the unconscious mind
research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables
some but not all clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation
while psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity
by many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society
many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role practicing psychotherapy in clinical counseling or school settings
other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior
typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings e g universities medical schools or hospitals
another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings
yet others are involved in work on human development aging sports health forensic science education and the media
the word psychology derives from the greek word psyche for spirit or soul
the latter part of the word psychology derives from logia which refers to study or research
the latin word psychologia was first used by the croatian humanist and latinist marko maruli in his book psichiologia de ratione animae humanae psychology on the nature of the human soul in the late th century or early th century
the earliest known reference to the word psychology in english was by steven blankaart in in the physical dictionary
the dictionary refers to anatomy which treats the body and psychology which treats of the soul
in william james defined psychology as the science of mental life both of its phenomena and their conditions this definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades
however this meaning was contested notably by radical behaviorists such as john b
watson who in asserted that the discipline is a natural science the theoretical goal of which is the prediction and control of behavior since james defined psychology the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation
folk psychology refers to ordinary people s as contrasted with psychology professionals understanding of the mental states and behaviors of people
the ancient civilizations of egypt greece china india and persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology
in ancient egypt the ebers papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders
historians note that greek philosophers including thales plato and aristotle especially in his de anima treatise addressed the workings of the mind
as early as the th century bc the greek physician hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes
in bce plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place and in bce aristotle suggested that it was the heart
in china psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of laozi and confucius and later from the doctrines of buddhism
this body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting
it frames the universe in term of a division of physical reality and mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical and the mental
chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power
an ancient text known as the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation includes theories of personality based on yin yang balance and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria
chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the qing dynasty with the work of western educated fang yizhi liu zhi and wang qingren
wang qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system linked mental disorder with brain diseases investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization in brain function
influenced by hinduism indian philosophy explored distinctions in types of awareness
a central idea of the upanishads and other vedic texts that formed the foundations of hinduism was the distinction between a person s transient mundane self and their eternal unchanging soul
divergent hindu doctrines and buddhism have challenged this hierarchy of selves but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness
yoga encompasses a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal
theosophy a religion established by russian american philosopher helena blavatsky drew inspiration from these doctrines during her time in british india
psychology was of interest to enlightenment thinkers in europe
in germany gottfried wilhelm leibniz applied his principles of calculus to the mind arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum
he suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree
christian wolff identified psychology as its own science writing psychologia empirica in and psychologia rationalis in
immanuel kant advanced the idea of anthropology as a discipline with psychology an important subdivision
kant however explicitly rejected the idea of an experimental psychology writing that the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object in ferdinand ueberwasser designated himself professor of empirical psychology and logic and gave lectures on scientific psychology though these developments were soon overshadowed by the napoleonic wars
at the end of the napoleonic era prussian authorities discontinued the old university of m nster
having consulted philosophers hegel and herbart however in the prussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system
however this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation
in england early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism violence and the country s crowded lunatic asylums
philosopher john stuart mill believed that the human mind was open to scientific investigation even if the science is in some ways inexact
mill proposed a mental chemistry in which elementary thoughts could combine into ideas of greater complexity
gustav fechner began conducting psychophysics research in leipzig in the s
he articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity
the principle became known as the weber fechner law
fechner s elements of psychophysics challenged kant s negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind
fechner s achievement was to show that mental processes could not only be given numerical magnitudes but also that these could be measured by experimental methods in heidelberg hermann von helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception and trained physiologist wilhelm wundt
wundt in turn came to leipzig university where he established the psychological laboratory that brought experimental psychology to the world
wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of materials
paul flechsig and emil kraepelin soon created another influential laboratory at leipzig a psychology related lab that focused more on experimental psychiatry
the german psychologist hermann ebbinghaus a researcher at the university of berlin was another th century contributor to the field
he pioneered the experimental study of memory and developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting
in the early twentieth century wolfgang kohler max wertheimer and kurt koffka co founded the school of gestalt psychology not to be confused with the gestalt therapy of fritz perls
the approach of gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes
rather than reducing thoughts and behavior into smaller component elements as in structuralism the gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important and differs from the sum of its parts
psychologists in germany denmark austria england and the united states soon followed wundt in setting up laboratories
stanley hall an american who studied with wundt founded a psychology lab that became internationally influential
the lab was located at johns hopkins university
hall in turn trained yujiro motora who brought experimental psychology emphasizing psychophysics to the imperial university of tokyo
wundt s assistant hugo m nsterberg taught psychology at harvard to students such as narendra nath sen gupta who in founded a psychology department and laboratory at the university of calcutta
wundt s students walter dill scott lightner witmer and james mckeen cattell worked on developing tests of mental ability
cattell who also studied with eugenicist francis galton went on to found the psychological corporation
witmer focused on the mental testing of children scott on employee selection
another student of wundt the englishman edward titchener created the psychology program at cornell university and advanced structuralist psychology
the idea behind structuralism was to analyze and classify different aspects of the mind primarily through the method of introspection
william james john dewey and harvey carr advanced the idea of functionalism an expansive approach to psychology that underlined the darwinian idea of a behavior s usefulness to the individual
in james wrote an influential book the principles of psychology which expanded on the structuralism
he memorably described stream of consciousness james s ideas interested many american students in the emerging discipline
dewey integrated psychology with societal concerns most notably by promoting progressive education inculcating moral values in children and assimilating immigrants
a different strain of experimentalism with a greater connection to physiology emerged in south america under the leadership of horacio g
pi ero at the university of buenos aires
in russia too researchers placed greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology beginning with ivan sechenov s essay who is to develop psychology and how sechenov advanced the idea of brain reflexes and aggressively promoted a deterministic view of human behavior
the russian soviet physiologist ivan pavlov discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed classical conditioning and applied the process to human beings
one of the earliest psychology societies was la soci t de psychologie physiologique in france which lasted from to
the first meeting of the international congress of psychology sponsored by the international union of psychological science took place in paris in august amidst the world s fair celebrating the centennial of the french revolution
william james was one of three americans among the attendees
the american psychological association apa was founded soon after in
the international congress continued to be held at different locations in europe and with wide international participation
the sixth congress held in geneva in included presentations in russian chinese and japanese as well as esperanto
after a hiatus for world war i the seventh congress met in oxford with substantially greater participation from the war victorious anglo americans
in the congress took place at yale university in new haven connecticut attended by hundreds of members of the apa
tokyo imperial university led the way in bringing new psychology to the east
new ideas about psychology diffused from japan into china
american psychology gained status upon the u s s entry into world war i
a standing committee headed by robert yerkes administered mental tests army alpha and army beta to almost million soldiers
subsequently the rockefeller family via the social science research council began to provide funding for behavioral research
rockefeller charities funded the national committee on mental hygiene which disseminated the concept of mental illness and lobbied for applying ideas from psychology to child rearing
through the bureau of social hygiene and later funding of alfred kinsey rockefeller foundations helped establish research on sexuality in the u s
under the influence of the carnegie funded eugenics record office the draper funded pioneer fund and other institutions the eugenics movement also influenced american psychology
in the s and s eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes
in contrast to the us in the uk psychology was met with antagonism by the scientific and medical establishments and up until there were only six psychology chairs in universities in england
during world war ii and the cold war the u s
military and intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology by way of the armed forces and in the new office of strategic services intelligence agency
university of michigan psychologist dorwin cartwright reported that university researchers began large scale propaganda research in
he observed that the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week by week propaganda policy for the united states government cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy
the army rolled out its new general classification test to assess the ability of millions of soldiers
the army also engaged in large scale psychological research of troop morale and mental health
in the s the rockefeller foundation and ford foundation collaborated with the central intelligence agency cia to fund research on psychological warfare
in public controversy called attention to the army s project camelot the manhattan project of social science an effort which enlisted psychologists and anthropologists to analyze the plans and policies of foreign countries for strategic purposes
in germany after world war i psychology held institutional power through the military which was subsequently expanded along with the rest of the military during nazi germany
under the direction of hermann g ring s cousin matthias g ring the berlin psychoanalytic institute was renamed the g ring institute
freudian psychoanalysts were expelled and persecuted under the anti jewish policies of the nazi party and all psychologists had to distance themselves from freud and adler founders of psychoanalysis who were also jewish
the g ring institute was well financed throughout the war with a mandate to create a new german psychotherapy this psychotherapy aimed to align suitable germans with the overall goals of the reich
as described by one physician despite the importance of analysis spiritual guidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the volk and the gemeinschaft psychologists were to provide seelenf hrung lit soul guidance the leadership of the mind to integrate people into the new vision of a german community
harald schultz hencke melded psychology with the nazi theory of biology and racial origins criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed
johannes heinrich schultz a german psychologist recognized for developing the technique of autogenic training prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable and devised techniques for facilitating this process
after the war new institutions were created although some psychologists because of their nazi affiliation were discredited
alexander mitscherlich founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called psyche
with funding from the rockefeller foundation mitscherlich established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at heidelberg university
in psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students
after the russian revolution the bolsheviks promoted psychology as a way to engineer the new man of socialism
consequently university psychology departments trained large numbers of students in psychology
at the completion of training positions were made available for those students at schools workplaces cultural institutions and in the military
the russian state emphasized pedology and the study of child development
lev vygotsky became prominent in the field of child development
the bolsheviks also promoted free love and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual repression
although pedology and intelligence testing fell out of favor in psychology maintained its privileged position as an instrument of the soviet union
stalinist purges took a heavy toll and instilled a climate of fear in the profession as elsewhere in soviet society
following world war ii jewish psychologists past and present including lev vygotsky a r
luria and aron zalkind were denounced ivan pavlov posthumously and stalin himself were celebrated as heroes of soviet psychology
soviet academics experienced a degree of liberalization during the khrushchev thaw
the topics of cybernetics linguistics and genetics became acceptable again
the new field of engineering psychology emerged
the field involved the study of the mental aspects of complex jobs such as pilot and cosmonaut
interdisciplinary studies became popular and scholars such as georgy shchedrovitsky developed systems theory approaches to human behavior
twentieth century chinese psychology originally modeled itself on u s
psychology with translations from american authors like william james the establishment of university psychology departments and journals and the establishment of groups including the chinese association of psychological testing and the chinese psychological society
chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning
chinese psychologists were drawn to the idea that education would enable modernization
john dewey who lectured to chinese audiences between and had a significant influence on psychology in china
chancellor t sai yuan p ei introduced him at peking university as a greater thinker than confucius
kuo zing yang who received a phd at the university of california berkeley became president of zhejiang university and popularized behaviorism
after the chinese communist party gained control of the country the stalinist soviet union became the major influence with marxism leninism the leading social doctrine and pavlovian conditioning the approved means of behavior change
chinese psychologists elaborated on lenin s model of a reflective consciousness envisioning an active consciousness pinyin tzu chueh neng tung li able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle
they developed a concept of recognition pinyin jen shih which referred to the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview failure to correspond with party doctrine was incorrect recognition psychology education was centralized under the chinese academy of sciences supervised by the state council
in the academy created a psychology research office which in became the institute of psychology
because most leading psychologists were educated in the united states the first concern of the academy was the re education of these psychologists in the soviet doctrines
child psychology and pedagogy for the purpose of a nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline
in douard clapar de and pierre bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the international congress of psychotechnics applied to vocational guidance later called the international congress of psychotechnics and then the international association of applied psychology
the iaap is considered the oldest international psychology association
today at least international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology
in response to male predominance in the field female psychologists in the u s
formed the national council of women psychologists in
this organization became the international council of women psychologists after world war ii and the international council of psychologists in
several associations including the association of black psychologists and the asian american psychological association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non european racial groups in the profession
the international union of psychological science iupsys is the world federation of national psychological societies
the iupsys was founded in under the auspices of the united nations educational cultural and scientific organization unesco
psychology departments have since proliferated around the world based primarily on the euro american model
since the union has published the international journal of psychology
iaap and iupsys agreed in each to hold a congress every four years on a staggered basis
iupsys recognizes national psychology associations and at least others exist
the american psychological association is the oldest and largest
its membership has increased from in to in the present day
the apa includes divisions which since have steadily proliferated to include more specialties
some of these divisions such as the society for the psychological study of social issues and the american psychology law society began as autonomous groups
the interamerican psychological society founded in aspires to promote psychology across the western hemisphere
it holds the interamerican congress of psychology and ha had members in year
the european federation of professional psychology associations founded in represents national associations with a total of individual members
at least other international organizations represent psychologists in different regions
in some places governments legally regulate who can provide psychological services or represent themselves as a psychologist the apa defines a psychologist as someone with a doctoral degree in psychology
early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed popularity including the interest of scholars such as william james
some people considered parapsychology to be part of psychology parapsychology hypnotism and psychism were major topics at the early international congresses
but students of these fields were eventually ostracized and more or less banished from the congress in
parapsychology persisted for a time at imperial university in japan with publications such as clairvoyance and thoughtography by tomokichi fukurai but it was mostly shunned by
as a discipline psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a soft science
philosopher of science thomas kuhn s critique implied psychology overall was in a pre paradigm state lacking agreement on the type of overarching theory found in mature sciences such as chemistry and physics
because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and questionnaires critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science
skeptics have suggested that personality thinking and emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self reports which may be problematic
experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities
divisions still exist within the field with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population
critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a cult of empiricism which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived from the physical sciences
feminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of historically mostly male researchers
jean grimshaw for example argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal agenda through its efforts to control behavior
psychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling and therefore an important area of study
behaviorial neuroscience also known as biological psychology involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals
the allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non human animals
a leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brain
from phineas gage to h m
and clive wearing individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area
modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the s when in france paul broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function
soon after carl wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech
the contemporary field of behavioral neuroscience focuses on the physical basis of behavior
behaviorial neuroscientists use animal models often relying on rats to study the neural genetic and cellular mechanisms that underlie behaviors involved in learning memory and fear responses
cognitive neuroscientists by using neural imaging tools investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans
neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine how an individual s behavior and cognition are related to the brain
the biopsychosocial model is a cross disciplinary holistic model that concerns the ways in which interrelationships of biological psychological and socio environmental factors affect health and behavior
evolutionary psychology approaches thought and behavior from a modern evolutionary perspective
this perspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments
evolutionary psychologists attempt to find out how human psychological traits are evolved adaptations the results of natural selection or sexual selection over the course of human evolution
the history of the biological foundations of psychology includes evidence of racism
the idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by europeans
carl von linnaeus s four fold classification of humans classifies europeans as intelligent and severe americans as contented and free asians as ritualistic and africans as lazy and capricious
race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania and dysaesthesia aethiopica the behavior of uncooperative african slaves
after the creation of experimental psychology ethnical psychology emerged as a subdiscipline based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans
a tenet of behavioral research is that a large part of both human and lower animal behavior is learned
a principle associated with behavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning apply to humans and non human animals
behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as behavior modification which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones
early behavioral researchers studied stimulus response pairings now known as classical conditioning
they demonstrated that when a biologically potent stimulus e g food that elicits salivation is paired with a previously neutral stimulus e g a bell over several learning trials the neutral stimulus by itself can come to elicit the response the biologically potent stimulus elicits
ivan pavlov known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously linked with food became a leading figure in the soviet union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans
in the united states edward lee thorndike initiated connectionist studies by trapping animals in puzzle boxes and rewarding them for escaping
thorndike wrote in there can be no moral warrant for studying man s nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts from to the american psychological association went through a sea change of opinion away from mentalism and towards behavioralism in john b
watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought
watson s famous little albert experiment in was at first thought to demonstrate that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill phobias aversions to other stimuli in an infant human although such a conclusion was likely an exaggeration
karl lashley a close collaborator with watson examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain
clark l
hull edwin guthrie and others did much to help behaviorism become a widely used paradigm
a new method of instrumental or operant conditioning added the concepts of reinforcement and punishment to the model of behavior change
radical behaviorists avoided discussing the inner workings of the mind especially the unconscious mind which they considered impossible to assess scientifically
operant conditioning was first described by miller and kanorski and popularized in the u s
by b f
skinner who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist movement
noam chomsky published an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that behaviorist principles could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition and language use
the review which was scathing did much to reduce the status of behaviorism within psychology
martin seligman and his colleagues discovered that they could condition in dogs a state of learned helplessness which was not predicted by the behaviorist approach to psychology
edward c
tolman advanced a hybrid cognitive behavioral model most notably with his publication discussing the cognitive maps used by rats to guess at the location of food at the end of a maze
skinner s behaviorism did not die in part because it generated successful practical applications
the association for behavior analysis international was founded in and by had members from countries
the field has gained a foothold in latin america and japan
applied behavior analysis is the term used for the application of the principles of operant conditioning to change socially significant behavior it supersedes the term behavior modification
cognitive psychology involves the study of mental processes including perception attention language comprehension and production memory and problem solving
researchers in the field of cognitive psychology are sometimes called cognitivists
they rely on an information processing model of mental functioning
cognitivist research is informed by functionalism and experimental psychology
starting in the s the experimental techniques developed by wundt james ebbinghaus and others re emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist and eventually constituted a part of the wider interdisciplinary cognitive science
some called this development the cognitive revolution because it rejected the anti mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis
albert bandura helped along the transition in psychology from behaviorism to cognitive psychology
bandura and other social learning theorists advanced the idea of vicarious learning
in other words they advanced the view that a child can learn by observing his or her social environment and not necessarily from having been reinforced for enacting a behavior although they did not rule out the influence of reinforcement on learning a behavior
technological advances also renewed interest in mental states and mental representations
english neuroscientist charles sherrington and canadian psychologist donald o
hebb used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena to the structure and function of the brain
the rise of computer science cybernetics and artificial intelligence underlined the value of comparing information processing in humans and machines
a popular and representative topic in this area is cognitive bias or irrational thought
psychologists and economists have classified and described a sizeable catalogue of biases which recur frequently in human thought
the availability heuristic for example is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind
elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form cognitive behavioral therapy a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by american psychologist albert ellis and american psychiatrist aaron t
on a broader level cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving cognitive psychologists cognitive neuroscientists linguists and researchers in artificial intelligence human computer interaction and computational neuroscience
the discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as philosophy of mind computer science and neuroscience
computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest
social psychology is concerned with how behaviors thoughts feelings and the social environment influence human interactions
social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual s behavior e g
conformity persuasion and the formation of beliefs attitudes and stereotypes about other people
social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology for the purpose of understanding how people process remember or distort social information
the study of group dynamics involves research on the nature of leadership organizational communication and related phenomena
in recent years social psychologists have become interested in implicit measures mediational models and the interaction of person and social factors in accounting for behavior
some concepts that sociologists have applied to the study of psychiatric disorders concepts such as the social role sick role social class life events culture migration and total institution have influenced social psychologists
psychoanalysis refers to the theories and therapeutic techniques applied to the unconscious mind and its impact on everyday life
these theories and techniques inform treatments for mental disorders
psychoanalysis originated in the s most prominently with the work of sigmund freud
freud s psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods introspection and clinical observation
it became very well known largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality repression and the unconscious
freud pioneered the methods of free association and dream interpretation
psychoanalytic theory is not monolithic
other well known psychoanalytic thinkers who diverged from freud include alfred adler carl jung erik erikson melanie klein d w
winnicott karen horney erich fromm john bowlby freud s daughter anna freud and harry stack sullivan
these individuals ensured that psychoanalysis would evolve into diverse schools of thought
among these schools are ego psychology object relations and interpersonal lacanian and relational psychoanalysis
psychologists such as hans eysenck and philosophers including karl popper sharply criticized psychoanalysis
popper argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline whereas eysenck advanced the view that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data
by the end of the th century psychology departments in american universities mostly had marginalized freudian theory dismissing it as a desiccated and dead historical artifact
researchers such as ant nio dam sio oliver sacks and joseph ledoux and individuals in the emerging field of neuro psychoanalysis have defended some of freud s ideas on scientific grounds
humanistic psychology which has been influenced by existentialism and phenomenology stresses free will and self actualization
it emerged in the s as a movement within academic psychology in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis
the humanistic approach seeks to view the whole person not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions
humanistic psychology also focuses on personal growth self identity death aloneness and freedom
it emphasizes subjective meaning the rejection of determinism and concern for positive growth rather than pathology
some founders of the humanistic school of thought were american psychologists abraham maslow who formulated a hierarchy of human needs and carl rogers who created and developed client centered therapy
later positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific study
positive psychology is the study of factors which contribute to human happiness and well being focusing more on people who are currently healthy
in clinical psychological review published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions such as gratitude journaling and the physical expression of gratitude
it is however far from clear that positive psychology is effective in making people happier
positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope but their effects are thought to be somewhat better than placebo effects
the evidence however is far from clear that interventions based on positive psychology increase human happiness or resilience
the american association for humanistic psychology formed in declared
existential psychology emphasizes the need to understand a client s total orientation towards the world
existential psychology is opposed to reductionism behaviorism and other methods that objectify the individual
in the s and s influenced by philosophers s ren kierkegaard and martin heidegger psychoanalytically trained american psychologist rollo may helped to develop existential psychology
existential psychotherapy which follows from existential psychology is a therapeutic approach that is based on the idea that a person s inner conflict arises from that individual s confrontation with the givens of existence
swiss psychoanalyst ludwig binswanger and american psychologist george kelly may also be said to belong to the existential school
existential psychologists tend to differ from more humanistic psychologists in the former s relatively neutral view of human nature and relatively positive assessment of anxiety
existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death free will and meaning suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths and narratives meaning can be deepened by the acceptance of free will which is requisite to living an authentic life albeit often with anxiety with regard to death
austrian existential psychiatrist and holocaust survivor viktor frankl drew evidence of meaning s therapeutic power from reflections upon his own internment
he created a variation of existential psychotherapy called logotherapy a type of existentialist analysis that focuses on a will to meaning in one s life as opposed to adler s nietzschean doctrine of will to power or freud s will to pleasure
personality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior thought and emotion
theories of personality vary across different psychological schools of thought
each theory carries different assumptions about such features as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience
according to freud personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id ego and super ego
by contrast trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits
trait theorists have often employed statistical data reduction methods such as factor analysis
although the number of proposed traits has varied widely hans eysenck s early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality extraversion introversion neuroticism stability and psychoticism normality
raymond cattell empirically derived a theory of personality factors at the primary factor level and up to eight broader second stratum factors
since the s the big five openness to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism emerged as an important trait theory of personality
dimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the dsm v
however despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the big five personality dimensions it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan
an early example of personality assessment was the woodworth personal data sheet constructed during world war i
the popular although psychometrically inadequate myers briggs type indicator was developed to assess individuals personality types according to the personality theories of carl jung
the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi despite its name is more a dimensional measure of psychopathology than a personality measure
california psychological inventory contains personality scales e g independence tolerance
the international personality item pool which is in the public domain has become a source of scales that can be used personality assessment
study of the unconscious mind a part of the psyche outside the individual s awareness but that is believed to influence conscious thought and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology
in one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the united states c s
peirce and joseph jastrow found in that research subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference
freud popularized the concept of the unconscious mind particularly when he referred to an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one s speech a freudian slip or to his efforts to interpret dreams
his book the psychopathology of everyday life catalogues hundreds of everyday events that freud explains in terms of unconscious influence
pierre janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the direct scrutiny of the subject
the concept of unconscious processes has remained important in psychology
cognitive psychologists have used a filter model of attention
according to the model much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness and only certain stimuli limited by their nature and number make their way through the filter
much research has shown that subconscious priming of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior
because of the unreliability of self reporting a major hurdle in this type of research involves demonstrating that a subject s conscious mind has not perceived a target stimulus
for this reason some psychologists prefer to distinguish between implicit and explicit memory
in another approach one can also describe a subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not a subjective threshold
the automaticity model of john bargh and others involves the ideas of automaticity and unconscious processing in our understanding of social behavior although there has been dispute with regard to replication
some experimental data suggest that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind becomes aware of them
the influence of unconscious forces on people s choices bears on the philosophical question of free will
john bargh daniel wegner and ellen langer describe free will as an illusion
some psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular time
it also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior
psychologists such as william james initially used the term motivation to refer to intention in a sense similar to the concept of will in european philosophy
with the steady rise of darwinian and freudian thinking instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation
according to drive theory the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence
psychoanalysis like biology regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system
psychoanalysts believed that these forces especially the sexual instincts could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche
classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle roughly corresponding to id and ego
later in beyond the pleasure principle freud introduced the concept of the death drive a compulsion towards aggression destruction and psychic repetition of traumatic events
meanwhile behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models pleasure pain reward punishment and well established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking
clark hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model
hunger thirst fear sexual desire and thermoregulation constitute fundamental motivations in animals
humans seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from desires for belonging positive self image self consistency truth love and control
motivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways
researchers have found that eating for example depends not only on the organism s fundamental need for homeostasis an important factor causing the experience of hunger but also on circadian rhythms food availability food palatability and cost
abstract motivations are also malleable as evidenced by such phenomena as goal contagion the adoption of goals sometimes unconsciously based on inferences about the goals of others
vohs and baumeister suggest that contrary to the need desire fulfilment cycle of animal instincts human motivations sometimes obey a getting begets wanting rule the more you get a reward such as self esteem love drugs or money the more you want it
they suggest that this principle can even apply to food drink sex and sleep
developmental psychology refers to the scientific study of how and why the thought processes emotions and behaviors of humans change over the course of their lives
some credit charles darwin with conducting the first systematic study within the rubric of developmental psychology having published in a short paper detailing the development of innate forms of communication based on his observations of his infant son
the main origins of the discipline however are found in the work of jean piaget
like piaget developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on the development of cognition from infancy to adolescence
later developmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition over the life span
in addition to studying cognition developmental psychologists have also come to focus on affective behavioral moral social and neural development
developmental psychologists who study children use a number of research methods
for example they make observations of children in natural settings such as preschools and engage them in experimental tasks
such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful
developmental researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants
in addition to studying children developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span including old age
these psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research
all researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment to varying degrees
these two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals and families
an example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring
a theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring by virtue of his or her having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother is at risk for developing depression
on the other hand a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother
genes and environment in these simple transmission models are completely confounded
a depressed mother may both carry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that increases the risk of depression in her child
behavioral genetics researchers have employed methodologies that help to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior
traditionally the research has involved twin studies and adoption studies two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un confounded
more recently gene focused research has contributed to understanding genetic contributions to the development of psychological traits
the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant dna variation directly and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome wide association studies
one goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in huntington s once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype
one major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology as well as complex medical diseases are highly polygenic where a large number on the order of hundreds to thousands of genetic variants each of small effect contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder
active research continues to work toward understanding the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction
psychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior
psychological testing has ancient origins dating as far back as bc in the examinations for the chinese civil service
written exams began during the han dynasty bc ad
by the chinese system required a stratified series of tests involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics
the system was ended in
in europe mental assessment took a different approach with theories of physiognomy judgment of character based on the face described by aristotle in th century bc greece
physiognomy remained current through the enlightenment and added the doctrine of phrenology a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy
when experimental psychology came to britain francis galton was a leading practitioner
by virtue of his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation he is considered an inventor of modern mental testing also known as psychometrics
james mckeen cattell a student of wundt and galton brought the idea of psychological testing to the united states and in fact coined the term mental test
in cattell s student clark wissler published discouraging results suggesting that mental testing of columbia and barnard students failed to predict academic performance
in response to orders from the minister of public instruction french psychologists alfred binet and th odore simon developed and elaborated a new test of intelligence in
they used a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty
binet and simon introduced the concept of mental age and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiots
henry h
goddard put the binet simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as imbecile and feebleminded
in after binet s death stanford professor lewis m
terman modified the binet simon scale renamed the stanford binet scale and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report
based on his test findings and reflecting the racism common to that era terman concluded that intellectual disability represents the level of intelligence which is very very common among spanish indians and mexican families of the southwest and also among negroes
their dullness seems to be racial
following the army alpha and army beta tests which was developed by psychologist robert yerkes in and then used in world war by industrial and organizational psychologists for large scale employee testing and selection of military personnel
mental testing also became popular in the u s where it was applied to schoolchildren
the federally created national intelligence test was administered to million children in the s
in the college entrance examination board created the scholastic aptitude test to standardize college admissions
the results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions including the preferential training of black americans for manual labor
these practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a horace mann bond and allison davis
eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded now referred to as intellectual disability
in the united states tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized
setting a precedent that has never been overturned the u s
supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the case buck v
today mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in western societies
modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure consistency of results output of an interpretable score statistical norms describing population outcomes and ideally effective prediction of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations
developments in psychometrics include work on test and scale reliability and validity
developments in item response theory structural equation modeling and bifactor analysis have helped in strengthening test and scale construction
the provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the u s
sometimes however members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologists
clinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology
in canada some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology
in canada and the u s practitioners get bachelor s degrees and doctorates doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship
in mexico and most other latin american and european countries psychologists do not get bachelor s and doctoral degrees instead they take a three year professional course following high school
clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology
it includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding preventing and relieving psychological distress dysfunction and or mental illness
clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well being and personal growth
central to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research teaching consultation forensic testimony and program development and administration
credit for the first psychology clinic in the united states typically goes to lightner witmer who established his practice in philadelphia in
another modern psychotherapist was morton prince an early advocate for the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline
in the first part of the twentieth century most mental health care in the united states was performed by psychiatrists who are medical doctors
psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing which promised to improve the diagnosis of mental problems
for their part some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill
psychotherapy as conducted by psychiatrists blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology and this trend continued with the rise of community mental health facilities
some in the clinical psychology community adopted behavioral therapy a thoroughly non psychodynamic model that used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients
a key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment s effectiveness
in the s cognitive behavior therapy emerged with the work of albert ellis and aaron beck
although there are similarities between behavior therapy and cognitive behavior therapy cognitive behavior therapy required the application of cognitive constructs
since the s the popularity of cognitive behavior therapy among clinical psychologists increased
a key practice in behavioral and cognitive behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear based on the premise that their responses fear panic anxiety can be deconditioned
mental health care today involves psychologists and social workers in increasing numbers
in national institute of mental health director bertram brown described this shift as a source of intense competition and role confusion graduate programs issuing doctorates in clinical psychology emerged in the s and underwent rapid increase through the s
the phd degree is intended to train practitioners who could also conduct scientific research
the psyd degree is more exclusively designed to train practitioners
some clinical psychologists focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury
this subspecialty is known as clinical neuropsychology
in many countries clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession
the emerging field of disaster psychology see crisis intervention involves professionals who respond to large scale traumatic events
the work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client usually an individual couple family or small group
typically these approaches encourage new ways of thinking feeling or behaving
four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic cognitive behavioral existential humanistic and systems or family therapy
there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture gender spirituality and sexual orientation
with the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance
because of this more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation
diagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm
the study of mental illnesses is called abnormal psychology
educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings the effectiveness of educational interventions the psychology of teaching and the social psychology of schools as organizations
educational psychologists can be found in preschools schools of all levels including post secondary institutions community organizations and learning centers government or private research firms and independent or private consultant madisonodell sandbox
the work of developmental psychologists such as lev vygotsky jean piaget and jerome bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices
educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as north america australia and new zealand
school psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities to foster the intellectual growth of gifted students to facilitate prosocial behaviors in adolescents and otherwise to promote safe supportive and effective learning environments
school psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment intervention prevention and consultation and many have extensive training in research
industrial and organizational i o psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals work lives
in the field s beginnings industrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency
the field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology later industrial psychology employment psychology or psychotechnology
an influential early study examined workers at western electric s hawthorne plant in cicero illinois from to
western electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in illumination breaks food and wages
the researchers came to focus on workers responses to observation itself and the term hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they re being watched
although the hawthorne research can be found in psychology textbooks the research and its findings however were weak at best
the name industrial and organizational psychology emerged in the s
in it became enshrined in the name of the society for industrial and organizational psychology division of the american psychological association
one goal of the discipline is to optimize human potential in the workplace
personnel psychology is a subfield of i o psychology
personnel psychologists apply the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers
another subfield organizational psychology examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation job satisfaction and productivity
most i o psychologists work outside of academia for private and public organizations and as consultants
a psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about their industry their target markets and the organization of their company
organizational behavior ob is an allied field involved in the study of human behavior within organizations
one way to differentiate i o psychology from ob is to note that i o psychologists train in university psychology departments and ob specialists in business schools
one role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel
in the u s this function began during world war i when robert yerkes established the school of military psychology at fort oglethorpe in georgia
the school provided psychological training for military staff
today u s
army psychologists perform psychological screening clinical psychotherapy suicide prevention and treatment for post traumatic stress as well as provide prevention related services for example smoking cessation
the united states army s mental health advisory teams implement psychological interventions to help combat troops experiencing mental problems
psychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfare
psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians
this so called black propaganda is designed to seem as if it originates from a source other than the army
the cia s mkultra program involved more individualized efforts at mind control involving techniques such as hypnosis torture and covert involuntary administration of lsd
the u s
military used the name psychological operations psyop until when these activities were reclassified as military information support operations miso part of information operations io
psychologists have sometimes been involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects staining the records of the psychologists involved
an example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of kenneth and mamie phipps clark
these two african american psychologists studied segregation s adverse psychological impact on black children
their research findings played a role in the desegregation case brown v
board of education
the impact of psychology on social change includes the discipline s broad influence on teaching and learning
research has shown that compared to the whole word or whole language approach the phonics approach to reading instruction is more efficacious
medical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles
one aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen
health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance
psychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior
these range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies
psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people
psychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health and well being of employees
some work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific problems whereas others are full time employees of the organization
applications include conducting surveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthier
some of the specific health areas include
accidents and injuries a major contribution is the concept of safety climate which is employee shared perceptions of the behaviors that are encouraged e g wearing safety gear and discouraged not following safety rules at work
organizations with strong safety climates have fewer work accidents and injuries
cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease has been related to lack of job control
mental health exposure to occupational stress is associated with mental health disorder
musculoskeletal disorder these are injuries in bones nerves and tendons due to overexertion and repetitive strain
they have been linked to job satisfaction and workplace stress
physical health symptoms occupational stress has been linked to physical symptoms such as digestive distress and headache
workplace violence violence prevention climate is related to being physically assaulted and psychologically mistreated at work interventions that improve climates are a way to address accidents and violence
interventions that reduce stress at work or provide employees with tools to better manage it can help in areas where stress is an important component
industrial psychology became interested in worker fatigue during world war i when government ministers in britain were concerned about the impact of fatigue on workers in munitions factories but not other types of factories
in the u
some interest in worker well being emerged with the efforts of charles samuel myers and his national institute of industrial psychology niip during the inter war years
in the u
during the mid twentieth century industrial psychologist arthur kornhauser pioneered the study of occupational mental health linking industrial working conditions to mental health as well as the spillover of an unsatisfying job into a worker s personal life
zickar accumulated evidence to show that no other industrial psychologist of his era was as devoted to advocating management and labor practices that would improve the lives of working people
as interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century the field of occupational health psychology ohp emerged
ohp is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary
ohp is concerned with the health and safety of workers
ohp addresses topic areas such as the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health mistreatment of workers e g bullying and violence work family balance the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health the influence of psychosocial factors on safety and accidents and interventions designed to improve protect worker health
ohp grew out of health psychology industrial and organizational psychology and occupational medicine
ohp has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology including industrial engineering sociology and economics
quantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses
although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings such research can only assess a limited range of short term phenomena
some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled but more ecologically valid field experiments as well
other research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data
the statistical methods research psychologists employ include the pearson product moment correlation coefficient the analysis of variance multiple linear regression logistic regression structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling
the measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs
although this type of psychological research is much less abundant than quantitative research some psychologists conduct qualitative research
this type of research can involve interviews questionnaires and first hand observation
while hypothesis testing is rare virtually impossible in qualitative research qualitative studies can be helpful in theory and hypothesis generation interpreting seemingly contradictory quantitative findings and understanding why some interventions fail and others succeed
a true experiment with random assignment of research participants sometimes called subjects to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships
when there are large numbers of research participants the random assignment also called random allocation of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will on average be similar on most characteristics including characteristics that went unmeasured
in an experiment the researcher alters one or more variables of influence called independent variables and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest called dependent variables
prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment
a quasi experiment refers to a situation in which there are rival conditions under study but random assignment to the different conditions is not possible
investigators must work with preexisting groups of people
researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study s validity
for example in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments
psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes and perhaps statistically adjust for any initial differences in reading level
experimental researchers typically use a statistical hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment then assessing how well the data collected are consistent with the predictions
these predictions are likely to originate from one or more abstract scientific hypotheses about how the phenomenon under study actually works
surveys are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring attitudes and traits monitoring changes in mood and checking the validity of experimental manipulations checking research participants perception of the condition they were assigned to
psychologists have commonly used paper and pencil surveys
however surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e mail
web based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects
observational studies are commonly conducted in psychology
in cross sectional observational studies psychologists collect data at a single point in time
the goal of many cross sectional studies is the assess the extent factors are correlated with each other
by contrast in longitudinal studies psychologists collect data on the same sample at two or more points in time
sometimes the purpose of longitudinal research is to study trends across time such as the stability of traits or age related changes in behavior
because some studies involve endpoints that psychologists cannot ethically study from an experimental standpoint such as identifying the causes of depression they conduct longitudinal studies a large group of depression free people periodically assessing what is happening in the individuals lives
in this way psychologists have an opportunity to test causal hypotheses regarding conditions that commonly arise in people s lives that put them at risk for depression
problems that affect longitudinal studies include selective attrition the type of problem in which bias is introduced when a certain type of research participant disproportionately leaves a study
exploratory data analysis refers to a variety of practices that researchers use to reduce a great many variables to a small number overarching factors
in peirce s three modes of inference exploratory data analysis corresponds to abduction
meta analysis is the technique research psychologists use to integrate results from many studies of the same variables and arriving at a grand average of the findings
a classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram eeg a technique using amplified electrodes on a person s scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain
hans berger the first researcher to use eeg on an unopened skull quickly found that brains exhibit signature brain waves electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness
researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during non rem sleep
newer functional neuroimaging techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography both of which track the flow of blood through the brain
these technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal
they also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self reporting
it remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality
however neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain
some of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than a localized function model
interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and drugs also provide information about brain mind interactions
psychopharmacology is the study of drug induced mental effects
computational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior
this method has several advantages
since modern computers process information quickly simulations can be run in a short time allowing for high statistical power
modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn t be directly observed in a human
computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain
another method is symbolic modeling which represents many mental objects using variables and rules
other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling
animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology including perception emotion learning memory and thought to name a few
in the s russian physiologist ivan pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning
non human primates cats dogs pigeons and rats and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments
ideally controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables
these conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings
in contrast human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely and depend upon so many factors that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects
there are pitfalls however in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models
comparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non human animals especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history adaptive significance and development of behavior
research in this area explores the behavior of many species from insects to primates
it is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology
research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial for example the sociobiology of e o
wilson
animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior e g
in cognitive neuroscience
qualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts feelings and behaviors of individuals
qualitative research involving first hand observation can help describe events as they occur with the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are made
qualitative psychological research methods include interviews first hand observation and participant observation
creswell identified five main possibilities for qualitative research including narrative phenomenology ethnography case study and grounded theory
qualitative researchers sometimes aim to enrich our understanding of symbols subjective experiences or social structures
sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research as in erich fromm s application of psychological and sociological theories in his book escape from freedom to understanding why many ordinary germans supported hitler
just as jane goodall studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social professional and family life
sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed and other times the participants do not know they are being observed
strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out
program evaluation involves the systematic collection analysis and application of information to answer questions about projects policies and programs particularly about their effectiveness
in both the public and private sectors stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding implementing voting for receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effects
while program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant how the program could be improved whether the program is worthwhile whether there are better alternatives if there are unintended outcomes and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful
metascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself
the field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research
some psychological research has suffered from bias problematic reproducibility and misuse of statistics
these findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community
in statistician theodore sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that of them supported their initial hypotheses implying possible publication bias
similarly fanelli found that of psychiatry psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for and concluded that the odds of this happening a positive result was around five times higher than in fields such as space science or geosciences
fanelli argued that this is because researchers in softer sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases
a replication crisis in psychology has emerged
many notable findings in the field have not been replicated
some researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent results
systematic efforts including efforts by the reproducibility project of the center for open science to assess the extent of the problem found that as many as two thirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be replicated
reproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology in studies and journals than social psychology and subfields of differential psychology
other subfields of psychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis including clinical psychology developmental psychology and a field closely related to psychology educational research
focus on the replication crisis has led to other renewed efforts in the discipline to re test important findings
in response to concerns about publication bias and data dredging conducting a large number of statistical tests on a great many variables but restricting reporting to the results that were statistically significant psychology and medical journals have adopted result blind peer review where studies are accepted not on the basis of their findings and after the studies are completed but before the studies are conducted and upon the basis of the methodological rigor of their experimental designs and the theoretical justifications for their proposed statistical analysis before data collection or analysis is conducted
in addition large scale collaborations among researchers working in multiple labs in different countries have taken place
the collaborators regularly make their data openly available for different researchers to assess
allen and mehler estimated that percent of result blind studies have yielded null results in contrast to an estimated to percent in traditional research
some critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced
psychologist and statistician jacob cohen wrote in that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts
some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics rather than sole reliance on p values
in arnett pointed out that most articles in american psychological association journals were about u s
populations when u s
citizens are only of the world s population
he complained that psychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research findings to the rest of the global population
in henrich heine and norenzayan reported a bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from weird western educated industrialized rich and democratic societies
henrich et al
found that of psychological samples come from countries with only of the world s population p
the article gave examples of results that differ significantly between people from weird and tribal cultures including the m ller lyer illusion
arnett altmaier and hall and morgan consoli et al
view the western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in weird regions in their research clinical work and consultation with populations around the world
in rad martingano and ginges showed that nearly a decade after henrich et al s paper over of the samples used in studies published in the journal psychological science employed weird samples
moreover their analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose the origin of their samples the authors offered a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to reduce weird bias
some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application in particular the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices
critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence
practices such as facilitated communication for infantile autism memory recovery techniques including body work and other therapies such as rebirthing and reparenting may be dubious or even dangerous despite their popularity
these practices however are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology doctoral programs
ethical standards in the discipline have changed over time
some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes the canadian code of conduct for research involving humans and the belmont report
the american psychological association has advanced a set of ethical principles and a code of conduct for the profession
the most important contemporary standards include informed and voluntary consent
after world war ii the nuremberg code was established because of nazi abuses of experimental subjects
later most countries and scientific journals adopted the declaration of helsinki
in the u s the national institutes of health established the institutional review board in and in adopted the national research act hr
all of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies
a number of influential but ethically dubious studies led to the establishment of this rule such studies included the mit harvard fernald school radioisotope studies the thalidomide tragedy the willowbrook hepatitis study and stanley milgram s studies of obedience to authority
universities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights e g voluntary nature of participation in the research privacy and well being e g minimizing distress of research participants
university ethics committees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and well being of participants an investigator s research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics committee
the ethics code of the american psychological association originated in as ethical standards of psychologists
this code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most american states
it has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption
in the apa revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the federal trade commission
the incarnation was the first to distinguish between aspirational ethical standards and enforceable ones
members of the public have a five year window to file ethics complaints about apa members with the apa ethics committee members of the apa have a three year window
some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence to maintain confidentiality with the patients and to avoid sexual relations with them
another important principle is informed consent the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing
some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct
research on other animals is also governed by university ethics committees
research on nonhuman animals cannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee of the researcher s home institution
current ethical guidelines state that using non human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm physical or psychological done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research
keeping this in mind psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans
comparative psychologist harry harlow drew moral condemnation for isolation experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the university of wisconsin madison in the s
the aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression
harlow also devised what he called a rape rack to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture
in american literary critic wayne c
booth wrote that harry harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade invariably proving what we all knew in advance that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties he writes that harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work badcock christopher r
