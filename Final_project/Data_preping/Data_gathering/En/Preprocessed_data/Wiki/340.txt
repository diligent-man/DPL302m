psychologist compare achievement child attending phonics whole language class perhaps statistically adjust initial difference reading level
experimental researcher typically use statistical hypothesis testing model involves making prediction conducting experiment assessing well data collected consistent predictions
prediction likely originate one abstract scientific hypothesis phenomenon study actually works
survey used psychology purpose measuring attitude trait monitoring change mood checking validity experimental manipulation checking research participants' perception condition assigned to
web-based survey increasingly used conveniently reach many subjects
cross-sectional observational study psychologist collect data single point time
goal many cross-sectional study ass extent factor correlated other
contrast longitudinal study psychologist collect data sample two point time
sometimes purpose longitudinal research study trend across time stability trait age-related change behavior
study involve endpoint psychologist cannot ethically study experimental standpoint identifying cause depression conduct longitudinal study large group depression-free people periodically assessing happening individuals' lives
way psychologist opportunity test causal hypothesis regarding condition commonly arise people's life put risk depression
problem affect longitudinal study include selective attrition type problem bias introduced certain type research participant disproportionately leaf study
exploratory data analysis refers variety practice researcher use reduce great many variable small number overarching factors
peirce's three mode inference exploratory data analysis corresponds abduction
meta-analysis technique research psychologist use integrate result many study variable arriving grand average findings
classic popular tool used relate mental neural activity electroencephalogram eeg technique using amplified electrode person's scalp measure voltage change different part brain
han berger first researcher use eeg unopened skull quickly found brain exhibit signature brain wave electric oscillation correspond different state consciousness
researcher subsequently refined statistical method synthesizing electrode data identified unique brain wave pattern delta wave observed non-rem sleep
newer functional neuroimaging technique include functional magnetic resonance imaging positron emission tomography track flow blood brain
technology provide localized information activity brain create representation brain widespread appeal
also provide insight avoids classic problem subjective self-reporting
remains challenging draw hard conclusion brain specific thought originateor even usefully localization corresponds reality
however neuroimaging ha delivered unmistakable result showing existence correlation mind brain
draw systemic neural network model rather localized function model
intervention transcranial magnetic stimulation drug also provide information brain-mind interactions
computational modeling tool used mathematical psychology cognitive psychology simulate behavior
since modern computer process information quickly simulation run short time allowing high statistical power
modeling also allows psychologist visualize hypothesis functional organization mental event directly observed human
another method symbolic modeling represents many mental object using variable rules
animal experiment aid investigating many aspect human psychology including perception emotion learning memory thought name few
russian physiologist ivan pavlov famously used dog demonstrate classical conditioning
non-human primate cat dog pigeon rat rodent often used psychological experiments
ideally controlled experiment introduce one independent variable time order ascertain unique effect upon dependent variables
contrast human environment genetic background vary widely depend upon many factor difficult control important variable human subjects
pitfall however generalizing finding animal study human animal models
comparative psychology refers scientific study behavior mental process non-human animal especially relate phylogenetic history adaptive significance development behavior
research area explores behavior many specie insect primates
research comparative psychology sometimes appears shed light human behavior attempt connect two quite controversial example sociobiology eo
animal model often used study neural process related human behavior eg
qualitative research often designed answer question thought feeling behavior individuals
qualitative research involving first-hand observation help describe event occur goal capturing richness everyday behavior hope discovering understanding phenomenon might missed cursory examination made
qualitative psychological research method include interview first-hand observation participant observation
creswell identified five main possibility qualitative research including narrative phenomenology ethnography case study grounded theory
qualitative researcher sometimes aim enrich understanding symbol subjective experience social structures
sometimes hermeneutic critical aim give rise quantitative research erich fromm's application psychological sociological theory book escape freedom understanding many ordinary german supported hitler
jane goodall studied chimpanzee social family life careful observation chimpanzee behavior field psychologist conduct naturalistic observation ongoing human social professional family life
sometimes participant aware observed time participant know observed
strict ethical guideline must followed covert observation carried out
program evaluation involves systematic collection analysis application information answer question project policy program particularly effectiveness
public private sector stakeholder often want know extent program funding implementing voting receiving objecting producing intended effects
program evaluation first focus effectiveness important consideration often include much program cost per participant program could improved whether program worthwhile whether better alternative unintended outcome whether program goal appropriate useful
metascience involves application scientific methodology study science itself
psychological research ha suffered bias problematic reproducibility misuse statistics
finding led call reform within outside scientific community
statistician theodore sterling examined result psychological study discovered supported initial hypothesis implying possible publication bias
similarly fanelli found psychiatrypsychology study confirmed effect looking concluded odds happening positive result wa around five time higher field space science geosciences
fanelli argued researcher softer science fewer constraint conscious unconscious biases
systematic effort including effort reproducibility project center open science ass extent problem found many two-thirds highly publicized finding psychology failed replicated
reproducibility ha generally stronger cognitive psychology study journal social psychology subfields differential psychology
subfields psychology also implicated replication crisis including clinical psychology developmental psychology field closely related psychology educational research
focus replication crisis ha led renewed effort discipline re-test important findings
response concern publication bias data dredging conducting large number statistical test great many variable restricting reporting result statistically significant psychology medical journal adopted result-blind peer review study accepted basis finding study completed study conducted upon basis methodological rigor experimental design
addition large-scale collaboration among researcher working multiple lab different country taken place
collaborator regularly make data openly available different researcher assess
allen mehler estimated percent result-blind study yielded null result contrast estimated percent traditional research
psychologist statistician jacob cohen wrote psychologist routinely confuse statistical significance practical importance enthusiastically reporting great certainty unimportant facts
psychologist responded increased use effect size statistic rather sole reliance p-values
