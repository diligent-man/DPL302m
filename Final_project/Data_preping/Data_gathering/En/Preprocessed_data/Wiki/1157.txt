the motivations which draw today s visitors to christian sacred sites can be mixed faith based spiritual in a general way with cultural interests etc
this diversity has become an important factor in the management and pastoral care of christian pilgrimage as recent research on international sanctuaries and much visited churches has shown
rome has been a major christian pilgrimage site since the middle ages
pilgrimages to rome can involve visits to a large number of sites both within the vatican city and in italian territory
a popular stopping point is the pilate s stairs these are according to the christian tradition the steps that led up to the praetorium of pontius pilate in jerusalem which jesus christ stood on during his passion on his way to trial
the stairs were reputedly brought to rome by st
helena in the th century
for centuries the scala santa has attracted christian pilgrims who wished to honour the passion of jesus
several catacombs built in the roman age are also the object of pilgrimage where christians prayed buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution

after the murder of the archbishop thomas becket at the cathedral in canterbury became one of the most notable towns in europe as pilgrims from all parts of christendom came to visit his shrine
this pilgrimage provided the framework for geoffrey chaucer s th century collection of stories the canterbury tales

thomas becket s shrine in the cathedral was demolished and all the gold silver and jewels were removed to the tower of london and becket s images name and feasts were obliterated throughout the kingdom ending the pilgrimages
the first pilgrimages were made to sites connected with jesus

pilgrimage to rome became a common destination for pilgrims from throughout western christianity in the medieval period and important sites were listed in travel guides such as the th century mirabilia urbis romae
in the th century the holy land fell to the muslim conquests and as pilgrimage to the holy land now became more difficult for european christians major pilgrimage sites developed in western europe notably santiago de compostela in the th century though travelers such as bernard the pilgrim continued to make the journey to the holy land
political relationships between the muslim caliphates and the christian kingdoms of europe remained in a state of suspended truce allowing the continuation of christian pilgrimages into muslim controlled lands at least in intervals for example the fatimid caliph al hakim bi amr allah ordered the destruction of the church of the holy sepulchre only to have his successor allow the byzantine empire to rebuild it
the seljuk turks systematically disrupted christian pilgrimage routes which became one of the major factors
triggering the crusades later in the th century
the crusades were at first a success the crusader states especially the kingdom of jerusalem guaranteeing safe access to the holy land for christian pilgrims during the th century but palestine was re conquered by the muslim ayyubids by the end of the th century
under the ottoman empire travel in palestine was once again restricted and dangerous
modern pilgrimages in the holy land may be said to have received an early impetus from the scholar ernest renan whose twenty four days in palestine recounted in his vie de j sus published found the resonance of the new testament at every turn
according to believers the blessed virgin mary appeared to saint bernadette soubirous on a total of eighteen occasions at lourdes lorda in her local occitan language

at some point between and during the reign of alfonso ii of asturias bishop theodemar of iria d
claimed to have found some remains which were attributed to saint james the greater
around the place of the discovery a new settlement and centre of pilgrimage emerged which was known to the author usuard in and by the th century was called compostella
the cult of saint james of compostela was just one of many arising throughout northern iberia during the th and th centuries as rulers encouraged their own region specific cults such as saint eulalia in oviedo and saint aemilian in castile
after the centre of asturian political power moved from oviedo to le n in compostela became more politically relevant and several kings of galicia and of le n were acclaimed by the galician noblemen and crowned and anointed by the local bishop at the cathedral among them ordo o iv in bermudo ii in and alfonso vii in by which time compostela had become capital of the kingdom of galicia
later th century kings were also sepulchered in the cathedral namely fernando ii and alfonso ix last of the kings of le n and galicia before both kingdoms were united with the kingdom of castile
according to some authors by the middle years of the th century the site had already become a pan european place of peregrination while others maintain that the cult to saint james was before th centuries an essentially galician affair supported by asturian and leonese kings to win over faltering galician loyalties
santiago would become in the course of the following century a main catholic shrine second only to rome and jerusalem
in the th century under the impulse of bishop diego gelm rez compostela became an archbishopric attracting a large and multinational population
under the rule of this prelate the townspeople rebelled headed by the local council beginning a secular tradition of confrontation by the people of the city who fought for self government against the local bishop the secular and jurisdictional lord of the city and of its fief the semi independent terra de santiago land of saint james
the culminating moment in this confrontation was reached in the th century when the new prelate the frenchman b renger de landore treacherously executed the counselors of the city in his castle of a rocha forte the strong rock castle after inviting them for talks
