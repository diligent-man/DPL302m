pontus or pontos p nt s greek romanized p ntos sea is a region on the southern coast of the black sea located in the modern day eastern black sea region of turkey
the name was applied to the coastal region and its mountainous hinterland rising to the pontic alps in the east by the greeks who colonized the area in the archaic period and derived from the greek name of the black sea e xinos p ntos hospitable sea or simply pontos as early as the aeschylean persians bc and herodotus histories circa bc
having originally no specific name the region east of the river halys was spoken of as the country en p nt lit
on the euxinos pontos and hence it acquired the name of pontus which is first found in xenophon s anabasis c bc
the extent of the region varied through the ages but generally extended from the borders of colchis modern western georgia until well into paphlagonia in the west with varying amounts of hinterland
several states and provinces bearing the name of pontus or variants thereof were established in the region in the hellenistic roman and byzantine periods culminating in the late byzantine empire of trebizond
pontus is sometimes considered as the original home of the amazons in ancient greek mythology and historiography e
by herodotus and strabo
pontus remained outside the reach of the bronze age empires of which the closest was great hatti
the region went further uncontrolled by hatti s eastern neighbors hurrian states like azzi and or hayasa
in those days the best any outsider could hope from this region was temporary alliance with a local strongman
the hittites called the unorganized groups on their northeastern frontier the ka ka
as of little had been found of them archaeologically
in the wake of the hittite empire s collapse the assyrian court noted that the ka ku had overrun its territory in conjunction with a hitherto unknown group whom they labeled the mu ki
iron age visitors to the region mostly greek noted that the hinterlands remained disunited and they recorded the names of tribes moskhians often associated with those mu ki leucosyri mares makrones mossynoikoi tibarenoi tzans and chalybes or chaldoi
the armenian language went unnoted by the hittites the assyrians and all the post hittite nations an ancient theory first conjectured by herodotus is that its speakers migrated from phrygia past literary notice across pontus during the early iron age
the greeks who spoke a closely related indo european tongue followed them along the coast
the greeks are the earliest long term inhabitants of the region from whom written records survive
during the late th century bc pontus further became a base for the cimmerians another indo european speaking people however these were defeated by the lydians and became a distant memory after the campaigns of alyattes
since there was so little literacy in northeastern anatolia until the persian and hellenistic era one can only speculate as to the other languages spoken here
given that kartvelian languages remain spoken to the east of pontus some are suspected to have been spoken in eastern pontus during the iron age the tzans are usually associated with today s laz
the first travels of greek merchants and adventurers to the pontus region occurred probably from around bc whereas their settlements would become steady and solidified cities only by the th and th centuries bc as archaeological findings document
this fits in well with a foundation date of bc as reported by eusebius of caesarea for sinope perhaps the most ancient of the greek colonies in what was later to be called pontus
the epical narratives related to the travels of jason and the argonauts to colchis the tales of heracles navigating the black sea and odysseus wanderings into the land of the cimmerians as well as the myth of zeus constraining prometheus to the caucasus mountains as a punishment for his outwitting the gods can all be seen as reflections of early contacts between early greek colonists and the local probably caucasian peoples
the earliest known written description of pontus however is that of scylax of korianda who in the th century bc described greek settlements in the area
by the th century bc pontus had become officially a part of the achaemenid empire which probably meant that the local greek colonies were paying tribute to the persians
when the athenian commander xenophon passed through pontus around a century later in bc in fact he found no persians in pontus
the peoples of this part of northern asia minor were incorporated into the third and nineteenth satrapies of the persian empire
iranian influence ran deep illustrated most famously by the temple of the persian deities anaitis omanes and anadatos at zela founded by victorious persian generals in the th century bc
the kingdom of pontus extended generally to the east of the halys river
the persian dynasty which was to found this kingdom had during the th century bc ruled the greek city of cius or kios in mysia with its first known member being ariobarzanes i of cius and the last ruler based in the city being mithridates ii of cius
mithridates ii s son also called mithridates would proclaim himself later mithridates i ktistes of pontus
as the encyclopaedia iranica states the most famous member of the family mithradates vi eupator although undoubtedly presenting himself to the greek world as a civilized philhellene and new alexander also paraded his iranian background he maintained a harem and eunuchs in true oriental fashion he gave all his sons persian names he sacrificed spectacularly in the manner of the persian kings at pasargadae appian mith
and he appointed satraps a persian title as his provincial governors
iranica further states and although there is only one inscription attesting it he seems to have adopted the title king of kings the very small number of hellenistic greek inscriptions that have been found anywhere in pontus suggest that greek culture did not substantially penetrate beyond the coastal cities and the court
during the troubled period following the death of alexander the great mithridates ktistes was for a time in the service of antigonus one of alexander s successors and successfully maneuvering in this unsettled time managed shortly after bc to create the kingdom of pontus which would be ruled by his descendants mostly bearing the same name until bc
thus this persian dynasty managed to survive and prosper in the hellenistic world while the main persian empire had fallen
this kingdom reached its greatest height under mithridates vi or mithridates eupator commonly called the great who for many years carried on war with the romans
under him the realm of pontus included not only pontic cappadocia but also the seaboard from the bithynian frontier to colchis part of inland paphlagonia and lesser armenia
despite ruling lesser armenia king mithridates vi was an ally of armenian king tigranes the great to whom he married his daughter cleopatra
eventually however the romans defeated both king mithridates vi and his son in law armenian king tigranes the great during the mithridatic wars bringing pontus under roman rule
with the subjugation of this kingdom by pompey in bc little changed in the daily lives of either the oligarchies that controlled the cities or for the common people there and in the hinterland though the meaning of the name pontus underwent a change
part of the kingdom was now annexed to the roman empire being united with bithynia in a double province called pontus and bithynia this part included only the seaboard between heraclea today ere li and amisus samsun the ora pontica
the larger part of pontus however was included in the province of galatia
hereafter the simple name pontus without qualification was regularly employed to denote the half of this dual province especially by romans and people speaking from the roman point of view it is so used almost always in the new testament
the eastern half of the old kingdom was administered as a client kingdom together with colchis
its last king was polemon ii
in ad the country was constituted by nero a roman province
it was divided into the three districts pontus galaticus in the west bordering on galatia pontus polemoniacus in the centre so called from its capital polemonium and pontus cappadocicus in the east bordering on cappadocia armenia minor
subsequently the roman emperor trajan moved pontus into the province of cappadocia itself in the early nd century ad
in response to a gothic raid on trebizond in ad the roman emperor diocletian decided to break up the area into smaller provinces under more localized administration
with the reorganization of the provincial system under diocletian about ad the pontic districts were divided up between three smaller independent provinces within the dioecesis pontica
galatian pontus also called diospontus later renamed helenopontus by constantine the great after his mother
it had its capital at amisus and included the cities of sinope amasia andres ibora and zela as well
pontus polemoniacus with its capital at polemonium also called side and including the cities of neocaesarea argyroupolis comana and cerasus as well
cappadocian pontus with its capital at trebizond and including the small ports of athanae and rhizaeon
this province extended all the way to colchis the byzantine emperor justinian further reorganized the area in
pontus polemoniacus was dissolved with the western part polemonium and neocaesarea going to helenopontus comana going to the new province of armenia ii and the rest trebizond and cerasus joining the new province of armenia i magna with its capital at justinianopolis
helenopontus gained polemonium and neocaesarea and lost zela to armenia ii
the provincial governor was relegated to the rank of moderator
paphlagonia absorbed honorias and was put under a praetor by the time of the early byzantine empire trebizond became a center of culture and scientific learning
in the th century an individual named tychicus returned from constantinople to establish a school of learning
one of his students was the early armenian scholar anania of shirak
under the byzantine empire the pontus came under the armeniac theme with the westernmost parts paphlagonia belonging to the bucellarian theme
progressively these large early themes were divided into smaller ones so that by the late th century the pontus was divided into the themes of chaldia which was governed by the gabrades family and koloneia
after the th century the area experienced a period of prosperity which was brought to an end only by the seljuk conquest of asia minor in the s and s
restored to the byzantine empire by alexios i komnenos the area was governed by effectively semi autonomous rulers like the gabras family of trebizond
the region was secured militarily from the th through the th centuries with a vast network of sophisticated coastal fortresses
following constantinople s loss of sovereignty to the fourth crusade in the pontus retained independence as the empire of trebizond under the komnenos dynasty
through a combination of geographic remoteness and adroit diplomacy this remnant managed to survive until it was conquered by the ottomans in after the fall of constantinople itself
this political adroitness included becoming a vassal state at various times to both georgia and to various inland turkic rulers
in addition the empire of trebizond became a renowned center of culture under its ruling komnenos dynasty
under the subsequent ottoman rule which began with the fall of trebizond particularly starting from the th century some of the region s pontic greeks became muslim through the dev irme system
but at the same time some valleys inhabited by greeks converted voluntarily most notably those in the of valley
large communities around of the population of christian pontic greeks remained throughout the area including trabezon and kars in northeastern turkey the russian caucasus until the s and in parts of georgia and armenia until the s preserving their own customs and dialect of greek
one group of islamicized greeks were called the kromli but were suspected of secretly having remained christians
they numbered between and and lived in villages including krom imera livadia prdi alitinos mokhora and ligosti
many of the islamized greeks continued speaking their language known for its unique preservation of characteristics of ancient greek and still today there are some in the of valley that still speak the local ophitic dialect
the republic of pontus greek romanized dimokrat a tou p ntou was a proposed pontic greek state on the southern coast of the black sea
its territory would have encompassed much of historical pontus and today forms part of turkey s black sea region
the proposed state was discussed at the paris peace conference of but the greek government of eleftherios venizelos feared the precarious position of such a state and so it was included instead in the larger proposed state of wilsonian armenia
neither state came into existence and the pontic greek population was subjected to genocide and expelled from turkey after and resettled in the soviet union or in macedonia
this state of affairs was later formally recognized as part of the population exchange between greece and turkey in
the black sea region turkish karadeniz b lgesi comprising all or parts of provinces is one of turkey s seven census defined geographical regions
it encompasses but is larger than historic pontus
mentioned thrice in the new testament inhabitants of pontus were some of the very first converts to christianity
acts mentions them present in jerusalem on the day of pentecost acts mentions a jewish tentmaker from pontus aquila who was then living in corinth with his wife priscilla who had both converted to christianity and in peter peter the apostle addresses the pontians in his letter as the elect and chosen ones
as early as the first council of nicea trebizond had its own bishop
subsequently the bishop of trebizond was subordinated to the metropolitan bishop of poti
then during the th century trebizond itself became the seat of the metropolitan bishop of lazica
