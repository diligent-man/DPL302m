The NSWRFL season was the forty-seventh season of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership competition based in Sydney
Ten rugby league football teams from across the city competed for the J
Giltinan Shield during the season which culminated in the first mandatory Grand Final played between South Sydney and Newtown
During the pre-season Queensland and Australian international representative forward Harold Mick Crocker signed a then record one-year deal for an Australian to move south and play for Sydney club Parramatta
marked the first season when a Grand Final was scheduled to determine the premiership winner
Prior to that the season victors were either the minor premiers or decided by a final that followed two semi-finals
A Grand Final was only played if the minor-premier was defeated in a semi-final or final and exercised their right to challenge via a Grand Final
Since a Grand Final has been played every year to determine the premiership winner
This season in a New South Wales versus England match at the Sydney Cricket Ground referee Aub Oxford watched in disbelief the players fighting around him like street-brawlers before turning his back and walking from the field
Oxford never refereed again and the match remains the only top-level game ever abandoned in rugby league history
In South Sydney’s Les Brennan set the standing record for the highest number of tries in a debut season with
Newtown winger Ray Preston’s tries remains second only to Dave Brown’s in in the tally of tries scored in a season
Preston and Kevin Considine combined for fifty-six tries during the season easily a record for a pair of club wingers
In the last round on August Western Suburbs set a record for the highest losing score when they lost to Balmain
This was to be one of only two cases before the introduction of the -metre ruck rule in that a team scored over thirty points and lost the match
In spite of Newtown finishing as minor premiers they hadn’t beaten South Sydney in either regular season encounter
Souths had also won their semi-final meeting -
In this the NSWRFL’s first Grand Final scheduled to determine the premiership winner Souths were the victors
Legendary fullback Clive Churchill was outstanding setting up three of his side's five tries
The Bluebags stayed in the contest through the kicking boot of their Test fullback Gordon Punchy Clifford
