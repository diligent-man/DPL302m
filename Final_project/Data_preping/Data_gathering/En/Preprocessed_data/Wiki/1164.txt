A shotgun wedding is a wedding which is arranged in order to avoid embarrassment due to premarital sex which can possibly lead to an unintended pregnancy The phrase is a primarily American colloquialism termed as such based on a stereotypical scenario in which the father of the pregnant bride to be threatens the reluctant groom with a shotgun in order to ensure that he follows through with the wedding
One purpose of such a wedding can be to get recourse from the man for the act of impregnation another reason is trying to ensure that the child is raised by both parents In some cases as in early America and in the Middle East a major objective was restoring the social honour of the mother The practice is a loophole method of preventing the birth of illegitimate children or if the marriage occurs early enough in the gestation period to conceal the fact that conception had already occurred prior to marriage
In some societies the stigma attached to pregnancy out of wedlock can be enormous and coercive means in spite of the legal defense of undue influence for gaining recourse are often seen as the prospective father in law's right and an important albeit unconventional coming of age event for the groom and young father to be Often a couple will arrange a shotgun wedding without explicit outside encouragement and some religious groups consider it a moral imperative to marry in that situation
Premarital sexual relations remain taboo across all social strata throughout the Arab world In many cases fornication is illegal and even a criminal offence under Sharia law Even when it is not the social response can be extreme especially against women who have lost their virginity prior to marriage
In Arabic culture shotgun weddings serve to obscure the fact that a baby was conceived prior to marriage When that proves impossible the social standing of the couple involved is irreparably damaged Nevertheless shotgun weddings help prevent the individuals involved especially the women from becoming social pariahs
Apart from instances of regional slang there is no universal specific term for shotgun weddings in Arabic This is because they are not recognised as a regular social phenomenon and because a successfully conducted Middle Eastern shotgun wedding is generally unknown to the guests In some Persian Gulf nations the term police station marriage Arabic زواج مخفر may be the closest colloquial analogue for the concept of a shotgun wedding
