during the th century ballet was a way to show a person s position in society
since the early th century the western world has adopted a view of male ballet dancers or danseurs as weak effeminate or homosexual
through gender expectations and performance male ballet dancers combat the stereotypes that surround them
through education and media exposure the stereotypes about male ballet dancers lead to changes in perception
ballet was started in italian and french courts during the fifteenth century
during this time graceful and delicate characteristics were a sign of power
many noblemen started dancing ballet to demonstrate their position in society
louis xiv of france founded the acad mie royale de danse
it was the first ballet school
men were considered the stars of ballet until the nineteenth century when women were pushed into more of the spot light
a couple of different factors influenced this shift
first audience members changed when ballet moved from taking place in palaces to stages
second there was a cultural shift that created more ethereal themes
william l
earl s exploration of american stereotypes asked upper middle class mall shoppers to describe male ballet dancers as a whole using up to words or phrases
the most common responses were pretty boys afraid to soil themselves with honest labor snobs secretive neurotic narcissistic soft vain frail homosexual momma s boy irresponsible probably hard workers creatures of the night flighty afraid of intimacy use people cold and fancy
in a sociological study male ballet dancers reported several stereotypes they had been confronted with including feminine homosexual wimp spoiled gay dainty fragile weak fluffy woosy prissy artsy and sissy
in preparation for their anthology on masculinity and dance jennifer fisher and anthony shay interviewed several male dancers from different age groups ethnic backgrounds and sexualities
in the interviews the men were asked questions pertaining to the biased picture of male dancers such as do you think you re now surrounded by any stereotypes about men and dancing and are there perceptions about men who dance that you think need changing
one of the dancers interviewed aaron cota came up against unfair prejudices but helped dispel them
he took some time off to enter the marine corps
he tells of his fellow marines reaction when they found out that i would be earning a dance degree they were like what you re what
they were kind of confused
you just have to explain it to them
when the guys in my unit would see some of the things i ve done or they see videos of other people dance and they re like holy crap how can they do that
and they re like wow that s amazing and that s kind of opened my eyes
another dancer david allan experienced very negative effects of the stereotype growing up
he tells of the time he performed in his school s talent show at age eleven i was so excited about doing a dance from david my first choreography
so when i came out in my pretty white tights there was a big roar of laughter
later i met some guys in the hallway of my school who were making rude comments
you re that dancer guy would turn into being thrown down the stairs
a number of notable actors sportsmen and other celebrities have studied ballet including australian rules footballers james hird and josh dunkley footballer rio ferdinand rap artist tupac shakur and actors arnold schwarzenegger christian bale jamie bell and jean claude van damme noted for their action and martial arts acting roles
male ballet dancers are often disdained because of the belief that ballet is a feminine activity
there are a couple of ways that male ballet dancers combat this idea
male ballet dancers take on different movement characteristics and different technique compared to their female counter parts
men are expected to have movement that is strong and powerful
they are also expected to be good solid bases that can lift a person
within the dance world words like strong proud and in control were used to describe a good male ballet dancer
a good female dancer was described as timid modest and light
male ballet dancers perform more athletic technique
men focus more on leaps and jumps and are expected to get more height and power in their technique
within the dance world there is a strong push for male ballet dancers to have masculine characteristics
they are often told to dance like a man from a young age
male dancers that have feminine movement qualities are usually looked down on
they are often described as weak fragile and out of place
these negative responses to men in the dance world come from the lack of association of male stereotype to the stereotypes of dance
men are often perceived as and are expected to display qualities such as dominance independence authority strength and a lack of emotions
female stereotypes on the other hand include submissiveness dependence compliance vulnerability and emotion
stereotypes of dance are linked closer to female stereotypes as dance is an expression of emotion
in ballet one must be vulnerable to the people around them whether it s to trust others to lift catch or move in a synchronized manner
men and masculinity correlate and are oftentimes indistinguishable from one another
masculinity in itself is a social standing that associates with certain roles and practices
masculinity creates a symbolic meaning of what it means to be a man which involve many stereotypical male qualities
as a social standing masculinity is pressured on men by society and if unfulfilled society freely ridicules and ostracizes men for their failure to effectuate its symbolic meaning
since dance is an expression of emotion that is based on vulnerability men thus open themselves to mockery by displaying different characteristics than the expected male attributes
in a study done on peer attitudes of participants in gender specific sports e g
ballet and american football teens ages were found to have strong stereotypical views
males who frequently participated in a sex inappropriate athletic activity were perceived as more feminine than those who did not
the study also suggested this stereotyping of athletes may have an important impact on the willingness of athletes to participate in certain sports
likewise these stereotypes may tend to filter out certain types of potential participants e g macho males
in athletic activities which are inappropriate for one s gender victoria morgan a former principal ballerina with the san francisco ballet now an artistic director and c e o
of the cincinnati ballet relates
i feel there is a stigma attached to ballet in america that doesn t reflect the reality
this makes it difficult to attract some audience members and boys for ballet companies
one strategy used to combat the stereotypical attitudes is to discuss the social constructs of gender within dance education
there have also been programs like boys dancing that oppose the idea that boys should not dance
media can also help change the perspective on male ballet dancers
after the movie billy elliot released in in dance classes there was a dramatic increase in male enrollment
for example more boys than girls were admitted in the royal ballet school which had never been done before
reality shows like dancing with the stars and so you think you can dance have also impacted enrollment rates in a positive way
many students credit these shows as the spark to start dancing and study ballet
