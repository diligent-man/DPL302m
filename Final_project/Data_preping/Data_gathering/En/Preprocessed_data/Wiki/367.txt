During the th century ballet was a way to show a person's position in society Since the early th century the western world has adopted a view of male ballet dancers or danseurs as weak effeminate or homosexual Through gender expectations and performance male ballet dancers combat the stereotypes that surround them Through education and media exposure the stereotypes about male ballet dancers lead to changes in perception

One of the dancers interviewed Aaron Cota came up against unfair prejudices but helped dispel them He took some time off to enter the Marine Corps He tells of his fellow Marines' reaction When they found out that I would be earning a dance degree they were like 'What You're what ' They were kind of confused You just have to explain it to them When the guys in my unit would see some of the things I've done or they see videos of other people dance and they're like 'Holy crap how can they do that ' and they're like 'Wow that's amazing ' and 'That's kind of opened my eyes '

Male ballet dancers are often disdained because of the belief that ballet is a feminine activity There are a couple of ways that male ballet dancers combat this idea Male ballet dancers take on different movement characteristics and different technique compared to their female counter parts Men are expected to have movement that is strong and powerful They are also expected to be good solid bases that can lift a person Within the dance world words like strong proud and in control were used to describe a good male ballet dancer A good female dancer was described as timid modest and light Male ballet dancers perform more athletic technique Men focus more on leaps and jumps and are expected to get more height and power in their technique
Within the dance world there is a strong push for male ballet dancers to have masculine characteristics They are often told to dance like a man from a young age Male dancers that have feminine movement qualities are usually looked down on They are often described as weak fragile and out of place
These negative responses to men in the dance world come from the lack of association of male stereotype to the stereotypes of dance Men are often perceived as and are expected to display qualities such as dominance independence authority strength and a lack of emotions Female stereotypes on the other hand include submissiveness dependence compliance vulnerability and emotion Stereotypes of dance are linked closer to female stereotypes as dance is an expression of emotion In ballet one must be vulnerable to the people around them whether it's to trust others to lift catch or move in a synchronized manner
Men and masculinity correlate and are oftentimes indistinguishable from one another Masculinity in itself is a social standing that associates with certain roles and practices Masculinity creates a symbolic meaning of what it means to be a man which involve many stereotypical male qualities As a social standing masculinity is pressured on men by society and if unfulfilled society freely ridicules and ostracizes men for their failure to effectuate its symbolic meaning Since dance is an expression of emotion that is based on vulnerability men thus open themselves to mockery by displaying different characteristics than the expected male attributes
In a study done on peer attitudes of participants in gender specific sports e g ballet and American football teens ages were found to have strong stereotypical views Males who frequently participated in a sex inappropriate athletic activity were perceived as more feminine than those who did not The study also suggested This stereotyping of athletes may have an important impact on the willingness of athletes to participate in certain sports Likewise these stereotypes may tend to filter out certain types of potential participants e g macho males in athletic activities which are 'inappropriate' for one's gender Victoria Morgan a former principal ballerina with the San Francisco Ballet now an Artistic Director and C E O of the Cincinnati Ballet relates I feel there is a stigma attached to ballet in America that doesn't reflect the reality This makes it difficult to attract some audience members and boys for ballet companies
One strategy used to combat the stereotypical attitudes is to discuss the social constructs of gender within dance education There have also been programs like Boys Dancing that oppose the idea that boys should not dance Media can also help change the perspective on male ballet dancers After the movie Billy Elliot released in in dance classes there was a dramatic increase in male enrollment For example more boys than girls were admitted in the Royal Ballet School which had never been done before Reality shows like Dancing with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance have also impacted enrollment rates in a positive way Many students credit these shows as the spark to start dancing and study ballet
