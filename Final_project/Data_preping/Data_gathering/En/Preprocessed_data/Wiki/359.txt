scientism is the opinion that science and the scientific method are the best or only objective means by which people should determine normative and epistemological values
while the term was defined originally to mean methods and attitudes typical of or attributed to natural scientists some religious scholars and subsequently many others also adopted it as a pejorative term with the meaning an exaggerated trust in the efficacy of the methods of natural science applied to all areas of investigation as in philosophy the social sciences and the humanities
with respect to the philosophy of science the term scientism frequently implies a critique of the more extreme expressions of logical positivism and has been used by social scientists such as friedrich hayek philosophers of science such as karl popper and philosophers such as mary midgley the later hilary putnam and tzvetan todorov to describe for example the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methods and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or confirmatory
more generally scientism is often interpreted as science applied in excess
this use of the term scientism has two senses
the improper use of science or scientific claims
this usage applies equally in contexts where science might not apply such as when the topic is perceived as beyond the scope of scientific inquiry and in contexts where there is insufficient empirical evidence to justify a scientific conclusion
it includes an excessive deference to the claims of scientists or an uncritical eagerness to accept any result described as scientific
this can be a counterargument to appeals to scientific authority
it can also address attempts to apply natural science methods and claims of certainty to the social sciences which friedrich hayek described in the counter revolution of science as being impossible because those methods attempt to eliminate the human factor while social sciences including his own topic of economics mainly concern the study of human action
the belief that the methods of natural science or the categories and things recognized in natural science form the only proper elements in any philosophical or other inquiry or that science and only science describes the world as it is in itself independent of perspective with a concomitant elimination of the psychological and spiritual dimensions of experience
tom sorell provides this definition scientism is a matter of putting too high a value on natural science in comparison with other branches of learning or culture philosophers such as alexander rosenberg have also adopted scientism as a name for the opinion that science is the only reliable source of knowledge it is also sometimes used to describe the universal applicability of the scientific method and the opinion that empirical science constitutes the most authoritative worldview or the most valuable part of human learning sometimes to the complete exclusion of other opinions such as historical philosophical economic or cultural opinions
it has been defined as the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and in particular that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society
the term scientism is also used by historians philosophers and cultural critics to highlight the possible dangers of lapses towards excessive reductionism with respect to all topics of human knowledge
for social theorists practising the tradition of max weber such as j rgen habermas and max horkheimer the concept of scientism relates significantly to the philosophy of positivism but also to the cultural rationalization for modern western civilization
reviewing the references to scientism in the works of contemporary scholars gregory r
peterson detected two main general themes
it is used to criticize a totalizing opinion of science as if it were capable of describing all reality and knowledge or as if it were the only true method to acquire knowledge about reality and the nature of things
it is used often pejoratively to denote violations by which the theories and methods of one scientific discipline are applied inappropriately to another scientific or non scientific discipline and its domain
an example of this second usage is to term as scientism any attempt to claim science as the only or primary source of human values a traditional domain of ethics or as the source of meaning and purpose a traditional domain of religion and related worldviews the term scientism was popularized by f a
hayek who defined it as the slavish imitation of the method and language of science
karl popper defines scientism as the aping of what is widely mistaken for the method of science
mikael stenmark proposed the expression scientific expansionism as a synonym of scientism
in the encyclopedia of science and religion he wrote that while the doctrines that are described as scientism have many possible forms and varying degrees of ambition they share the idea that the boundaries of science that is typically the natural sciences could and should be expanded so that something that has not been previously considered as a subject pertinent to science can now be understood as part of science usually with science becoming the sole or the main arbiter regarding this area or dimension
according to stenmark the strongest form of scientism states that science does not have any boundaries and that all human problems and all aspects of human endeavor with due time will be dealt with and solved by science alone
this idea has also been termed the myth of progress
schumacher in his a guide for the perplexed criticized scientism as an impoverished world view confined solely to what can be counted measured and weighed
the architects of the modern worldview notably galileo and descartes assumed that those things that could be weighed measured and counted were more true than those that could not be quantified
if it couldn t be counted in other words it didn t count
intellectual historian t j
jackson lears argued there has been a recent reemergence of nineteenth century positivist faith that a reified science has discovered or is about to discover all the important truths about human life
precise measurement and rigorous calculation in this view are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies lears specifically identifies harvard psychologist steven pinker s work as falling in this category
philosophers john n
gray and thomas nagel have made similar criticisms against popular works by moral psychologist jonathan haidt atheist author sam harris and writer malcolm gladwell
both religious and non religious scholars have applied the term scientism to individuals associated with new atheism
theologian john haught argued that philosopher daniel dennett and other new atheists subscribe to a belief system of scientific naturalism which includes the dogma that only nature including humans and our creations is real that god does not exist and that science alone can give us complete and reliable knowledge of reality
haught argued that this belief system is self refuting since it requires its adherents to assent to beliefs that violate its own stated requirements for knowledge
christian philosopher peter williams argued in that it is only by conflating science with scientism that new atheists feel qualified to pontificate on metaphysical issues
daniel dennett responded to religious criticism of his book breaking the spell religion as a natural phenomenon by saying that accusations of scientism are an all purpose wild card smear
when someone puts forward a scientific theory that religious critics really don t like they just try to discredit it as scientism
but when it comes to facts and explanations of facts science is the only game in town
non religious scholars have also associated new atheist thought with scientism and or with positivism
atheist philosopher thomas nagel argued that philosopher sam harris conflated all empirical knowledge with scientific knowledge
marxist literary critic terry eagleton argued that christopher hitchens possessed an old fashioned scientistic notion of what counts as evidence that reduces knowledge to what can and cannot be proven by scientific procedure
agnostic philosopher anthony kenny has also criticized new atheist philosopher alexander rosenberg s the atheist s guide to reality for resurrecting a self refuting epistemology of logical positivism and reducing all knowledge of the universe to the discipline of physics
michael shermer founder of the skeptics society discussed resemblances between scientism and traditional religions indicating the cult of personality that develops for some scientists
he defined scientism as a worldview that encompasses natural explanations eschews supernatural and paranormal speculations and embraces empiricism and reason
the iranian scholar seyyed hossein nasr has stated that in the western world many will accept the ideology of modern science not as simple ordinary science but as a replacement for religion
gregory r
peterson wrote that for many theologians and philosophers scientism is among the greatest of intellectual sins
genetic biologist austin l
hughes wrote in the conservative journal the new atlantis that scientism has much in common with superstition the stubborn insistence that something
has powers which no evidence supports
repeating common criticisms of logical positivism and verificationism philosopher of religion keith ward has said that scientism is philosophically inconsistent or even self refuting as the truth of the two statements no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically or logically and no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true cannot themselves be proven scientifically logically or empirically
philosopher paul feyerabend who was an enthusiastic proponent of scientism during his youth later came to characterize science as an essentially anarchic enterprise and argued emphatically that science merits no exclusive monopoly of dealing in knowledge and that scientists have never operated within a distinct and narrowly self defined tradition
in his essay against method he depicted the process of contemporary scientific education as a mild form of indoctrination intended for making the history of science duller simpler more uniform more objective and more easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchanging rules
physicist and philosopher mario bunge used the term scientism with a favorable rather than pejorative sense in numerous books published during several decades as for scientism it is the thesis that the scientific method is the best strategy for attaining the more objective more accurate and deepest truths about facts of any kind natural or social
true hayek famously claimed that scientism is something quite different namely the attempt on the part of some social scientists to ape their colleagues in the natural sciences in ignoring the inner life of their referents
but this arbitrary redefinition involves confusing naturalism or reductionist materialism as practised e g by the sociobiologists with scientism and in articles with titles such as in defense of realism and scientism and in defense of scientism
bunge dismissed critics of science such as hayek and habermas as dogmatists and obscurantists
in philosophers maarten boudry and massimo pigliucci co edited a book titled science unlimited the challenges of scientism in which a number of chapters by philosophers and scientists defended scientism
in his chapter two cheers for scientism taner edis wrote
thomas m
lessl argued that religious themes persist in what he terms scientism the public rhetoric of science
there are two methods of describing this idea of scientism the epistemological method the assumption that the scientific method trumps other ways of knowing and the ontological method that the rational mind represents the world and both operate in knowable ways
according to lessl the ontological method is an attempt to resolve the conflict between rationalism and skepticism
lessl also argued that without scientism there would not be a scientific culture
in the introduction to his collected works on the sociology of religion max weber asked why the scientific the artistic the political or the economic development elsewhere
did not enter upon that path of rationalization which is peculiar to the occident according to the german social theorist j rgen habermas for weber the intrinsic that is not merely contingent relationship between modernity and what he called occidental rationalism was still self evident weber described a process of rationalisation disenchantment and the disintegration of religious world views that resulted in modern secular societies and capitalism
habermas is critical of pure instrumental rationality arguing that the social life world of subjective experiencing is better suited to literary expression whereas the sciences deal with intersubjectively accessible experiences that can be generalized in a formal language while the literary arts must generate an intersubjectivity of mutual understanding in each concrete case
habermas quoted writer aldous huxley in support of this duality of literature and science
as a form of dogma as defined in the pbs documentary faith and reason unlike the use of the scientific method as only one mode of reaching knowledge scientism claims that science alone can render truth about the world and reality
scientism s single minded adherence to only the empirical or testable makes it a strictly scientifc worldview in much the same way that a protestant fundamentalism that rejects science can be seen as a strictly religious worldview
scientism sees it necessary to do away with most if not all metaphysical philosophical and religious claims as the truths they proclaim cannot be apprehended by the scientific method
in essence scientism sees science as the absolute and only justifiable access to the truth
