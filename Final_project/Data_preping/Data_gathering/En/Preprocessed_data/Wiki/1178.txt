the faisal weizmann agreement was a january agreement between emir faisal the third son of hussein ibn ali al hashimi king of the short lived kingdom of hejaz and chaim weizmann a zionist leader who had negotiated the balfour declaration with the british government signed two weeks before the start of the paris peace conference
together with a letter written by t
lawrence in faisal s name to felix frankfurter in march it was one of two documents used by the zionist delegation at the peace conference to argue that the zionist plans for palestine had prior approval of arabs
the agreement was presented to faisal in his room at the carlton hotel on january in english which faisal could not read and its contents were explained to faisal by lawrence as the sole translator
faisal signed the document in the same meeting without consulting his advisors awaiting him in a separate room but added a caveat in arabic next to his signature such that faisal considered the agreement was conditional on palestine being within the area of arab independence
the zionist organization submitted the agreement to the paris peace conference without the caveat
yoav gelber described the document as of propaganda value only since it quickly became clear that faisal s conditions would not be met
at the time the agreement was made there had preceded it apart from the balfour declaration the mcmahon hussein correspondence the sykes picot agreement the hogarth message the bassett letter the declaration to the seven and the anglo french declaration
of these the sykes picot agreement had been made public by the bolsheviks and the declaration to the seven as well as the anglo french declaration were also public documents
the sykes picot agreement had called for an arab state or a confederation of arab states
under the suzerainty of an arab chief
the french and british also proposed an international administration in the brown area an area including jerusalem similar to and smaller than mandate palestine the form of which was to be decided upon after consultation with russia and subsequently in consultation with the other allies and the representatives of the shereef of mecca
henry mcmahon had exchanged letters with faisal s father hussein bin ali sharif of mecca in in which he had promised hussein control of arab lands with the exception of portions of syria lying to the west of the districts of damascus homs hama and aleppo
palestine lies to the southwest of these areas and wasn t explicitly mentioned
that modern day lebanese region of the mediterranean coast was set aside as part of a future french mandate
after the war the extent of the coastal exclusion was hotly disputed
hussein had protested that the arabs of beirut would greatly oppose isolation from the arab state or states but did not bring up the matter of jerusalem or palestine
between and the british government interpreted these commitments as including palestine in the arab area
however in the churchill white paper they argued instead that palestine had been excluded
on the basis of mcmahon s assurances the arab revolt began on june
however the british and french also secretly concluded the sykes picot agreement on may
this agreement divided many arab territories into british and french administered areas and allowed for the internationalisation of palestine
hussein learned of the agreement when it was leaked by the new russian government in december but was satisfied by two disingenuous telegrams from sir reginald wingate high commissioner of egypt assuring him that the british government s commitments to the arabs were still valid and that the sykes picot agreement was not a formal treaty
following the publication of the balfour declaration the british had dispatched commander david george hogarth to see hussein in january bearing the message that the political and economic freedom of the palestinian population was not in question
hogarth reported that hussein would not accept an independent jewish state in palestine nor was i instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by great britain
according to isaiah friedman hussein was not perturbed by the balfour declaration and on march in al qibla the daily newspaper of mecca attested that palestine was a sacred and beloved homeland of its original sons the jews the return of these exiles to their homeland will prove materially and spiritually an experimental school for their arab brethren he called on the arab population in palestine to welcome the jews as brethren and cooperate with them for the common welfare
whereas kedourie as well as friedman have argued that hussein accepted the balfour declaration charles d smith has argued that both friedman and kedourie misrepresent documents and violate scholarly standards in order to reach their conclusions
while schneer says that historians have spilled oceans of ink tracing the initial reactions of hussein and his sons to the balfour declaration without settling the debate noting that hussein considered palestine to be arab land
continuing arab disquiet over allied intentions also led during to the british declaration to the seven and the anglo french declaration the latter promising the complete and final liberation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the turks and the setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations
weizmann first met faisal in june during the british advance from the south against the ottoman empire in world war i
as leader of an impromptu zionist commission weizmann traveled to southern transjordan for the meeting
weizmann had assured faisal that the jews did not propose to set up a government of their own but wished to work under british protection to colonize and develop palestine without encroaching on any legitimate interests
antonius commented in that the combined effect of those assurances had been to induce in him a belief that there was nothing either in the zionist aspirations as such or in the policy professed by the british government in regard to their fulfilment that would interfere with arab political and economic freedom in palestine
weizmann s intended purpose was to forge an agreement between faisal and the zionist movement to support an arab kingdom and jewish settlement in palestine respectively
the wishes of the palestinian arabs were to be ignored and indeed both men seem to have held the palestinian arabs in considerable disdain
in the event weizmann and faisal established an informal agreement under which faisal would support close jewish settlement in palestine while the zionist movement would assist in the development of the vast arab nation that faisal hoped to establish
after concerns were expressed by cecil regarding draft proposals put forward by the advisory committee on palestine chaired by herbert samuel balfour suggested to weizmann that it would be very helpful indeed if the zionists and feisal could act unitedly and reach an agreement on certain points of possible conflict weizmann and faisal met again on december while both were in london preparing their statements for the upcoming peace conference in paris
two weeks prior to signing the agreement on december faisal was quoted in the times in a piece which ali allawi writes was no doubt instigated by lawrence and the foreign office
the two main branches of the semitic family arabs and jews understand one another and i hope that as a result of interchange of ideas at the peace conference which will be guided by ideals of self determination and nationality each nation will make definite progress towards the realization of its aspirations
arabs are not jealous of zionist jews and intend to give them fair play and the zionist jews have assured the nationalist arabs of their intention to see that they too have fair play in their respective areas
turkish intrigue in palestine has raised jealousy between the jewish colonists and the local peasants but the mutual understanding of the aims of arabs and jews will at once clear away the last trace of this former bitterness which indeed had already practically disappeared before the war by the work of the arab secret revolutionary committee which in syria and elsewhere laid the foundation of the arab military successes of the past two years two days prior to the agreement on january faisal s delegation submitted a statement to the peace conference and a further memorandum was submitted on january
the statement referred to the goal to unite the arabs eventually into one nation defining the arab areas as from a line alexandretta persia southward to the indian ocean january or from the line alexandretta diarbekr southward to the indian ocean january
the latter memorandum described boundaries of any new states as matters for arrangement between us after the wishes of their respective inhabitants have been ascertained in a reference to us president woodrow wilson s policy of self determination
they signed the written agreement which bears their names on january
faisal was not explicitly authorised by his father to enter into such an agreement with his instructions from his father limited to the requirement that he accept only fulfilment of the previous british promises for arab independence the caveat was added as a result
the next day weizmann arrived in paris to head the zionist delegation to the peace conference
agreement between emir feisal and dr
weizmann
january
his royal highness the emir feisal representing and acting on behalf of the arab kingdom of hedjaz and dr
chaim weizmann representing and acting on behalf of the zionist organization mindful of the racial kinship and ancient bonds existing between the arabs and the jewish people and realizing that the surest means of working out the consummation of their natural aspirations is through the closest possible collaboration in the development of the arab state and palestine and being desirous further of confirming the good understanding which exists between them have agreed upon the following
articles
given under our hand at london england the third day of january one thousand nine hundred and nineteen
chaim weizmann feisal ibn hussein
the agreement committed both parties to conducting all relations between the groups by the most cordial goodwill and understanding to work together to encourage immigration of jews into palestine on a large scale while protecting the rights of the arab peasants and tenant farmers and to safeguard the free practice of religious observances
the muslim holy places were to be under muslim control
the zionist movement undertook to assist the arab residents of palestine and the future arab state to develop their natural resources and establish a growing economy
the boundaries between an arab state and palestine should be determined by a commission after the paris peace conference
the parties committed to carrying into effect the balfour declaration of calling for a jewish national home in palestine
disputes were to be submitted to the british government for arbitration weizmann signed the agreement on behalf of the zionist organization while faisal signed on behalf of the short lived arab kingdom of hedjaz
faisal conditioned his acceptance on the fulfillment of british wartime promises to the arabs who had hoped for independence in a vast part of the ottoman empire
he appended to the typed document a hand written statement next to which lawrence added a slightly inaccurate translation
the date of january referred to in the caveat is either a mistake or refers to a document unknown to historians
allawi interprets faisal as referring to his memorandum submitted on january
faisal submitted his written proposals to the conference on january
a draft memorandum that lawrence had brought at faisal s request to stephen bonsal of the american delegation shortly after the zionists had made their initial presentation according to bonsal s memoirs stated very different views from the agreement with weizmann
if the views of the radical zionists as presented to the peace conference should prevail the result will be a ferment chronic unrest and sooner or later civil war in palestine
but i hope i will not be misunderstood
i assert that we arabs have none of the racial or religious animosity against the jews which unfortunately prevail in many other regions of the world
i assert that with the jews who have been seated for some generations in palestine our relations are excellent
but the new arrivals exhibit very different qualities from those old settlers as we call them with whom we have been able to live and even co operate on friendly terms
for want of a better word i must say that new colonists almost without exception have come in an imperialistic spirit
they say that too long we have been in control of their homeland taken from them by brute force in the dark ages but that now under the new world order we must clear out and if we are wise we should do so peaceably without making any resistance to what is the fiat of the civilised world faisal made his appearance before the supreme council on february and in a further sign that his zionist sympathy might be wavering suggested that palestine in consequence of its universal character be left on one side for the mutual consideration of all parties concerned
the zionists written submission was made on february with their appearance before the supreme council on february
a march interview by le matin quoted faisal as saying
this feeling of respect for other religions dictates my opinion about palestine our neighbor
that the unhappy jews come to reside there and behave as good citizens of this country our humanity rejoices given that they are placed under a muslim or christian government mandated by the league of nations
if they want to constitute a state and claim sovereign rights in this region i forsee very serious dangers
it is to be feared that there will be a conflict between them and the other races
although allawi states that faisal had been misquoted he says that the le matin interview resulted in difficulties with the zionists leading to a meeting between faisal and frankfurter followed by lawrence drafting of a letter to felix frankfurter president of the zionist organization of america on march signed by faisal
the arabs especially the educated among us look with the deepest sympathy on the zionist movement
our deputation here in paris is fully acquainted with the proposals submitted yesterday by the zionist organization to the peace conference and we regard them as moderate and proper
frankfurter replied on march these aims are now before the peace conference as definite proposals by the zionist organisation
we are happy indeed that you consider these proposals moderate and proper and that we have in you a staunch supporter for their realisation
when the letter was tabled at the shaw commission in rustam haidar spoke to faisal in baghdad and cabled that faisal had no recollection that he wrote anything of the sort
in january haidar wrote to a newspaper in baghdad that faisal finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed to him as he at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an arab country
awni abd al hadi faisal s secretary wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between frankfurter and faisal took place and that i believe that this letter assuming that it is authentic was written by lawrence and that lawrence signed it in english on behalf of faisal
i believe this letter is part of the false claims made by chaim weizmann and lawrence to lead astray public opinion according to allawi the most likely explanation for the frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place a letter was drafted in english by lawrence but that its contents were not entirely made clear to faisal
he then may or may not have been induced to sign it since it ran counter to faisal s other public and private statements at the time
mack notes that frankfurter reprinted the letter in the october issue of the atlantic monthly vouched for its authenticity commenting prince feisal s letter was a document prepared under the most responsible conditions and that although faisal objected to interpretations that understood his letter to mean consent to zionist policy he did not disavow its authorship
in october british and arab forces had captured damascus during the arab revolt and faisal formed a government
in may elections were held for the syrian national congress
on july the congress in a memorandum presented to the king crane commission completely opposed any migration to palestine and the latter not to be separated from syria
according to c d
smith the syrian national congress had forced faisal to back away from his tentative support of zionist goals
at this point the agreement could be seen as a dead letter
on march faisal was proclaimed king of arab kingdom of syria greater syria
in april the san remo conference gave france the mandate for syria which led to the franco syrian war
in the battle of maysalun on july the french were victorious and faisal was expelled from syria after which he contended that the conditions he appended were not fulfilled and the agreement therefore moot
according to contemporaries including gertrude bell and lawrence the french with british support betrayed faisal and the arab cause rendering the treaty invalid
john philby a british representative in palestine later stated that hussein bin ali the sharif of mecca and king of hejaz on whose behalf faisal was acting had refused to recognize the agreement as soon as it was brought to his notice
the agreement was first disclosed to the public in
it was noted by unscop that to many observers at the time conclusion of the feisal weizmann agreement promised well for the future co operation of arab and jew in palestine and further referring to the report of the palestine royal commission which noted that not once since had any arab leader said that co operation with the jews was even possible despite expressed hopes to the contrary by british and zionist representatives
unscop did not regard the agreement as ever being valid although weizmann asserted that the treaty should be considered valid while at the same time agreeing that faisal had the right to void it after losing syria to the french
