biology biological life cycle life cycle lifecycle biological context clear series change form organism undergoes returning starting state
concept closely related life history development ontogeny differs stressing renewal transition form may involve growth asexual reproduction sexual reproduction
plant many algae two multicellular stage life cycle referred alternation generations
term life history often used particularly organism red algae three multicellular stage rather two
life cycle include sexual reproduction involve alternating haploid n diploid n stage ie change ploidy involved
return diploid stage haploid stage meiosis must occur
haplontic life cycle haploid stage multicellular diploid stage single cell meiosis zygotic
diplontic life cycle diploid stage multicellular haploid gamete formed meiosis gametic
haplodiplontic life cycle also referred diplohaplontic diplobiontic dibiontic life cycle multicellular diploid haploid stage occur meiosis sporicthe cycle differ mitosis growth occurs
zygotic meiosis gametic meiosis one mitotic stage mitosis occurs n phase zygotic meiosis n phase gametic meiosis
therefore zygotic gametic meiosis collectively termed haplobiontic single mitotic phase confused haplontic
sporic meiosis hand ha mitosis two stage diploid haploid stage termed diplobiontic confused diplontic
study reproduction development organism wa carried many botanist zoologists
wilhelm hofmeister demonstrated alternation generation feature unites plant published result see plant sexuality
term haplobiont diplobiont used description life cycle proposed initially algae nil svedelius became used organisms
term autogamy gamontogamy used protist life cycle introduced karl gottlieb grell
description complex life cycle various organism contributed disproof idea spontaneous generation s
zygotic meiosis meiosis zygote immediately karyogamy fusion two cell nuclei
way organism end diploid phase produce several haploid cells
cell divide mitotically form either larger multicellular individual haploid cells
two opposite type gamete eg male female individual cell fuse become zygote
whole cycle zygote diploid cell mitosis occurs haploid phase
individual cell result mitosis haplonts hence life cycle also called haplontic life cycle
alveolates many dinoflagellate eg ceratium gymnodinium apicomplexans eg plasmodium
opisthokonts fungi chytrids zygomycetes ascomycete basidiomycetesin gametic meiosis instead immediately dividing meiotically produce haploid cell zygote divide mitotically produce multicellular diploid individual group unicellular diploid cells
cell diploid individual undergo meiosis produce haploid cell gametes
haploid cell may divide mitosis form haploid cell many yeast haploid phase predominant life cycle phase
gamete usually form quickly fuse produce diploid zygotes
whole cycle gamete usually haploid cell mitosis usually occurs diploid phase
diploid multicellular individual diplont hence gametic meiosis also called diplontic life cycle
stramenopiles brown algae fucales however life cycle also interpreted strongly heteromorphic-diplohaplontic highly reduced gametophyte phase flowering plant xanthophytes eg vaucheria diatom oomycetes eg saprolegnia plasmopara viticola opalines heliozoan eg actinophrys actinosphaerium
opisthokonts animal fungi eg ascomycetesin sporic meiosis also commonly known intermediary meiosis zygote divide mitotically produce multicellular diploid sporophyte
sporophyte creates spore via meiosis also divide mitotically producing haploid individual called gametophytes
plant gametophyte small-sized also short-lived plant many algae gametophyte dominant stage life cycle
archaeplastidans red algae two sporophyte generation green algae eg ulva land plants
eukaryote haptophytessome animal sex-determination system called haplodiploid related haplodiplontic life cycle
red algae bonnemaisonia lemanea green algae prasiola vegetative meiosis also called somatic meiosis rare phenomenon
vegetative meiosis occur haplodiplontic also diplontic life cycles
vegetative non-reproductive diploid cell undergo meiosis generating vegetative haploid cells
different phenomenon called vegetative diploidization type apomixis occurs brown algae eg elachista stellaris
cell haploid part plant spontaneously duplicate chromosome produce diploid tissue
must infect one host specie complete life cycle said complex indirect life cycles
dirofilaria immitis heartworm ha indirect life cycle example
microfilariae must first ingested female mosquito develops infective larval stage
mosquito bite animal transmits infective larva animal migrate pulmonary artery mature adults
example parasite direct life cycle ancylostoma caninum canine hookworm
develop infective larval stage environment penetrate skin dog directly mature adult small intestine
parasite ha infect given host order complete life cycle said obligate parasite host sometimes infection facultativethe parasite survive complete life cycle without infecting particular host species
parasite sometimes infect host cannot complete life cycle accidental hosts
host parasite reproduce sexually known definitive final primary host
intermediate host parasite either reproduce asexually parasite always develops new stage type host
case parasite infect host undergo development host known paratenic transport hosts
paratenic host useful raising chance parasite transmitted definitive host
example cat lungworm aelurostrongylus abstrusus us slug snail intermediate host first stage larva enters mollusk develops third stage larva infectious definitive hostthe cat
mouse eats slug third stage larva enter mouse's tissue undergo development
primitive type life cycle probably haploid individual asexual reproduction
bacteria archaea exhibit life cycle like eukaryote apparently eg cryptophyta choanoflagellata many euglenozoa many amoebozoa red algae green algae imperfect fungi rotifer many group necessarily haploid
however eukaryote probably primitively asexual lost sexual reproduction wa observed yet
many eukaryote including animal plant exhibit asexual reproduction may facultative obligate life cycle sexual reproduction occurring le frequently
individual organism participating biological life cycle ordinarily age die cell organism connect successive life cycle generation germ line cell descendant potentially immortal
medvedev considered accuracy genome replicative synthetic system alone cannot explain immortality germ lines
rather medvedev thought known feature biochemistry genetics sexual reproduction indicate presence unique information maintenance restoration process gametogenesis stage biological life cycle
particular medvedev considered important opportunity information maintenance germ cell created recombination meiosis dna repair saw process within germ line cell capable restoring integrity dna chromosome type damage cause irreversible ageing non-germ line cell eg
ancestry present day cell presumably trace back unbroken lineage billion year origin life
immortality cell lineage depends maintenance cell division potential
potential may lost particular lineage cell damage terminal differentiation occurs nerve cell programmed cell death apoptosis development
maintenance cell division potential biological life cycle successive generation depends avoidance accurate repair cellular damage particularly dna damage
sexual organism continuity germline successive cell cycle generation depends effectiveness process avoiding dna damage repairing dna damage occur
sexual process eukaryote provide opportunity effective repair dna damage germ line homologous recombination
apomixis replacement normal sexual reproduction asexual reproduction without fertilization
haplodiploidy biological system sex determined number set chromosomes
parasexual cycle nonsexual mechanism transferring genetic material without meiosis
metamorphosis profound change body structure postembryonic development organism
