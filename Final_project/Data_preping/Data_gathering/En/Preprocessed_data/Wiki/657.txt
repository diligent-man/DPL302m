in biology a biological life cycle or just life cycle or lifecycle when the biological context is clear is a series of changes in form that an organism undergoes returning to the starting state
the concept is closely related to those of the life history development and ontogeny but differs from them in stressing renewal transitions of form may involve growth asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction
in some organisms different generations of the species succeed each other during the life cycle
for plants and many algae there are two multicellular stages and the life cycle is referred to as alternation of generations
the term life history is often used particularly for organisms such as the red algae which have three multicellular stages or more rather than two
life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating haploid n and diploid n stages i e a change of ploidy is involved
to return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage meiosis must occur
in regard to changes of ploidy there are types of cycles
haplontic life cycle the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell meiosis is zygotic
diplontic life cycle the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid gametes are formed meiosis is gametic
haplodiplontic life cycle also referred to as diplohaplontic diplobiontic or dibiontic life cycle multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur meiosis is sporic the cycles differ in when mitosis growth occurs
zygotic meiosis and gametic meiosis have one mitotic stage mitosis occurs during the n phase in zygotic meiosis and during the n phase in gametic meiosis
therefore zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed haplobiontic single mitotic phase not to be confused with haplontic
sporic meiosis on the other hand has mitosis in two stages both the diploid and haploid stages termed diplobiontic not to be confused with diplontic
the study of reproduction and development in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists
wilhelm hofmeister demonstrated that alternation of generations is a feature that unites plants and published this result in see plant sexuality
some terms haplobiont and diplobiont used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by nils svedelius and then became used for other organisms
other terms autogamy and gamontogamy used in protist life cycles were introduced by karl gottlieb grell
the description of the complex life cycles of various organisms contributed to the disproof of the ideas of spontaneous generation in the s and s
a zygotic meiosis is a meiosis of a zygote immediately after karyogamy which is the fusion of two cell nuclei
this way the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells
these cells divide mitotically to form either larger multicellular individuals or more haploid cells
two opposite types of gametes e g male and female from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote
in the whole cycle zygotes are the only diploid cell mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase
the individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are haplonts hence this life cycle is also called haplontic life cycle
haplonts are
in archaeplastidans some green algae e g chlamydomonas zygnema chara
in stramenopiles some golden algae
in alveolates many dinoflagellates e g ceratium gymnodinium some apicomplexans e g plasmodium
in rhizarians some euglyphids ascetosporeans
in excavates some parabasalids
in amoebozoans dictyostelium
in opisthokonts most fungi some chytrids zygomycetes some ascomycetes basidiomycetes in gametic meiosis instead of immediately dividing meiotically to produce haploid cells the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells
cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or gametes
haploid cells may divide again by mitosis to form more haploid cells as in many yeasts but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase
in most diplonts mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase i e
gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes
in the whole cycle gametes are usually the only haploid cells and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase
the diploid multicellular individual is a diplont hence a gametic meiosis is also called a diplontic life cycle
diplonts are
in archaeplastidans some green algae e g cladophora glomerata acetabularia
in stramenopiles some brown algae the fucales however their life cycle can also be interpreted as strongly heteromorphic diplohaplontic with a highly reduced gametophyte phase as in the flowering plants some xanthophytes e g vaucheria most diatoms some oomycetes e g saprolegnia plasmopara viticola opalines some heliozoans e g actinophrys actinosphaerium
in alveolates ciliates
in excavates some parabasalids
in opisthokonts animals some fungi e g some ascomycetes in sporic meiosis also commonly known as intermediary meiosis the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid sporophyte
the sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which also then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called gametophytes
the gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis
in some plants the gametophyte is not only small sized but also short lived in other plants and many algae the gametophyte is the dominant stage of the life cycle
haplodiplonts are
in archaeplastidans red algae which have two sporophyte generations some green algae e g ulva land plants
in stramenopiles most brown algae
in rhizarians many foraminiferans plasmodiophoromycetes
in amoebozoa myxogastrids
in opisthokonts some fungi some chytrids some ascomycetes like the brewer s yeast
other eukaryotes haptophytessome animals have a sex determination system called haplodiploid but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle
some red algae such as bonnemaisonia and lemanea and green algae such as prasiola have vegetative meiosis also called somatic meiosis which is a rare phenomenon
vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles
the gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte
vegetative non reproductive diploid cells undergo meiosis generating vegetative haploid cells
these undergo many mitosis and produces gametes
a different phenomenon called vegetative diploidization a type of apomixis occurs in some brown algae e g elachista stellaris
cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue
parasites depend on the exploitation of one or more hosts
those that must infect more than one host species to complete their life cycles are said to have complex or indirect life cycles
dirofilaria immitis or the heartworm has an indirect life cycle for example
the microfilariae must first be ingested by a female mosquito where it develops into the infective larval stage
the mosquito then bites an animal and transmits the infective larvae into the animal where they migrate to the pulmonary artery and mature into adults
those parasites that infect a single species have direct life cycles
an example of a parasite with a direct life cycle is ancylostoma caninum or the canine hookworm
they develop to the infective larval stage in the environment then penetrate the skin of the dog directly and mature to adults in the small intestine
if a parasite has to infect a given host in order to complete its life cycle then it is said to be an obligate parasite of that host sometimes infection is facultative the parasite can survive and complete its life cycle without infecting that particular host species
parasites sometimes infect hosts in which they cannot complete their life cycles these are accidental hosts
a host in which parasites reproduce sexually is known as the definitive final or primary host
in intermediate hosts parasites either do not reproduce or do so asexually but the parasite always develops to a new stage in this type of host
in some cases a parasite will infect a host but not undergo any development these hosts are known as paratenic or transport hosts
the paratenic host can be useful in raising the chance that the parasite will be transmitted to the definitive host
for example the cat lungworm aelurostrongylus abstrusus uses a slug or snail as an intermediate host the first stage larva enters the mollusk and develops to the third stage larva which is infectious to the definitive host the cat
if a mouse eats the slug the third stage larva will enter the mouse s tissues but will not undergo any development
the primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction
bacteria and archaea exhibit a life cycle like this and some eukaryotes apparently do too e g cryptophyta choanoflagellata many euglenozoa many amoebozoa some red algae some green algae the imperfect fungi some rotifers and many other groups not necessarily haploid
however these eukaryotes probably are not primitively asexual but have lost their sexual reproduction or it just was not observed yet
many eukaryotes including animals and plants exhibit asexual reproduction which may be facultative or obligate in the life cycle with sexual reproduction occurring more or less frequently
individual organisms participating in a biological life cycle ordinarily age and die while cells from these organisms that connect successive life cycle generations germ line cells and their descendants are potentially immortal
the basis for this difference is a fundamental problem in biology
the russian biologist and historian zhores a
medvedev considered that the accuracy of genome replicative and other synthetic systems alone cannot explain the immortality of germ lines
rather medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of sexual reproduction indicate the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the gametogenesis stage of the biological life cycle
in particular medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of germ cells are created by recombination during meiosis and dna repair he saw these as processes within the germ line cells that were capable of restoring the integrity of dna and chromosomes from the types of damage that cause irreversible ageing in non germ line cells e g
somatic cells
the ancestry of each present day cell presumably traces back in an unbroken lineage for over billion years to the origin of life
it is not actually cells that are immortal but multi generational cell lineages
the immortality of a cell lineage depends on the maintenance of cell division potential
this potential may be lost in any particular lineage because of cell damage terminal differentiation as occurs in nerve cells or programmed cell death apoptosis during development
maintenance of cell division potential of the biological life cycle over successive generations depends on the avoidance and the accurate repair of cellular damage particularly dna damage
in sexual organisms continuity of the germline over successive cell cycle generations depends on the effectiveness of processes for avoiding dna damage and repairing those dna damages that do occur
sexual processes in eukaryotes provide an opportunity for effective repair of dna damages in the germ line by homologous recombination
