despite losing to lithuania the host team won all other matches and captured inaugural title thanks to better head to head point difference among top teams
lithuania and poland took silver and bronze medals respectively
the second world war which began the following year interrupted the organization of women s basketball tournaments for a long time
the next continental championship was held in hungary only years later in
from to women s championships were held biennially each even year unlike men s european basketball championship which were held each odd year
this tournament marked beginning of the era of dominance of the eastern european teams which lasted for next four decades
in the last and decisive match of the final round hosts met with soviet team
hungary led after first half but in the second half soviets players looked much better
they managed to achieve victory and to won its maiden european title

bulgaria took bronze european championship medals for first time
on the next tournament which was held in czechoslovakia in soviet team took gold medals for fourth time in a row by beating hungarians in the final match while hosts took bronze
european championships which was held in d poland became remarkable event
soviet union the winner of four previous tournaments lost european title for first time
in the decisive match of final round bulgaria led by vanya voynova managed to beat soviet team in overtime and to break soviet dominance
this victory was remarkable it s enough to say that this defeat alongside with soviet defeat to united states at the world championship remained the only two defeats in the history of participation of soviet team at all international basketball competitions during very long time till
next year soviet union took revenge by beating bulgaria in the decisive match of the world championship which was held in moscow
the next european championship was held in in sofia bulgaria
soviet team returned european title although this victory was more difficult
they achieved victory over czechoslovakia future bronze medalists with margin of just two points
in the decisive match of final round soviet team again met with bulgaria
after first half bulgarians led with margin of points
however in second half soviet players managed to equal score and then achieve victory in overtime
last minutes and overtime of this match were played in an indoor hall of the national stadium due to rain
two years later european championship was held in france
at the group round soviet union defeated czechoslovakia only in overtime
later both teams reached final match where soviet team won with a bigger advantage
at the next european championships which was held in hungary soviet team won third title in a row by beating bulgaria in the final match with margin of just two points
two years later at the european championships in romania soviet team won over czechoslovakia in a final match
european championships which was held in italy became debut for legendary center u jana iulijaka semjonova
this giant meter tall player played key role in soviet team for next years
from to she played at european championships and always won gold
before semjonova s debut the vast majority of decisive matches were ended with favour of soviet team but with relatively close margin
with semjonova in the squad the superiority of soviet union over opponents became overwhelming
other prominent european basketball national teams at that time such as czechoslovakia bulgaria or hungary were huge step behind the soviet union
soviet team played games during these tournaments and the slimmest margin of victory was points
another architect of the success of soviet basketball was lidiya alekseyeva who took direct participation in soviet victories at the european championships firstly as team captain titles from to then as assistant coach and later as a head coach of national team record titles from to
soviet team was unbeaten not only in europe but also in the world
from to soviet union won all international competitions in which they participated without losing any match european championships world championships and and olympic tournaments and
after the olympic games and european championships it was decided to hold women s continental tournament biennially each odd year just like men s european basketball championship
soviet team continued to win but in late s as a result of changing of generation their superiority became not such overwhelming as it was before
in they suffered first defeats at international competition for years at first they lost to united states at the decisive match of the goodwill games with margin of points and next month they lost to us team with margin of points in the final match of home world championship both matches were played in moscow
nevertheless soviet team continued to dominate at european area
they won european championship held in spain after beating czechoslovakia in semifinals and yugoslavia in the final match
but next year at the summer olympics in seoul south korea yugoslavia managed to perform better they took silver medals by losing just points to us team in the final match while soviet team surprisingly failed to reach final and unexpectively finished only at third place for first time in their history
at the group round of the european championship held in bulgaria soviet team defeated czechoslovakia and netherlands with margin of just points and respectively and then reached final where defeated czechoslovakia once again with same margin
but at the world championship in malaysia soviet union lost in the second group round to czechoslovakia and yugoslavia and finished only at fifth place
it was first and only time when soviet team failed to reach podium at the international competition where they participated
like two years ago yugoslavia took silver medals after losing to us in the final match
at the next european championship held in israel yugoslavia managed to beat soviet team at the group round
it was only second defeat of soviet union at the continental championships and the first since
despite this defeat soviet team reached final match where met with yugoslavia once again
in this final yugoslavia led with margin of points after first half but in the second half soviet players managed to change situation and won match with margin of points
it was last participation of soviet team at the european championships
their dominance at this tournament was simply unimaginable
the facts speak for itself participation in championships resulted in titles as european champions matches and wins the only two defeats in overtime to bulgaria in and one point defeat by yugoslavia in including consecutive wins between and
it s hard to imagine that any other team from any other sport could ever equal these amazing achievement
next year the former soviet players who completed for unified team at the summer olympics in barcelona spain as a result of soviet union s dissolution in december managed to achieve surprising success after shocking victory over united states in semifinals and victory over china in the final match
there was last participation of soviet basketball at the international competitions and true true swan song of soviet team which ceased to exist after that
during four decades vast majority of the european championships ended with very predictable results soviet union took gold medals while silver and bronze medals went to other eastern european teams
however in early s situation totally changed after dissolution of soviet union sfr yugoslavia and czechoslovakia
it opened way for the success of other national teams and made european championships much less predictable
at the european championships which was held in italy slovakia took bronze medals and became only newly formed national team who managed to reach podium
for the first time two western european teams played in the final match spain took their maiden european title by beating france
it s remarkable that not one of medalists reached the podium at the next european championships which was held in czech republic
led by olympic champions maryna tkachenko and olena zhyrko ukraine became the first post soviet national team to win european title after victories over russia in semifinals and over italy in the final match
russian team also took podium after beating slovakia in the bronze medal match
