A leotard ˈliːətɑːrd is a unisex skin-tight one-piece garment that covers the torso from the crotch to the shoulder
The garment was made famous by the French acrobatic performer Jules Lotard
There are sleeveless short-sleeved and long-sleeved leotards
A variation is the unitard which also covers the legs
Leotards are worn by acrobats gymnasts dancers figure skaters athletes actors wrestlers and circus performers both as practice garments and performance costumes
They are often worn with ballet skirts on top and tights or sometimes bike shorts as underwear
As a casual garment a leotard can be worn with a belt it can also be worn under overalls or short skirts
Leotards are entered by stepping into the legs and pulling the sleeves over the shoulders
Scoop-necked leotards have wide neck openings and are held in place by the elasticity of the garment
Others are crew necked or polo necked and close at the back of the neck with a zipper or snaps
Leotards are used for a variety of purposes including yoga exercise dance particularly for ballet andor modern as pajamas for additional layered warmth under clothing and for recreational and casual wear
They may form a part of children's dressing up and play outfits and can also be worn as a top
Leotards are commonly worn in figure skating postwar modern dance acrobatic rock'n'roll traditional ballet and gymnastics especially by young children
Practice leotards and those worn in podium training sessions are usually sleeveless
Female competition garments for gymnastics and skating are almost always long-sleeved while male competition leotards may be sleeved or sleeveless the latter more common in gymnastics the former in figure skating
Leotards come in many styles — either with a full seated bottom or as a thong or T-front thong for maximum comfort and avoidance of visible panty lines when worn under leggings or tights
Many full-back leotards are cut high enough above the legs that they expose underwear
For this reason underwear is often omitted or special underwear cut high on the waist is worn
Gymnastics judges can deduct points for visible underwear
For example in the movie Stick It a competitor had her score reduced for a technicality of showing a bra strap
The first known use of the name leotard came only in many years after Jules Lotard's death
Lotard himself called the garment a maillot which is a general French word for different types of tight-fitting shirts or sports shirts
In the early th century leotards were mainly confined to circus and acrobatic shows worn by the specialists who performed these acts
The s and s saw leotards influencing the style of swimsuits with women's one-piece swimsuits today still being similar in appearance to leotards
Leotards are worn by professional dancers such as the showgirls of Broadway
Stage use of the leotard typically coordinates the garment with stockings or tights
In the s traditionally-styled leotards continued to be worn mainly by stage performers and circus actors but leotards began to be used as simple and functional exercise garments often in institutional settings like schools and in fitness training
These were almost always black and worn together with thick tights
Between and leotards remained as such in appearance until a style change in the s with more colorful leotards appearing on the scene most often in ballet and exercise
During the s and s leotards were extensively used as clothing for aerobic exercises eventually displaced in the s by Lycra pants similar to those used in cycling uniforms and in the s they were replaced completely by trousers and leggings tight clothing which cover the legs made of spandex and denim
It continues to be also worn by women cyclists and athletes in competitions
By the late s leotards had become common both as exercise and street wear popularized by the disco craze and aerobics fashion craze of the time
These leotards were produced in a variety of nylon and spandex materials as well as the more traditional cotton previously used for uni-colored leotards and tights
Exercise videos by celebrities such as Jane Fonda also did much to popularize the garment
The dancewear company Danskin flourished during this period producing a wide variety of leotards for both dance and street wear
Other companies such as Gilda Marx produced leotards during this time period then ceased production when they ceased to be in fashion
By the late s leotards for exercise wear had become little more than bikini bottoms with straps over the shoulders generally worn with cropped shirts
From the mid-s to mid s leotards usually cap sleeved style or sometime in colder weather a long sleeved turtleneck style both popularly worn as tops with jeans especially skinny jeans and high waisted ankle length mom jeans under shortalls or with casual or dress pants as part of everyday wear
They were also worn with skirts outfits
By the mid-s leotards had been almost completely replaced for exercise wear by the sports bra and shorts
Leotards are a versatile garment that can either be dressed up or dressed down
The illustration of Beyonc shows a stage costume that has been heavily embellished with sequins and sparkles
Among exercise garments leotards may be seen along with other types of garments such as T-shirts crop tops and tights
For females the standard gymnastic competition uniform is a leotard
Traditionally competition leotards have always had long sleeves however half-length sleeved and sleeveless garments are now permitted under the Code of Points and have been worn by teams at the World Gymnastics Championships and other major events
Practice leotards and those worn in podium training sessions are generally sleeveless
In the s leotards were typically made from polyester and related fabrics
Since the s however they have been made from lycra or spandex
Since the s leotards have become more elaborate and have employed a variety of textiles including velvet velour mesh metallic fabrics foils and iridescent hologram fabric
They can also be decorated with rhinestones and metallic jewels that are heat-set onto the garments and will not fall or wash off
Leotards cannot be cut above hip height or be cut past the shoulder blades back or front
Any leotard that is somewhat see-through is also against the rules
Usage of white tights is not standard
In rare instances gymnasts and teams have been penalized with score deductions for their attire
For competitions male gymnasts wear two layers of clothing
The first a singlet or comp shirt short for competition shirt is a sleeveless leotard
For floor and vault gymnasts wear a pair of very short shorts over the singlet
For their other events they wear a pair of long pants attached to the bottom of the feet with stirrups
Unlike women's uniforms which generally employ metallic or iridescent fabrics men's uniforms are usually matte-colored and less ornate
Singlets usually employ one or more of the national team colors but there are no restrictions on design
Shorts and pants are generally a solid color usually white blue red or black
Olympic gymnastics team leotards have dramatically changed from their first memorable designs
Over time the emphasis on what leotards are intended to do has changed
Originally the intent was to cover as much of a woman's body as possible while today leotards must breathe improve aerodynamics and seamlessly re-shape as female athletes bend twist and contort their way through increasingly difficult routines
When Jules Lotard created the maillot it was intended for men
This style of leotard can be seen in early th century photos of the circus 'strong man'
Men's leotards evolved along with the women's style eventually resembling it except that the men's version had a slightly lower-cut leg opening and a lower-cut front
Unlike their female counterparts however men's leotards come in two styles—either with a full seated bottom or as a thong
The reason for this is apparent when worn with tights such as in ballet where lines created by the garment underneath the tights would look unsightly
In such instances a dance belt is also worn
Leotards are commonly worn by male dancers particularly for ballet and gymnasts
Leotard-like garments often of the biketard or singlet type are also often worn by men in sports such as rowing wrestling cycling and running to maintain a tight fit and stop the upper part of the clothing from running up
