over time the emphasis on what leotards are intended to do has changed
originally the intent was to cover as much of a woman s body as possible while today leotards must breathe improve aerodynamics and seamlessly re shape as female athletes bend twist and contort their way through increasingly difficult routines
when jules l otard created the maillot it was intended for men
this style of leotard can be seen in early th century photos of the circus strong man
men s leotards evolved along with the women s style eventually resembling it except that the men s version had a slightly lower cut leg opening and a lower cut front
unlike their female counterparts however men s leotards come in two styles either with a full seated bottom or as a thong
the reason for this is apparent when worn with tights such as in ballet where lines created by the garment underneath the tights would look unsightly
in such instances a dance belt is also worn
leotards are commonly worn by male dancers particularly for ballet and gymnasts
leotard like garments often of the biketard or singlet type are also often worn by men in sports such as rowing wrestling cycling and running to maintain a tight fit and stop the upper part of the clothing from running up
