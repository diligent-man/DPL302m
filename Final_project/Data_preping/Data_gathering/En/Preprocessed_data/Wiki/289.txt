true to your heart is the end credits song of disney s animated film mulan and one of two singles released off the soundtrack
it was written by matthew wilder and david zippel and performed by american recording artists degrees and stevie wonder
the song was also included on the band s second album degrees and rising
critics felt the song was vibrant but ultimately seemed out of place in the mulan film and soundtrack
matthew wilder david zippel had written the song originally for hanson but the deal eventually fell through
they were subsequently asked to alter the song to give it a stevie wonder feel
the writers previously had the opportunity to work with famous performers like dubbing artist marni nixon though were excited and astonished to work with wonder
wilder recalled while sitting in the studio waiting for wonder s arrival some guy walks in and sets up a keyboard and then walks out with saying a word
after several hours passed wonder finally arrived
i peaked my head out into the hallway in time to see him floating down this long hallway in this floor length dashiki
he looked like an african god wilder and zippel didn t have a clear collaboration in mind when calling wonder into the studio
initially they had asked him to play harmonica on the track
wonder said that he liked the song describing it as a song i would ve written back in the s and i m into it and offered to sing on it
meanwhile degrees had recently released their debut album with just one single invisible man and the album failed to chart
the band s next creative step following this was to explore the international markets of asia and europe and record true to your heart with stevie wonder for disney s mulan soundtrack which led them to wider recognition
the song was released as the first single off the soundtrack and was nominated for the grammy awards in the category of best song written specifically for a motion picture or for television
the song has different lyrics in the movie than on the soundtrack
the song reached on the adult contemporary chart in
sandy and jr
interpreted the song in portuguese as seu cora o
raven symon recorded a cover of the song in for the soundtrack to ella enchanted and disneymania
both versions were released on s mulan special edition
