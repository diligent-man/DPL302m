british israelism also called anglo israelism is the pseudoarchaeological pseudohistorical and pseudoreligious belief that the people of the british isles are genetically racially and linguistically the direct descendants of the ten lost tribes of ancient israel
with roots in the th century british israelism was inspired by several th century english writings such as john wilson s our israelitish origin
numerous british israelite organisations were set up throughout the british empire as well as in the united states from the s onwards a number of these organisations are independently active as of the early st century
in america the idea gave rise to the christian identity movement
the central tenets of british israelism have been refuted by evidence from modern archaeological ethnological genetic and linguistic research
according to brackney and fine the french huguenot magistrate m
le loyer s the ten lost tribes published in provided one of the earliest expressions of the belief that the anglo saxon celtic scandinavian germanic and associated peoples are the direct descendants of the old testament israelites
anglo israelism has also been attributed to francis drake and king james vi and i who believed he was the king of israel
adriaan van schrieck who influenced henry spelman and john sadler wrote in the early th century about his ideas on the origins of the celtic and saxon peoples
in sadler published the rights of the kingdom which argues for an israelite genealogy for the british people
aspects of british israelism and its influences have also been traced to richard brothers who published a revealed knowledge of the prophecies and times in john wilson s our israelitish origin and john pym yeatman s the shemetic origin of the nations of western europe
british israelism arose in england then spread to the united states
british israelists cite various supposedly medieval manuscripts to claim an older origin but british israelism as a distinct movement appeared in the early s
the extent to which the british clergy became aware of the existence of the movement may be gauged by the comment which cardinal john henry newman made when he was asked why he had left the church of england in in order to join the roman catholic church
he said that there was a very real danger that the movement would take over the church of england
in the late th century edward hine edward wheler bird and herbert aldersmith developed the british israelite movement
hine and bird achieved a degree of doctrinal coherence by eliminating competing forms of the ideology in the anglo ephraim association of london which followed wilson by accepting the broader community of western european germanic peoples as fellow israelites who were also favoured by god was absorbed into bird s metropolitan anglo israel association which espoused the anglo exclusive view promoted by hine
by the anglo israel association had affiliated groups throughout britain
hine later departed for the united states where he promoted the movement
the edition of the jewish encyclopedia stated that british israelism s adherents are said to number in england and the united states an unreliable figure if association membership and journal subscription numbers are any guide the number of passive protestant sympathisers is almost impossible to determine
between and adherents of british israelism dug up parts of the hill of tara in the belief that the ark of the covenant was buried there doing much damage to one of ireland s most ancient royal and archaeological sites
at the same time british israelism became associated with various pseudo archaeological pyramidology theories such as the notion that the pyramid of khufu contained a prophetic numerology of the british peoples
in the thirty fourth year of its publication the anglo israel almanac listed the details of a large number of kingdom identity groups which were operating independently throughout the british isles as well as in australia new zealand south africa canada and the united states of america
in the british israel world federation biwf was founded in london and covenant publishing was founded in
william pascoe goard was the first director of the publishing house
during this time several prominent figures patronized the biwf organization and its publisher princess alice countess of athlone was patron in chief prior to world war ii
one of its highest profile members was william massey then prime minister of new zealand
due to the expansive nature of the british empire believers in british israelism spread worldwide and the biwf expanded its organization to the commonwealth
howard rand promoted the teaching and became national commissioner of the anglo saxon federation of america in
he published the bulletin later renamed the messenger of the covenant
more recently it has been renamed destiny
during its peak in the early th century british israelism was also supported by john fisher st baron fisher
a prolific author on british israelism during the later s and s was alexander james ferris
the biwf continues to exist with its main headquarters located in bishop auckland in county durham
it also has chapters in australia canada the netherlands new zealand and south africa
in one source estimated that there were between and british israelites in britain
there the theology of british israelism has been taught by a few small pentecostal churches
the post imperial era brought about a change in orientation of the british israelists reflected in a corresponding change in the social class from which their membership predominantly derived
in its years of initial growth it could depend on the spread of fundamentalist religion in the country the emotional appeal of imperialism and a belief in the unrivaled power of the british economy to expand a middle class membership that viewed it as the divine duty of the nation as god s chosen people to rule and civilize the world
the dissipation of these factors by the mid th century changed the focus of the movement to one of concern over social and moral decline including the degredation of social status and of monarchical absolutism
societal changes were seen as portents of a coming apocalypse and signals of a nation in need of redemption
a fantasized society of victorian moral rectitude and imperialism lacking socialism bureaucrats intellectuals and income tax would come to be viewed by the movement now drawing its support from the well to do as the ideal that modern british society should emulate
adherents believe that the twelve tribes of israel are the twelve sons of the patriarch jacob who was later named israel
jacob elevated the descendants of ephraim and manasseh the two sons of joseph to the status of full tribes in their own right replacing the tribe of joseph
a division occurred among the twelve tribes in the days of jeroboam and rehoboam with the three tribes of judah benjamin and in part levi forming the kingdom of judah and the remaining ten tribes forming the kingdom of israel samaria
thus they argue the great bulk of israelites are not the jews
filmer writing in suggested that the fact that some jews continue to search for the ten lost tribes implies that their representatives are not found among modern day multi ethnic jews
a number of british israelites quote josephus in order to support their claim that the lost tribes of israel are not jews the entire body of the people of israel remained in that country wherefore there are but two tribes in asia and europe subject to the romans while the ten tribes are beyond the euphrates till now and are an immense multitude
the key component of british israelism is its representation of the migrations of the lost tribes of israel
adherents suggested that the scythians cimmerians and goths were representatives of these lost tribes and the progenitors of the later invaders of britain
john wilson would argue for the inclusion of all western european gothic peoples among the descendants of the israelites but under the later influence of edward hine the movement would come to view only the peoples of the british isles as having this ancestry
herodotus reported that the ancient persians called all of the scythians sacae but they called themselves scoloti
however a modern comparison of the forms which are given in other ancient languages suggests that skuda was their name
ancient writers such as josephus and jerome would associate the scythians with the peoples of gog and magog but british israelist etymologists would see in sacae a name derived from the biblical isaac claiming that the appearance of the scythians where they claimed the lost tribes were last documented also supported a connection
further british israelists find support in the superficial resemblance between king jehu s pointed headdress and that of the captive saka king seen to the far right on the behistun rock
the chain of etymological identification leading from isaac to the sacae was continued to the saxons interpreted as sac s sons the sons of isaac who are portrayed as invading england from denmark the land of the tribe of dan
they saw the same tribal name left by the wanderers in the dardanelles the danube macedonia dunkirk dunglow in ireland dundee in scotland sweden and london and ascribed to this lost tribe the mythical irish tuatha d danann
in the name of the british they see berithish referring to the hebrew covenant with god
bede died had linked the picts to the scythians but british israelists suggested that he had confused the two tribes of scotland and that it was the scotti scots who were one with the scoloti scyths of herodotus
they drew particular support from the derivation of the scots from the scythians found in the declaration of arbroath reflecting a tradition related in the th century historia brittonum that the scots descended from the union of a scythian exile with scota daughter of a pharaoh a tale found in some form in several other early th century historical and poetic sources
the declaration begins
most holy father and lord we know and from the chronicles and books of the ancients we find that among other famous nations our own the scots has been graced with widespread renown
they journeyed from greater scythia by way of the tyrrhenian sea and the pillars of hercules and dwelt for a long course of time in spain among the most savage tribes but nowhere could they be subdued by any race however barbarous
thence they came twelve hundred years after the people of israel crossed the red sea to their home in the west where they still live today british israel associations cite the declaration as evidence for the link between the scots and the scythians and hence the lost tribes as had been proposed by the early british israelist etymologists
other celtic invaders would be given an analogous descent
in the welsh cymry the british israelists would see a direct connection through the cimbri to the cimmerians the gimirri of assyrian annals a name sometimes also given by the ancient babylonians to the scythians and saka
perceived similarity between this and the name by which the assyrian annals referred to israel bit khumri would lead the british israelists to claim that the welsh too were members of the lost tribes
according to the anglo israelists these claimed connections would make the british the literal descendants of the lost tribes and thus inheritors of the promises made to the israelites in the old testament
some adherents further claim that the british royal family is of lineal descent from the house of king david via a daughter of zedekiah the last king of judah
according to this legend the prophet jeremiah and his scribe baruch escaped with the king s daughters jer
to egypt
they later travelled to ireland where one of the surviving judahite princesses tea tephi married a local high king of ireland
from this fabled union the davidic throne was supposedly preserved having been transferred to ireland then scotland and later england whence the british monarchs are alleged to have descended
the stone of scone which has been used in the coronations of scottish english and british monarchs for centuries is traditionally claimed to be identical to both the pillow stone which was used by the biblical patriarch jacob and the coronation stone of king david
a commonly held british israel doctrine is the belief that the tribe of ephraim and the tribe of manasseh can be identified as modern day britain and the united states of america
part of the foundation of the british israel doctrine is the theological claim that particular blessings were bestowed upon three of the tribes of israel in that the tribe of judah was to be the chief ruler e g
king david and ephraim was to receive the birthright see jacob and esau
adherents believe that these blessings have continued down through the ages to modern times with the british monarchy being identified as the continued blessing upon judah and both britain ephraim and the usa manasseh as recipients of the national birthright blessing
they cite passages such as chron and gen in order to support their claim
british israelism has been criticized for its poor research and scholarship
in the edition of the encyclop dia britannica an article which summarizes the theology of british israelism contains the statement that the theory of british israelism rests on premises which are deemed by scholars both theological and anthropological to be utterly unsound
current scholarship is not consistent with the claims of british israelism with scholars drawing attention to its historical and linguistic inaccuracies in addition to its links to antisemitism
hale refers to the overwhelming cultural historical and genetic evidence against it
critics of british israelism note that the arguments which are presented by promoters of the teaching are based on unsubstantiated and highly speculative amateur research
tudor parfitt author of the lost tribes the history of a myth states that the proof cited by adherents of british israelism is of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre
some proponents of british israelism have claimed that numerous links exist between historical linguistics ancient hebrew and various european place names and languages
this can be traced to the works of john wilson in the th century
the self trained wilson looked for similarities in the sounds of words and argued that many scottish british and irish words stemmed from ancient hebrew words
wilson s publications inspired the development of british israel language associations in europe
modern scholarly linguistic analysis conclusively shows that the languages of the british isles english welsh and gaelic belong in the indo european language family while hebrew belongs in the semitic branch of the afro asiatic language family
lounsbury stated that no trace of the slightest real connection can be discovered between english and ancient hebrew while in michael friedman refuted claims that hebrew was closely related to celtic and anglo saxon when he wrote that the actual evidence could hardly be any weaker
others have addressed the specific word relationships proposed
russell spittler says of the disputable etymological claims made by the british israelists that they have no ample basis in linguistic scholarship and are based on coincidences only william ingram would present arguments made by british israelism as examples of tortured etymology
adherents of british israelism cite various scriptures in support of the argument that the lost northern israelite tribes migrated through europe to end up in britain
dimont argues that british israelists misunderstand and misinterpret the meaning of these scriptures
one such case is the distinction that british israelists make between the jews of the southern kingdom and the israelites of the northern kingdom
they believe that the bible consistently distinguishes the two groups
dimont says that many of these scriptures are misinterpreted because after the captivities the distinction between jews and israelites was lost over time
british israelists believe that the northern tribes of israel lost their identity after the captivity in assyria and that this is reflected in the bible
dimont disagrees with this assertion and argues that only higher ranking israelites were deported from israel and many israelites remained
he cites examples after the assyrian captivity such as josiah king of judah who received money from the tribes of manasseh and ephraim and all the remnant of israel chronicles and hezekiah who sent invitations not only to judah but also to northern israel for the attendance of a passover in jerusalem
chronicles british israelites interpret chronicles as referring to scythians
dimont is also critical of the interpretations of biblical prophecy embraced by the movement saying texts are torn from their context and misapplied without the slightest regard to their original meaning
british israelism rests on linking different ancient populations
this includes linking the lost tribes of israel with the scythians cimmerians celts and modern western europeans such as the british
to support these links some adherents believe that similarities exist between various cultural aspects of these population groups and they argue that these links demonstrate the migration of the lost israelites in a westerly direction
examples given include burial customs metalwork clothing dietary customs and more
dimont argues that the customs of the scythians and the cimmerians are in contrast to those of the ancient israelites and he further dismisses the connection between these populations and the saxons and celts particularly criticizing the then current formulations of british israelism that would interject semites between the closely related english and germans
the scythian origin of the scots has been referred to as mythical
algernon herbert writing in characterized the linguistic derivation of scots from scoloti as strictly impossible and merrill referred to it as false etymology
addressing their view on the fate of the exiled tribes frank boys said of their voluminous output all the effort to write these volumes might well have been saved on the premise that they were never lost which we believe to be the correct one
parfitt suggests that the creation of british israelism was inspired by numerous ideological factors which included a desire of its adherents many of whom were from ordinary backgrounds to prove that they had a glorious past emerging pride in western imperialism and colonialism and a belief in the racial superiority of white anglo saxon protestants
aikau characterized the movement as being fundamentally about providing a rationale for anglo saxon superiority to kidd its theology represents a quasi heresy which serves to blunt the universalist message apparent in the new testament its role in fostering antisemitism in conservative protestant christianity has been noted by historians along with its role in fostering a feeling of racial chauvinism which is not always covert
separately the mythology of british israelism has been characterized as fostering nationalistic bellicosity by historians
to some adherents british israelism served as a justification for british imperialism and american settler colonialism along with the displacement of indigenous peoples which subsequently followed them
british israelism along with explicitly racist anglo saxon triumphalism was rapidly growing in england when the united states based latter day saint movement sent its first missionaries to england
british israelist ideas clearly influenced mormon thought by the s and by the s mormon periodicals being published in britain were citing british israelist proponents to promote the belief that most mormons were of anglo saxon and israelite descent concepts that would subsequently be synthesized into general mormon discourse
several individuals who were influential in the founding of pentecostalism embraced the tenets of british israelism
the british israel inspired self identification of anglo saxon peoples with the jewish nation and the promises made to them by their god would significantly contribute to the belief held by several prominent proto and early pentecostals that they would play a central role in the end times
notable among them was john alexander dowie who spoke about plans for anglo saxon christians to take control of jerusalem in order to prepare for the second coming
this legacy was continued by charles fox parham who instead believed that the lost tribes would join their jewish brethren in order to reestablish the nation of israel
his was a more expansive view of the lost tribes than dowie s encompassing not only anglo saxons but also scandinavians danes high germans and even hindus and japanese who according to parham had acquired the blood of abraham through intermarriage and hence they were eligible to take part in his end time drama
british isralist beliefs would soon be marginalized in the movement but its influences could still be seen in the teachings of several key leaders in the mid th century
in britain the espousal of british israelism by george jeffreys founder of the elim pentecostal church led to a schism which precipitated his resignation in and led to the formation of the bible pattern church fellowship which continues to teach the doctrine
beginning in the s the teaching of british israelism was vigorously promoted by herbert w
armstrong founder and pastor general of the worldwide church of god
armstrong believed that the teaching was key to the understanding of biblical prophecy one might ask were not biblical prophecies closed and sealed indeed they were until now and even now they can be understood only by those who possess the master key to unlock them armstrong believed that god commanded him to proclaim the prophecies to the lost tribes of israel before the end times
armstrong s belief caused his separation from the church of god seventh day because of its refusal to adopt the teaching
armstrong founded his own church first named the radio church of god and later renamed the worldwide church of god
he described british israelism as a central plank of his theology
after armstrong s death his former church abandoned its belief in british israelism and in it changed its name to grace communion international gci
it offers an explanation for the doctrine s origin as well as an explanation for the church s renunciation of the doctrine on its official website
church members who refused to accept these doctrinal changes left the worldwide church of god gci and founded their own offshoot churches
many of these organizations still teach british israelism among them are the philadelphia church of god the living church of god and the united church of god
armstrong promoted other genealogical history theories such as the belief that modern day germany represents ancient assyria see assyria and germany in anglo israelism writing the assyrians settled in central europe and the germans undoubtedly are in part the descendants of the ancient assyrians
early british israelites such as edward hine and john wilson were philo semites
british israelism had several jewish adherents and it also received support from rabbis throughout the th century
within british politics the movement supported benjamin disraeli who was descended from sephardi jews and they also supported theodor herzl s advocacy of zionism
however an anti semitic strain also existed below the surface such as the scientific racialism that led wilson to deny the racial purity of modern day jews leading some within the movement to adopt the belief that modern day jews were un semitic impostors some american adherents of british israelism would later adopt a racialized strongly anti semitic theology that became known as christian identity which has at its core the belief that non caucasian people have no souls and therefore cannot be saved
since its emergence in the s christian identity has taught the belief that jews are not descended from the tribe of judah
instead some christian identity adherents believe that jews are descended from satan and lilith see serpent seed while others believe that jews are descended from edomite khazars see khazar hypothesis of ashkenazi ancestry
their adoption of the british israelist belief that the israelite derived anglo saxons had been favoured by god over the impure modern jews meant that a reluctantly anti semitic klansman could now maintain his anti semitism and at the same time revere a bible cleansed of its jewish taint the arrival of british israelism in the united states contributed to the transmission of anti semitic notions into the christian identity movement
one of the leading proponents of the movement after world war ii reverend wesley a

swift was a student and a minister at aimee semple mcpherson s pentecostal foursquare church for several years during the s and s
