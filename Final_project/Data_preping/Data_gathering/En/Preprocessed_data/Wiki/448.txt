general mental disorder classified separately neurological disorder learning disability intellectual disability
unlike dsm icd approach based identifying distinct category disorder using dichotomous symptom profile intended separate abnormal normal
significant scientific debate relative merit categorical versus non-categorical hybrid scheme also known continuum dimensional models
scientific academic literature definition classification mental disorder one extreme argues entirely matter value judgement including normal another proposes could entirely objective scientific including reference statistical norms
common hybrid view argue concept mental disorder objective even fuzzy prototype never precisely defined conversely concept always involves mixture scientific fact subjective value judgments
although diagnostic category referred 'disorders' presented medical disease validated way medical diagnoses
neurologist argue classification reliable valid based neurobiological feature rather clinical interview others suggest differing ideological practical perspective need better integrated
dsm icd approach remains attack implied causality model researcher believe better aim underlying brain difference precede symptom many years
high degree comorbidity disorder categorical model dsm icd led propose dimensional models
studying comorbidity disorder demonstrated two latent unobserved factor dimension structure mental disorder thought possibly reflect etiological processes
two dimension reflect distinction internalizing disorder mood anxiety symptom externalizing disorder behavioral substance use symptoms

long-term international study schizophrenia found half individual recover term symptom around fifth third term symptom functioning many requiring medication
serious difficulty support need many year late recovery still plausible
world health organization concluded long-term studies' finding converged others relieving patient carers clinician chronicity paradigm dominated thinking throughout much century
follow-up study tohen coworkers revealed around half people initially diagnosed bipolar disorder achieve symptomatic recovery longer meeting criterion diagnosis within six week nearly achieve within two year nearly half regaining prior occupational residential status period
le half go experience new episode mania major depression within next two years
disorder may limited functional effect others may involve substantial disability support needs
