a mental disorder also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning
such features may be persistent relapsing and remitting or occur as single episodes
many disorders have been described with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders
such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional usually a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist
the causes of mental disorders are often unclear
theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields
mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves feels perceives or thinks
this may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain often in a social context
a mental disorder is one aspect of mental health
cultural and religious beliefs as well as social norms should be taken into account when making a diagnosis
services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists psychologists psychiatric nurses and clinical social workers using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning
treatments are provided by various mental health professionals
psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options
other treatments include lifestyle changes social interventions peer support and self help
in a minority of cases there might be involuntary detention or treatment
prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression
in common mental disorders around the globe include depression which affects about million bipolar disorder which affects about million dementia which affects about million and schizophrenia and other psychoses which affects about million people
neurodevelopmental disorders include intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders which usually arise in infancy or childhood
stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion
the definition and classification of mental disorders are key issues for researchers as well as service providers and those who may be diagnosed
for a mental state to classify as a disorder it generally needs to cause dysfunction
most international clinical documents use the term mental disorder while illness is also common
it has been noted that using the term mental i e of the mind is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from the brain or body
according to dsm iv a mental disorder is a psychological syndrome or pattern which is associated with distress e g
via a painful symptom disability impairment in one or more important areas of functioning increased risk of death or causes a significant loss of autonomy however it excludes normal responses such as grief from loss of a loved one and also excludes deviant behavior for political religious or societal reasons not arising from a dysfunction in the individual
dsm iv predicates the definition with caveats stating that as in the case with many medical terms mental disorder lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations noting that different levels of abstraction can be used for medical definitions including pathology symptomology deviance from a normal range or etiology and that the same is true for mental disorders so that sometimes one type of definition is appropriate and sometimes another depending on the situation
in the american psychiatric association apa redefined mental disorders in the dsm as a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual s cognition emotion regulation or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning the final draft of icd contains a very similar definition
the terms mental breakdown or nervous breakdown may be used by the general population to mean a mental disorder
the terms nervous breakdown and mental breakdown have not been formally defined through a medical diagnostic system such as the dsm or icd and are nearly absent from scientific literature regarding mental illness
although nervous breakdown is not rigorously defined surveys of laypersons suggest that the term refers to a specific acute time limited reactive disorder involving symptoms such as anxiety or depression usually precipitated by external stressors
many health experts today refer to a nervous breakdown as a mental health crisis
additionally to the concept of mental disorder some people have argued for a return to the old fashioned concept of nervous illness
in how everyone became depressed the rise and fall of the nervous breakdown edward shorter a professor of psychiatry and the history of medicine says
there are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders
icd chapter v mental and behavioural disorders since part of the international classification of diseases produced by the who
the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm produced by the apa since both of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis
they have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable although significant differences remain
other classification schemes may be used in non western cultures for example the chinese classification of mental disorders and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions such as the psychodynamic diagnostic manual
in general mental disorders are classified separately from neurological disorders learning disabilities or intellectual disability
unlike the dsm and icd some approaches are not based on identifying distinct categories of disorder using dichotomous symptom profiles intended to separate the abnormal from the normal
there is significant scientific debate about the relative merits of categorical versus such non categorical or hybrid schemes also known as continuum or dimensional models
a spectrum approach may incorporate elements of both
in the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements including of what is normal while another proposes that it is or could be entirely objective and scientific including by reference to statistical norms
common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective even if only a fuzzy prototype that can never be precisely defined or conversely that the concept always involves a mixture of scientific facts and subjective value judgments
although the diagnostic categories are referred to as disorders they are presented as medical diseases but are not validated in the same way as most medical diagnoses
some neurologists argue that classification will only be reliable and valid when based on neurobiological features rather than clinical interview while others suggest that the differing ideological and practical perspectives need to be better integrated
the dsm and icd approach remains under attack both because of the implied causality model and because some researchers believe it better to aim at underlying brain differences which can precede symptoms by many years
the high degree of comorbidity between disorders in categorical models such as the dsm and icd have led some to propose dimensional models
studying comorbidity between disorders have demonstrated two latent unobserved factors or dimensions in the structure of mental disorders that are thought to possibly reflect etiological processes
these two dimensions reflect a distinction between internalizing disorders such as mood or anxiety symptoms and externalizing disorders such as behavioral or substance use symptoms
a single general factor of psychopathology similar to the g factor for intelligence has been empirically supported
the p factor model supports the internalizing externalizing distinction but also supports the formation of a third dimension of thought disorders such as schizophrenia
biological evidence also supports the validity of the internalizing externalizing structure of mental disorders with twin and adoption studies supporting heritable factors for externalizing and internalizing disorders
a leading dimensional model is the hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology
there are many different categories of mental disorder and many different facets of human behavior and personality that can become disordered
an anxiety disorder is anxiety or fear that interferes with normal functioning may be classified as an anxiety disorder
commonly recognized categories include specific phobias generalized anxiety disorder social anxiety disorder panic disorder agoraphobia obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder
other affective emotion mood processes can also become disordered
mood disorder involving unusually intense and sustained sadness melancholia or despair is known as major depression also known as unipolar or clinical depression
milder but still prolonged depression can be diagnosed as dysthymia
bipolar disorder also known as manic depression involves abnormally high or pressured mood states known as mania or hypomania alternating with normal or depressed moods
the extent to which unipolar and bipolar mood phenomena represent distinct categories of disorder or mix and merge along a dimension or spectrum of mood is subject to some scientific debate
patterns of belief language use and perception of reality can become dysregulated e g delusions thought disorder hallucinations
psychotic disorders in this domain include schizophrenia and delusional disorder
schizoaffective disorder is a category used for individuals showing aspects of both schizophrenia and affective disorders
schizotypy is a category used for individuals showing some of the characteristics associated with schizophrenia but without meeting cutoff criteria
personality the fundamental characteristics of a person that influence thoughts and behaviors across situations and time may be considered disordered if judged to be abnormally rigid and maladaptive
although treated separately by some the commonly used categorical schemes include them as mental disorders albeit on a separate axis ii in the case of the dsm iv
a number of different personality disorders are listed including those sometimes classed as eccentric such as paranoid schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders types that have described as dramatic or emotional such as antisocial borderline histrionic or narcissistic personality disorders and those sometimes classed as fear related such as anxious avoidant dependent or obsessive compulsive personality disorders
personality disorders in general are defined as emerging in childhood or at least by adolescence or early adulthood
the icd also has a category for enduring personality change after a catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness
if an inability to sufficiently adjust to life circumstances begins within three months of a particular event or situation and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated it may instead be classed as an adjustment disorder
there is an emerging consensus that personality disorders similar to personality traits in general incorporate a mixture of acute dysfunctional behaviors that may resolve in short periods and maladaptive temperamental traits that are more enduring
furthermore there are also non categorical schemes that rate all individuals via a profile of different dimensions of personality without a symptom based cutoff from normal personality variation for example through schemes based on dimensional models
eating disorders involve disproportionate concern in matters of food and weight
categories of disorder in this area include anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa exercise bulimia or binge eating disorder
sleep disorders are associated with disruption to normal sleep patterns
a common sleep disorder is insomnia which is described as difficulty falling and or staying asleep
other sleep disorders include narcolepsy sleep apnea rem sleep behavior disorder chronic sleep deprivation and restless leg syndrome
narcolepsy is a condition of extreme tendencies to fall asleep whenever and wherever
people with narcolepsy feel refreshed after their random sleep but eventually get sleepy again
narcolepsy diagnosis requires an overnight stay at a sleep center for analysis during which doctors ask for a detailed sleep history and sleep records
doctors also use actigraphs and polysomnography
doctors will do a multiple sleep latency test which measures how long it takes a person to fall asleep
sleep apnea when breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep can be a serious sleep disorder
three types of sleep apnea include obstructive sleep apnea central sleep apnea and complex sleep apnea sleep apnea can be diagnosed at home or with polysomnography at a sleep center
an ear nose and throat doctor may further help with the sleeping habits
sexual disorders include dyspareunia and various kinds of paraphilia sexual arousal to objects situations or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others
impulse control disorder people who are abnormally unable to resist certain urges or impulses that could be harmful to themselves or others may be classified as having an impulse control disorder and disorders such as kleptomania stealing or pyromania fire setting
various behavioral addictions such as gambling addiction may be classed as a disorder
obsessive compulsive disorder can sometimes involve an inability to resist certain acts but is classed separately as being primarily an anxiety disorder
substance use disorder this disorder refers to the use of drugs legal or illegal including alcohol that persists despite significant problems or harm related to its use
substance dependence and substance abuse fall under this umbrella category in the dsm
substance use disorder may be due to a pattern of compulsive and repetitive use of a drug that results in tolerance to its effects and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped
dissociative disorder people with severe disturbances of their self identity memory and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings may be classified as having these types of disorders including depersonalization disorder or dissociative identity disorder which was previously referred to as multiple personality disorder or split personality
cognitive disorder these affect cognitive abilities including learning and memory
this category includes delirium and mild and major neurocognitive disorder previously termed dementia
developmental disorder these disorders initially occur in childhood
some examples include autism spectrum disorder oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd which may continue into adulthood
conduct disorder if continuing into adulthood may be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder dissocial personality disorder in the icd
popular labels such as psychopath or sociopath do not appear in the dsm or icd but are linked by some to these diagnoses
somatoform disorders may be diagnosed when there are problems that appear to originate in the body that are thought to be manifestations of a mental disorder
this includes somatization disorder and conversion disorder
there are also disorders of how a person perceives their body such as body dysmorphic disorder
neurasthenia is an old diagnosis involving somatic complaints as well as fatigue and low spirits depression which is officially recognized by the icd but no longer by the dsm iv
factitious disorders are diagnosed where symptoms are thought to be reported for personal gain
symptoms are often deliberately produced or feigned and may relate to either symptoms in the individual or in someone close to them particularly people they care for
there are attempts to introduce a category of relational disorder where the diagnosis is of a relationship rather than on any one individual in that relationship
the relationship may be between children and their parents between couples or others
there already exists under the category of psychosis a diagnosis of shared psychotic disorder where two or more individuals share a particular delusion because of their close relationship with each other
there are a number of uncommon psychiatric syndromes which are often named after the person who first described them such as capgras syndrome de clerambault syndrome othello syndrome ganser syndrome cotard delusion and ekbom syndrome and additional disorders such as the couvade syndrome and geschwind syndrome
the onset of psychiatric disorders usually occurs from childhood to early adulthood
impulse control disorders and a few anxiety disorders tend to appear in childhood
some other anxiety disorders substance disorders and mood disorders emerge later in the mid teens
symptoms of schizophrenia typically manifest from late adolescence to early twenties
the likely course and outcome of mental disorders vary and are dependent on numerous factors related to the disorder itself the individual as a whole and the social environment
some disorders may last a brief period of time while others may be long term in nature
all disorders can have a varied course
long term international studies of schizophrenia have found that over a half of individuals recover in terms of symptoms and around a fifth to a third in terms of symptoms and functioning with many requiring no medication
while some have serious difficulties and support needs for many years late recovery is still plausible
the world health organization concluded that the long term studies findings converged with others in relieving patients carers and clinicians of the chronicity paradigm which dominated thinking throughout much of the th century
a follow up study by tohen and coworkers revealed that around half of people initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve symptomatic recovery no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis within six weeks and nearly all achieve it within two years with nearly half regaining their prior occupational and residential status in that period
less than half go on to experience a new episode of mania or major depression within the next two years
some disorders may be very limited in their functional effects while others may involve substantial disability and support needs
the degree of ability or disability may vary over time and across different life domains
furthermore continued disability has been linked to institutionalization discrimination and social exclusion as well as to the inherent effects of disorders
alternatively functioning may be affected by the stress of having to hide a condition in work or school etc by adverse effects of medications or other substances or by mismatches between illness related variations and demands for regularity
it is also the case that while often being characterized in purely negative terms some mental traits or states labeled as disorders can also involve above average creativity non conformity goal striving meticulousness or empathy
in addition the public perception of the level of disability associated with mental disorders can change
nevertheless internationally people report equal or greater disability from commonly occurring mental conditions than from commonly occurring physical conditions particularly in their social roles and personal relationships
the proportion with access to professional help for mental disorders is far lower however even among those assessed as having a severely disabling condition
disability in this context may or may not involve such things as
basic activities of daily living
including looking after the self health care grooming dressing shopping cooking etc or looking after accommodation chores diy tasks etc
interpersonal relationships
including communication skills ability to form relationships and sustain them ability to leave the home or mix in crowds or particular settings
occupational functioning
ability to acquire an employment and hold it cognitive and social skills required for the job dealing with workplace culture or studying as a student in terms of total disability adjusted life years dalys which is an estimate of how many years of life are lost due to premature death or to being in a state of poor health and disability mental disorders rank amongst the most disabling conditions
unipolar also known as major depressive disorder is the third leading cause of disability worldwide of any condition mental or physical accounting for million years lost
the first systematic description of global disability arising in youth in found that among to year olds nearly half of all disability current and as estimated to continue was due to mental and neurological conditions including substance use disorders and conditions involving self harm
second to this were accidental injuries mainly traffic collisions accounting for percent of disability followed by communicable diseases at percent
the disorders associated with most disabilities in high income countries were unipolar major depression and alcohol use disorder
in the eastern mediterranean region it was unipolar major depression and schizophrenia and in africa it was unipolar major depression and bipolar disorder
suicide which is often attributed to some underlying mental disorder is a leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under
there are an estimated to million non fatal attempted suicides every year worldwide
the predominant view as of is that genetic psychological and environmental factors all contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders
different risk factors may be present at different ages with risk occurring as early as during prenatal period
a number of psychiatric disorders are linked to a family history including depression narcissistic personality disorder and anxiety
twin studies have also revealed a very high heritability for many mental disorders especially autism and schizophrenia
although researchers have been looking for decades for clear linkages between genetics and mental disorders that work has not yielded specific genetic biomarkers yet that might lead to better diagnosis and better treatments
statistical research looking at eleven disorders found widespread assortative mating between people with mental illness
that means that individuals with one of these disorders were two to three times more likely than the general population to have a partner with a mental disorder
sometimes people seemed to have preferred partners with the same mental illness
thus people with schizophrenia or adhd are seven times more likely to have affected partners with the same disorder
this is even more pronounced for people with autism spectrum disorders who are times more likely to have a spouse with the same disorder
during the prenatal stage factors like unwanted pregnancy lack of adaptation to pregnancy or substance use during pregnancy increases the risk of developing a mental disorder
maternal stress and birth complications including prematurity and infections have also been implicated in increasing susceptibility for mental illness
infants neglected or not provided optimal nutrition have a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment
social influences have also been found to be important including abuse neglect bullying social stress traumatic events and other negative or overwhelming life experiences
aspects of the wider community have also been implicated including employment problems socioeconomic inequality lack of social cohesion problems linked to migration and features of particular societies and cultures
the specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear however
nutrition also plays a role in mental disorders
in schizophrenia and psychosis risk factors include migration and discrimination childhood trauma bereavement or separation in families recreational use of drugs and urbanicity
in anxiety risk factors may include parenting factors including parental rejection lack of parental warmth high hostility harsh discipline high maternal negative affect anxious childrearing modelling of dysfunctional and drug abusing behaviour and child abuse emotional physical and sexual
adults with imbalance work to life are at higher risk for developing anxiety
for bipolar disorder stress such as childhood adversity is not a specific cause but does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness
mental disorders are associated with drug use including cannabis alcohol and caffeine use of which appears to promote anxiety
for psychosis and schizophrenia usage of a number of drugs has been associated with development of the disorder including cannabis cocaine and amphetamines
there has been debate regarding the relationship between usage of cannabis and bipolar disorder
cannabis has also been associated with depression
adolescents are at increased risk for tobacco alcohol and drug use peer pressure is the main reason why adolescents start using substances
at this age the use of substances could be detrimental to the development of the brain and place them at higher risk of developing a mental disorder
people living with chronic conditions like hiv and diabetes are at higher risk of developing a mental disorder
people living with diabetes experience significant stress from biological impact of the disease which places them at risk for developing anxiety and depression
diabetic patients also have to deal with emotional stress trying to manage the disease
conditions like heart disease stroke respiratory conditions cancer and arthritis increase the risk of developing a mental disorder when compared to the general population
risk factors for mental illness include a propensity for high neuroticism or emotional instability
in anxiety risk factors may include temperament and attitudes e g
pessimism
mental disorders can arise from multiple sources and in many cases there is no single accepted or consistent cause currently established
an eclectic or pluralistic mix of models may be used to explain particular disorders
the primary paradigm of contemporary mainstream western psychiatry is said to be the biopsychosocial model which incorporates biological psychological and social factors although this may not always be applied in practice
biological psychiatry follows a biomedical model where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience
a common assumption is that disorders may have resulted from genetic and developmental vulnerabilities exposed by stress in life for example in a diathesis stress model although there are various views on what causes differences between individuals
some types of mental disorders may be viewed as primarily neurodevelopmental disorders
evolutionary psychology may be used as an overall explanatory theory while attachment theory is another kind of evolutionary psychological approach sometimes applied in the context of mental disorders
psychoanalytic theories have continued to evolve alongside and cognitive behavioral and systemic family approaches
a distinction is sometimes made between a medical model or a social model of disorder and disability
psychiatrists seek to provide a medical diagnosis of individuals by an assessment of symptoms signs and impairment associated with particular types of mental disorder
other mental health professionals such as clinical psychologists may or may not apply the same diagnostic categories to their clinical formulation of a client s difficulties and circumstances
the majority of mental health problems are at least initially assessed and treated by family physicians in the uk general practitioners during consultations who may refer a patient on for more specialist diagnosis in acute or chronic cases
routine diagnostic practice in mental health services typically involves an interview known as a mental status examination where evaluations are made of appearance and behavior self reported symptoms mental health history and current life circumstances
the views of other professionals relatives or other third parties may be taken into account
a physical examination to check for ill health or the effects of medications or other drugs may be conducted
psychological testing is sometimes used via paper and pen or computerized questionnaires which may include algorithms based on ticking off standardized diagnostic criteria and in rare specialist cases neuroimaging tests may be requested but such methods are more commonly found in research studies than routine clinical practice
time and budgetary constraints often limit practicing psychiatrists from conducting more thorough diagnostic evaluations
it has been found that most clinicians evaluate patients using an unstructured open ended approach with limited training in evidence based assessment methods and that inaccurate diagnosis may be common in routine practice
in addition comorbidity is very common in psychiatric diagnosis where the same person meets the criteria for more than one disorder
on the other hand a person may have several different difficulties only some of which meet the criteria for being diagnosed
there may be specific problems with accurate diagnosis in developing countries
more structured approaches are being increasingly used to measure levels of mental illness
honos is the most widely used measure in english mental health services being used by at least trusts
in honos a score of is given for each of factors based on functional living capacity
research has been supportive of honos although some questions have been asked about whether it provides adequate coverage of the range and complexity of mental illness problems and whether the fact that often only of the scales vary over time gives enough subtlety to accurately measure outcomes of treatment since the s paula caplan has been concerned about the subjectivity of psychiatric diagnosis and people being arbitrarily slapped with a psychiatric label caplan says because psychiatric diagnosis is unregulated doctors are not required to spend much time interviewing patients or to seek a second opinion
the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders can lead a psychiatrist to focus on narrow checklists of symptoms with little consideration of what is actually causing the person s problems
so according to caplan getting a psychiatric diagnosis and label often stands in the way of recovery
in psychiatrist allen frances wrote a paper entitled the new crisis of confidence in psychiatric diagnosis which said that psychiatric diagnosis
still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests frances was also concerned about unpredictable overdiagnosis for many years marginalized psychiatrists such as peter breggin thomas szasz and outside critics such as stuart a
kirk have been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality more recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the american psychiatric association e g robert spitzer allen frances
a editorial in the british medical journal warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications
gary greenberg a psychoanalyst in his book the book of woe argues that mental illness is really about suffering and how the dsm creates diagnostic labels to categorize people s suffering
indeed the psychiatrist thomas szasz in his book the medicalization of everyday life also argues that what is psychiatric illness is not always biological in nature i e
social problems poverty etc and may even be a part of the human condition
in the american psychological association commissioned a review to reach a consensus on whether modern clinical mri fmri will be able to be used in the diagnosis of mental health disorders
the criteria presented by the apa stated that the biomarkers used in diagnosis should
have a sensitivity of at least for detecting a particular psychiatric disorder
should have a specificity of at least for distinguishing this disorder from other psychiatric or medical disorders
should be reliable reproducible and ideally be noninvasive simple to perform and inexpensive
proposed biomarkers should be verified by independent studies each by a different investigator and different population samples and published in a peer reviewed journal the review concluded that although neuroimaging diagnosis may technically be feasible very large studies are needed to evaluate specific biomarkers which were not available
the who report prevention of mental disorders stated that prevention of these disorders is obviously one of the most effective ways to reduce the disease burden
the european psychiatric association epa guidance on prevention of mental disorders states there is considerable evidence that various psychiatric conditions can be prevented through the implementation of effective evidence based interventions
a uk department of health report on the economic case for mental health promotion and mental illness prevention found that many interventions are outstandingly good value for money low in cost and often become self financing over time saving public expenditure
in the national institute of mental health re affirmed prevention as a research priority area
parenting may affect the child s mental health and evidence suggests that helping parents to be more effective with their children can address mental health needs
universal prevention aimed at a population that has no increased risk for developing a mental disorder such as school programs or mass media campaigns need very high numbers of people to show effect sometimes known as the power problem
approaches to overcome this are focus on high incidence groups e g
by targeting groups with high risk factors use multiple interventions to achieve greater and thus more statistically valid effects use cumulative meta analyses of many trials and run very large trials
treatment and support for mental disorders are provided in psychiatric hospitals clinics or a range of community mental health services
in some countries services are increasingly based on a recovery approach intended to support individual s personal journey to gain the kind of life they want
there is a range of different types of treatment and what is most suitable depends on the disorder and the individual
many things have been found to help at least some people and a placebo effect may play a role in any intervention or medication
in a minority of cases individuals may be treated against their will which can cause particular difficulties depending on how it is carried out and perceived
compulsory treatment while in the community versus non compulsory treatment does not appear to make much of a difference except by maybe decreasing victimization
lifestyle strategies including dietary changes exercise and quitting smoking may be of benefit
there is also a wide range of psychotherapists including family therapy counselors and public health professionals
in addition there are peer support roles where personal experience of similar issues is the primary source of expertise
a major option for many mental disorders is psychotherapy
there are several main types
cognitive behavioral therapy cbt is widely used and is based on modifying the patterns of thought and behavior associated with a particular disorder
other psychotherapies include dialectic behavioral therapy dbt and interpersonal psychotherapy ipt
psychoanalysis addressing underlying psychic conflicts and defenses has been a dominant school of psychotherapy and is still in use
systemic therapy or family therapy is sometimes used addressing a network of significant others as well as an individual
some psychotherapies are based on a humanistic approach
there are many specific therapies used for particular disorders which may be offshoots or hybrids of the above types
mental health professionals often employ an eclectic or integrative approach
much may depend on the therapeutic relationship and there may be problems with trust confidentiality and engagement
a major option for many mental disorders is psychiatric medication and there are several main groups
antidepressants are used for the treatment of clinical depression as well as often for anxiety and a range of other disorders
anxiolytics including sedatives are used for anxiety disorders and related problems such as insomnia
mood stabilizers are used primarily in bipolar disorder
antipsychotics are used for psychotic disorders notably for positive symptoms in schizophrenia and also increasingly for a range of other disorders
stimulants are commonly used notably for adhd
despite the different conventional names of the drug groups there may be considerable overlap in the disorders for which they are actually indicated and there may also be off label use of medications
there can be problems with adverse effects of medication and adherence to them and there is also criticism of pharmaceutical marketing and professional conflicts of interest
however these medications in combination with non pharmacological methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy cbt are seen to be most effective in treating mental disorders
electroconvulsive therapy ect is sometimes used in severe cases when other interventions for severe intractable depression have failed
ect is usually indicated for treatment resistant depression severe vegetative symptoms psychotic depression intense suicidal ideation depression during pregnancy and catatonia
psychosurgery is considered experimental but is advocated by some neurologists in certain rare cases
counseling professional and co counseling between peers may be used
psychoeducation programs may provide people with the information to understand and manage their problems
creative therapies are sometimes used including music therapy art therapy or drama therapy
lifestyle adjustments and supportive measures are often used including peer support self help groups for mental health and supported housing or supported employment including social firms
some advocate dietary supplements
reasonable accommodations adjustments and supports might be put in place to help an individual cope and succeed in environments despite potential disability related to mental health problems
this could include an emotional support animal or specifically trained psychiatric service dog
as of cannabis is specifically not recommended as a treatment
mental disorders are common
worldwide more than one in three people in most countries report sufficient criteria for at least one at some point in their life
in the united states qualify for a mental illness at some point
an ongoing survey indicates that anxiety disorders are the most common in all but one country followed by mood disorders in all but two countries while substance disorders and impulse control disorders were consistently less prevalent
rates varied by region
a review of anxiety disorder surveys in different countries found average lifetime prevalence estimates of with women having higher rates on average
a review of mood disorder surveys in different countries found lifetime rates of for major depressive disorder higher in some studies and in women and for bipolar i disorder
in the united states the frequency of disorder is anxiety disorder mood disorder impulse control disorder or substance use disorder
a cross europe study found that approximately one in four people reported meeting criteria at some point in their life for at least one of the dsm iv disorders assessed which included mood disorders anxiety disorders or alcohol disorder
approximately one in ten met the criteria within a month period
women and younger people of either gender showed more cases of the disorder
a review of surveys in european countries found that of adult europeans are affected by at least one mental disorder in a month period
an international review of studies on the prevalence of schizophrenia found an average median figure of for lifetime prevalence it was consistently lower in poorer countries
studies of the prevalence of personality disorders pds have been fewer and smaller scale but one broad norwegian survey found a five year prevalence of almost in
rates for specific disorders ranged from to differing across countries and by gender educational level and other factors
a us survey that incidentally screened for personality disorder found a rate of
approximately of a preschool pediatric sample were given a psychiatric diagnosis in one clinical study and approximately of and year olds receiving developmental screening have been assessed as having significant emotional behavioral problems based on parent and pediatrician reports
while rates of psychological disorders are often the same for men and women women tend to have a higher rate of depression
each year million women are affected by major depression and suicide is ranked th as the cause of death for women between the ages of
depressive disorders account for close to of the disability from neuropsychiatric disorders among women compared to among men
ancient civilizations described and treated a number of mental disorders
mental illnesses were well known in ancient mesopotamia where diseases and mental disorders were believed to be caused by specific deities
because hands symbolized control over a person mental illnesses were known as hands of certain deities
one psychological illness was known as q t i tar meaning hand of ishtar
others were known as hand of shamash hand of the ghost and hand of the god
descriptions of these illnesses however are so vague that it is usually impossible to determine which illnesses they correspond to in modern terminology
mesopotamian doctors kept detailed record of their patients hallucinations and assigned spiritual meanings to them
the royal family of elam was notorious for its members often being insane
the greeks coined terms for melancholy hysteria and phobia and developed the humorism theory
mental disorders were described and treatments developed in persia arabia and in the medieval islamic world
conceptions of madness in the middle ages in christian europe were a mixture of the divine diabolical magical and humoral and transcendental
in the early modern period some people with mental disorders may have been victims of the witch hunts
while not every witch and sorcerer accused were mentally ill all mentally ill were considered to be witches or sorcerers
many terms for mental disorders that found their way into everyday use first became popular in the th and th centuries
by the end of the th century and into the enlightenment madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon with no connection to the soul or moral responsibility
asylum care was often harsh and treated people like wild animals but towards the end of the th century a moral treatment movement gradually developed
clear descriptions of some syndromes may be rare before the th century
industrialization and population growth led to a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every western country in the th century
numerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities and the term psychiatry was coined though medical superintendents were still known as alienists
the turn of the th century saw the development of psychoanalysis which would later come to the fore along with kraepelin s classification scheme
asylum inmates were increasingly referred to as patients and asylums were renamed as hospitals
early in the th century in the united states a mental hygiene movement developed aiming to prevent mental disorders
clinical psychology and social work developed as professions
world war i saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed shell shock
world war ii saw the development in the u s
of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
the international classification of diseases icd also developed a section on mental disorders
the term stress having emerged from endocrinology work in the s was increasingly applied to mental disorders
electroconvulsive therapy insulin shock therapy lobotomies and the neuroleptic chlorpromazine came to be used by mid century
in the s there were many challenges to the concept of mental illness itself
these challenges came from psychiatrists like thomas szasz who argued that mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts from sociologists such as erving goffman who said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non conformists from behavioral psychologists who challenged psychiatry s fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena and from gay rights activists who criticised the apa s listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder
a study published in science by rosenhan received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis
deinstitutionalization gradually occurred in the west with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of community mental health services
a consumer survivor movement gained momentum
other kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use such as psychic energizers later antidepressants and lithium
benzodiazepines gained widespread use in the s for anxiety and depression until dependency problems curtailed their popularity
advances in neuroscience genetics and psychology led to new research agendas
cognitive behavioral therapy and other psychotherapies developed
the dsm and then icd adopted new criteria based classifications and the number of official diagnoses saw a large expansion
through the s new ssri type antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world as later did antipsychotics
also during the s a recovery approach developed
different societies or cultures even different individuals in a subculture can disagree as to what constitutes optimal versus pathological biological and psychological functioning
research has demonstrated that cultures vary in the relative importance placed on for example happiness autonomy or social relationships for pleasure
likewise the fact that a behavior pattern is valued accepted encouraged or even statistically normative in a culture does not necessarily mean that it is conducive to optimal psychological functioning
people in all cultures find some behaviors bizarre or even incomprehensible
but just what they feel is bizarre or incomprehensible is ambiguous and subjective
these differences in determination can become highly contentious
the process by which conditions and difficulties come to be defined and treated as medical conditions and problems and thus come under the authority of doctors and other health professionals is known as medicalization or pathologization
mental illness in the latino community is seen as a sign of human weakness
the stigma of what others think seems haunt those who have metal illness
with the fear of being called demented by others
common mental illness has been identified among latino groups such as puerto rican and mexican communities
according to the hispanic health and nutrition examination survey of the puerto rican community have depression in the u s while mexican american community have depression
the cuban american community reported that only had depression
although these survey percentages show us a realistic sign of mental illness in the latino community only of latinos will discuss mental illness with their doctor
the u s general report mental health culture race and ethnicity state that only will seek treatment from a metal health specialist
the latino community is known for its strong family backgrounds
having an uphold family support system can bring awareness about mental health illness
making it easier to discuss these topics with family members
sharing these important topics of awareness can bring an easier care treatment plan for the patient and family member
religious spiritual or transpersonal experiences and beliefs meet many criteria of delusional or psychotic disorders
a belief or experience can sometimes be shown to produce distress or disability the ordinary standard for judging mental disorders
there is a link between religion and schizophrenia a complex mental disorder characterized by a difficulty in recognizing reality regulating emotional responses and thinking in a clear and logical manner
those with schizophrenia commonly report some type of religious delusion and religion itself may be a trigger for schizophrenia
controversy has often surrounded psychiatry and the term anti psychiatry was coined by the psychiatrist david cooper in
the anti psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients and psychiatry s history involves what may now be seen as dangerous treatments
electroconvulsive therapy was one of these which was used widely between the s and s
lobotomy was another practice that was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal
diazepam and other sedatives were sometimes over prescribed which led to an epidemic of dependence
there was also concern about the large increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for children
some charismatic psychiatrists came to personify the movement against psychiatry
the most influential of these was r d
laing who wrote a series of best selling books including the divided self
thomas szasz wrote the myth of mental illness
some ex patient groups have become militantly anti psychiatric often referring to themselves as survivors
giorgio antonucci has questioned the basis of psychiatry through his work on the dismantling of two psychiatric hospitals in the city of imola carried out from to
the consumer survivor movement also known as user survivor movement is made up of individuals and organizations representing them who are clients of mental health services or who consider themselves survivors of psychiatric interventions
activists campaign for improved mental health services and for more involvement and empowerment within mental health services policies and wider society
patient advocacy organizations have expanded with increasing deinstitutionalization in developed countries working to challenge the stereotypes stigma and exclusion associated with psychiatric conditions
there is also a carers rights movement of people who help and support people with mental health conditions who may be relatives and who often work in difficult and time consuming circumstances with little acknowledgement and without pay
an anti psychiatry movement fundamentally challenges mainstream psychiatric theory and practice including in some cases asserting that psychiatric concepts and diagnoses of mental illness are neither real nor useful
alternatively a movement for global mental health has emerged defined as the area of study research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide
diagnostic guidelines of the s namely the dsm and to some extent the icd have been criticized as having a fundamentally euro american outlook
opponents argue that even when diagnostic criteria are used across different cultures it does not mean that the underlying constructs have validity within those cultures as even reliable application can prove only consistency not legitimacy
advocating a more culturally sensitive approach critics such as carl bell and marcello maviglia contend that the cultural and ethnic diversity of individuals is often discounted by researchers and service providers
cross cultural psychiatrist arthur kleinman contends that the western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the dsm iv
disorders or concepts from non western or non mainstream cultures are described as culture bound whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever revealing to kleinman an underlying assumption that western cultural phenomena are universal
kleinman s negative view towards the culture bound syndrome is largely shared by other cross cultural critics
common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non western mental disorders still left out and frustration that even those included are often misinterpreted or misrepresented
many mainstream psychiatrists are dissatisfied with the new culture bound diagnoses although for partly different reasons
robert spitzer a lead architect of the dsm iii has argued that adding cultural formulations was an attempt to appease cultural critics and has stated that they lack any scientific rationale or support
spitzer also posits that the new culture bound diagnoses are rarely used maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved
in general mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid cross cultural factors are either irrelevant or are significant only to specific symptom presentations
clinical conceptions of mental illness also overlap with personal and cultural values in the domain of morality so much so that it is sometimes argued that separating the two is impossible without fundamentally redefining the essence of being a particular person in a society
in clinical psychiatry persistent distress and disability indicate an internal disorder requiring treatment but in another context that same distress and disability can be seen as an indicator of emotional struggle and the need to address social and structural problems
this dichotomy has led some academics and clinicians to advocate a postmodernist conceptualization of mental distress and well being
such approaches along with cross cultural and heretical psychologies centered on alternative cultural and ethnic and race based identities and experiences stand in contrast to the mainstream psychiatric community s alleged avoidance of any explicit involvement with either morality or culture
in many countries there are attempts to challenge perceived prejudice against minority groups including alleged institutional racism within psychiatric services
there are also ongoing attempts to improve professional cross cultural sensitivity
three quarters of countries around the world have mental health legislation
compulsory admission to mental health facilities also known as involuntary commitment is a controversial topic
it can impinge on personal liberty and the right to choose and carry the risk of abuse for political social and other reasons yet it can potentially prevent harm to self and others and assist some people in attaining their right to healthcare when they may be unable to decide in their own interests
because of this it is a concern of medical ethics
all human rights oriented mental health laws require proof of the presence of a mental disorder as defined by internationally accepted standards but the type and severity of disorder that counts can vary in different jurisdictions
the two most often used grounds for involuntary admission are said to be serious likelihood of immediate or imminent danger to self or others and the need for treatment
applications for someone to be involuntarily admitted usually come from a mental health practitioner a family member a close relative or a guardian
human rights oriented laws usually stipulate that independent medical practitioners or other accredited mental health practitioners must examine the patient separately and that there should be regular time bound review by an independent review body
the individual should also have personal access to independent advocacy
for involuntary treatment to be administered by force if necessary it should be shown that an individual lacks the mental capacity for informed consent i e
to understand treatment information and its implications and therefore be able to make an informed choice to either accept or refuse
legal challenges in some areas have resulted in supreme court decisions that a person does not have to agree with a psychiatrist s characterization of the issues as constituting an illness nor agree with a psychiatrist s conviction in medication but only recognize the issues and the information about treatment options
proxy consent also known as surrogate or substituted decision making may be transferred to a personal representative a family member or a legally appointed guardian
moreover patients may be able to make when they are considered well an advance directive stipulating how they wish to be treated should they be deemed to lack mental capacity in the future
the right to supported decision making where a person is helped to understand and choose treatment options before they can be declared to lack capacity may also be included in the legislation
there should at the very least be shared decision making as far as possible
involuntary treatment laws are increasingly extended to those living in the community for example outpatient commitment laws known by different names are used in new zealand australia the united kingdom and most of the united states
the world health organization reports that in many instances national mental health legislation takes away the rights of persons with mental disorders rather than protecting rights and is often outdated
in the united nations adopted the principles for the protection of persons with mental illness and the improvement of mental health care which established minimum human rights standards of practice in the mental health field
in the un formally agreed the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of disabled people including those with psychosocial disabilities
the term insanity sometimes used colloquially as a synonym for mental illness is often used technically as a legal term
the insanity defense may be used in a legal trial known as the mental disorder defence in some countries
the social stigma associated with mental disorders is a widespread problem
the us surgeon general stated in that powerful and pervasive stigma prevents people from acknowledging their own mental health problems much less disclosing them to others additionally researcher wulf r ssler in in his article the stigma of mental disorders stated in the united states racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to experience mental health disorders often due to low socioeconomic status and discrimination
in taiwan those with mental disorders are subject to general public s misperception that the root causes of the mental disorders are over thinking having a lot of time and nothing better to do stagnant not serious in life not paying enough attention to the real life affairs mentally weak refusing to be resilient turning back to perfectionistic strivings not bravery and so forth
employment discrimination is reported to play a significant part in the high rate of unemployment among those with a diagnosis of mental illness
an australian study found that having a mental illness is a bigger barrier to employment than a physical disability
the mentally ill are stigmatized in chinese society and can not legally marry
efforts are being undertaken worldwide to eliminate the stigma of mental illness although the methods and outcomes used have sometimes been criticized
media coverage of mental illness comprises predominantly negative and pejorative depictions for example of incompetence violence or criminality with far less coverage of positive issues such as accomplishments or human rights issues
such negative depictions including in children s cartoons are thought to contribute to stigma and negative attitudes in the public and in those with mental health problems themselves although more sensitive or serious cinematic portrayals have increased in prevalence
in the united states the carter center has created fellowships for journalists in south africa the u s and romania to enable reporters to research and write stories on mental health topics
former us first lady rosalynn carter began the fellowships not only to train reporters in how to sensitively and accurately discuss mental health and mental illness but also to increase the number of stories on these topics in the news media
there is also a world mental health day which in the us and canada falls within a mental illness awareness week
the general public have been found to hold a strong stereotype of dangerousness and desire for social distance from individuals described as mentally ill
a us national survey found that a higher percentage of people rate individuals described as displaying the characteristics of a mental disorder as likely to do something violent to others compared to the percentage of people who are rating individuals described as being troubled
in the article discrimination against people with a mental health diagnosis qualitative analysis of reported experiences an individual who has a mental disorder revealed that if people don t know me and don t know about the problems they ll talk to me quite happily
once they ve seen the problems or someone s told them about me they tend to be a bit more wary in addition in the article stigma and its impact on help seeking for mental disorders what do we know by george schomerus and matthias angermeyer it is affirmed that family doctors and psychiatrists have more pessimistic views about the outcomes for mental illnesses than the general public jorm et al and mental health professionals hold more negative stereotypes about mentally ill patients but reassuringly they are less accepting of restrictions towards them
recent depictions in media have included leading characters successfully living with and managing a mental illness including in bipolar disorder in homeland and posttraumatic stress disorder in iron man
despite public or media opinion national studies have indicated that severe mental illness does not independently predict future violent behavior on average and is not a leading cause of violence in society
there is a statistical association with various factors that do relate to violence in anyone such as substance use and various personal social and economic factors
a review found that in the united states about of violence is attributable to people diagnosed with mental illness and a study found that of crimes committed by mentally ill people were directly related to the symptoms of their mental illness
the majority of people with serious mental illness are never violent
in fact findings consistently indicate that it is many times more likely that people diagnosed with a serious mental illness living in the community will be the victims rather than the perpetrators of violence
in a study of individuals diagnosed with severe mental illness living in a us inner city area a quarter were found to have been victims of at least one violent crime over the course of a year a proportion eleven times higher than the inner city average and higher in every category of crime including violent assaults and theft
people with a diagnosis may find it more difficult to secure prosecutions however due in part to prejudice and being seen as less credible
however there are some specific diagnoses such as childhood conduct disorder or adult antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy which are defined by or are inherently associated with conduct problems and violence
there are conflicting findings about the extent to which certain specific symptoms notably some kinds of psychosis hallucinations or delusions that can occur in disorders such as schizophrenia delusional disorder or mood disorder are linked to an increased risk of serious violence on average
the mediating factors of violent acts however are most consistently found to be mainly socio demographic and socio economic factors such as being young male of lower socioeconomic status and in particular substance use including alcohol use to which some people may be particularly vulnerable
high profile cases have led to fears that serious crimes such as homicide have increased due to deinstitutionalization but the evidence does not support this conclusion
violence that does occur in relation to mental disorder against the mentally ill or by the mentally ill typically occurs in the context of complex social interactions often in a family setting rather than between strangers
it is also an issue in health care settings and the wider community
the recognition and understanding of mental health conditions have changed over time and across cultures and there are still variations in definition assessment and classification although standard guideline criteria are widely used
in many cases there appears to be a continuum between mental health and mental illness making diagnosis complex
according to the world health organization who over a third of people in most countries report problems at some time in their life which meet the criteria for diagnosis of one or more of the common types of mental disorder
corey m keyes has created a two continua model of mental illness and health which holds that both are related but distinct dimensions one continuum indicates the presence or absence of mental health the other the presence or absence of mental illness
for example people with optimal mental health can also have a mental illness and people who have no mental illness can also have poor mental health
psychopathology in non human primates has been studied since the mid th century
over behavioral patterns in captive chimpanzees have been documented as statistically abnormal for frequency severity or oddness some of which have also been observed in the wild
captive great apes show gross behavioral abnormalities such as stereotypy of movements self mutilation disturbed emotional reactions mainly fear or aggression towards companions lack of species typical communications and generalized learned helplessness
in some cases such behaviors are hypothesized to be equivalent to symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression anxiety disorders eating disorders and post traumatic stress disorder
concepts of antisocial borderline and schizoid personality disorders have also been applied to non human great apes
the risk of anthropomorphism is often raised concerning such comparisons and assessment of non human animals cannot incorporate evidence from linguistic communication
however available evidence may range from nonverbal behaviors including physiological responses and homologous facial displays and acoustic utterances to neurochemical studies
it is pointed out that human psychiatric classification is often based on statistical description and judgment of behaviors especially when speech or language is impaired and that the use of verbal self report is itself problematic and unreliable
psychopathology has generally been traced at least in captivity to adverse rearing conditions such as early separation of infants from mothers early sensory deprivation and extended periods of social isolation
studies have also indicated individual variation in temperament such as sociability or impulsiveness
particular causes of problems in captivity have included integration of strangers into existing groups and a lack of individual space in which context some pathological behaviors have also been seen as coping mechanisms
remedial interventions have included careful individually tailored re socialization programs behavior therapy environment enrichment and on rare occasions psychiatric drugs
socialization has been found to work of the time in disturbed chimpanzees although restoration of functional sexuality and caregiving is often not achieved
laboratory researchers sometimes try to develop animal models of human mental disorders including by inducing or treating symptoms in animals through genetic neurological chemical or behavioral manipulation but this has been criticized on empirical grounds and opposed on animal rights grounds
