The Mahoraga Sanskrit महोरग are a race of deities in Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism
Like the nāga they are often depicted as anthropomorphic beings with serpentine bodies from the waist down
However their appearance can differ depending on artistic tradition sometimes having serpent heads with humanoid bodies
The Mahoraga are one of the eight classes of deities aṣṭasenā that are said to protect the Dharma
They are described as huge subterranean serpents who lie on their sides and rotate the earth which occasionally causes earthquakes
Like the kinnara the mahoraga are also associated with music
They are understood as being associated with large serpents such as pythons while the nāgas are more closely related to the cobra
one is reborn as a mahoraga as a result of practicing generosity and upholding the Dharma while being inclined toward anger
