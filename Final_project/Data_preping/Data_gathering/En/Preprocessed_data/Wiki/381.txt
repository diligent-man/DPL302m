semiotics also called semiotic studies is the systematic study of sign processes semiosis and meaning making
semiosis is any activity conduct or process that involves signs where a sign is defined as anything that communicates something usually called a meaning to the sign s interpreter
the meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning or unintentional such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition
signs can also communicate feelings which are usually not considered meanings and may communicate internally through thought itself or through any of the senses visual auditory tactile olfactory or gustatory taste
contemporary semiotics is a branch of science that studies meaning making and various types of knowledge
the semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications
unlike linguistics semiotics also studies non linguistic sign systems
semiotics includes the study of signs and sign processes indication designation likeness analogy allegory metonymy metaphor symbolism signification and communication
semiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological and sociological dimensions for example the italian semiotician and novelist umberto eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication
some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of the science however
they examine areas also belonging to the life sciences such as how organisms make predictions about and adapt to their semiotic niche in the world see semiosis
fundamental semiotic theories take signs or sign systems as their object of study applied semiotics analyzes cultures and cultural artifacts according to the ways they construct meaning through their being signs
the communication of information in living organisms is covered in biosemiotics including zoosemiotics and phytosemiotics
semiotics is not to be confused with the saussurean tradition called semiology which is a subset of semiotics
the importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of philosophy and psychology
the term derives from ancient greek s mei tik s observant of signs from s me on a sign mark token
for the greeks signs occurred in the world of nature and symbols in the world of culture
as such plato and aristotle explored the relationship between signs and the world
it would not be until augustine of hippo that the nature of the sign would be considered within a conventional system
augustine introduced a thematic proposal for uniting the two under the notion of sign signum as transcending the nature culture divide and identifying symbols as no more than a species or sub species of signum
a monograph study on this question would be done by manetti
these theories have had a lasting effect in western philosophy especially through scholastic philosophy
the general study of signs that began in latin with augustine culminated with the tractatus de signis of john poinsot and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in by charles sanders peirce to draw up a new list of categories
more recently umberto eco in his semiotics and the philosophy of language has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most perhaps all major thinkers
john locke himself a man of medicine was familiar with this semeiotics as naming a specialized branch within medical science
in his personal library were two editions of scapula s abridgement of henricus stephanus thesaurus graecae linguae which listed as the name for diagnostics the branch of medicine concerned with interpreting symptoms of disease symptomatology
indeed physician and scholar henry stubbe had transliterated this term of specialized science into english precisely as semeiotics marking the first use of the term in english locke would use the term sem e iotike in an essay concerning human understanding book iv chap
in which he explains how science may be divided into three parts
locke then elaborates on the nature of this third category naming it semeiotike and explaining it as the doctrine of signs in the following terms
juri lotman would introduce eastern europe to semiotics and adopt locke s coinage as the name to subtitle his founding at the university of tartu in estonia in of the first semiotics journal sign systems studies
ferdinand de saussure founded his semiotics which he called semiology in the social sciences
thomas sebeok would assimilate semiology to semiotics as a part to a whole and was involved in choosing the name semiotica for the first international journal devoted to the study of signs
saussurean semiotics have exercised a great deal of influence on the schools of structuralism and post structuralism
jacques derrida for example takes as his object the saussurean relationship of signifier and signified asserting that signifier and signified are not fixed coining the expression diff rance relating to the endless deferral of meaning and to the absence of a transcendent signified
in the nineteenth century charles sanders peirce defined what he termed semiotic which he would sometimes spell as semeiotic as the quasi necessary or formal doctrine of signs which abstracts what must be the characters of all signs used by an intelligence capable of learning by experience and which is philosophical logic pursued in terms of signs and sign processes
peirce s perspective is considered as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial and sign processes modes of inference and the inquiry process in general
the peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism as per saussure but the internal representation machine investigating sign processes and modes of inference as well as the whole inquiry process in general
peircean semiotic is triadic including sign object interpretant as opposed to the dyadic saussurian tradition signifier signified
peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three sub types positing the existence of signs that are symbols semblances icons and indices i e signs that are such through a factual connection to their objects
peircean scholar and editor max h
fisch would claim that semeiotic was peirce s own preferred rendering of locke s
charles w
morris followed peirce in using the term semiotic and in extending the discipline beyond human communication to animal learning and use of signals
while the saussurean semiotic is dyadic sign syntax signal semantics the peircean semiotic is triadic sign object interpretant being conceived as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial
peirce would aim to base his new list directly upon experience precisely as constituted by action of signs in contrast with the list of aristotle s categories which aimed to articulate within experience the dimension of being that is independent of experience and knowable as such through human understanding
the estimative powers of animals interpret the environment as sensed to form a meaningful world of objects but the objects of this world or umwelt in jakob von uexk ll s term consist exclusively of objects related to the animal as desirable undesirable or safe to ignore
in contrast to this human understanding adds to the animal umwelt a relation of self identity within objects which transforms objects experienced into things as well as objects
thus the generically animal objective world as umwelt becomes a species specifically human objective world or lebenswelt life world wherein linguistic communication rooted in the biologically underdetermined innenwelt inner world of humans makes possible the further dimension of cultural organization within the otherwise merely social organization of non human animals whose powers of observation may deal only with directly sensible instances of objectivity
this further point that human culture depends upon language understood first of all not as communication but as the biologically underdetermined aspect or feature of the human animal s innenwelt was originally clearly identified by thomas a
sebeok
sebeok also played the central role in bringing peirce s work to the center of the semiotic stage in the twentieth century first with his expansion of the human use of signs anthroposemiosis to include also the generically animal sign usage zo semiosis then with his further expansion of semiosis to include the vegetative world phytosemiosis
such would initially be based on the work of martin krampen but takes advantage of peirce s point that an interpretant as the third item within a sign relation need not be mental
peirce distinguished between the interpretant and the interpreter
the interpretant is the internal mental representation that mediates between the object and its sign
the interpreter is the human who is creating the interpretant
peirce s interpretant notion opened the way to understanding an action of signs beyond the realm of animal life study of phytosemiosis zo semiosis anthroposemiosis biosemiotics which was his first advance beyond latin age semiotics
other early theorists in the field of semiotics include charles w
morris
writing in jozef maria bochenski surveyed the field in this way closely related to mathematical logic is the so called semiotics charles morris which is now commonly employed by mathematical logicians
semiotics is the theory of symbols and falls in three parts logical syntax the theory of the mutual relations of symbols logical semantics the theory of the relations between the symbol and what the symbol stands for and logical pragmatics the relations between symbols their meanings and the users of the symbols max black argued that the work of bertrand russell was seminal in the field
semioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted see modality
this process of carrying meaning depends on the use of codes that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion or even something as general as the clothes they wear
to coin a word to refer to a thing see lexical words the community must agree on a simple meaning a denotative meaning within their language but that word can transmit that meaning only within the language s grammatical structures and codes see syntax and semantics
codes also represent the values of the culture and are able to add new shades of connotation to every aspect of life
to explain the relationship between semiotics and communication studies communication is defined as the process of transferring data and or meaning from a source to a receiver
hence communication theorists construct models based on codes media and contexts to explain the biology psychology and mechanics involved
both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must decode the data i e be able to distinguish the data as salient and make meaning out of it
this implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication
indeed many of the concepts are shared although in each field the emphasis is different
in messages and meanings an introduction to semiotics marcel danesi suggested that semioticians priorities were to study signification first and communication second
a more extreme view is offered by jean jacques nattiez who as a musicologist considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics
semiotics differs from linguistics in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality
thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense
the branch of semiotics that deals with such formal relations between signs or expressions in abstraction from their signification and their interpreters or more generally with formal properties of symbol systems specifically with reference to linguistic signs syntax is referred to as syntactics
peirce s definition of the term semiotic as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the world s languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions
from a subjective standpoint perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the philosophy of language
in a sense the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects
different authors have called themselves philosopher of language or semiotician this difference does not match the separation between analytic and continental philosophy
on a closer look there may be found some differences regarding subjects
philosophy of language pays more attention to natural languages or to languages in general while semiotics is deeply concerned with non linguistic signification
philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics while semiotics might appear closer to some of the humanities including literary theory and to cultural anthropology
semiosis or semeiosis is the process that forms meaning from any organism s apprehension of the world through signs
scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include c s
peirce john deely and umberto eco
cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of semiotics and the humanities with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices
the research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics cognitive science and related disciplines on a common meta theoretical platform of concepts methods and shared data
cognitive semiotics may also be seen as the study of meaning making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences
this involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations
cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the center for semiotics at aarhus university denmark with an important connection with the center of functionally integrated neuroscience cfin at aarhus hospital
amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are per aage brandt svend stergaard peer bundg rd frederik stjernfelt mikkel wallentin kristian tyl n riccardo fusaroli and jordan zlatev
zlatev later in co operation with g ran sonesson established ccs center for cognitive semiotics at lund university sweden
finite semiotics developed by cameron shackell aims to unify existing theories of semiotics for application to the post baudrillardian world of ubiquitous technology
its central move is to place the finiteness of thought at the root of semiotics and the sign as a secondary but fundamental analytical construct
the theory contends that the levels of reproduction that technology is bringing to human environments demands this reprioritisation if semiotics is to remain relevant in the face of effectively infinite signs
the shift in emphasis allows practical definitions of many core constructs in semiotics which shackell has applied to areas such as human computer interaction creativity theory and a computational semiotics method for generating semiotic squares from digital texts
pictorial semiotics is intimately connected to art history and theory
it goes beyond them both in at least one fundamental way however
while art history has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as works of art pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes
pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them
according to g ran sonesson a swedish semiotician pictures can be analyzed by three models a the narrative model which concentrates on the relationship between pictures and time in a chronological manner as in a comic strip b the rhetoric model which compares pictures with different devices as in a metaphor and c the laokoon model which considers the limits and constraints of pictorial expressions by comparing textual mediums that utilize time with visual mediums that utilize space
the break from traditional art history and theory as well as from other major streams of semiotic analysis leaves open a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics
some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis cognitive psychology structuralist and cognitivist linguistics and visual anthropology and sociology
studies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a brand
culture codes strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brand s marketing especially internationally
if the company is unaware of a culture s codes it runs the risk of failing in its marketing
globalization has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations whether positive or negative across numerous markets
mistranslations may lead to instances of engrish or chinglish terms for unintentionally humorous cross cultural slogans intended to be understood in english
this may be caused by a sign that in peirce s terms mistakenly indexes or symbolizes something in one culture that it does not in another
in other words it creates a connotation that is culturally bound and that violates some culture code
theorists who have studied humor such as schopenhauer suggest that contradiction or incongruity creates absurdity and therefore humor
violating a culture code creates this construct of ridiculousness for the culture that owns the code
intentional humor also may fail cross culturally because jokes are not on code for the receiving culture
a good example of branding according to cultural code is disney s international theme park business
disney fits well with japan s cultural code because the japanese value cuteness politeness and gift giving as part of their culture code tokyo disneyland sells the most souvenirs of any disney theme park
in contrast disneyland paris failed when it launched as euro disney because the company did not research the codes underlying european culture
its storybook retelling of european folktales was taken as elitist and insulting and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in france
disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets
the park was a financial failure because its code violated the expectations of european culture in ways that were offensive
on the other hand some researchers have suggested that it is possible to successfully pass a sign perceived as a cultural icon such as the coca cola or mcdonald s logos from one culture to another
this may be accomplished if the sign is migrated from a more economically developed to a less developed culture
the intentional association of a product with another culture has been called foreign consumer culture positioning fccp
products also may be marketed using global trends or culture codes for example saving time in a busy world but even these may be fine tuned for specific cultures
research also found that as airline industry brandings grow and become more international their logos become more symbolic and less iconic
the iconicity and symbolism of a sign depends on the cultural convention and are on that ground in relation with each other
if the cultural convention has greater influence on the sign the signs get more symbolic value
the flexibility of human semiotics is well demonstrated in dreams
sigmund freud spelled out how meaning in dreams rests on a blend of images effects sounds words and kinesthetic sensations
in his chapter on the means of representation he showed how the most abstract sorts of meaning and logical relations can be represented by spatial relations
two images in sequence may indicate if this then that or despite this that freud thought the dream started with dream thoughts which were like logical verbal sentences
he believed that the dream thought was in the nature of a taboo wish that would awaken the dreamer
in order to safeguard sleep the midbrain converts and disguises the verbal dream thought into an imagistic form through processes he called the dream work
subfields that have sprouted out of semiotics include but are not limited to the following

the phrase was coined by daniel hoeg in semiotics mobility s design process for autonomous recognition and perception
the phrase also refers to machine learning and neural nets application of semiotic methods and semiotic machine learning to the analysis and development of robotics commands and instructions with subsystem communications in autonomous systems context
semiotics of mathematics the study of signs symbols sign systems and their structure meaning and use in mathematics and mathematics education charles sanders peirce a noted logician who founded philosophical pragmatism defined semiosis as an irreducibly triadic process wherein something as an object logically determines or influences something as a sign to determine or influence something as an interpretation or interpretant itself a sign thus leading to further interpretants
semiosis is logically structured to perpetuate itself
the object may be quality fact rule or even fictional hamlet and may be immediate to the sign the object as represented in the sign or dynamic the object as it really is on which the immediate object is founded
the interpretant may be immediate to the sign all that the sign immediately expresses such as a word s usual meaning or dynamic such as a state of agitation or final or normal the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant at most may coincide
his semiotic covered not only artificial linguistic and symbolic signs but also semblances such as kindred sensible qualities and indices such as reactions
he came c to classify any sign by three interdependent trichotomies intersecting to form ten rather than classes of sign
signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar
he regarded formal semiotic as logic per se and part of philosophy as also encompassing study of arguments hypothetical deductive and inductive and inquiry s methods including pragmatism and as allied to but distinct from logic s pure mathematics
in addition to pragmatism peirce provided a definition of sign as a representamen in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that represents something else in order to suggest it that is re present it in some way ferdinand de saussure the father of modern linguistics proposed a dualistic notion of signs relating the signifier as the form of the word or phrase uttered to the signified as the mental concept
according to saussure the sign is completely arbitrary i e there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning
this sets him apart from previous philosophers such as plato or the scholastics who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies
in his course in general linguistics saussure credits the american linguist william dwight whitney with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign
saussure s insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as jacques derrida roland barthes and jean baudrillard
ferdinand de saussure coined the term s miologie while teaching his landmark course on general linguistics at the university of geneva from to
saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful
rather a word is only a signifier i e the representation of something and it must be combined in the brain with the signified or the thing itself in order to form a meaning imbued sign saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science for in doing so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts
jakob von uexk ll studied the sign processes in animals
he used the german word umwelt environment to describe the individual s subjective world and he invented the concept of functional circle funktionskreis as a general model of sign processes
in his theory of meaning bedeutungslehre he described the semiotic approach to biology thus establishing the field that now is called biosemiotics
valentin voloshinov was a soviet russian linguist whose work has been influential in the field of literary theory and marxist theory of ideology
written in the late s in the ussr voloshinov s marxism and the philosophy of language russian marksizm i filosofiya yazyka developed a counter saussurean linguistics which situated language use in social process rather than in an entirely decontextualized saussurean langue
louis hjelmslev developed a formalist approach to saussure s structuralist theories
his best known work is prolegomena to a theory of language which was expanded in r sum of the theory of language a formal development of glossematics his scientific calculus of language
charles w
morris unlike his mentor george herbert mead morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the vienna circle positivism of his colleague rudolf carnap
morris was accused by john dewey of misreading peirce
in his foundations of the theory of signs he defined semiotics as grouped into three branches
semantics deals with the formal properties and interrelation of signs and symbols without regard to meaning
syntactics syntax deals with the formal structures of signs particularly the relation between signs and the objects to which they apply i e
signs to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote
pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis including all the psychological biological and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs
pragmatics is concerned with the relation between the sign system and sign using agents or interpreters i e the human or animal users thure von uexk ll the father of modern psychosomatic medicine developed a diagnostic method based on semiotic and biosemiotic analyses
roland barthes was a french literary theorist and semiotician
he often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others
for instance the portrayal of wine drinking in french society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities i e
that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating
he found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques
barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second order signs or connotations
a picture of a full dark bottle is a sign a signifier relating to a signified a fermented alcoholic beverage wine
however the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it making wine a new signifier this time relating to a new signified the idea of healthy robust relaxing wine
motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo
these insights brought barthes very much in line with similar marxist theory
algirdas julien greimas developed a structural version of semiotics named generative semiotics trying to shift the focus of discipline from signs to systems of signification
his theories develop the ideas of saussure hjelmslev claude l vi strauss and maurice merleau ponty
thomas a
sebeok a student of charles w
morris was a prolific and wide ranging american semiotician
although he insisted that animals are not capable of language he expanded the purview of semiotics to include non human signaling and communication systems thus raising some of the issues addressed by philosophy of mind and coining the term zoosemiotics
sebeok insisted that all communication was made possible by the relationship between an organism and the environment in which it lives
he also posed the equation between semiosis the activity of interpreting signs and life a view that the copenhagen tartu biosemiotic school has further developed
juri lotman was the founding member of the tartu or tartu moscow semiotic school
he developed a semiotic approach to the study of culture semiotics of culture and established a communication model for the study of text semiotics
he also introduced the concept of the semiosphere
among his moscow colleagues were vladimir toporov vyacheslav ivanov and boris uspensky
christian metz pioneered the application of saussurean semiotics to film theory applying syntagmatic analysis to scenes of films and grounding film semiotics in greater context
eliseo ver n developed his social discourse theory inspired in the peircian conception of semiosis
groupe founded developed a structural version of rhetorics and the visual semiotics
umberto eco was an italian novelist semiotician and academic
he made a wider audience aware of semiotics by various publications most notably a theory of semiotics and his novel the name of the rose which includes second to its plot applied semiotic operations
his most important contributions to the field bear on interpretation encyclopedia and model reader
he also criticized in several works a theory of semiotics la struttura assente le signe la production de signes the iconism or iconic signs taken from peirce s most famous triadic relation based on indexes icons and symbols to which he proposed four modes of sign production recognition ostension replica and invention
julia kristeva born a student of lucien goldmann and roland barthes bulgarian french semiotician literary critic psychoanalyst feminist and novelist
she uses psychoanalytical concepts together with the semiotics distinguishing the two components in the signification the symbolic and the semiotic
kristeva also studies the representation of women and women s bodies in popular culture such as horror films and has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies
michael silverstein a theoretician of semiotics and linguistic anthropology
over the course of his career he created an original synthesis of research on the semiotics of communication the sociology of interaction russian formalist literary theory linguistic pragmatics sociolinguistics early anthropological linguistics and structuralist grammatical theory together with his own theoretical contributions yielding a comprehensive account of the semiotics of human communication and its relation to culture
his main influence was charles sanders peirce ferdinand de saussure and roman jakobson
some applications of semiotics include
representation of a methodology for the analysis of texts regardless of the medium in which it is presented
for these purposes text is any message preserved in a form whose existence is independent of both sender and receiver
by scholars and professional researchers as a method to interpret meanings behind symbols and how the meanings are created
potential improvement of ergonomic design in situations where it is important to ensure that human beings are able to interact more effectively with their environments whether it be on a large scale as in architecture or on a small scale such as the configuration of instrumentation for human use and
marketing epure eisenstat and dinu express that semiotics allows for the practical distinction of persuasion from manipulation in marketing communication semiotics are used in marketing as a persuasive device to influence buyers to change their attitudes and behaviors in the market place
there are two ways that epure eisenstat and dinu building on the works of roland barthes state in which semiotics are used in marketing surface signs are used to create personality for the product creativity plays its foremost role at this level underlying the concealed meaning of the text imagery sounds etc
semiotics can also be used to analyze advertising effectiveness and meaning
cian for instance analyzed a specific printed advertisement from two different semiotic points of view
he applied the interpretative instruments provided by the barthes school of thinking focused on the description of explicit signs taken in isolation
he then analyzed the same advertising using greimas structural semiotics where a sign has meaning only when it is interpreted as part of a system in some countries the role of semiotics is limited to literary criticism and an appreciation of audio and visual media
this narrow focus may inhibit a more general study of the social and political forces shaping how different media are used and their dynamic status within modern culture
issues of technological determinism in the choice of media and the design of communication strategies assume new importance in this age of mass media
a world organisation of semioticians the international association for semiotic studies and its journal semiotica was established in
the larger research centers together with teaching program include the semiotics departments at the university of tartu university of limoges aarhus university and bologna university
publication of research is both in dedicated journals such as sign systems studies established by juri lotman and published by tartu university press semiotica founded by thomas a
sebeok and published by mouton de gruyter zeitschrift f r semiotik european journal of semiotics versus founded and directed by umberto eco et al the american journal of semiotics and as articles accepted in periodicals of other disciplines especially journals oriented toward philosophy and cultural criticism
