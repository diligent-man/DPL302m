erik homburger erikson born erik salomonsen june may was a german american developmental psychologist and psychoanalyst known for his theory on psychological development of human beings
he coined the phrase identity crisis
despite lacking a university degree erikson served as a professor at prominent institutions including harvard university of california berkeley and yale
a review of general psychology survey published in ranked erikson as the th most eminent psychologist of the th century
erikson s mother karla abrahamsen came from a prominent jewish family in copenhagen denmark
she was married to jewish stockbroker valdemar isidor salomonsen but had been estranged from him for several months at the time erik was conceived
little is known about erik s biological father except that he was a non jewish dane
on discovering her pregnancy karla fled to frankfurt am main in germany where erik was born on june and was given the surname salomonsen
she fled due to conceiving erik out of wedlock and the identity of erik s birth father was never made clear
following erik s birth karla trained to be a nurse and moved to karlsruhe germany
in she married erik s jewish pediatrician theodor homburger
in erik salomonsen s name was changed to erik homburger and in he was officially adopted by his stepfather
karla and theodor told erik that theodor was his real father only revealing the truth to him in late childhood he remained bitter about the deception all his life
the development of identity seems to have been one of erikson s greatest concerns in his own life as well as being central to his theoretical work
as an older adult he wrote about his adolescent identity confusion in his european days
my identity confusion he wrote was at times on the borderline between neurosis and adolescent psychosis erikson s daughter wrote that her father s real psychoanalytic identity was not established until he replaced his stepfather s surname homburger with a name of his own invention erikson the decision to change his last name came about as he started his job at yale and the erikson name was accepted by erik s family when they became american citizens
it is said his children enjoyed the fact they would not be called hamburger any longer
erik was a tall blond blue eyed boy who was raised in the jewish religion
due to these mixed identities he was a target of bigotry by both jewish and gentile children
at temple school his peers teased him for being nordic while at grammar school he was teased for being jewish
at das humanistische gymnasium his main interests were art history and languages but he lacked a general interest in school and graduated without academic distinction
after graduation instead of attending medical school as his stepfather had desired he attended art school in munich much to the liking of his mother and her friends
uncertain about his vocation and his fit in society erik dropped out of school and began a lengthy period of roaming about germany and italy as a wandering artist with his childhood friend peter blos and others
for children from prominent german families taking a wandering year was not uncommon
during his travels he often sold or traded his sketches to people he met
eventually erik realized he would never become a full time artist and returned to karlsruhe and became an art teacher
during the time he worked at his teaching job erik was hired by an heiress to sketch and eventually tutor her children
erik worked very well with these children and was eventually hired by many other families that were close to anna and sigmund freud
during this period which lasted until he was years old he continued to contend with questions about his father and competing ideas of ethnic religious and national identity
when erikson was twenty five his friend peter blos invited him to vienna to tutor art at the small burlingham rosenfeld school for children whose affluent parents were undergoing psychoanalysis by sigmund freud s daughter anna freud
anna noticed erikson s sensitivity to children at the school and encouraged him to study psychoanalysis at the vienna psychoanalytic institute where prominent analysts august aichhorn heinz hartmann and paul federn were among those who supervised his theoretical studies
he specialized in child analysis and underwent a training analysis with anna freud
helene deutsch and edward bibring supervised his initial treatment of an adult
simultaneously he studied the montessori method of education which focused on child development and sexual stages
in he received his diploma from the vienna psychoanalytic institute
this and his montessori diploma were to be erikson s only earned academic credentials for his life s work
in erikson married joan mowat serson a canadian dancer and artist whom erikson had met at a dress ball
during their marriage erikson converted to christianity
in with adolf hitler s rise to power in germany the burning of freud s books in berlin and the potential nazi threat to austria the family left an impoverished vienna with their two young sons and emigrated to copenhagen
unable to regain danish citizenship because of residence requirements the family left for the united states where citizenship would not be an issue
in the united states erikson became the first child psychoanalyst in boston and held positions at massachusetts general hospital the judge baker guidance center and at harvard medical school and psychological clinic
this was while he was establishing a singular reputation as a clinician
in erikson left harvard and joined the staff at yale university where he worked at the institute of social relations and taught at the medical school
erikson continued to deepen his interest in areas beyond psychoanalysis and to explore connections between psychology and anthropology
he made important contacts with anthropologists such as margaret mead gregory bateson and ruth benedict
erikson said his theory of the development of thought derived from his social and cultural studies
in he left yale to study the sioux tribe in south dakota on their reservation
after his studies in south dakota he traveled to california to study the yurok tribe
erikson discovered differences between the children of the sioux and yurok tribes
this marked the beginning of erikson s life passion of showing the importance of events in childhood and how society affects them
in he left yale and the eriksons moved to california where erik had been invited to join a team engaged in a longitudinal study of child development for the university of california at berkeley s institute of child welfare
in addition in san francisco he opened a private practice in child psychoanalysis
while in california he was able to make his second study of american indian children when he joined anthropologist alfred kroeber on a field trip to northern california to study the yurok
in after publishing the book childhood and society for which he is best known erikson left the university of california when california s levering act required professors there to sign loyalty oaths
from to he worked and taught at the austen riggs center a prominent psychiatric treatment facility in stockbridge massachusetts where he worked with emotionally troubled young people
another famous stockbridge resident norman rockwell became erikson s patient and friend
during this time he also served as a visiting professor at the university of pittsburgh where he worked with benjamin spock and fred rogers at arsenal nursery school of the western psychiatric institute
he returned to harvard in the s as a professor of human development and remained there until his retirement in
in the national endowment for the humanities selected erikson for the jefferson lecture the united states highest honor for achievement in the humanities
erikson s lecture was titled dimensions of a new identity
erikson is credited with being one of the originators of ego psychology which emphasized the role of the ego as being more than a servant of the id
although erikson accepted freud s theory he did not focus on the parent child relationship and gave more importance to the role of the ego particularly the person s progression as self
according to erikson the environment in which a child lived was crucial to providing growth adjustment a source of self awareness and identity
erikson won a pulitzer prize and a us national book award in category philosophy and religion for gandhi s truth which focused more on his theory as applied to later phases in the life cycle
in erikson s discussion of development he rarely mentioned a stage of development by age
in fact he referred to it as a prolonged adolescence which has led to further investigation into a period of development between adolescence and young adulthood called emerging adulthood
erikson s theory of development includes various psychosocial crises where each conflict builds off of the previous stages
the result of each conflict can have negative or positive impacts on a person s development however a negative outcome can be revisited and readdressed throughout the life span
on ego identity versus role confusion ego identity enables each person to have a sense of individuality or as erikson would say ego identity then in its subjective aspect is the awareness of the fact that there is a self sameness and continuity to the ego s synthesizing methods and a continuity of one s meaning for others
role confusion however is according to barbara engler the inability to conceive of oneself as a productive member of one s own society this inability to conceive of oneself as a productive member is a great danger it can occur during adolescence when looking for an occupation
the erikson life stages in order of the eight stages in which they may be acquired are listed below as well as the virtues that erikson has attached to these stages these virtues are underlined
hope basic trust vs
basic mistrust this stage covers the period of infancy years old which is the most fundamental stage of life as this is the stage that all other ones build off of
whether the baby develops basic trust or basic mistrust is not merely a matter of nurture
it is multi faceted and has strong social components
it depends on the quality of the maternal relationship
the mother carries out and reflects her inner perceptions of trustworthiness a sense of personal meaning etc
on the child
an important part of this stage is providing stable and constant care of the infant
this helps the child develop trust that can transition into relationships other than parental
additionally children develop trust in others to support them
if successful in this the baby develops a sense of trust which forms the basis in the child for a sense of identity failure to develop this trust will result in a feeling of fear and a sense that the world is inconsistent and unpredictable
will autonomy vs
shame this stage covers early childhood around years old and introduces the concept of autonomy vs
shame and doubt
the child begins to discover the beginnings of his or her independence and parents must facilitate the child s sense of doing basic tasks all by himself herself discouragement can lead to the child doubting his or her efficacy
during this stage the child is usually trying to master toilet training
additionally the child discovers their talents or abilities and it is important to ensure the child is able to explore those activities
erikson states it is essential to allow the children freedom in exploration but also create an environment welcoming of failures
therefore the parent should not punish or reprimand the child for failing at the task
shame and doubt occurs when the child feels incompetent in ability to complete tasks and survive
will is achieved with success of this stage
children successful in this stage will have self control without a loss of self esteem
purpose initiative vs
guilt this stage covers preschool children from ages three to five
does the child have the ability to do things on her own such as dress herself children in this stage are interacting with peers and creating their own games and activities
children in this stage practice independence and start to make their own decisions
if allowed to make these decisions the child will develop confidence in her ability to lead others
if the child is not allowed to make certain decisions then a sense of guilt develops
guilt in this stage is characterized by a sense of being a burden to others and the child will therefore usually present themselves as a follower as they lack the confidence to do otherwise
additionally the child is asking many questions to build knowledge of the world
if the questions earn responses that are critical and condescending the child will also develop feelings of guilt
success in this stage leads to the virtue of purpose which is the normal balance between the two extremes
competence industry vs
inferiority
this area covers school age children from five to twelve
children compare their self worth to others around them
friends can have a significant impact on the growth of the child
the child can recognize major disparities in personal abilities relative to other children
erikson places some emphasis on the teacher who should ensure that children do not feel inferior
during this stage the child s friend group increases in importance in his life
often during this stage the child will try to prove competency with things rewarded in society and also develop satisfaction with his abilities
encouraging the child increases feelings of adequacy and competency in ability to reach goals
restriction from teachers or parents leads to doubt questioning and reluctance in abilities and therefore may not reach full capabilities
competence the virtue of this stage is developed when a healthy balance between the two extremes is reached
fidelity identity vs
role confusion this section deals with adolescence meaning those between twelve and eighteen years old
this occurs when we start to question ourselves and ask questions relevant to who we are and what we want to accomplish
who am i how do i fit in where am i going in life the adolescent is exploring and seeking for her own unique identity
this is done by looking at personal beliefs goals and values
the morality of the individual is also explored and developed
erikson believes that if the parents allow the child to explore she will determine her own identity
if however the parents continually push her to conform to their views the teen will face identity confusion
the teen is also looking towards the future in terms of employment relationships and families
learning the roles she provides in society is essential since the teen begins to develop the desire to fit in to society
fidelity is characterized by the ability to commit to others and acceptance of others even with differences
identity crisis is the result of role confusion and can cause the adolescent to try out different lifestyles
love intimacy vs
isolation this is the first stage of adult development
this development usually happens during young adulthood which is between the ages of to
this stage marks a transition from just thinking about ourselves to thinking about other people in the world
we are social creatures and as a result need to be with other people and form relationships with them
dating marriage family and friendships are important during this stage in their life
this is due to the increase in the growth of intimate relationships with others
it is important to note that ego development earlier in life middle adolescence is a strong predictor of how well intimacy for romantic relationships will transpire in emerging adulthood
by successfully forming loving relationships with other people individuals are able to experience love and intimacy
they also feel safety care and commitment in these relationships
furthermore if individuals are able to successfully resolve the crisis of intimacy versus isolation they are able to achieve the virtue of love
those who fail to form lasting relationships may feel isolated and alone
care generativity vs
stagnation the second stage of adulthood happens between the ages of
during this time people are normally settled in their lives and know what is important to them
a person is either making progress in his career or treading lightly in his career and unsure if this is what he wants to do for the rest of his working life
also during this time a person may be raising their children
if they are a parent then they are reevaluating their life roles
this is one way of contributing to society along with productivity at work and involvement in community activities and organizations
individuals that exercise the concept of generativity believe in the next generation and seek to nurture them in creative ways through practices such as parenting teaching and mentoring
having a sense of generativity can be considered significant for both the individual and the society exemplifying their roles as effective parents leaders for organizations etc
if a person is not comfortable with the way his life is progressing he s usually regretful about the decisions that he has made in the past and feels a sense of uselessness
wisdom ego integrity vs
despair this stage affects the age group of and on
during this time an individual has reached the last chapter in her life and retirement is approaching or has already taken place
individuals in this stage must learn to accept the course of their life or they will look back on it with despair
ego integrity means the acceptance of life in its fullness the victories and the defeats what was accomplished and what was not accomplished
wisdom is the result of successfully accomplishing this final developmental task
wisdom is defined as informed and detached concern for life itself in the face of death itself having a guilty conscience about the past or failing to accomplish important goals will eventually lead to depression and hopelessness
achieving the virtue of the stage involves the feeling of living a successful life
for the ninth stage see erikson s stages of psychosocial development ninth stage favorable outcomes of each stage are sometimes known as virtues a term used in the context of erikson s work as it is applied to medicine meaning potencies
these virtues are also interpreted to be the same as strengths which are considered inherent in the individual life cycle and in the sequence of generations
erikson s research suggests that each individual must learn how to hold both extremes of each specific life stage challenge in tension with one another not rejecting one end of the tension or the other
only when both extremes in a life stage challenge are understood and accepted as both required and useful can the optimal virtue for that stage surface
thus trust and mis trust must both be understood and accepted in order for realistic hope to emerge as a viable solution at the first stage
similarly integrity and despair must both be understood and embraced in order for actionable wisdom to emerge as a viable solution at the last stage
psychoanalytic writers have always engaged in nonclinical interpretation of cultural phenomena such as art religion and historical movements
erik erikson gave such a strong contribution that his work was well received by students of religion and spurred various secondary literature
erikson s psychology of religion begins with an acknowledgement of how religious tradition can have an interplay with a child s basic sense of trust or mistrust
with regard to erikson s theory of personality as expressed in his eight stages of the life cycle each with their different tasks to master each also included a corresponding virtue as mentioned above which form a taxonomy for religious and ethical life
erikson extends this construct by emphasizing that human individual and social life is characterized by ritualization an agreed upon interplay between at least two persons who repeat it at meaningful intervals an in recurring contexts such ritualization involves careful attentiveness to what can be called ceremonial forms and details higher symbolic meanings active engagement of participants and a feeling of absolute necessity
each life cycle stage includes its own ritualization with a corresponding ritualism numinous vs
idolism judicious vs
legalism dramatic vs
impersonation formal vs
formalism ideological vs
totalism affiliative vs
elitism generational vs
authoritism and integral vs
dogmatism
perhaps erikson s best known contributions to the psychology of religion were his book length psychobiographies young man luther a study in psychoanalysis and history on martin luther and gandhi s truth on mohandas k
gandhi for which he remarkably won the pulitzer prize and the national book award
both books attempt to show how childhood development and parental influence social and cultural context even political crises form a confluence with personal identity
these studies demonstrate how each influential person discovered mastery both individually and socially in what erikson would call the historical moment
individuals like luther or gandhi were what erikson called a homo religiosus individuals for whom the final life cycle challenge of integrity vs
despair is a lifelong crisis and they become gifted innovators whose own psychological cure becomes an ideological breakthrough for their time
erikson married canadian born american dancer and artist joan erikson n e sarah lucretia serson in and they remained together until his death
the eriksons had four children kai t
