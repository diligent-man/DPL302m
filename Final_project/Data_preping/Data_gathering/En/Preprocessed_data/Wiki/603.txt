sacramental union latin unio sacramentalis martin luther s german sacramentliche einigkeit german sakramentalische vereinigung is the lutheran theological doctrine of the real presence of the body and blood of christ in the christian eucharist see eucharist in lutheranism
the sacramental union is distinguished from the other unions in theology like the personal union of the two natures in jesus christ the mystical union of christ and his church and the natural union in the human person of body and soul
it is seen as similar to the personal union in the analogue of the uniting of the two perfect natures in the person of jesus christ in which both natures remain distinct the integrity of the bread and wine remain though united with the body and the blood of christ
in the sacramental union the consecrated bread is united with the body of christ and the consecrated wine is united with the blood of christ by virtue of christ s original institution with the result that anyone eating and drinking these elements the consecrated bread and wine really eats and drinks the physical body and blood of christ as well
lutherans maintain that what they believe to be the biblical doctrine of the manducatio indignorum eating of the unworthy supports this doctrine as well as any other doctrine affirming the real presence
the manducatio indignorum is the contention that even unbelievers eating and drinking in the eucharist really eat and drink the body and blood of christ
this view was put forward by martin luther in his confession concerning christ s supper
it is asserted in the wittenberg concord of and in the formula of concord
the formula of concord couples the term with the circumlocution in with and under the forms of bread and wine used among lutherans to further define their view
lutherans believe that the words spoken by jesus christ at his last supper the words of institution bring about the sacramental union then and at all times whenever the christian eucharist is celebrated according to his mandate and institution
this view is sometimes erroneously identified as consubstantiation in that it asserts the simultaneous presence of four essences in the eucharist the consecrated bread the body of christ the consecrated wine and the blood of christ but it differs in that it does not assert a local three dimensional circumscribed presence of the body and blood in the sacramental bread and wine respectively which is rejected as gross carnal and capernaitic in the formula of concord
the term consubstantiation has been associated with such a local inclusion of the body and blood of christ in the sacramental bread and wine as has the term impanation lutherans have also rejected the designation of their position as consubstantiation because they believe it like transubstantiation is a philosophical explanation of the real presence whereas the sacramental union provides a description of the real presence
martin luther distinguished this doctrine from that of transubstantiation and impanation in this way the lutheran doctrine of the sacramental union is also distinct from the reformed view
the calvinistic view of christ s presence in the lord s supper a real spiritual presence is that christ is truly present at the meal though not substantially and particularly joined to the elements
this is in line with their general belief that the finite cannot contain the infinite finitum non est capax infiniti
lutherans on the other hand describe the personal union of the two natures in christ the divine and the human as sharing their predicates or attributes more fully
the doctrine of the sacramental union is more consistent with this type of christology
the lutheran scholastics described the reformed christological position which leads to this doctrine as the extra calvinisticum or calvinistic outside because the logos is thought to be outside or beyond the body of christ
