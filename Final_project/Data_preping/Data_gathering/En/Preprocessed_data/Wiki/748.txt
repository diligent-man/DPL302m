al im dud d n nas m azerbaijani seyid li i mad ddin n simi persian often known as nesimi was a th century azerbaijani ur f poet
known mostly by his pen name of nasimi he wrote in azerbaijani persian and sometimes arabic being the composer of one divan in azerbaijani one in persian and a number of poems in turkish and arabic
he is considered one of the greatest turkic mystical poets of the late th and early th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in turkic literary history
according to the third edition of the encyclopedia of islam nasimi is considered to be the true founder of turkic classical ar poetry
the third edition of the encyclopedia of islam notes that according to some sources including sib ibn al ajam died nasimi s given name was ali
the name nasimi was the pen name makhla he most commonly used
the encyclopedia of islam adds that although contested the name nasimi is most convincingly explained as a reflection of na imi the pen name of fazlallah astarabadi died
nasimi also used the pen name huseyni
the epithet laqab imadaddin which translates as the pillar of the religion or the title sayyid marking his claim of descent from the islamic prophet muhammad are often added in order to distinguish him from other figures who bore the name nasimi
most extant information about nasimi s life is unconfirmed
this includes his date of birth which without definite proof is usually said to be
nes m s birthplace is wrapped in mystery some claim that he was born in a province called nes m hence the pen name located either near aleppo in modern day syria or near baghdad in modern day iraq but no such province has been found to exist
according to the second edition of the encyclop dia of islam nasimi was an early ottoman poet and mystic and was most probably of turkoman origin
he was well versed in both turkic and persian but wrote some poems in arabic as well
from his poetry it s evident that nes m was an adherent of the ur f movement which was founded by nes m s teacher fa lull h astar b d of astar b d who was condemned for heresy and executed in alinja near nakhchivan
the center of fa lull h s influence was baku and most of his followers came from shirvan present day republic of azerbaijan then ruled by the shirvanshahs
nes m become one of the most influential advocates of the ur f doctrine and the movement s ideas were spread to a large extent through his poetry
while fa lull h believed that he himself was the manifestation of god for nes m at the center of creation there was god who bestowed his light on man
through sacrifice and self perfection man can become one with god
around or possibly as a direct result of his beliefs which were considered blasphemous by contemporary religious authorities nes m was seized and according to most accounts skinned alive in aleppo
a number of legends later grew up around nesimi s execution such as the story that he mocked his executioners with improvised verse and after the execution draped his flayed skin around his shoulders and departed
a rare historical account of the event the tarih i heleb of akhmad ibn ibrahim al halabi relates that the court which was of the maliki school of religious law was unwilling to convict nes m of apostasy and that the order of execution intstead came from the secular power of the emir of aleppo who was hoping to avoid open rebellion
nes m s tomb in aleppo remains an important place of pilgrimage to this day
nes m s collected poems or d v n number about and include ghazals qasidas lyrics and rub s quatrains in azerbaijani turkic persian and arabic
according to ali shir nava i nasimi wrote poetry in turkmeni and rumi however mehmet fuat k pr l argues that nasimi was unfamiliar with the dialect of anatolia
his turkic divan considered his most important work contains ghazals and more than rub s
a large body of bektashi and alevi poetry is also attributed to nes m largely as a result of hur f ideas influence upon those two groups
shah ismail i the founder of the safavid dynasty in iran who himself composed a divan in azerbaijani turkic under the pen name of khatai praised nesimi in his poems
according to the second edition of the encyclopedia of islam
one of nes m s most famous poems is the gazel beginning with the following lines
m nd s ar iki cahan m n bu cah na s mazam
g vh r i l m k n m n m k vn m k na s mazam
both worlds can fit within me but in this world i cannot fit
i am the placeless essence but into existence i cannot fit
the poem is an example of nes m s poetic brand of hurufism in its mystical form
there is a contrast made between the physical and the spiritual worlds which are seen to be ultimately united in the human being
as such the human being is seen to partake of the same spiritual essence as god the phrase l mek n or the placeless in the second line is a sufi term used for god
the same term however can be taken literally as meaning without a place and so nes m is also using the term to refer to human physicality
in his poem nes m stresses that understanding god is ultimately not possible in this world though it is nonetheless the duty of human beings to strive for such an understanding
moreover as the poem s constant play with the ideas of the physical and the spiritual underlines nes m calls for this search for understanding to be carried out by people within their own selves
this couplet has been described in different pictures movies poems and other pieces of arts
some of nes m s work is also more specifically hur f in nature as can be seen in the following quatrain from a long poem
g rd m ol ay v bayram eyledim
ol meye bu g zleri c m eyledimhecce vard m ezm i ehr m eyledim
f v z d l m i heqq n m eyledimseeing that moon i rejoiced
i made of my eyes a cup for its wine
i went on hajj in pilgrim s garb
i called f z d and l m by the name truth in the quatrain s last line f z d and l m are the names of the arabic letters that together spell out the first name of the founder of hurufism fazl ullah
as such nes m is praising his shaykh or spiritual teacher and in fact comparing him to god who is also given the name truth al haqq
moreover using the perso arabic letters in the poem in such a manner is a direct manifestation of hur f beliefs insofar as the group expounds a vast and complex letter symbolism in which each letter represents an aspect of the human character and all the letters together can be seen to represent god
nes m is also considered a superb love poet and his poems express the idea of love on both the personal and the spiritual plane
many of his gazels for instance have a high level of emotiveness as well as expressing a great mastery of language
z n menden nih n etmek dilersen etmegil
g zlerim ya n rev n etmek dilersen etmegilberq i nesrin zre miskin z lf n sen da d b
iqi b x nim n etmek dilersen etmegilshould you want to veil your face from me oh please do not
should you want to make my tears flow oh please do not should you want to lay your hair of musk atop the rose
and leave your lover destitute oh please do not nes m s work represents an important stage in the development of poetry not only in the azerbaijani language vernacular but also in the ottoman divan poetry tradition
after his death nes m s work continued to influence many turkic language poets and authors such as fuz l khata i and pir sultan abdal
nes m is venerated in the modern republic of azerbaijan and one of the districts of the capital city baku bears his name
there is also a monument to him in the city sculpted by t
