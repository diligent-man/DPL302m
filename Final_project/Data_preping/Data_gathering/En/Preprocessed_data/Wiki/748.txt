Alī Imādud Dīn Nasīmī Azerbaijani Seyid Əli İmadəddin Nəsimi سئید علی عمادالدّین نسیمی Persian عمادالدین نسیمی often known as Nesimi was a th century Azerbaijani Ḥurūfī poet Known mostly by his pen name of Nasimi he wrote in Azerbaijani Persian and sometimes Arabic being the composer of one divan in Azerbaijani one in Persian and a number of poems in Turkish and Arabic He is considered one of the greatest Turkic mystical poets of the late th and early th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in Turkic literary history According to the third edition of the Encyclopedia of Islam Nasimi is considered to be the true founder of Turkic classicalʿarūḍ poetry
The third edition of the Encyclopedia of Islam notes that according to some sources including Sibṭ Ibn al ʿAjamī died Nasimi's given name was Ali The name Nasimi was the pen name makhlaṣ he most commonly used The Encyclopedia of Islam adds that although contested the name Nasimi is most convincingly explained as a reflection of Na'imi the pen name of Fazlallah Astarabadi died Nasimi also used the pen name Huseyni The epithet laqab Imadaddin which translates as the pillar of the religion or the title Sayyid marking his claim of descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad are often added in order to distinguish him from other figures who bore the name Nasimi
Most extant information about Nasimi's life is unconfirmed This includes his date of birth which without definite proof is usually said to be Nesîmî's birthplace is wrapped in mystery some claim that he was born in a province called Nesîm — hence the pen name — located either near Aleppo in modern day Syria or near Baghdad in modern day Iraq but no such province has been found to exist
According to the second edition of the Encyclopædia of Islam Nasimi was an early Ottoman poet and mystic and was most probably of Turkoman origin He was well versed in both Turkic and Persian but wrote some poems in Arabic as well
From his poetry it's evident that Nesîmî was an adherent of the Ḥurūfī movement which was founded by Nesîmî's teacher Fażlullāh Astarābādī of Astarābād who was condemned for heresy and executed in Alinja near Nakhchivan The center of Fażlullāh's influence was Baku and most of his followers came from Shirvan present day Republic of Azerbaijan then ruled by the Shirvanshahs
Nesîmî become one of the most influential advocates of the Ḥurūfī doctrine and the movement's ideas were spread to a large extent through his poetry While Fażlullāh believed that he himself was the manifestation of God for Nesîmî at the center of Creation there was God who bestowed His Light on man Through sacrifice and self perfection man can become one with God Around or possibly as a direct result of his beliefs — which were considered blasphemous by contemporary religious authorities — Nesîmî was seized and according to most accounts skinned alive in Aleppo
A number of legends later grew up around Nesimi's execution such as the story that he mocked his executioners with improvised verse and after the execution draped his flayed skin around his shoulders and departed A rare historical account of the event — the Tarih i Heleb of Akhmad ibn Ibrahim al Halabi — relates that the court which was of the Maliki school of religious law was unwilling to convict Nesîmî of apostasy and that the order of execution intstead came from the secular power of the emir of Aleppo who was hoping to avoid open rebellion
Nesîmî's tomb in Aleppo remains an important place of pilgrimage to this day
Nesîmî's collected poems or dîvân number about and include ghazals qasidas lyrics and rubâ'îs quatrains in Azerbaijani Turkic Persian and Arabic According to Ali Shir Nava'i Nasimi wrote poetry in Turkmeni and Rumi however Mehmet Fuat Köprülü argues that Nasimi was unfamiliar with the dialect of Anatolia
His Turkic divan considered his most important work contains ghazals and more than rubâ'îs A large body of Bektashi and Alevi poetry is also attributed to Nesîmî largely as a result of Hurûfî ideas' influence upon those two groups Shah Ismail I the founder of the Safavid dynasty in Iran who himself composed a divan in Azerbaijani Turkic under the pen name of Khatai praised Nesimi in his poems
According to the second edition of the Encyclopedia of Islam
One of Nesîmî's most famous poems is the gazel beginning with the following lines
منده صغار ايكى جهان من بو جهانه صغمازام
گوهر لامکان منم كون و مکانه صغمازامMəndə sığar iki cahan mən bu cahâna sığmazam
Gövhər i lâ məkân mənəm kövn ü məkâna sığmazam
Both worlds can fit within me but in this world I cannot fit
I am the placeless essence but into existence I cannot fit
The poem is an example of Nesîmî's poetic brand of Hurufism in its mystical form There is a contrast made between the physical and the spiritual worlds which are seen to be ultimately united in the human being As such the human being is seen to partake of the same spiritual essence as God the phrase lâ mekân لامکان or the placeless in the second line is a Sufi term used for God The same term however can be taken literally as meaning without a place and so Nesîmî is also using the term to refer to human physicality In his poem Nesîmî stresses that understanding God is ultimately not possible in this world though it is nonetheless the duty of human beings to strive for such an understanding Moreover as the poem's constant play with the ideas of the physical and the spiritual underlines Nesîmî calls for this search for understanding to be carried out by people within their own selves This couplet has been described in different pictures movies poems and other pieces of arts
Some of Nesîmî's work is also more specifically Hurûfî in nature as can be seen in the following quatrain from a long poem
Şol meye bu gözleri câm eyledimHecce vardım ezm i ehrâm eyledim
Fâ vü zâd ı lâm i Heqq nâm eyledimSeeing that moon I rejoiced
I made of my eyes a cup for its wine
I went on Hajj in pilgrim's garb
I called Fâ Zâd and Lâm by the name TruthIn the quatrain's last line Fâ Zâd and Lâm are the names of the Arabic letters that together spell out the first name of the founder of Hurufism Fazl ullah As such Nesîmî is praising his shaykh or spiritual teacher and in fact comparing him to God who is also given the name Truth al Haqq Moreover using the Perso Arabic letters in the poem in such a manner is a direct manifestation of Hurûfî beliefs insofar as the group expounds a vast and complex letter symbolism in which each letter represents an aspect of the human character and all the letters together can be seen to represent God
Nesîmî is also considered a superb love poet and his poems express the idea of love on both the personal and the spiritual plane Many of his gazels for instance have a high level of emotiveness as well as expressing a great mastery of language
اوزكى مندن نهان ايتمك ديلرسه ڭ ايتمه غل
گوزلرم ياشڭ روان ايتمك ديلرسه ڭ ايتمه غلبرك نسرین اوزره مسکين زلفكى سن طاغدوب
عاشقى بى خانمان ايتمك ديلرسه ڭ ايتمه غلÜzünü menden nihân etmek dilersen etmegil
Gözlerim yaşın revân etmek dilersen etmegilBerq i nesrin üzre miskin zülfünü sen dağıdıb
Âşiqi bîxânimân etmek dilersen etmegilShould you want to veil your face from me oh please do not
Should you want to make my tears flow oh please do notShould you want to lay your hair of musk atop the rose
And leave your lover destitute oh please do notNesîmî's work represents an important stage in the development of poetry not only in the Azerbaijani language vernacular but also in the Ottoman Divan poetry tradition After his death Nesîmî's work continued to influence many Turkic language poets and authors such as Fuzûlî Khata'i and Pir Sultan Abdal
