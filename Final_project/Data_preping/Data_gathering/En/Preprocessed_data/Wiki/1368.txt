prostitution in hong kong is itself legal but organised prostitution is illegal as there are laws against keeping a vice establishment causing or procuring another to be a prostitute living on the prostitution of others or public solicitation
the most visible public venues for sex workers in hong kong especially for tourists are massage parlours and the so called japanese style night clubs
however most of the commercial sex worker industry consists of women working in small usually one room apartments usually referred to as one woman brothels the equivalent of the walk up brothel in the united kingdom
they advertise for clients through the internet and local classifieds
most popular mainstream newspapers will carry such classifieds with brothel guides as an insert within racing form guides
yellow neon advertising boxes were used to advertise sexual services to such an extent that yellow became synonymous with prostitution
in an attempt to prevent the spread of stis the authorities introduced hong kong ordinance no in
this required all brothels to be registered and inmates to undergo regular health checks
population census in and recorded and chinese brothel keepers
the annual report of the colonial surgeon reported that there were licensed chinese brothels containing prostitutes
from to prostitution was legal and regulated and prostitutes were required to register for licenses pay tax and have regular health examination
prostitution boomed in the districts of sai ying pun wan chai mong kok and yau ma tei
in hong kong with a population of boasted legal brothels with over licensed prostitutes
but in the hong kong government issued a ban on prostitution and three years later licensed prostitution ended
from that time on prostitution was permitted within strict limits while prohibiting a whole host of activities surrounding prostitution such as soliciting for sex and living off immoral earnings working as a pimp
it has also attracted prostitutes from other countries
most of them have come from southeast asia and even from europe and the united states
although organised prostitution is illegal the industry had always been under the influence of triads to recruit economically disadvantaged women who otherwise would never enter the profession voluntarily
until the s most hong kong underground sex establishments were run by gangsters
during the s however hong kong saw a massive shift in the form of prostitution
there was an influx of northern girls chinese from mainland china who worked as prostitutes illegally in hong kong on their short tourist visas local voluntary prostitutes also increased dramatically in number
as a result gangsters could no longer make a profit by coercion and their controlling power declined
lyndhurst terrace and the surrounding area were the location of some of the earliest brothels established in hong kong in the mid th century
the cantonese name of the street pai fa literally means flower arrangement possibly because of presence of numerous stalls in the area in the mid th century selling flowers to the customers of the nearby brothels
the name of lyndhurst terrace appears in this context in james joyce s finnegans wake published in
western prostitutes concentrated there while chinese brothels were located in the tai ping shan area near po hing fong
the chinese writer wang tao wrote in that tai ping shan street was full of brothels gaudy houses sporting brightly painted doors and windows with fancy curtains
the brothels gradually moved to possession street and relocated to shek tong tsui in
from to many brothels were declared by the government to be unlicensed and closed down
these were mainly in first second and third street but also in sheung fung lane ui on lane and centre street
in the early s spring garden lane and sam pan street in wan chai became a red light district with western and chinese prostitutes
to attract attention brothels were displaying large street number plates and the area became known as big number brothels
the tanka people an ethnic minority in coastal south china were a source of prostitutes for the sailors of the british empire
the tanka in hong kong were considered outcasts and categorised as low class
ordinary chinese prostitutes were afraid of serving westerners since they looked strange to them while the tanka prostitutes freely mingled with western men
the tanka assisted the europeans with supplies and providing them with prostitutes
low class european men in hong kong easily formed relations with the tanka prostitutes
the profession of prostitution among the tanka women led to them being hated by the chinese both because they had sex with westerners and because the tanka were seen as racially inferior
tanka prostitutes were considered low class greedy for money arrogant and liable to treat their clients badly
they had a reputation for punching their clients or mocking them by calling them names
nevertheless their brothels were said to be well kept and tidy
a fictional story written in the s described western items decorating the rooms of tanka prostitutes
the stereotype among most chinese in canton that all tanka women were prostitutes was common leading the government during the republican era to accidentally inflate the number of prostitutes when counting due to all tanka women being included
the tanka women were viewed as such that their prostitution activities were considered part of the normal bustle of a commercial trading city
tanka women were ostracised from the cantonese community and were nicknamed salt water girls ham shui mui in cantonese for their services as prostitutes to foreigners in hong kong
tanka women who worked as prostitutes for foreigners also commonly kept a nursery of tanka girls specifically for exporting them for prostitution work to overseas chinese communities such as in australia or america or to serve as a chinese or foreigner s concubine
a report called correspondence respecting the alleged existence of chinese slavery in hong kong presented to both houses of parliament by command of her majesty was presented to the english parliament in concerning the existence of slavery in hong kong which involved many tanka girls serving as prostitutes or mistresses to westerners
japanese prostitutes called karayuki san many coming from poor villages in kyushu started coming to hong kong in and constituted the majority of japanese residents of the territory in the s and s
there were licensed japanese brothels and prostitutes in hong kong in with the figure reaching a peak of in
initially located in central the japanese brothels later moved to wan chai
street prostitutes they may sometimes be seen on the pavements of yau ma tei sham shui po tsuen wan yuen long and tuen mun
usually pimps or gangsters are not involved and the prostitute will loiter in the street in search of customers
after a deal is struck they would go to a love hotel
before the asian financial crisis in street prostitutes would offer a set course of services after that the set price dropped by half
some girls will hang around the lobbies of hotels and will even knock on the doors of the rooms of single men after being tipped off by the concierge
in more down market accommodation the concierge may ask customers if they require company
american and other european prostitutes generally charge higher and are generally located in the business district of central one woman brothel jat lau jat fung y l u y f ng by hong kong law it is illegal for two or more prostitutes to work in the same premises
as a result the most common form of legal prostitution in hong kong is the so called one woman brothel where one woman receives customers in her apartment
the expense of the older centres of such activity has led to towns in the new territories such as yuen long and sheung shui becoming centres for the one woman brothel trade
this law however has little influence on the density of prostitute activity the nature of hong kong housing meaning that entire floors of some buildings or even whole apartment blocks may consist of one woman brothels with in some the letter of the law being adhered to by the subdivision of flats into multiple individual dwellings
saunas and massage parlours ostensibly these are regular saunas with the management turning a blind eye to other services the masseuses may offer
usually the menu on offer will fall just short of vaginal intercourse with manual stimulation with hands hand job breasts milk job or russian and oral sex bj being amongst the services available after negotiation
night club workers the term nightclub in hong kong is being driven from general use for being used as a euphemism for hostess clubs
hostesses receive a basic retainer and commission for having customers buy expensive drinks customers pay the club for the privilege of taking the girls out by paying a bar fine and buying out the girls time whatever comes after being a matter of negotiation between the customer and hostess
a similar format can be found at some karaoke lounges with private rooms
those that operate under the front of internet cafes have also existed but all were shut down in
freelance the growth of the internet has facilitated a practice similar to compensated dating with amateur prostitutes offering their services on message boards and forums
cnn reported in that social workers had found compensated dating was growing among hong kong teenage girls the caseload of girls engaging in this practice had doubled in two years the girls engaging in this practice had cut across socioeconomic levels and hong kong legal experts said the practice was a form of prostitution
cnn reported that students often teenagers sell sex so they can buy consumer goods such as cell phones and clothes
hong kong social worker chiu tak choi said that most girls who engage in compensated dating don t view themselves as prostitutes these sex workers are particularly visible in the wan chai district catering mainly to western businessmen and tourists
the sex workers operating in this area are predominantly thai including transsexuals and filipino
many work on a freelance basis in wan chai bars and discoth ques
there are several ngos that work closely with sex workers in hong kong these include ziteng and aids concern
ziteng campaigns for changes in the law in particular the overturn of ban on brothels with more than one prostitute since this prevents sex workers banding together for protection
many migrant sex workers arrive on a short tourist visa and try to make as much money as possible by prostituting illegally before leaving hong kong some returning frequently
there are also underground organisations such as thai restaurants and escort bars that arrange for foreign usually thai and mainland girls to gain work in hong kong legally with an entertainment visa but in fact they actually work in go go bars in wan chai or other hostess clubs around hong kong
in recent years prostitutes from eastern europe and russia have also come to hong kong
fake contracts often for domestic service facilitate trafficking in hong kong where a large number of east european women are also trafficked for prostitution purposes
despite the more visible presence of thai and filipino sex workers in hong kong the majority of migrant sex workers who come to hong kong are from mainland china
it is reported that with rmb mainland chinese girls would normally secure a three month visa
other frequent or previously deported visitors might experience tight visa requirements and would normally obtain only seven day visas
owing to the short stays and other expensive costs to pay for the travel arrangements and cover the high cost of renting apartments advertising etc
in hong kong sex workers would exert all their energy and work from morning till night during their seven day stay
the necessity to make money quickly also means that the sex workers are more likely to take risks
the advent of the two way permit and relaxation of restrictions on mainlanders to visit hong kong has continued to fuel the supply of workers from the mainland even though working would be in theory a violation of the visa conditions
many mainland girls advertise their services on websites where they put their pictures contact numbers and service charges
the youngest and most attractive may offer their services to customers at three or four star hotels and provide their services there their own accommodation is less likely to be of this quality but usually within a walk or short ride away from the main clusters of hotels to which they are led to by their pimps known locally as grooms
older less attractive girls will find themselves working in the one woman brothels as phoenixes a term derived from the similarity of the chinese word for prostitute to that of chicken
prices are lower than for girls who target the tourist hotels variations in price being a product of location with those working within the corridor formed by nathan road being on the whole higher than that found in the towns of the new territories
prostitution in hong kong is legal but subject to various restrictions mainly intended to keep it away from the public eye
these restrictions are manifested in the form of prohibiting a whole host of activities surrounding prostitution including soliciting and advertising for sex working as pimps running brothels and organised prostitution
for instance by the hong kong legal code chapter section any person who solicits for any immoral purpose in a public place may receive a maximum penalty of hk and six months imprisonment
in practice a woman on the street in certain areas well known for streetwalkers such as sham shui po might well be arrested even if seen smiling at a male passer by
advertisement of sex services including signboards illuminated signs and posters is also prohibited and an offence may result in imprisonment for months
in a test case in involving sex com an internet site created by two programmers who tailored on line advertisements for prostitutes its two principals were convicted of one count each of conspiring to live off the earnings of prostitution arising from the ads that appeared on their website
they were each fined and given a suspended sentence of eight months in prison
time out records it as the th most popular website in hong kong
as of november the site is active and ranks th most frequented site in hong kong
the site was shut down by the authorities in early december because the syndicate that controls it is allegedly engaged in activities that are otherwise illegal
organized prostitution in the form of directing over another person for the purpose of
that person s prostitution is forbidden by section and an offence may result in years of imprisonment
sections and which are aimed at pimps stipulate a jail sentence of seven years as the maximum penalty for procuring another person to become a prostitute and living on earnings of prostitution of others
under hong kong law it is also illegal to organise arrangement of sex deals for more than one woman violators are subject to a hk fine and seven years imprisonment
therefore if two women are found serving customers in the same apartment it is an illegal brothel
this gives rise to the so called one woman brothel where one woman receives customers in her apartment
this is the most common form of legal prostitution in hong kong
the law prohibits the prostitution of girls below the age of for vaginal sex below for anal sex and boys below for gross indecency
brothels are illegal prostitution in private however is legal
so many prostitutes in hong kong are one for one girls
to avoid the operation of an illegal brothel triads will purchase apartments in certain apartment blocks usually older tenements for subdivision and sublet them for amounts several times the prevailing rent for equivalent sized units so that the letter of the law is complied with
the girls advertise their services on web sites or in local publications
another avoidance strategy is to operate a karaoke establishment and provide girls as entertainment or companionship only the girls then take customers to an hourly hotel in the same building and pay for the room separately
informal individual prostitution mostly of filipinas indonesians thais and sometimes women from latin america and the former soviet union is almost always available at discos or hotel bars especially in the tsim sha tsui and wan chai districts the latter famous as the setting for the world of suzie wong
occasionally the police raid the triad run prostitution setups but usually the only arrests made are for immigration violations
hong kong is primarily a destination transit and to a much lesser extent a source territory for women and children subjected to sex trafficking
victims include citizens from mainland china indonesia the philippines thailand and other southeast asian countries as well as countries in south asia africa and south america
criminal syndicates or acquaintances sometimes lure women to hong kong from the philippines south america and mainland china using false promises of lucrative employment and force them into prostitution to repay money owed for passage to hong kong
traffickers sometimes psychologically coerce sex trafficking victims by threatening to reveal photos or recordings of the victims sexual encounters to their families
the united states department of state office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons ranks hong kong as a tier watch list territory
