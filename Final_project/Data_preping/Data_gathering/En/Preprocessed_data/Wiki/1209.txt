The Sharon plain (Hebrew: השרון HaSharon Arabic: سهل شارون Sahel Sharon) is the central section of the Israeli coastal plain
The plain lies between the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Samarian Hills, 15 km (9.3 mi) to the east
It stretches from Nahal Taninim, a stream marking the southern end of Mount Carmel in the north, to the Yarkon River in the south, at the northern limit of Tel Aviv, over a total of about 90 km (56 mi)
The level of the Sharon plain is connected to the level of the Mediterranean Sea by the Sharon Escarpment.
Parts of the Plain are included in the Central, and Tel Aviv Districts of Israel.
The Plain of Sharon is mentioned in the Bible (1 Chronicles 5:16, 27:29; Book of Isaiah 33:9, 35:2, 65:10), including the famous reference to the enigmatic "Rose of Sharon" (Song of Songs 2:1).
Prior to 1948, the region was subordinate to Jaffa Subdistrict and Tulkarm Subdistrict.
Historically, while some parts of the Sharon plain were very fertile, much of it was swampy and malarial, a condition exacerbated by massive Ottoman deforestation
Zionist immigrants arrived in the early 20th century, drained much of the swampy land, and populated the region with many settlements.
By 1945, Jaffa Subdistrict had a population of 373,800, consisting of 71% Jewish and 29% Palestinian Muslim and Christian
Tulkarm Subdistrict had a population 86,120, consisting of 17% Jewish and 83% Palestinian Muslim and Christian
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Arab population of the region left or was expelled almost entirely.
In 2008, it was the most densely populated region of Israel.
Excavations were performed before road construction in the north part of Sharon plain
Near En Esur an early Bronze Age planned metropolis – including a temple – stretching over 65 ha for 6,000 inhabitants was discovered
Underneath this 5000-year-old city, an even older settlement from 7000 YBP has been found, according to a report from the antiquities office of Israel from 6 October 2019.
