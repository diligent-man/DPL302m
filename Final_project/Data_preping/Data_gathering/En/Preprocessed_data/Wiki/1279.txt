the gallic wars were waged between bc and bc by the roman general julius caesar against the peoples of gaul present day france belgium along with parts of germany and the united kingdom
gallic germanic and british tribes fought to defend their homelands against an aggressive roman campaign
the wars culminated in the decisive battle of alesia in bc in which a complete roman victory resulted in the expansion of the roman republic over the whole of gaul
though the gallic military was as strong as the romans the gallic tribes internal divisions eased victory for caesar
gallic chieftain vercingetorix s attempt to unite the gauls under a single banner came too late
caesar portrayed the invasion as being a preemptive and defensive action but historians agree that he fought the wars primarily to boost his political career and to pay off his debts
still gaul was of significant military importance to the romans
native tribes in the region both gallic and germanic had attacked rome several times
conquering gaul allowed rome to secure the natural border of the river rhine
the wars began with conflict over the migration of the helvetii in bc which drew in neighboring tribes and the germanic suebi
by bc caesar had resolved to conquer all of gaul
he led campaigns in the east where the nervii almost defeated him
in bc caesar defeated the veneti in a naval battle and took most of northwest gaul
in bc caesar sought to boost his public image
he undertook first of their kind expeditions across the rhine and the english channel
rome hailed caesar as a hero upon his return from britain though he had achieved little beyond landing because his army had been too small
the next year he returned with a proper army and conquered much of britain
tribes rose up on the continent and the romans suffered a humiliating defeat
bc saw a draconian campaign against the gauls in an attempt to pacify them
this failed and the gauls staged a mass revolt under the leadership of vercingetorix in bc
gallic forces won a notable victory at the battle of gergovia but the romans indomitable siege works at the battle of alesia crushed the gallic coalition
in bc and bc there was little resistance and caesar s troops were mostly mopping up
gaul was conquered although it would not become a roman province until bc and resistance would continue until as late as ad
there is no clear end date for the war but the imminent roman civil war led to the withdrawal of caesar s troops in bc
caesar s wild successes in the war had made him wealthy and provided a legendary reputation
the gallic wars were a key factor in caesar s ability to win the civil war and declare himself dictator which culminated in the end of the roman republic and the establishment of the roman empire
julius caesar described the gallic wars in his book commentarii de bello gallico
it is the primary source for the conflict but modern historians consider it prone to exaggeration
caesar makes impossible claims about the number of gauls killed over a million while claiming almost zero roman casualties
modern historians believe that gallic forces were far smaller than the romans claimed and that the romans suffered significant casualties
historian david henige regards the entire account as clever propaganda meant to boost caesar s image and suggests it is of minimal historical accuracy
regardless of the accuracy of the commentarii the campaign was still exceptionally brutal
untold numbers of gauls were killed enslaved or mutilated including large numbers of civilians
the tribes of gaul were civilized and wealthy
most had contact with roman merchants and some such as the aedui who were governed by republics had enjoyed stable political alliances with rome in the past
during the first century parts of gaul were becoming urbanized which concentrated wealth and population centers inadvertently making roman conquest easier
though the romans considered the gauls to be barbarians their cities mirrored those of the mediterranean
they struck coins and traded extensively with rome providing iron grain and many slaves
in exchange the gauls accumulated much wealth and developed a taste for roman wine
the contemporary writer diodoros explains that part of the conception of gallic barbarity was because they drank their wine straight unlike the supposedly civilized romans who watered down their wine first
however the romans realized the gauls were a powerful fighting force and considered some of the most barbaric tribes to be the fiercest warriors as they were uncorrupted by roman luxuries
the gauls and the romans had significantly different military strategies
the roman army was a professional army armed and outfitted by the state extremely disciplined and kept standing between conflicts
however the professional army consisted mostly of heavy infantry any auxiliary units were fielded from the less disciplined roman allies which as the war progressed would include some gauls
by comparison the gauls were an irregular and less disciplined fighting force
individual gauls outfitted themselves thus while wealthy gauls were well equipped and rivalled the roman soldiers the average gallic warrior was poorly equipped compared to a roman
this was not an inherent disadvantage unlike the romans the gauls were a warrior culture
they prized acts of bravery and individual courage frequent raiding of neighboring tribes kept their fighting skills sharp
compared to the romans the gauls carried longer swords and had far superior cavalry
the gauls were generally taller than the romans a fact that seems to have embarrassed the romans and combined with their longer swords gave them a reach advantage in combat
both sides used archers and slingers
little is known about gallic battle strategy and the effectiveness of gallic slingers and archers is unknown
what is known indicates that battle strategy varied between tribes although engaging in pitched battle was frequent to prove bravery
not all tribes engaged the romans directly as rome was a formidable enemy
the gauls frequently used attrition warfare against them
while the gauls had much more flair in combat such as fighting in intricately decorated armor or even in the nude the superior discipline and formation of the romans combined with uniformly excellent equipment generally gave them an advantage in hand to hand fighting
the wars cemented the roman use of the cohort which had been established by the marian reforms passed by gaius marius uncle and father figure to julius caesar
that the cohort tactic was kept was likely due to caesar and his relationship with marius
a cohort replaced the prior maniple which had proved too small and ineffective
the cohort was an effective counterbalance to gallic and germanic tactics
the system diversified the ranks by combining men from different socio economic ranks unlike in the maniple system rich and poor fought alongside each other in a single uniform unit greatly increasing overall morale by removing resentment
a cohort held men ten of which combined with a small cavalry engineers and officers made a legion of around men
the marian reforms had also changed the practices of the army s baggage train though they would prove insufficient at times during the wars
each legionary was required to carry a substantial amount of his own gear including weapons and rations enough to operate independently of the baggage for a few days
this cut down the size of the baggage train greatly and allowed for a legion to temporarily march well ahead of its baggage
still a legion usually had around a thousand beasts of burden to carry the tents siege equipment reserve food entrenching tools records personal effects and all other items a large army needed
while on march the average legion with train stretched out for about mi km
such a large number of animals also required a great deal of grazing or fodder which limited campaigning to when there was grass or adequate supply
the logistical challenges of the baggage train would force the roman s hand many times during the wars
the romans respected and feared the gallic tribes
in bc the gauls had sacked rome which left an existential dread of barbarian conquest the romans never forgot
in bc rome conquered a group of southern gauls and established the province of transalpine gaul in the conquered lands
only years before the gallic wars in bc italy had been invaded from the north and saved by gaius marius only after several bloody and costly battles
around bc when a roman client state the gallic arverni conspired with the gallic sequani and the germanic suebi nations east of the rhine to attack the gallic aedui a strong roman ally rome turned a blind eye
the sequani and the arverni defeated the aedui in bc at the battle of magetobriga
rising politician and general julius caesar was the roman commander and agonist of the war
as a result of the financial burdens of being consul the highest office in the roman republic in bc caesar had incurred significant debts
to strengthen rome s position among the gauls he had paid substantial money to ariovistus king of the suebi to cement an alliance
through his influence as part of the first triumvirate the political alliance which comprised marcus licinius crassus pompey and himself during his consulship caesar had secured his assignment as proconsul governor to two provinces cisalpine gaul and illyricum by passage of the lex vatinia
when the governor of transalpine gaul metellus celer died unexpectedly the province was also awarded to caesar at the suggestion of pompey and caesar s father in law lucius calpurnius piso caesoninus
in the law granting him command of the provinces caesar was given a five year term as proconsul
this was longer than the traditional one year term that consuls received enabling him to engage in a military campaign without fear of command turnover
caesar had four veteran legions under his direct command initially legio vii legio viii legio ix hispana and legio x
as he had been governor of hispania ulterior in bc and had campaigned successfully with them against the lusitanians caesar knew most perhaps even all of the legions personally
he also had the legal authority to levy additional legions and auxiliary units as he saw fit
the assignment of the province that comprises what is now northern italy was helpful to his ambitions the po valley and the adjoining regions had large numbers of roman citizens who could be enticed to sign up for legionary service
his ambition was to conquer and plunder some territories to get himself out of debt
it is possible that gaul was not his initial target he may have been planning a campaign against the kingdom of dacia in the balkans instead
however a mass migration of gallic tribes in bc provided a convenient casus belli and caesar prepared for war
the helvetii were a confederation of about five related gallic tribes that lived on the swiss plateau hemmed in by the mountains and the rivers rhine and rh ne
they had come under increased pressure from germanic tribes to the north and the east and began planning for a migration around bc
they intended to travel across gaul to the west coast a route that would have taken them around the alps and through lands of the aedui a roman ally into the roman province of transalpine gaul
as word of the migration spread neighboring tribes grew concerned and rome sent ambassadors to several tribes to convince them not to join the helvetii
concern grew in rome that the germanic tribes would fill in the lands vacated by the helvetii
the romans much preferred the gauls to the germanic tribes as neighbors
the consuls of metellus and bc caesar both wanted to lead a campaign against the gauls though neither had a casus belli at the time
on the th of march in bc the helvetii began their migration bringing along all their peoples and livestock
they burned their villages and stores to ensure the migration could not be reversed
upon reaching transalpine gaul where caesar was governor they asked permission to cross the roman lands
caesar entertained the request but ultimately denied it
the gauls turned north instead entirely avoiding roman lands
the threat to rome was seemingly over but caesar led his army over the border and attacked the helvetii unprovoked
so began what historian kate gilliver describes as an aggressive war of expansion led by a general who was seeking to advance his career
caesar s consideration of the gallic request to enter rome was not indecision but a play for time
he was in rome when news of the migration arrived and he rushed to transalpine gaul raising two legions and some auxiliaries along the way
he delivered his refusal to the gauls and then promptly returned to italy to gather the legions he had raised on his previous trip and three veteran legions
caesar now had between and legionary troops and some quantity of auxiliaries many of whom were themselves gauls
he marched north to the river sa ne where he caught the helvetii in the middle of crossing
some three quarters had crossed he slaughtered those who had not
caesar then crossed the river in one day using a pontoon bridge
he followed the helvetii but chose not to engage in combat waiting for ideal conditions
the gauls attempted to negotiate but caesar s terms were draconian likely on purpose as he may have used it as another delaying tactic
caesar s supplies ran thin on june forcing him to travel towards allied territory in bibracte
while his army had easily crossed the sa ne his supply train had still not
the helvetii could now outmaneuver the romans and had time to pick up boii and tulingi allies
they used this moment to attack caesar s rearguard
in the ensuing battle of bibracte the gauls and romans fought for the better part of the day
after a hotly contested battle the romans eventually gained victory
caesar had set up his legions on a sloped hill which put the gauls at a disadvantage as they had to fight uphill
the helvetii started the battle with a probable feint which the romans easily repulsed
however the boii and tulingi then outmaneuvered the romans and attacked their right flank
at this point the romans were surrounded
a heated battle ensued
the men in the legion s last line were ordered to turn their backs around
they now fought on two fronts instead of just being attacked in the rear which gilliver describes as a brilliant tactical decision
eventually the helvetii were routed and fled
the romans chased the now outnumbered boii and tulingi back to their encampments killing the fighters as well as slaying the women and children
caesar s army rested for three days to tend to the wounded
they then gave chase to the helvetii who surrendered
caesar ordered them back on their lands to provide a buffer between rome and the even more feared germanic tribes
in the captured helvetian camp caesar claims that a census written in greek was found and studied of a total of helvetii of which were able bodied men only survivors remained to return home
historians believe the total was likely between with the excess exaggerated by caesar for propaganda purposes
see historiography section below for a detailed accounting
bibracte then the commercial hub of the gallic aedui tribe would again play a crucial role during the gallic uprising of bc
vercingetorix himself met with other gallic leaders there to plot the rebellion against caesar and the romans
after vercingetorix s revolt failed bibracte was slowly abandoned for other more prosperous settlements nearby
caesar then turned his attention to the germanic suebi whom he also wished to conquer
the senate had declared ariovistus king of the suebi a friend and ally of the roman people in bc so caesar needed a convincing casus belli to betray the suebi
he found his excuse following victory over the helvetii
a group of gallic tribes congratulated him and sought to meet in a general assembly hoping to leverage the romans against other gauls
diviciacus the head of the aeduan government and spokesmen for the gallic delegation expressed concern over ariovistus conquests and for the hostages he had taken
not only did caesar have a responsibility to protect the longstanding allegiance of the aedui but this proposition presented an opportunity to expand rome s borders strengthen loyalty within caesar s army and establish him as the commander of rome s troops abroad
with the attack of the harudes an apparent suebi ally on the aedui and the report that a hundred clans of suebi were trying to cross the rhine into gaul caesar had the justification he needed to wage war against ariovistus in bc
learning that ariovistus intended to seize vesontio the largest sequani town caesar began marched towards it and arrived before ariovistus
ariovistus sent emissaries to caesar requesting a meeting
they met under a truce at a knoll outside of town
the truce was violated when germanic horsemen edged towards the knoll and threw stones at caesar s mounted escort
two days later ariovistus requested another meeting
hesitant to send senior officials caesar dispatched valerius procillus his trusted friend and caius mettius a merchant who had traded successfully with ariovistus
insulted ariovistus threw the envoys in chains
ariovistus marched for two days and made camp two miles km miles behind caesar thus cutting off his communication and supply lines with the allied tribes
unable to entice ariovistus into battle caesar ordered a second smaller camp built near ariovistus position
the next morning caesar assembled his allied troops in front of the second camp and advanced his legions in towards ariovistus
each of caesar s five legates and his quaestor were given command of a legion
caesar lined up on the right flank
ariovistus countered by lining up his seven tribal formations
caesar was victorious in the ensuing battle due in large part to the charge made by publius crassus son of marcus crassus
as the germanic tribesmen began to drive back the roman left flank crassus led his cavalry in a charge to restore balance and ordered up the cohorts of the third line
as a result the whole germanic line broke and began to flee
caesar claims that most of ariovistus one hundred and twenty thousand men were killed
he and what remained of his troops escaped and crossed the rhine never to engage rome in battle again
the suebi camping near the rhine returned home
caesar was victorious
in one year he had defeated two of rome s most feared enemies
after this busy campaigning season he returned to transalpine gaul to deal with the non military aspects of his governorship
at this point it is possible he had already decided he would conquer all of gaul
caesar s stunning victories in bc had unsettled the gallic tribes
many rightly predicted caesar would seek to conquer all of gaul and some sought alliance with rome
as the campaigning season of bc dawned both sides were busy recruiting new soldiers
caesar set off with two more legions than the year before with to men along with a contingent of auxiliaries
the exact number of men the gauls raised is unknown but caesar claims he would fight
intervening again in an intra gallic conflict caesar marched against the belgae tribal confederation who inhabited the area roughly bounded by modern day belgium
they had recently attacked a tribe allied with rome and before marching with his army to meet them caesar ordered the remi and other neighboring gauls to investigate the belgae s actions
the belgae and the romans encountered each other near bibrax
the belgae attempted to take the fortified oppidum main settlement from the remi but were unsuccessful and chose instead to raid the nearby countryside
each side tried to avoid battle as both were short on supplies a continuing theme for caesar who gambled and left his baggage train behind several times
caesar ordered fortifications built which the belgae understood would give them a disadvantage
instead of making battle the belgic army simply disbanded as it could be re assembled easily
caesar realized an opportunity was presenting itself if he could beat the men from the army home he could take their lands with ease
his armies travel speed proved to be a crucial aspect of his ensuing victories
he rushed to the belgic suessiones oppidum at what is now villeneuve saint germain and laid siege to it
the belgic army nullified caesar s advantage by sneaking back into the city under cover of darkness
the roman siege preparations proved to be the decisive factor grand roman style siege warfare was unknown to the gauls and the might of the roman s preparations drove the gauls to surrender promptly
this had a ripple effect the nearby bellovaci and ambiones surrendered immediately afterward realizing the romans had defeated a powerful army without any combat
not all the tribes were so cowed though
the nervii allied with the atrebates and viromandui and planned to ambush the romans
the ensuing battle of the sabis was nearly a humiliating defeat for caesar and the roman victory was very hard won
the nervii set up an ambush along the river sambre lying in wait for the romans who arrived and started setting up camp
the romans detected the nervii and the battle began with the romans sending a light cavalry and infantry force across the river to keep the nervii at bay while the main force fortified its camp
the nervii easily repulsed the attack
in an uncharacteristic move for caesar he made a serious tactical error by not setting up an infantry screen to protect the entrenching force
the nervii took ample advantage of this and their entire force crossed the river quickly and caught the romans off guard and unprepared
as the battle began two legions had not even arrived whereas the nervii had at least fighters
the reserve legions were stuck at the end of the column km mi back with the animals of the baggage train
however because the soldiers could operate independently of the train the forwards legions were still ready for battle
the romans superior discipline and experience came in use and they quickly formed lines of battle
their center and left wings were successful and chased the atrebates across the river
to the tribes s advantage this exposed the half built camp and they took it easily
to make matters worse for the romans the right wing was in serious trouble
it had been outflanked its line of battle had become too tight to swing a sword and multiple officers were dead
the situation was so critical caesar took up his shield and joined the front line of the legion
his mere presence greatly increased morale and he ordered his men to form a defensive square to open the ranks and protect them from all sides
what turned the tide of battle was caesar s reinforcements the x legion which returned from chasing the atrebates and the two straggler legions that finally arrived
the strong stand by the x legion and the timely arrival of reinforcements enabled caesar to regroup redeploy and eventually repulse the nervii once the atrebates and viromandui were put to flight
caesar s cockiness had nearly ended in defeat but the legions experience combined with his personal role in combat turned a disaster into an incredible victory
the belgae were broken and most of the germanic tribes offered submission to rome
the end of the campaigning season saw caesar conquer tribes along the atlantic coast and deal with the atuatuci who were allies of the nervii but had broken the terms of surrender
caesar punished the atuatuci by selling of them into slavery
by law the profits were caesar s alone
he saw a minor setback towards winter as he sent one of his officers to the great st bernard pass where local tribes fought back fiercely he abandoned the campaign
but overall caesar had seen monumental success in bc
he had accumulated great wealth to pay off his debts and increased his stature to heroic levels
upon his return the senate granted him a day thanksgiving supplicatio longer than any before
his political reputation was now formidable
again he returned to transalpine gaul for the winter to see to the civil affairs of the province
he wintered his troops in northern gaul where the tribes were forced to house and feed them
the gauls were embittered at being forced to feed the roman troops over the winter
the romans sent out officers to requisition grain from the veneti a group of tribes in northwest gaul but the veneti had other ideas and captured the officers
this was a calculated move they knew this would anger rome and prepared by allying with the tribes of armorica fortifying their hill settlements and preparing a fleet
the veneti and the other peoples along the atlantic coast were versed in sailing and had vessels suitable for the rough waters of the atlantic
by comparison the romans were hardly prepared for naval warfare on the open ocean
the veneti also had sails whereas the romans relied on oarsmen
rome was a feared naval power in the mediterranean but there the waters were calm and less sturdy ships could be used
regardless the romans understood that to defeat the veneti they would need a fleet many of the venetic settlements were isolated and best accessible by sea
decimus brutus was appointed prefect of the fleet
caesar wished to sail as soon as the weather permitted and ordered new boats and recruited oarsmen from the already conquered regions of gaul to ensure the fleet would be ready as soon as possible
the legions were dispatched by land but not as a single unit
gilliver regards this as evidence that caesar s claims the prior year that gaul was at peace were untrue as the legions were apparently being dispatched to prevent or deal with rebellion
a cavalry force was sent to hold down the germanic and belgic tribes
troops under publius crassus were sent to aquitania and quintus titurius sabinus took forces to normandy
caesar led the remaining four legions overland to meet up with his recently raised fleet near the mouth of the river loire
the veneti held the upper hand for much of the campaign
their ships were well suited to the region and when their hill forts were under siege they could simply evacuate them by sea
the less sturdy roman fleet was stuck in harbor for much of the campaign
despite having the superior army and great siege equipment the romans were making little progress
caesar realized that the campaign could not be won on land and halted the campaign until the seas calmed enough for the roman vessels to be most useful
at last the roman fleet sailed and encountered the venetic fleet off the coast of brittany in the gulf of morbihan
they engaged in a battle that lasted from late in the morning until sundown
on paper the veneti appeared to have the superior fleet
their ships sturdy oak beam construction meant they were effectively immune to ramming and their high profile protected their occupants from projectiles
the veneti had some ships although gilliver notes many were likely not much more than fishing boats
caesar did not report the number of roman ships
the romans had one advantage grappling hooks
these allowed them to shred the rigging and sails of the venetic ships that got close enough rendering them inoperable
the hooks also allowed them to pull ships close enough to board
the veneti realized the grappling hooks were an existential threat and retreated
however the wind dropped and the roman fleet which did not rely on sails was able to catch up
the romans could now use their superior soldiers to board ships en masse and overwhelm the gauls at their leisure
just as the romans had beaten the superior forces of carthage in the first punic war by using the corvus boarding device a simple technological advantage the grappling hook allowed them to defeat the superior venetic fleet
the veneti now without a navy had been bested
they surrendered and caesar made an example of the tribal elders by executing them
he sold the rest of the veneti into slavery
caesar now turned his attention to the morini and menapii along the coast
during the venetic campaign caesar s subordinates had been busy pacifying normandy and aquitania
a coalition of lexovii coriosolites and venelli charged sabinus while he was entrenched atop a hill
this was a poor tactical move by the tribes
by the time they had reached the top they were exhausted and sabinus defeated them with ease
the tribes consequently surrendered yielding up all of normandy to the romans
crassus did not have such an easy time in facing the aquitania
with only one legion and some cavalry he was outnumbered
he raised additional forces from provence and marched south to what is now the border of modern spain and france
along the way he fought off the sotiates who attacked while the romans were marching
defeating the vocates and tarusates proved a tougher task
having allied with the rebel roman general quintus sertorius during his uprising in bc these tribes were well versed in roman combat and had learned guerilla tactics from the war
they avoided frontal battle and harassed supply lines and the marching romans
crassus realized he would have to force battle and located the gallic encampment of some
however they had only fortified the front of the camp and crassus simply circled it and attacked the rear
taken by surprise the gauls attempted to flee
however crassus cavalry pursued them
according to crassus only survived the overwhelming roman victory
the tribes surrendered and rome now controlled most of southwest gaul
caesar finished the campaign season by trying to take out the coastal tribes who had allied with the veneti
however they outmaneuvered the romans
due to superior knowledge of the local terrain which was heavily forested and marshy and a strategy of withdrawing there they avoided battle with the romans
poor weather worsened the situation and caesar could do little more than raid the countryside
realizing he would not meet the gauls in battle he withdrew for the winter
this was a setback for caesar as not pacifying the tribes would slow his campaigns the next year
the legions overwintered between the rivers sa ne and loire on the lands which they had conquered during the year
this was caesar s punishment to the tribes for having fought against the romans
non military business for caesar during the year included the politically pivotal luca conference in april which gave him another years as governor allowing time to finish his conquest of gaul
in exchange pompey and crassus would share the consulship for bc which further cemented the first triumvirate
a need for prestige more than tactical concerns likely determined caesar s campaigns in bc due to pompey and crassus consulship
on the one hand they were caesar s political allies and crassus s son had fought under him the year before
but they were also his rivals and had formidable reputations pompey was a great general and crassus was fabulously wealthy
since the consuls could easily sway and buy public opinion caesar needed to stay in the public eye
his solution was to cross two water bodies no roman army had attempted before the rhine and the english channel
crossing the rhine was a consequence of germanic celtic unrest
the suebi had recently forced the celtic usipetes and tencteri from their lands who resultingly had crossed the rhine in search of a new home
caesar however had denied their earlier request to settle in gaul and the issue turned to war
the celtic tribes sent out a cavalry force of against a roman auxiliary force of made up of gauls and won a surprising victory
caesar retaliated by attacking the defenseless celtic camp and slaughtering the men women and children
caesar claims he killed people in the camp
modern historians find this number impossibly high see historiography below but it is apparent that caesar killed a great many celts
so cruel were his actions his enemies in the senate wished to prosecute him for war crimes once his tenure as governor was up and he was no longer immune from prosecution
after the massacre caesar led the first roman army across the rhine in a lightning campaign that lasted just days
historian kate gilliver considers all of caesar s actions in bc to be a publicity stunt and suggests that the basis for continuing the celtic germanic campaign was a desire to gain prestige
this also explains the campaign s brief time span
caesar wanted to impress the romans and scare the germanic tribesmen and he did this by crossing the rhine in style
instead of using boats or pontoons as he had in earlier campaigns he built a timber bridge in a mere ten days
he walked across raided the suebic countryside and retreated across the bridge before the seubic army could mobilize
he then burned the bridge and turned his attentions to another feat no roman army had accomplished before landing in britain
the nominal reason to attack britain was the britonic tribes had been assisting the gauls but like most of caesar s casus belli it was just an excuse to gain stature in the eyes of the roman people
caesar s first trip into britain was less an invasion than an expedition
he took only two legions his cavalry auxiliaries were unable to make the crossing despite several attempts
caesar crossed late in the season and in great haste leaving well after midnight on august
initially he planned to land somewhere in kent but the britons were waiting for him
he moved up the coast and landed modern archeological finds suggest at pegwell bay but the britons had kept pace and fielded an impressive force including cavalry and chariots
the legions were hesitant to go ashore
eventually the x legion s standard bearer jumped into the sea and waded to shore
to have the legion s standard fall in combat was the greatest humiliation and the men disembarked to protect the standard bearer
after some delay a battle line was finally formed and the britons withdrew
because the roman cavalry had not made the crossing caesar could not chase down the britons
the romans luck did not improve and a roman foraging party was ambushed
the britons took this as a sign of roman weakness and amassed a large force to assault them
a short battle ensued though caesar provides no details beyond indicating the romans prevailed
again the lack of cavalry to chase down the fleeing britons prevented a decisive victory
the campaigning season was now nearly over and the legions were in no condition to winter on the coast of kent
caesar withdrew back across the channel
gilliver notes that caesar once again narrowly escaped disaster
taking an understrength army with few provisions to a far off land was a poor tactical decision which easily could have led to caesar s defeat yet he survived
while he had achieved no significant gains in britain he had accomplished a monumental feat simply by landing there
it was a fabulous propaganda victory as well which was chronicled in caesar s ongoing commentarii de bello gallico
the writings in the commentarii fed rome a steady update of caesar s exploits with his own personal spin on events
caesar s goal of prestige and publicity succeeded enormously upon his return to rome he was hailed as a hero and given an unprecedented day thanksgiving
he now began planning for a proper invasion of britain
caesar s approach towards britain in bc was far more comprehensive and successful than his initial expedition
new ships had been built over the winter and caesar now took five legions and cavalry
he left the rest of his army in gaul to keep order
gilliver notes that caesar took with him a good number of gallic chiefs whom he considered untrustworthy so he could keep an eye on them a further sign that he had not comprehensively conquered gaul
a series of revolts there late in the year were proof of continued gallic instability
caesar landed without resistance and immediately went to find the britonic army
the britons used guerilla tactics to avoid a direct confrontation
this allowed them to gather a formidable army under cassivellaunus king of the catuvellauni
the britonic army had superior mobility due to its cavalry and chariots which easily allowed them to evade and harass the romans
the britons attacked a foraging party hoping to pick off the isolated group but the party fought back fiercely and thoroughly defeated the britons
they mostly gave up resistance at this point and a great many tribes surrendered and offered tribute
the romans assaulted cassivellaunus stronghold likely modern day wheathampstead and he surrendered
caesar extracted payment of grain slaves and an annual tribute to rome
however britain was not particularly rich at the time marcus cicero summed up roman sentiment by saying its also been established that there isn t a scrap of silver in the island and no hope of booty except for slaves and i don t suppose you re expecting them to know much about literature or music regardless this second trip to britain was a true invasion and caesar achieved his goals
he had beaten the britons and extracted tribute they were now effectively roman subjects
caesar was lenient towards the tribes as he needed to leave before the stormy season set in which would make crossing the channel impossible
things did not run so smoothly back on the continent during bc
harvests had failed in gaul that year but caesar still wintered his legions there and expected the gauls to feed his troops
he did at least realize harvests had failed and spread his troops out so they would not overburden one tribe
but this isolated his legions making them easier to attack
gallic anger boiled over shortly after the legions made camp for the winter and tribes rebelled
the eburones under the competent ambiorix had been forced to winter a legion and five cohorts under quintus titurius sabinus and lucius aurunculeius cotta
ambiorix attacked the roman camp and told sabinus falsely that all of gaul was revolting and that the germanic tribes were also invading
he offered to give the romans safe passage if they abandoned their camp and returned to rome
in what gilliver describes as an incredibly foolish move sabinus believed ambiorix
as soon as sabinus left the camp his forces were ambushed in a steep valley
sabinus had not chosen an appropriate formation for the terrain and the green troops panicked
the gauls won decisively both sabinus and cotta were killed and only a handful of romans survived
the total defeat of sabinus spread revolutionary fervor and the atuatuci nervii and their allies also rebelled
they attacked the camp of quintus cicero brother to marcus cicero the famed orator and a key political player whom caesar wished to keep as a loyal ally
they also told cicero the story that ambiorix had related to sabinus but cicero was not as gullible as sabinus
he fortified the camp s defenses and attempted to get a messenger to caesar
the gauls began a fierce siege
having previously captured a number of roman troops as prisoners they used the knowledge of the romans tactics to build siege towers and earthworks
they then assaulted the romans nearly continuously for more than two weeks
cicero s message finally reached caesar and he immediately took two legions and cavalry to relieve the siege
they went on a forced march through the lands of the nervii making some miles km a day
caesar defeated the strong gallic army and finally rescued cicero s legion
the siege had led to the deaths of per cent of cicero s men
caesar s praise of quintus cicero s tenacity was unending
the winter uprising of bc had been a fiasco for the romans
one legion had been lost entirely and another almost destroyed
the revolts had shown the romans were not truly in command of gaul
caesar set out on a campaign to subjugate the gauls completely and forestall future resistance
down to seven legions he needed more men
two more legions were recruited and one was borrowed from pompey
the romans now had men
caesar began the brutal campaign early before the weather had warmed
he focused on a non traditional campaign demoralizing populations and attacking civilians
he assaulted the nervii and focused his energy on raiding burning villages stealing livestock and taking prisoners
this strategy worked and the nervii promptly surrendered
the legions returned to their wintering spots until the campaign season started fully
once the weather warmed caesar pulled a surprise attack on the senones
having had no time to prepare for a siege or even withdraw to their oppidum the senones also surrendered
attention turned to the menapii where caesar followed the same strategy of raiding he had used on the nervii
it worked just as well on the menapii who surrendered quickly
caesar s legions had been split up to put down more tribes and his lieutenant titus labienus had with him cohorts about men and a good deal of cavalry in the lands of the treveri led by indutiomarus
the germanic tribes had promised aid to the treveri and labienus realized that his relatively small force would be at a serious disadvantage
thus he sought to bait the treveri into an attack on his terms
he did so by feinting a withdrawal and the treveri took the bait
however labienus had made sure to feint up a hill requiring the treveri to run up it so by the time they reached the top they were exhausted
labienus dropped the pretense of withdrawing and gave battle defeating the treveri in minutes the tribe surrendered shortly after
in the rest of belgium three legions raided the remaining tribes and forced widespread surrender including the eburones under ambiorix
caesar now sought to punish the germanic tribes for daring to help the gauls
he took his legions over the rhine once more by building a bridge
but again caesar s supplies failed him forcing him to withdraw to avoid engaging with the still mighty suebi while short on supplies
regardless caesar had exacted widespread surrender through a vicious retaliatory campaign that focused on destruction over battle
northern gaul was essentially flattened
at the end of the year six legions were wintered two each on the lands of the senones the treveri and the lingones
caesar aimed to prevent a repeat of the previous disastrous winter but given the brutality of caesar s actions that year an uprising could not be stopped by garrisons alone
gallic existential concerns came to a head in bc and caused the widespread revolt the romans had long feared
the campaigns of bc had been particularly harsh and the gauls feared for their prosperity
previously they had not been united which had made them easy to conquer
but this changed in bc when caesar announced that gaul was now being treated as a roman province subject to roman laws and religion
this was a subject of immense concern for the gauls who feared the romans would destroy the gallic holy land which the carnutes watched over
each year the druids met there to mediate between the tribes on the lands considered the center of gaul
a threat to their sacred lands was an issue that finally united the gauls
over the winter the charismatic king of the arverni tribe vercingetorix assembled an unprecedented grand coalition of gauls
caesar was still in rome when news of the revolt reached him
he rushed to gaul in an attempt to prevent the revolt from spreading heading first to provence to see to its defense and then to agedincum to counter the gallic forces
caesar took a winding route to the gallic army to capture several oppidium for food
vercingetorix was forced to withdraw from his siege of the boii capital of gorgobina the boii had been allied to rome since their defeat at roman hands in bc
however it was still winter and he realized the reason caesar had detoured was that the romans were low on supplies
thus vercingetorix set out a strategy to starve the romans
he avoided attacking them outright and raided foraging parties and supply trains instead
vercingetorix abandoned a great many oppidum seeking only to defend the strongest and to ensure the others and their supplies could not fall into roman hands
once again a lack of supplies forced caesar s hand and he sieged the oppidum of avaricum where vercingetorix had sought refuge
originally vercingetorix had been opposed to defending avaricum but the bituriges cubi had persuaded him otherwise
the gallic army was camped outside the settlement
even while defending vercingetorix wished to abandon the siege and outrun the romans
but the warriors of avaricum were unwilling to leave it
upon his arrival caesar promptly began construction of a defensive fortification
the gauls continuously harassed the romans and their foraging parties while they built their camp and attempted to burn it down
but not even the fierce winter weather could stop the romans and they built a very sturdy camp in just days
the romans built siege engines and caesar waited for an opportunity to attack the heavily fortified oppidum
he chose to attack during a rainstorm when the sentries were distracted
siege towers were used to assault the fort and ballista artillery battered the walls
eventually the artillery broke a hole in a wall and the gauls could not stop the romans from taking the settlement
the romans then looted and pillaged avaricum caesar took no prisoners and claims the romans slew
that the gallic coalition did not fall apart after this defeat is a testament to the leadership of vercingetorix
even after losing avaricum the aedui were willing to revolt and join the coalition
this was yet another setback to caesar s supply lines as he could no longer get supplies through the aedui though the taking of avaricum had supplied the army for the moment
vercingetorix now withdrew to gergovia the capital of his own tribe which he was eager to defend
caesar arrived as the weather warmed and fodder finally became available which somewhat eased supply issues
as usual caesar promptly set about building a fortification for the romans
he captured territory closer to the oppidum
what happened in the ensuing battle of gergovia remains somewhat unclear
caesar claims that he had just ordered his men to take a hill near the oppidum and that he then sounded a retreat
but no such retreat occurred and the romans assaulted the settlement directly
gilliver finds it probable that caesar did not actually sound a retreat and that it was his plan all along to take the settlement
caesar s dubious claim was likely intended to distance himself from the ensuing and overwhelming roman failure
greatly outnumbered the roman assault ended in clear defeat
caesar claims that of his men died including centurions although the actual numbers are likely much higher
caesar withdrew from the siege and vercingetorix s victory attracted many more gallic tribes to his cause
despite their loss the romans still convinced numerous germanic tribes to join them after the battle
vercingetorix chose to defend the mandubii oppidum of alesia next in what would become the siege of alesia
he assembled some warriors
after the poor performance at gergovia caesar felt a direct assault on the gauls was no longer a viable solution so he opted to simply siege the settlement and starve out the defenders
vercingetorix was fine with this as he intended to use alesia as a trap to lay a pincer attack on the romans and sent a call for a relieving army at once
vercingetorix likely did not expect the intensity of the roman siege preparations
although modern archeology suggests that caesar s preparations were not as complete as he describes it is apparent that he laid some incredible siege works
over the span of a month the romans built some miles km of fortifications
these included a trench for soldiers an anti cavalry moat towers at regular intervals and booby traps in front of the trenches
the fortifications were dug in two lines one to protect from the defenders and one to protect from the relievers
archeological evidence suggests the lines were not continuous as caesar claims and made much use of the local terrain but it is apparent that they worked
vercingetorix s relieving army arrived quickly yet concerted coordinated attacks by both the defenders and relievers failed to oust the romans after multiple attacks the gauls realized they could not overcome the impressive roman siege works
at this point it became clear that the romans would be able to outlast the defenders and that the revolt was doomed
the relieving army melted away
vercingetorix surrendered and was held as a prisoner for the next six years until he was paraded through rome and ceremonially garroted at the tullianum in bc
with the revolt crushed caesar set his legions to winter across the lands of the defeated tribes to prevent further rebellion
he sent troops to protect the remi who had been steadfast allies to the romans throughout the campaign
but resistance was not entirely over caesar had not yet pacified southwest gaul
the spring of bc saw the legions campaign among the belgic tribes to snuff out any thoughts of an uprising and the romans achieved peace
but two chiefs in southwest gaul drappes and lucterius remained openly hostile to the romans and had fortified the formidable cadurci oppidum of uxellodunum
gaius caninius rebilus surrounded the oppidum and set the siege of uxellodunum focusing on building a series of camps a circumvallation and disrupting gallic access to water
a series of tunnels of which archeological evidence has been found were dug to the spring that fed the city
the gauls attempted to burn down the roman siege works but to no avail
eventually the roman tunnels reached the spring and diverted the water supply
not realizing the roman action the gauls believed the spring going dry was a sign from the gods and surrendered
caesar chose not to slaughter the defenders and instead just cut off their hands as an example
the legions were again wintered in gaul but little unrest occurred
all of the tribes had surrendered to the romans and little campaigning took place in bc
in the span of eight years caesar had conquered all of gaul and part of britain
he had become fabulously wealthy and achieved a legendary reputation
the gallic wars provided enough gravitas to caesar that subsequently he was able to wage a civil war and declare himself dictator in a series of events that would eventually lead to the end of the roman republic
the gallic wars lack a clear end date
legions continued to be active in gaul through bc when aulus hirtius took over the writing of caesar s reports on the war
the campaigns may well have continued into germanic lands if not for the impending roman civil war
the legions in gaul were eventually pulled out in bc as the civil war drew near for caesar would need them to defeat his enemies in rome
the gauls had not been entirely subjugated and were not yet a formal part of the empire
but that task was not caesar s and he left that to his successors
gaul would not be made formally into roman provinces until the reign of augustus in bc
several rebellions happened subsequently and roman troops were kept stationed throughout gaul
historian gilliver thinks there could have been unrest in the region as late as ad but not to the level of vercingetorix s revolt
the conquest of gaul marked the beginning of almost five centuries of roman rule which would have profound cultural and historical impacts
roman rule brought with it latin the language of the romans
this would evolve into old french giving the modern french language its latin roots
conquering gaul enabled further expansion of the empire into northwestern europe
augustus would push into germania and reach the elbe though settled on the rhine as the imperial border following the disastrous battle of the teutoburg forest
in addition to facilitating the conquest of parts of germania the roman conquest of britain led in ad by claudius also built on caesar s invasions
the roman hegemony would last with only one interruption until the crossing of the rhine in ad
very few sources about the gallic wars survive
the gauls did not record the history of their peoples and thus any gallic perspective has been lost to time
the writings of julius caesar remain the main source of information which complicates the task of historians as it is biased in his favor
only a handful of other contemporary works refer to the conflict but none as in depth as caesar s and most rely on caesar s account
the fact that he conquered gaul is certain
the details however are less clear
the main contemporary source for the conflict is julius caesar s commentarii de bello gallico which was largely taken as truthful and accurate until the th century
as late as camille jullian wrote a comprehensive history of gaul and took caesar s account as unerring
but after world war ii historians began to question if caesar s claims stood up
historian david henige takes issue with the supposed population and warrior counts
caesar claims that he could estimate the population of the helvetii because in their camp there was a census written in greek on tablets which would have showed helvetii and allies of whom exactly one quarter were combatants
but henige points out that such a census would have been difficult to achieve by the gauls that it made no sense to be written in greek by non greek tribes and that carrying such a large quantity of stone or wood tablets on their migration would have been a monumental feat
henige finds it oddly convenient that exactly one quarter were combatants suggesting that the numbers were more likely exaggerated by caesar than counted by census
contemporary authors also estimated the population of the helvetii and their allies was lower livy surmised that there were overall though henige still believes this number is inaccurate
hans delbr ck estimates that there were at most migrating helvetii of whom were warriors
gilliver thinks there were no more than helvetii and allies
during the campaign against the usipetes and the tenceri caesar makes the incredible claim that the romans attacked a camp of their victory was total they lost not a single soldier and that upon losing the tribes committed mass suicide
henige finds this entire story impossible as did ferdinand lot writing in
lot was one of the first modern authors who directly questioned the validity of these numbers finding a fighting force of to have been unbelievable for the time
gilliver also considers to be absurd but does note that it was likely the romans killed tens of thousands and finds the claim of zero roman losses possible
still the action to annihilate a non combatant camp was exceptionally brutal even by roman standards
ultimately modern scholars see the commentarii as a very clever piece of propaganda written by caesar built to make caesar appear far grander than he was
henige notes that caesar s matter of fact tone and easy to read writing made it all the easier to accept his outlandish claims
he sought to portray his fight as a justified defense against the barbarity of the gauls which was important as caesar had been the aggressor contrary to his claims
by making it appear that he had won against overwhelming odds and suffered minimal casualties he further reinforced the belief that he and the romans were protected by the gods and destined to win against the heathen barbarians of gaul
overall henige concludes that julius caesar must be considered one of history s earliest and most durably successful spin doctors
gilliver also calls caesar a spin doctor noting that he realized the importance of keeping up appearances in rome
kurt raaflaub argues in contrast to henige and gilliver that caesar s campaign was not in fact exceptionally brutal compared to the standards of the day even if it is considered ghoulish by modern standards
raaflaub notes that caesar generally tried to avoid battle where it was unnecessary and tried to be more lenient than most generals of his time
whether true or not caesar seems to go to great lengths to appear as having the moral high ground
this allows caesar to compare himself favorably to the barbarian gauls and present himself as raaflaub puts it as the perfect roman citizen
raaflaub contends that caesar s work is certainly full of propaganda but that it has more truth to it than most authors believe
above all he argues that it shows how caesar envisioned himself and how he thought a leader ought to rule
raaflaub notes that caesar s subjugation of the gauls would have been received favorably at home and have been considered a just peace
caesar s commentarii de bello gallico in latin is one of the best surviving examples of unadorned latin prose
it has consequently been a subject of intense study for latinists and is one of the classic prose sources traditionally used as a standard teaching text in modern latin education
it begins with the oft quoted phrase gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres meaning gaul is a whole divided into three parts
the introduction is world famed for its overview of gaul
the gallic wars have become a popular setting in modern historical fiction especially that of france and italy
in addition the comic ast rix is set shortly after the gallic wars where the titular character s village is the last holdout in gaul against caesar s legions
