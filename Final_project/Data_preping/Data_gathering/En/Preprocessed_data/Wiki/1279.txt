caesar portrayed invasion preemptive defensive action historian agree fought war primarily boost political career pay debts
native tribe region gallic germanic attacked rome several times
conquering gaul allowed rome secure natural border river rhine
war began conflict migration helvetii bc drew neighboring tribe germanic suebi
bc caesar defeated veneti naval battle took northwest gaul
rome hailed caesar hero upon return britain though achieved little beyond landing army small
next year returned proper army conquered much britain
bc saw draconian campaign gaul attempt pacify them
failed gaul staged mass revolt leadership vercingetorix bc
gallic force notable victory battle gergovia romans' indomitable siege work battle alesia crushed gallic coalition
bc bc wa little resistance caesar's troop mostly mopping up
gaul wa conquered although would become roman province bc resistance would continue late ad
clear end-date war imminent roman civil war led withdrawal caesar's troop bc
caesar's wild success war made wealthy provided legendary reputation
gallic war key factor caesar's ability win civil war declare dictator culminated end roman republic establishment roman empire
julius caesar described gallic war book commentarii de bello gallico
primary source conflict modern historian consider prone exaggeration
caesar make impossible claim number gaul killed million claiming almost zero roman casualties
modern historian believe gallic force far smaller roman claimed roman suffered significant casualties
historian david henige regard entire account clever propaganda meant boost caesar's image suggests minimal historical accuracy
regardless accuracy commentarii campaign wa still exceptionally brutal
untold number gaul killed enslaved mutilated including large number civilians
contact roman merchant aedui governed republic enjoyed stable political alliance rome past
first century part gaul becoming urbanized concentrated wealth population center inadvertently making roman conquest easier
though roman considered gaul barbarian city mirrored mediterranean
struck coin traded extensively rome providing iron grain many slaves
exchange gaul accumulated much wealth developed taste roman wine
contemporary writer diodoros explains part conception gallic barbarity wa drank wine straight unlike supposedly civilized roman watered wine first
however roman realized gaul powerful fighting force considered barbaric tribe fiercest warrior uncorrupted roman luxuries
roman army wa professional army armed outfitted state extremely disciplined kept standing conflicts
however professional army consisted mostly heavy infantry auxiliary unit fielded le disciplined roman ally war progressed would include gauls
individual gaul outfitted thus wealthy gaul well equipped rivalled roman soldier average gallic warrior wa poorly equipped compared roman
wa inherent disadvantage unlike roman gaul warrior culture
prized act bravery individual courage frequent raiding neighboring tribe kept fighting skill sharp
compared roman gaul carried longer sword far superior cavalry
gaul generally taller roman fact seems embarrassed roman combined longer sword gave reach advantage combat
little known gallic battle strategy effectiveness gallic slinger archer unknown
known indicates battle strategy varied tribe although engaging pitched battle wa frequent prove bravery
tribe engaged roman directly rome wa formidable enemy
gaul much flair combat fighting intricately decorated armor even nude superior discipline formation roman combined uniformly excellent equipment generally gave advantage hand-to-hand fighting
war cemented roman use cohort established marian reform passed gaius marius uncle father figure julius caesar
cohort tactic wa kept wa likely due caesar relationship marius
system diversified rank combining men different socio-economic rank unlike maniple system rich poor fought alongside single uniform unit greatly increasing overall morale removing resentment
cohort held men ten combined small cavalry engineer officer made legion around men
marian reform also changed practice army's baggage train though would prove insufficient time wars
legionary wa required carry substantial amount gear including weapon ration enough operate independently baggage days
cut size baggage train greatly allowed legion temporarily march well ahead baggage
still legion usually around thousand beast burden carry tent siege equipment reserve food entrenching tool record personal effect item large army needed
large number animal also required great deal grazing fodder limited campaigning wa grass adequate supply
logistical challenge baggage train would force roman's hand many time wars
bc gaul sacked rome left existential dread barbarian conquest roman never forgot
bc rome conquered group southern gaul established province transalpine gaul conquered lands
year gallic war bc italy invaded north saved gaius marius several bloody costly battles
around bc roman client state gallic arverni conspired gallic sequani germanic suebi nation east rhine attack gallic aedui strong roman ally rome turned blind eye
rising politician general julius caesar wa roman commander agonist war
result financial burden consul highest office roman republic bc caesar incurred significant debts
strengthen rome's position among gaul paid substantial money ariovistus king suebi cement alliance
influence part first triumvirate political alliance comprised marcus licinius crassus pompey consulship caesar secured assignment proconsul governor two province cisalpine gaul illyricum passage lex vatinia
governor transalpine gaul metellus celer died unexpectedly province wa also awarded caesar suggestion pompey caesar's father-in-law lucius calpurnius piso caesoninus
law granting command province caesar wa given five-year term proconsul
wa longer traditional one-year term consul received enabling engage military campaign without fear command turnover
caesar four veteran legion direct command initially legio vii legio viii legio ix hispana legio x
governor hispania ulterior bc campaigned successfully lusitanians caesar knew perhaps even legion personally
also legal authority levy additional legion auxiliary unit saw fit
assignment province comprises northern italy wa helpful ambition po valley adjoining region large number roman citizen could enticed sign legionary service
possible gaul wa initial target may planning campaign kingdom dacia balkan instead
however mass migration gallic tribe bc provided convenient casus belli caesar prepared war
helvetii confederation five related gallic tribe lived swiss plateau hemmed mountain river rhine rhne
come increased pressure germanic tribe north east began planning migration around bc
intended travel across gaul west coast route would taken around alp land aedui roman ally roman province transalpine gaul
word migration spread neighboring tribe grew concerned rome sent ambassador several tribe convince join helvetii
concern grew rome germanic tribe would fill land vacated helvetii
consul metellus bc caesar wanted lead campaign gaul though neither casus belli time
march bc helvetii began migration bringing along people livestock
upon reaching transalpine gaul caesar wa governor asked permission cross roman lands
gaul turned north instead entirely avoiding roman lands
threat rome wa seemingly caesar led army border attacked helvetii unprovoked
began historian kate gilliver describes aggressive war expansion led general wa seeking advance career
caesar's consideration gallic request enter rome wa indecision play time
wa rome news migration arrived rushed transalpine gaul raising two legion auxiliary along way
delivered refusal gaul promptly returned italy gather legion raised previous trip three veteran legions
marched north river sane caught helvetii middle crossing
caesar crossed river one day using pontoon bridge
followed helvetii chose engage combat waiting ideal conditions
gaul attempted negotiate caesar's term draconian likely purpose may used another delaying tactic
caesar's supply ran thin june forcing travel towards allied territory bibracte
army easily crossed sane supply train still not
helvetii could outmaneuver roman time pick boii tulingi allies
ensuing battle bibracte gaul roman fought better part day
caesar set legion sloped hill put gaul disadvantage fight uphill
helvetii started battle probable feint roman easily repulsed
however boii tulingi outmaneuvered roman attacked right flank
men legion's last line ordered turn back around
fought two front instead attacked rear gilliver describes brilliant tactical decision
roman chased outnumbered boii tulingi back encampment killing fighter well slaying woman children
caesar ordered back land provide buffer rome even feared germanic tribes
captured helvetian camp caesar claim census written greek wa found studied total helvetii able-bodied men survivor remained return home
historian believe total wa likely excess exaggerated caesar propaganda purposes
bibracte commercial hub gallic aedui tribe would play crucial role gallic uprising bc
vercingetorix met gallic leader plot rebellion caesar romans
vercingetorix's revolt failed bibracte wa slowly abandoned prosperous settlement nearby
caesar turned attention germanic suebi also wished conquer
senate declared ariovistus king suebi friend ally roman people bc caesar needed convincing casus belli betray suebi
group gallic tribe congratulated sought meet general assembly hoping leverage roman gauls
diviciacus head aeduan government spokesman gallic delegation expressed concern ariovistus' conquest hostage taken
caesar responsibility protect longstanding allegiance aedui proposition presented opportunity expand rome's border strengthen loyalty within caesar army establish commander rome troop abroad
attack harudes apparent suebi ally aedui report hundred clan suebi trying cross rhine gaul caesar justification needed wage war ariovistus bc
learning ariovistus intended seize vesontio largest sequani town caesar began marched towards arrived ariovistus
truce wa violated germanic horseman edged towards knoll threw stone caesar's mounted escort
hesitant send senior official caesar dispatched valerius procillus trusted friend caius mettius merchant traded successfully ariovistus
ariovistus marched two day made camp two mile km mile behind caesar thus cutting communication supply line allied tribes
unable entice ariovistus battle caesar ordered second smaller camp built near ariovistus' position
next morning caesar assembled allied troop front second camp advanced legion towards ariovistus
caesar wa victorious ensuing battle due large part charge made publius crassus son marcus crassus
germanic tribesman began drive back roman left flank crassus led cavalry charge restore balance ordered cohort third line
caesar claim ariovistus' one-hundred twenty thousand men killed
remained troop escaped crossed rhine never engage rome battle again
busy campaigning season returned transalpine gaul deal non-military aspect governorship
many rightly predicted caesar would seek conquer gaul sought alliance rome
campaigning season bc dawned side busy recruiting new soldiers
caesar set two legion year men along contingent auxiliaries
exact number men gaul raised unknown caesar claim would fight
intervening intra-gallic conflict caesar marched belgae tribal confederation inhabited area roughly bounded modern-day belgium
recently attacked tribe allied rome marching army meet caesar ordered remi neighboring gaul investigate belgae's actions
belgae attempted take fortified oppidum main settlement remi unsuccessful chose instead raid nearby countryside
side tried avoid battle short supply continuing theme caesar gambled left baggage train behind several times
caesar ordered fortification built belgae understood would give disadvantage
instead making battle belgic army simply disbanded could re-assembled easily
caesar realized opportunity wa presenting could beat men army home could take land ease
armies' travel speed proved crucial aspect ensuing victories
rushed belgic suessiones' oppidum villeneuve-saint-germain laid siege it
belgic army nullified caesar's advantage sneaking back city cover darkness
roman siege preparation proved decisive factor grand roman-style siege warfare wa unknown gaul might roman's preparation drove gaul surrender promptly
ripple effect nearby bellovaci ambiones surrendered immediately afterward realizing roman defeated powerful army without combat
ensuing battle sabis wa nearly humiliating defeat caesar roman victory wa hard-won
nervii set ambush along river sambre lying wait roman arrived started setting camp
roman detected nervii battle began roman sending light cavalry infantry force across river keep nervii bay main force fortified camp
uncharacteristic move caesar made serious tactical error setting infantry screen protect entrenching force
nervii took ample advantage entire force crossed river quickly caught roman off-guard unprepared
battle began two legion even arrived whereas nervii least fighters
reserve legion stuck end column km mi back animal baggage train
however soldier could operate independently train forward legion still ready battle
romans' superior discipline experience came use quickly formed line battle
center left wing successful chased atrebates across river
make matter worse roman right wing wa serious trouble
outflanked line battle become tight swing sword multiple officer dead
situation wa critical caesar took shield joined front line legion
mere presence greatly increased morale ordered men form defensive square open rank protect sides
turned tide battle wa caesar's reinforcement x legion returned chasing atrebates two straggler legion finally arrived
strong stand x legion timely arrival reinforcement enabled caesar regroup redeploy eventually repulse nervii atrebates viromandui put flight
caesar's cockiness nearly ended defeat legions' experience combined personal role combat turned disaster incredible victory
end campaigning season saw caesar conquer tribe along atlantic coast deal atuatuci ally nervii broken term surrender
saw minor setback towards winter sent one officer great st bernard pas local tribe fought back fiercely abandoned campaign
accumulated great wealth pay debt increased stature heroic levels
upon return senate granted day thanksgiving supplicatio longer before
returned transalpine gaul winter see civil affair province
wintered troop northern gaul tribe forced house feed them
roman sent officer requisition grain veneti group tribe northwest gaul veneti idea captured officers
wa calculated move knew would anger rome prepared allying tribe armorica fortifying hill settlement preparing fleet
veneti people along atlantic coast versed sailing vessel suitable rough water atlantic
comparison roman hardly prepared naval warfare open ocean
rome wa feared naval power mediterranean water calm le sturdy ship could used
regardless roman understood defeat veneti would need fleet many venetic settlement isolated best accessible sea
caesar wished sail soon weather permitted ordered new boat recruited oarsman already conquered region gaul ensure fleet would ready soon possible
gilliver regard evidence caesar's claim prior year gaul wa peace untrue legion apparently dispatched prevent deal rebellion
cavalry force wa sent hold germanic belgic tribes
troop publius crassus sent aquitania quintus titurius sabinus took force normandy
caesar led remaining four legion overland meet recently raised fleet near mouth river loire
ship well-suited region hill fort siege could simply evacuate sea
le sturdy roman fleet wa stuck harbor much campaign
despite superior army great siege equipment roman making little progress
caesar realized campaign could land halted campaign sea calmed enough roman vessel useful
last roman fleet sailed encountered venetic fleet coast brittany gulf morbihan
ships' sturdy oak beam construction meant effectively immune ramming high-profile protected occupant projectiles
veneti ship although gilliver note many likely much fishing boats
allowed shred rigging sail venetic ship got close enough rendering inoperable
hook also allowed pull ship close enough board
however wind dropped roman fleet rely sail wa able catch up
roman could use superior soldier board ship en masse overwhelm gaul leisure
roman beaten superior force carthage first punic war using corvus boarding device simple technological advantagethe grappling hookallowed defeat superior venetic fleet
surrendered caesar made example tribal elder executing them
venetic campaign caesar's subordinate busy pacifying normandy aquitania
coalition lexovii coriosolites venelli charged sabinus wa entrenched atop hill
raised additional force provence marched south border modern spain france
allied rebel roman general quintus sertorius uprising bc tribe well versed roman combat learned guerilla tactic war
avoided frontal battle harassed supply line marching romans
crassus realized would force battle located gallic encampment some
however fortified front camp crassus simply circled attacked rear
caesar finished campaign season trying take coastal tribe allied veneti
due superior knowledge local terrain wa heavily forested marshy strategy withdrawing avoided battle romans
poor weather worsened situation caesar could little raid countryside
wa setback caesar pacifying tribe would slow campaign next year
legion overwintered river sane loire land conquered year
non-military business caesar year included politically pivotal luca conference april gave another year governor allowing time finish conquest gaul
exchange pompey crassus would share consulship bc cemented first triumvirate
need prestige tactical concern likely determined caesar's campaign bc due pompey crassus' consulship
one hand caesar's political ally crassus's son fought year before
also rival formidable reputation pompey wa great general crassus wa fabulously wealthy
since consul could easily sway buy public opinion caesar needed stay public eye
solution wa cross two water body roman army attempted rhine english channel
suebi recently forced celtic usipetes tencteri land resultingly crossed rhine search new home
caesar however denied earlier request settle gaul issue turned war
celtic tribe sent cavalry force roman auxiliary force made gaul surprising victory
caesar retaliated attacking defenseless celtic camp slaughtering men woman children
modern historian find number impossibly high see historiography apparent caesar killed great many celts
cruel action enemy senate wished prosecute war crime tenure governor wa wa longer immune prosecution
massacre caesar led first roman army across rhine lightning campaign lasted days
historian kate gilliver considers caesar's action bc publicity stunt suggests basis continuing celticgermanic campaign wa desire gain prestige
caesar wanted impress roman scare germanic tribesman crossing rhine style
instead using boat pontoon earlier campaign built timber bridge mere ten days
walked across raided suebic countryside retreated across bridge seubic army could mobilize
burned bridge turned attention another feat roman army accomplished beforelanding britain
nominal reason attack britain wa britonic tribe assisting gaul like caesar's casus belli wa excuse gain stature eye roman people
caesar's first trip britain wa le invasion expedition
took two legion cavalry auxiliary unable make crossing despite several attempts
caesar crossed late season great haste leaving well midnight august
initially planned land somewhere kent briton waiting him
moved coast landedmodern archeological find suggest pegwell baybut briton kept pace fielded impressive force including cavalry chariots
eventually x legion's standard bearer jumped sea waded shore
legion's standard fall combat wa greatest humiliation men disembarked protect standard bearer
delay battle line wa finally formed briton withdrew
roman cavalry made crossing caesar could chase britons
romans' luck improve roman foraging party wa ambushed
briton took sign roman weakness amassed large force assault them
short battle ensued though caesar provides detail beyond indicating roman prevailed
lack cavalry chase fleeing briton prevented decisive victory
campaigning season wa nearly legion condition winter coast kent
taking understrength army provision far-off land wa poor tactical decision easily could led caesar's defeat yet survived
achieved significant gain britain accomplished monumental feat simply landing there
wa fabulous propaganda victory well wa chronicled caesar's ongoing commentarii de bello gallico
writing commentarii fed rome steady update caesar's exploit personal spin events
caesar's goal prestige publicity succeeded enormously upon return rome wa hailed hero given unprecedented day thanksgiving
caesar's approach towards britain bc wa far comprehensive successful initial expedition
new ship built winter caesar took five legion cavalry
gilliver note caesar took good number gallic chief considered untrustworthy could keep eye sign comprehensively conquered gaul
series revolt late year proof continued gallic instability
caesar landed without resistance immediately went find britonic army
britonic army superior mobility due cavalry chariot easily allowed evade harass romans
briton attacked foraging party hoping pick isolated group party fought back fiercely thoroughly defeated britons
mostly gave resistance point great many tribe surrendered offered tribute
roman assaulted cassivellaunus' stronghold likely modern day wheathampstead surrendered
caesar extracted payment grain slave annual tribute rome
however britain wa particularly rich time marcus cicero summed roman sentiment saying also established scrap silver island hope booty except slave suppose expecting know much literature music regardless second trip britain wa true invasion caesar achieved goals
caesar wa lenient towards tribe needed leave stormy season set would make crossing channel impossible
harvest failed gaul year caesar still wintered legion expected gaul feed troops
least realize harvest failed spread troop would overburden one tribe
gallic anger boiled shortly legion made camp winter tribe rebelled
eburones competent ambiorix forced winter legion five cohort quintus titurius sabinus lucius aurunculeius cotta
ambiorix attacked roman camp told sabinus falsely gaul wa revolting germanic tribe also invading
offered give roman safe passage abandoned camp returned rome
gilliver describes incredibly foolish move sabinus believed ambiorix
soon sabinus left camp force ambushed steep valley
sabinus chosen appropriate formation terrain green troop panicked
gaul decisively sabinus cotta killed handful roman survived
total defeat sabinus spread revolutionary fervor atuatuci nervii ally also rebelled
attacked camp quintus cicero brother marcus cicero famed orator key political player caesar wished keep loyal ally
also told cicero story ambiorix related sabinus cicero wa gullible sabinus
previously captured number roman troop prisoner used knowledge romans' tactic build siege tower earthworks
cicero's message finally reached caesar immediately took two legion cavalry relieve siege
went forced march land nervii making mile km day
caesar defeated strong gallic army finally rescued cicero's legion
caesar set campaign subjugate gaul completely forestall future resistance
assaulted nervii focused energy raiding burning village stealing livestock taking prisoners
legion returned wintering spot campaign season started fully
time prepare siege even withdraw oppidum senones also surrendered
attention turned menapii caesar followed strategy raiding used nervii
caesar's legion split put tribe lieutenant titus labienus cohort men good deal cavalry land treveri led indutiomarus
germanic tribe promised aid treveri labienus realized relatively small force would serious disadvantage
however labienus made sure feint hill requiring treveri run time reached top exhausted
labienus dropped pretense withdrawing gave battle defeating treveri minute tribe surrendered shortly after
rest belgium three legion raided remaining tribe forced widespread surrender including eburones ambiorix
caesar sought punish germanic tribe daring help gauls
caesar's supply failed forcing withdraw avoid engaging still mighty suebi short supplies
regardless caesar exacted widespread surrender vicious retaliatory campaign focused destruction battle
end year six legion wintered two land senones treveri lingones
caesar aimed prevent repeat previous disastrous winter given brutality caesar's action year uprising could stopped garrison alone
gallic existential concern came head bc caused widespread revolt roman long feared
changed bc caesar announced gaul wa treated roman province subject roman law religion
wa subject immense concern gaul feared roman would destroy gallic holy land carnutes watched over
year druid met mediate tribe land considered center gaul
threat sacred land wa issue finally united gauls
winter charismatic king arverni tribe vercingetorix assembled unprecedented grand coalition gauls
caesar wa still rome news revolt reached him
rushed gaul attempt prevent revolt spreading heading first provence see defense agedincum counter gallic forces
caesar took winding route gallic army capture several oppidium food
vercingetorix wa forced withdraw siege boii capital gorgobina boii allied rome since defeat roman hand bc
however wa still winter realized reason caesar detoured wa roman low supplies
avoided attacking outright raided foraging party supply train instead
vercingetorix abandoned great many oppidum seeking defend strongest ensure others supply could fall roman hands
lack supply forced caesar's hand sieged oppidum avaricum vercingetorix sought refuge
originally vercingetorix opposed defending avaricum bituriges cubi persuaded otherwise
even defending vercingetorix wished abandon siege outrun romans
upon arrival caesar promptly began construction defensive fortification
gaul continuously harassed roman foraging party built camp attempted burn down
even fierce winter weather could stop roman built sturdy camp days
roman built siege engine caesar waited opportunity attack heavily fortified oppidum
siege tower used assault fort ballista artillery battered walls
eventually artillery broke hole wall gaul could stop roman taking settlement
roman looted pillaged avaricum caesar took prisoner claim roman slew
gallic coalition fall apart defeat testament leadership vercingetorix
even losing avaricum aedui willing revolt join coalition
wa yet another setback caesar's supply line could longer get supply aedui though taking avaricum supplied army moment
vercingetorix withdrew gergovia capital tribe wa eager defend
caesar arrived weather warmed fodder finally became available somewhat eased supply issues
caesar claim ordered men take hill near oppidum sounded retreat
gilliver find probable caesar actually sound retreat wa plan along take settlement
caesar's dubious claim wa likely intended distance ensuing overwhelming roman failure
caesar claim men died including centurion although actual number likely much higher
caesar withdrew siege vercingetorix's victory attracted many gallic tribe cause
despite loss roman still convinced numerous germanic tribe join battle
vercingetorix chose defend mandubii oppidum alesia next would become siege alesia
poor performance gergovia caesar felt direct assault gaul wa longer viable solution opted simply siege settlement starve defenders
vercingetorix wa fine intended use alesia trap lay pincer attack roman sent call relieving army once
although modern archeology suggests caesar's preparation complete describes apparent laid incredible siege works
included trench soldier anti-cavalry moat tower regular interval booby trap front trenches
fortification dug two line one protect defender one protect relievers
archeological evidence suggests line continuous caesar claim made much use local terrain apparent worked
vercingetorix's relieving army arrived quickly yet concerted coordinated attack defender reliever failed oust romansafter multiple attack gaul realized could overcome impressive roman siege works
point became clear roman would able outlast defender revolt wa doomed
vercingetorix surrendered wa held prisoner next six year wa paraded rome ceremonially garroted tullianum bc
revolt crushed caesar set legion winter across land defeated tribe prevent rebellion
sent troop protect remi steadfast ally roman throughout campaign
resistance wa entirely caesar yet pacified southwest gaul
spring bc saw legion campaign among belgic tribe snuff thought uprising roman achieved peace
two chief southwest gaul drappes lucterius remained openly hostile roman fortified formidable cadurci oppidum uxellodunum
gaius caninius rebilus surrounded oppidum set siege uxellodunum focusing building series camp circumvallation disrupting gallic access water
series tunnel archeological evidence ha found dug spring fed city
eventually roman tunnel reached spring diverted water supply
realizing roman action gaul believed spring going dry wa sign god surrendered
caesar chose slaughter defender instead cut hand example
tribe surrendered roman little campaigning took place bc
span eight year caesar conquered gaul part britain
gallic war provided enough gravitas caesar subsequently wa able wage civil war declare dictator series event would eventually lead end roman republic
legion continued active gaul bc aulus hirtius took writing caesar's report war
campaign may well continued germanic land impending roman civil war
legion gaul eventually pulled bc civil war drew near caesar would need defeat enemy rome
gaul would made formally roman province reign augustus bc
several rebellion happened subsequently roman troop kept stationed throughout gaul
historian gilliver think could unrest region late ad level vercingetorix's revolt
conquest gaul marked beginning almost five century roman rule would profound cultural historical impacts
would evolve old french giving modern french language latin roots
augustus would push germania reach elbe though settled rhine imperial border following disastrous battle teutoburg forest
addition facilitating conquest part germania roman conquest britain led ad claudius also built caesar's invasions
roman hegemony would last one interruption crossing rhine ad
gaul record history people thus gallic perspective ha lost time
writing julius caesar remain main source information complicates task historian biased favor
handful contemporary work refer conflict none in-depth caesar's rely caesar's account
main contemporary source conflict julius caesar's commentarii de bello gallico wa largely taken truthful accurate century
late camille jullian wrote comprehensive history gaul took caesar's account unerring
world war ii historian began question caesar's claim stood up
historian david henige take issue supposed population warrior counts
caesar claim could estimate population helvetii camp wa census written greek tablet would showed helvetii ally exactly one quarter combatants
henige point census would difficult achieve gaul made sense written greek non-greek tribe carrying large quantity stone wood tablet migration would monumental feat
henige find oddly convenient exactly one quarter combatant suggesting number likely exaggerated caesar counted census
contemporary author also estimated population helvetii ally wa lower livy surmised overall though henige still belief number inaccurate
campaign usipetes tenceri caesar make incredible claim roman attacked camp victory wa total lost single soldier upon losing tribe committed mass suicide
henige find entire story impossible ferdinand lot writing in
lot wa one first modern author directly questioned validity number finding fighting force unbelievable time
gilliver also considers absurd doe note wa likely roman killed ten thousand find claim zero roman loss possible
still action annihilate non-combatant camp wa exceptionally brutal even roman standards
ultimately modern scholar see commentarii clever piece propaganda written caesar built make caesar appear far grander was
henige note caesar's matter-of-fact tone easy-to-read writing made easier accept outlandish claims
sought portray fight justified defense barbarity gaul wa important caesar aggressor contrary claims
making appear overwhelming odds suffered minimal casualty reinforced belief roman protected god destined win heathen barbarian gaul
overall henige concludes julius caesar must considered one history's earliest durably successful spin doctors'
gilliver also call caesar spin-doctor noting realized importance keeping appearance rome
kurt raaflaub argues contrast henige gilliver caesar's campaign wa fact exceptionally brutal compared standard day even considered ghoulish modern standards
raaflaub note caesar generally tried avoid battle wa unnecessary tried lenient general time
whether true caesar seems go great length appear moral high ground
allows caesar compare favorably barbarian gaul present raaflaub put perfect roman citizen
raaflaub contends caesar's work certainly full propaganda ha truth author believe
argues show caesar envisioned thought leader ought rule
raaflaub note caesar's subjugation gaul would received favorably home considered peace
caesar's commentarii de bello gallico latin one best surviving example unadorned latin prose
ha consequently subject intense study latinist one classic prose source traditionally used standard teaching text modern latin education
