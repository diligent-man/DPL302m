A Rebbe Hebrew רבי ˈrɛbɛ or Admor Hebrew אדמו״ר is the spiritual leader in the Hasidic movement and the personalities of its dynasties
The titles of Rebbe and Admor which used to be a general honor title even before the beginning of the movement became over time almost exclusively identified with its Tzaddikim
Today rebbe is used in the following ways
Rabbi a teacher of Torah Yeshiva students or cheder elementary school students when talking to their teacher would address him with the honorific Rebbe as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the Hebrew word rabbi רַבִּי‎ rabi ˈʁabi
Personal mentor and teacher—A person's main Rosh Yeshiva Yeshiva teacher or mentor who teaches him or her Talmud and Torah and gives religious guidance is referred to as rebbe ˈrɛbə also as an equivalent to the term rabbi
Spiritual leader—The spiritual head of a Hasidic movement is called a rebbe ˈrɛbə
His followers would address him as The Rebbe or refer to him when speaking to others as the Rebbe or my Rebbe
He is referred to by others as the Rebbe of a particular Hasidic dynasty
In Hebrew a Hasidic rebbe is often referred to as an AdMoR which is an abbreviation for Adoneinu Moreinu veRabbenu Our Master our Teacher and our Rabbi
In writing this title is placed before the name of the Hasidut as in Admor of Belz while the title Rebbe comes after the name of the Hasidut when used as an adjective as in Lubavitcher Rebbe Amshinever Rebbe and every rebbe of every Hasidic dynasty
In the Litvishe world when not referring to a hasidic rebbe ˈrɛbə the word can be pronounced rebbee ˈrɛbi
Sephardic Jews can pronounce it as Ribbi ˈriːbi
The Lubavitcher hasidim have a tradition that the Hebrew letters that make up the word rebbe ˈrɛbi are also an acronym for Rosh Bnei Yisroel meaning a spiritual head of the Children of IsraelAn ordinary communal rabbi or rebbe in Yiddish is sometimes distinct from a rav ˈræv also pronounced rov ˈrɒv by Jews of Eastern European or Russian origin who is a more authoritative halakhic decider
A significant function of a rav is to answer questions of halakha the corpus of Jewish law but he is not as authoritative as a posek
The short form reb is an honorific for Orthodox Jewish men who are most likely to have profound knowledge of the Talmud and Torah as opposed to Reconstructionist Reform or Conservative Judaism
Originally this title was added to the names of Jews at the time of the schism with the Karaite sect as a sign of loyalty to the original rabbinic tradition known today as Orthodox Judaism
As a rule among hasidim rebbe ˈrɛbə is referred to in Hebrew as admor pl
admorim an abbreviation for Hebrew adoneinu moreinu v'rabeinu Hebrew אדמור acronym for אדוננו מורנו ורבנו meaning 'our master our teacher and our rabbi' which is now the modern Hebrew word in Israel for rebbe
Hasidim use the term rebbe also in a more elevated manner to denote someone that they perceive not only as the religious leader or nasi of their congregation but as their spiritual adviser and mentor
The Rebbe or my Rebbe in this sense is a rav or rabbi whose views and advice are accepted not only on issues of religious law and practice but in all arenas of life including political and social issues
Sometimes a Hasid has a rebbe as his spiritual guide and an additional rav for rulings on issues of halakha
Hasidim use the concept of a non-Hasidic rebbe in the simple sense of rabbi as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the Hebrew word רַבִּי‎ rabi ˈʁbi
For example I will ask my rebbe ˈrɛbə Rabbi ˈræbaɪ Ploni so-and-so for advice about this personal matter
A Hasidic rebbe ˈrɛbɛ is generally taken to mean a great leader of a Hasidic dynasty also referred to as Grand Rabbi in English or an ADMOR a Hebrew acronym for Adoneinu-Moreinu-veRabbeinu our lordmaster teacher and rabbi
Outside of Hasidic circles the term Grand Rabbi has been used to refer to a rabbi with a higher spiritual status
The practice became widespread in America in the early s when Hasidic rebbes began to emigrate to the United States and was derived from the German Grossrabbiner
Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov the founder of Hasidism is regarded by Hasidim as the first Hasidic rebbe
During his lifetime he was referred to mainly as The holy rather than as Rebbe and his disciples were magidim or preachers such as the Magid of Chernobyl or the Magid of Mezritch
The first rebbe to be known as such was the Baal Shem Tov's grandson Rabbi Boruch of Mezhibozh who was referred to as The Rebbe during his lifetime
After him those who rose to positions of leadership and their successors began to be called rebbe
The title gradually came to suggest a higher spiritual status
Each Hasidic group refers to its leader as the rebbe
Hannah Rachel Verbermacher also known as the Maiden of Ludmir or the Ludmirer Moyd was the only female rebbe in the history of the Hasidic movement she lived in the th century in Ukraine and Israel
According to Maimonides a tzadik is one whose merit surpasses hisher iniquity and every person can reach the level of a Tzadik
According to the Tanya a tzadik has no evil inclination and only a select few predestined to attain this level can attain it
According to Kabbalah and particularly the Hasidic understanding of Kabbalah the world is sustained on the shoulders of Tzadikim Nistarim divinely predestined exceptionally righteous people in a generation
Nobody knows who was such a tzaddik even one of these exceptionally righteous people would not know that they are such a tzadik
These people are understood to have perfected their service of God to such an extent that they become literally and physically aware of God
These righteous people's perception of both spiritual and physical not to mention temporal matters transcends the apparent boundaries of existence
However a Hasidic rebbe is generally said to be a righteous person called a tzaddik
Furthermore a rebbe is said to be able to affect divine providence and a rebbe is said to be able to see the future or at least have strong insight into the life and trials of another
As a result Hasidim in some Hasidic circles seek their rebbe's advice for a variety of concerns spiritual physical and even business concerns
Furthermore many people seek the blessing bracha of a rebbe and a Hasid will specifically seek the blessing of his rebbe for anything from minor and all the more so major physical troubles to grand spiritual concerns
In some movements the Hasidim believe that their rebbe is the tzadik hador tzaddik of the generation and would regard any thought that detracts from his perfection and holiness as heresy
Other sects lessen this idealization to some degree or another
Since many rebbes are sons-in-law or students of other rebbes it makes sense that they would view themselves as subordinate to those other rebbes
Nonetheless their Hasidim remain loyal to them because of their special loyalty a family connection or a belief that a specific tzaddik or Nasi HaDor although others might have greater spiritual stature connects best with one's soul
For example the Kosover Rebbe makes yearly pilgrimages to the Tosher Rebbe
Nonetheless his followers remain very loyal to him
Unlike rabbis or non-Hasidic rebbes in other Jewish movements Hasidic Judaism considers a Hasidic rebbe to be a conduit between Jews and God
based on traditional Kabbalistic concepts and terminology Hasidic philosophy bridged deveikut a Jewish concept referring to closeness to God to the Hasidic rebbe embodying and channeling the Divine flow of blessing to the world because Creation is dependent on the continuous flow of Divine lifeforce without which it would revert to nothingness
Given a rebbe's physical awareness of God and the rebbe's transcendent perception of Godliness many Hasidim take special care to observe their rebbe's specific and sometimes minute practices
Even things that seem mundane may nonetheless be seen by Hasidim as incredibly significant
For example Lubavitcher Hasidim frequently shape their fedoras to match the way that the Lubavitcher Rebbe shaped his hat-which was more flat than many others
Many Skverer Hasidim of the Skverer Rebbe in New Square wear their peyos identical to those of the Skverer Rebbe
While Hasidim does not always follow the specific practices of their rebbe the rebbe can create practices that may be specific and unique to his Hasidim
For example Rabbi Aaron Roth Reb Areleh as he was called the first rebbe of Shomer Emunim told his Hasidim to pause frequently while eating their meals to keep them from overindulging
A Hasid will usually love his rebbe like a close family member if not more so
However the degree and nature of this belief vary depending on the movement
There are some functions that are exclusively the domain of Hasidic rebbes
A rebbe conducts a tish Yiddish פֿירט טיש feet tish literally to run a table or a farbrengen—a communal festive meal with highly mystical overtones—on Shabbat and other occasions
At a tish the rebbe distributes shirayim lit
remnants to the Hasidim seated at or gathered around the table
When a gathering similar to a tish is led by a rabbi who is not a rebbe ie
a Mashpia it can be referred to as a botte esp
amongst groups from Romania or shelves Achim
A rebbe has times when Hasidim and other petitioners may come for a private audience
A kvitel Yiddish for note plural kvitlach is a note with the name of the petitioner and a short request for which the rebbe is asked to pray
The formula in which a person's name is written is one's own Hebrew name the sondaughter of one's mother's Hebrew name such as Shimon ben Rivkah Simeon the son of Rebecca
Hasidim believes that rebbes read supernaturally between the lines of a vital and in every Hasidic movement there are numerous anecdotes relating how the rebbe saw things that were not written in the vital
In most Hasidic groups the vital is written by the rebbe's gabbai secretary however sometimes the petitioner writes it on his own
Usually but with some exceptions a person redemption of cash is customarily handed to the rebbe under the vital but this is not obligatory
This is considered to be the conduit through which the blessing is given and a redemption for the soul of the petitioner
A gift makes its receiver glad is given as an explanation a blessing only comes from a joyous heart It is also customary to tip the gabbai although this too is not obligatory
Other tasks are not exclusive to Hasidic rebbes but are important roles they play in their community similar to other rabbis
These include the leading of prayer on Shabbat and Holy Days performing mitzvot with their Hasidim and participating in or officiating at weddings brit milahs and other events
Hasidic rebbes also play a central role in the intellectual and social life of their communities delivering sermons and dialogues and building educational and religious institutions
Zalman Schachter-Shalomi theorized that the historical Hasidic Rebbes may be viewed as occupying one or several of the following roles or functions about their support of their followers
The Rav — This role refers to Hasidic Rebbes who also served as ordained rabbis serving Jewish communities
Examples of this type cited by Schachter-Shalom include Shmelke of Nikolsburg and Pinchas Horowitz
For some Hasidic Rebbes such as Chaim Halberstam of Sanz the term Rav was used instead of Rebbe
The Good Jew — This role known in Yiddish as the Guter Yid refers to a popular Hasidic Rebbe who is viewed as enjoying God's favor and whose legacies spoke to the conditions of struggling Hasidim
This role was viewed as a continuation of the Talmudic legacy of individuals such as Honi HaMe'agel
Examples of Hasidic Rebbes of this type cited include Aryeh Leib of Shpola and Berishil of Krakow
The Seer — This role known in Hebrew as the Chozeh refers to a Hasidic Rebbe is was ascribed prophetic powers
Examples of this type cited include the Seer of Lublin and his student Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov
The Miracle Worker — This role known in Hebrew as the Ba'al Mofet was often assumed by Hasidim to involve expertise in Practical Kabbalah
The Healer — This role is understood as involving more than mere healing but also involved the expectation that the Hasid would alter his behavior to merit healing
The Gaon — A variant of the healer-type was the Talmudic genius gaon who could offer blessing through the merit of his Talmudic study
This tradition was not limited to Hasidism but also was applied to non-Hasidic rabbis such as Yechezkel Landau of Prague and the Gaon of Vilna
The Son or Grandson of the Tzaddik — This role applied to Hasidic Rebbes who would utilize ancestral merit of a Hasidic predecessor to invoke blessing
In Yiddish the term einykel grandson would sometimes be used
Often this role involved the use of petitions at the gravesite of the Hasidic predecessor
Examples cited of this type include Boruch of Medzhybizh who was the grandson of the Baal Shem Tov the founder of Hasidism
The Block Rebbe — This type is viewed to have developed in New York City from to and involved a grandfatherly role to local Jewish residents
The Kabbalist — This role also known in Hebrew as the Ba'al M'kubal involved expertise in the theoretical teachings of Jewish mysticism
Examples cited include Shneur Zalman of Lyady the founder of Chabad Hasidism Yisroel Hopstein the Maggid of Kozhnitz and Isaac of Komarno
The Spiritual Guide — This role known in Hebrew as the Moreh Derekh Teacher of the Path reflects the Hasidic notion that Rebbe is the expert on matters of the Love and Fear of God
The Hasidic Rebbe Aharon Roth reportedly insisted on the use of this term
While Schachter-Shalom notes that Hasidim valued the living guide over the use of books some Rebbes such as Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch wrote various tracts for different types of spiritual seekers
The Tzaddik of the Generation — This role known in Hebrew as Tzaddik HaDor or Rashey Alafim Head of Thousands invokes the stature of Biblical leaders and is viewed mystically as the conduit of all blessing for the Jewish people of that generationList of Hasidic dynastiesChabadorg The Rebbe
