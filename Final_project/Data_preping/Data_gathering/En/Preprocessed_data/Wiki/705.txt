moss s second book a war of shadows describes the aftermath of ill met by moonlight a subsequent raid on crete and operations in mainland greece and thailand against japanese forces
in may german forces attacked and occupied crete
allied forces were driven back and evacuated to north africa by june
the special operations executive soe inserted agents on crete in order to work with the local resistance in harrying german occupying forces
on february major patrick leigh fermor and captain william stanley moss and two cretan soe agents left egypt by plane for crete
their intention was to parachute into crete but after arriving at the drop zone only leigh fermor was able to parachute successfully
the others had to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and were returned to egypt
on landing leigh fermor was met by a group from the cretan resistance with whom he remained until the arrival of the rest of the soe team
after three more attempts at a parachute jump over a two month period moss and the other two arrived by motor launch ml on april
they were met on the beach by leigh fermor and another soe agent sandy rendel
their target general m ller was replaced by general kreipe just before they arrived
the team decided to proceed with the plan to abduct the german commanding officer
the soe team included a number of cretans anthony antonis papaleonidas micky michalis akoumianakis and grigorios chnarakis
micky was especially welcome as his house was opposite kreipe s residence the villa ariadne in the village of knossos
the team reconnoitred the area and planned the abduction
dressed as a cretan shepherd leigh fermor travelled on the local bus to check knossos and the area around the german headquarters
he decided that the german headquarters would be too difficult to penetrate
after a few days of alternately observing the actions of the general they finalized the details of the abduction
the plan was for the two british officers dressed as corporals in the feldgendarmerie german military police to stop the general s car on his way home at what was supposed to be a routine check point
on the night of april the two british officers stopped the general s car before the villa ariadne
when the car stopped leigh fermor took care of kreipe and moss knocked the driver out with his cosh
moss drove the team and the general in the general s car for an hour and a half through controlled road blocks in heraklion before leaving leigh fermor to abandon the car
when leigh fermor left the car he also left documents revealing that the kidnapping had been done by british commandos so that no reprisals should be taken against the local population
with his cretan escorts moss set off with the general across country to a rendezvous where they would be joined by leigh fermor
hunted by german patrols the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island where a british motor launch ml commanded by brian coleman was to pick them up
on may the soe team and the general were finally picked up from a beach near rodakino possibly peristeres beach on the southern side of the island
they were transported to safety landing at mersa matruh in egypt
after the war a member of kreipe s staff reported how on hearing the news of the kidnapping an uneasy silence in the officers mess in heraklion was followed by well gentlemen i think this calls for champagne all round post war correspondence explains that kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because amongst other things he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning approved travel orders
this tension between the general and his troops in part explains the caution of sentries in considering stopping the general s car as moss drove it through heraklion
the book was due to be published in germany in
kreipe alleged that he had never given his parole not to shout or to try to escape to moss and leigh fermor as described by moss in the book
kreipe secured an injunction preventing publication of the book in germany on the grounds that the statement in the book was untrue
leigh fermor s report after the operation and the publication of his account of the abduction published in both corroborated moss s version of events
