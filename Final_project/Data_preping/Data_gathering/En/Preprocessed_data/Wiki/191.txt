The University of Massachusetts Boston UMass Boston is a public research university in Boston Massachusetts It is the only public research university in Boston and the third largest campus in the five campus University of Massachusetts system UMass Boston is the third most diverse university in the United States While a majority of UMass Boston students are Massachusetts residents international students and students from other states make up a significant portion of the student body Founded with a distinct urban mission UMass Boston has a long history of serving the city of Boston including numerous partnerships with local community organizations
It is an official member institution of the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities and the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities It is classified among R Doctoral Universities High research activity
The University of Massachusetts System dates back to the founding of Massachusetts Agricultural College under the Morrill Land Grant Acts in However prior to the founding of UMass Boston the Amherst campus was the only public comprehensive university in the state Even as late as the s Massachusetts ranked at or near the bottom in public funding per capita for higher education and proposals to expand the University of Massachusetts into Boston was opposed both by faculty and administrators at the Amherst campus and by the private colleges and universities in Boston In the nd Massachusetts General Court expanded the UMass System for the first time to Worcester Massachusetts with the creation of the University of Massachusetts Medical School In UMass President John W Lederle informed the General Court that more than graduates of Boston area high schools qualified to attend the University of Massachusetts were denied admission to the Amherst campus due to lack of space and despite opposition from the Amherst campus endorsed expanding the UMass System with a commuter campus in Boston At the time there were freshman applications to the University of Massachusetts in Amherst with only slots yet the majority of the applicants lived in the Greater Boston area
In Massachusetts Senate Majority Leader Maurice A Donahue and State Senator George Kenneally introduced a bill to establish a Boston campus for the UMass System with Majority Whip of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Robert H Quinn co sponsoring the House bill and the Massachusetts AFL CIO endorsing the legislation The bill was opposed by several private colleges and universities in the Boston area including Northeastern University Boston University and Boston College who argued that the state would be better off subsidizing the existing private institutions in the city as well as from Boston State College the only public institution of higher education in the city who argued for expanding its campus on Huntington Avenue instead However the Huntington Avenue building of Boston State College could not be expanded to accommodate a student campus and the local news media and public opinion generally favored creating the new Boston campus for the UMass System
On June with a appropriation the legislation establishing the University of Massachusetts Boston was passed by the rd Massachusetts General Court and was signed into law two days later by Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody UMass President John W Lederle began recruiting freshmen students faculty and administrative staff for the fall semester of with goals of students and faculty members and appointed his assistant at the Amherst campus John W Ryan as UMass Boston's first chancellor Ryan recruited tenured faculty members from the Amherst campus to relocate and form the UMass Boston faculty and appointed Amherst's history professor Paul A Gagnon and Amherst's provost and biology professor Arthur Gentile to hire the humanities and natural science faculty members respectively One faculty member that made the move was historian Robert M Berdahl who later became chancellor of the University of California Berkeley President of the University of Texas at Austin and president of the Association of American Universities
Gagnon with the assistance of Harvard University sociologist David Riesman also recruited junior faculty members through recommendations of graduate students by the department chairs of Ivy League and other prestigious private universities in the Boston area Serving as the new university's first provost Gagnon became the most important faculty member in defining the curriculum and academic focus of the university saying in June that The first aim of the University of Massachusetts at Boston must be to build a university in the ancient tradition of Western civilization Along with creating a university in the great Western tradition we must make it public and urban in all that these words imply in
Gagnon would be the principal architect of the university's attempt to create a Great Books program called the Coordinated Freshman Year English History Program which prompted criticism and opposition from younger faculty members in the English and History Departments who wanted their students to have reading assignments that contained more politically 'relevant' content from faculty in the social and natural sciences who felt their fields were being neglected and students many of whom were Vietnam War veterans or working class single parents working one or two jobs to pay for school and that eventually led to its requirements being diluted and the program ultimately dismantled by the end of the s
Freshman classes started for undergraduate students in September at a renovated building located at Arlington Street in the Park Square area of Downtown Boston formerly the headquarters of the Boston Gas Company which had leased the building to the university Virtually the entire entering class were residents of Massachusetts with the great majority living in the Greater Boston area and one fourth living in the city of Boston itself By the fall of the number of applications to UMass Boston for the fall semester had risen from for fall to and total enrollment had risen to In the late s UMass Boston students on average were years old typically white and male working part or full time and either married or living with others in an apartment UMass Boston also reportedly had the largest population of Vietnam War veterans than any university in the United States many of whom had been recently discharged and the largest population of African American students of all universities in Massachusetts
In February the th Massachusetts General Court appropriated funds for the university to purchase the building at Arlington Street Over the next three years the university also leased the Sawyer Building on Stuart Street the Salada Buildings on Columbus Avenue a part of the Boston Statler Hotel for faculty and departmental office space and the Armory of the First Corps of Cadets which was converted into the university's library while the university administration also had an arrangement with the Copley Square YMCA to provide students access to exercise equipment Also in during the university's first Spring Weekend the American folk music duo Simon Garfunkel was the headline act The student newspaper The Mass Media published its inaugural issue on November and the Founding Day Convocation for the university was held December at the Prudential Center in Boston In a group of students started the folk music radio station WUMB FM
In the summer of inaugural Chancellor John W Ryan resigned to return to his alma mater Indiana University in an administrative position and was succeeded in October of that year by historian Francis L Broderick who was serving as a dean at Lawrence University at the time Broderick oversaw the reorganization of the university into separate colleges College I and College II along with the establishment of the College of Public and Community Service and presided over the university's first graduation ceremony on June where of the original students received diplomas However in addition to the university's budgetary problems Broderick's tenure was consumed by the controversies of the times
By early some younger professors were holding teach ins and encouraging their male students to burn their draft cards in protest of American corporate imperialism The Young Socialist Alliance and the Students for a Democratic Society both had chapters on campus and in April the latter group rallied more than a hundred students protesting the decision to move the university campus to Columbia Point The following month a student group called the Afro American Society staged an occupation of summer school registration demanding the immediate hiring of more black faculty members and the admission of more black students to the university
From March to March in a group of thirty students occupied the chancellor's office after a popular radical female professor in the Sociology Department was denied tenure and denounced the university as corrupt racist sexist and servile to an exploitative class of capitalist oppressors Following President Richard Nixon's announcement of the Vietnam War's Cambodian campaign on April and the subsequent shooting of anti war protestors at Kent State University on May like hundreds of other universities across the United States UMass Boston administration suspended regular business operations while the campus became consumed by protests mostly organized by the campus chapter of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War
However no controversy was more contentious than the conflict over where UMass Boston would locate its campus permanently The conflict emerged in not long after the university was initially founded UMass President John W Lederle had insisted upon a campus inside the city limits of Boston while Boston Mayor John F Collins publicly asked Chancellor John W Ryan not to consider a permanent site in Downtown Boston as a disproportionate amount of the valuable real estate there was already owned by many colleges and other non profit institutions exempt from the city government's property taxes In only one new private office building had appeared on the city skyline since one in five of the city's housing units were classified as dilapidated or deteriorating and the city was ranked lowest among major cities in building starts while the only growing industries in the city were government and universities leading to a narrowing tax base and the city already had a higher number of municipal employees per capita than any major city in the United States
In addition to Mayor Collins the Boston business community the Massachusetts General Court WBZ radio the editorial board of The Boston Globe and residents of the South End were also opposed to a permanent downtown campus Nonetheless when the university purchased the building at Arlington Street in many faculty and students interpreted the transaction as a signal that the university intended to settle permanently in Park Square A proposal popular among students and faculty to build a high rise academic building overlooking the Massachusetts Turnpike in Copley Square was cancelled when the John Hancock Insurance Company purchased the land and built John Hancock Tower there instead Another proposal for a campus in the Highland Park area of Roxbury also met with opposition from residents Other proposals to locate the permanent campus near Fenway Park or South Station and Chinatown or on golf courses for sale in Newton were considered but rejected by Chancellor Ryan due to insufficient space or commuting concerns
In the Boston Redevelopment Authority BRA published a study titled An Urban Campus by the Sea which proposed building the campus on the Columbia Point peninsula The site was a former landfill adjacent to the largest and poorest public housing complex in New England and a mile from the MBTA's Columbia station The proposal was deeply unpopular among the faculty and students of them subsequently organized a rally in November on Boston Common demanding a downtown location in Copley Square In April when the Students for a Democratic Society organized its opposition rally the student leaders denounced the university as a 'pawn' masking the Boston Redevelopment Authority's plan to remove poor people from Columbia Point and that the university is planning a prestigious dormitory school with high tuition which students from low and moderate income families whom the university was designed to serve will not be able to attend
In November the Environmental Pollution Panel of the Science Advisory Committee to President Lyndon B Johnson released its final report that included the findings of a sub panel studying atmospheric carbon dioxide composed of oceanographers Roger Revelle and Charles D Keeling geochemists Wallace S Broecker and Harmon Craig and meteorologist Joseph Smagorinsky demonstrating that the amount of carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuel combustion as a percentage of atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by percent from through with an average rate of increase of percent per year that from through the average rate of increase was percent per year and that carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuel combustion was the only source of carbon dioxide being added to the atmosphere The report concluded that if fossil fuel combustion continued to rise at the rates during the previous century or the previous decade the amount of emitted carbon dioxide as a percentage of atmospheric carbon dioxide by would be a to percent increase from levels and that two possible consequences of the increase could be the melting of the Antarctic ice cap and rising sea levels
Chancellor Ryan also opposed the Columbia Point proposal who before he resigned in February made a counterproposal for a acre campus south of where John Hancock Tower was being built that the BRA rejected Architectural consultants of the university also scouted land near North Station and adjacent to the Boston Garden that was immediately opposed both by the ownership of the Boston Garden Arena Corporation that owned the Boston Bruins who threatened to move the team out of the city and Boston Mayor Kevin White In August after Francis L Broderick was appointed the university's chancellor now Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Robert H Quinn Massachusetts Senate Majority Leader Kevin B Harrington and State Senator George Kenneally all urged the UMass Board of Trustees to accept the Columbia Point proposal while Chancellor Broderick asked the board to delay its decision at an October meeting by one month so that he might be able to deliver a final counterproposal while another rally at the Massachusetts State House of faculty and students still demanded a Copley Square or Park Square location
In November Chancellor Broderick proposed a scattered site campus of office buildings situated along the MBTA's Green Line in the South End that would be jointly owned by the university and businesses while retaining the original Arlington Street building However while the UMass Board of Trustees and UMass President John W Lederle argued instead for a unified campus on Columbia Point they allowed a task force an additional month to more fully study Broderick's proposal In the end after reviewing the task force's white paper at a meeting in December the UMass Board of Trustees voted to to accept the Columbia Point proposal
The initial reactions of the residents of Savin Hill and Columbia Point were mixed A coalition of community organizations in Columbia Point and Dorchester formed the Dorchester Tenants Action Council DTAC to prevent an influx of students into the public housing project on Mount Vernon Street When the Columbia Point public housing project opened in its initial demographics reflected that of the city's population white tenants made up more than percent of the population while black families made up approximately percent However all reports at the time indicated that racial and ethnic tensions were minimal that there were high levels of social trust within the neighborhood and by had a long waiting list of families wanting to become new tenants However as race relations in the city of Boston deteriorated during the s many neighborhoods became more racially segregated due to redlining and the Boston Housing Authority BHA segregated the public housing developments within the city as well moving black families into the Columbia Point housing project and whites to other projects in South Boston as many white families that had been on the waiting list for the complex by the early s started refusing assignments to the Columbia Point project
In Chancellor Francis L Broderick resigned and was succeeded by Italian literature professor Carlo L Golino who had been serving as vice president of academic affairs at the University of California Riverside in During Golino's tenure before the move to Columbia Point the university began awarding its first master's degrees in English and mathematics By the time the Columbia Point campus opened in only percent of the units in the Columbia Point housing project were occupied and the BHA now thought of the complex as housing of last resort However as construction for the Columbia Point campus began DTAC demanded the creation of a joint task force to address their housing concerns while some within DTAC called for the university to construct dormitories as part of the Columbia Point proposal legislation for doing so was proposed within the Massachusetts House of Representatives but failed to pass In addition to DTAC the Columbia Point Community Development Council also asked that a number of construction jobs be reserved for residents of the projects including set asides for non union minority workers that would later become a source of friction between the community groups and the university against the construction management firm McKee Berger Mansueto MBM overseeing the project its subcontractors and the construction unions
On January the university opened its new campus on the Columbia Point peninsula surrounded by Dorchester Bay Beginning in the construction of the Columbia Point campus was the largest public capital construction project in the history of Massachusetts exceeded only later by the Big Dig The state government hired a single construction management firm McKee Berger Mansueto MBM to supervise six other architectural firms and construction companies to complete the project by September The construction had multiple delays the Boston Edison Company had not finished its electrical work and because the site was a former landfill that had only been closed since a concrete and brick substructure where all of the campus mechanical systems would run conduits undergirded by hundreds of driven piles needed to be constructed before the buildings but pile driving released methane from the former landfill requiring construction workers to halt production while each release of methane dispersed
The Columbia Point campus was originally composed of five buildings connected by a series of enclosed walkway footbridges commonly called catwalks on the second floors of the buildings McCormack Hall Wheatley Hall the Science Center the Healey Library which was designed by Chicago modernist architect Harry Weese and the Quinn Administration Building To transport students from Columbia station the MBTA concluded that constructing a skyway from the station to the campus would be too expensive and the university administration set about planning a shuttle bus system funded by parking fees Campus facilities would rise from the bottom of the substructure and the bottom of the substructure would provide entry to a parking garage with spaces Because the campus was surrounded on three sides by a bay exposed to sea breeze and winter storms the salt water in the atmosphere and the road salt carried from automobiles would eventually damage parts of the substructure beyond feasible repair
Because the university was underneath flight paths arriving at Logan International Airport all of the original Columbia Point campus buildings were soundproofed and because of this the classroom and offices in the buildings were designed as interior spaces with no windows and the entrance to every building faced inward onto the campus plaza Due to the campus being uniformly built of brick and the campus positioned above the landscape the campus became known as The Fortress The Rock or The Prison colloquially The buildings were rumored to have been designed by architects familiar with the architectural design of prisons such as Weese who designed the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center but also designed so that the plaza could easily be occupied by the National Guard to suppress demonstrations and protests
In the million capital construction budget for erecting more buildings on the campus was frozen due to the recession halting any further expansion of the campus In enabled by the move to Columbia Point Chancellor Carlo L Golino oversaw the opening of the College of Professional Studies later renamed the College of Management and in supervised the merger of College I and College II into a single College of Arts and Sciences Golino would resign as chancellor in was succeeded in the interim by Claire Van Ummersen the university's associate vice chancellor of academic affairs and succeeded permanently in by Robert A Corrigan former arts and humanities provost at the University of Maryland Construction for the Clark Athletic Center that included an ice hockey arena swimming pool and basketball courts broke ground in and was completed in On October with the Boston busing desegregation underway musician Stevie Wonder spoke and led students in song at a lounge in the university the day after he performed at the Boston Garden
Also in the John F Kennedy Presidential Library Corporation announced its decision to locate the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on a acre site offered by the university adjacent to its campus In October President Kennedy had personally selected a site in Harvard Square near his alma mater but after his assassination Cambridge residents actively opposed the Kennedy family's efforts to build a presidential library there due to traffic concerns Designed by architect I M Pei construction for the building broke ground on June and was completed and dedicated in October Two years later the state government announced that it would construct a new building for the Massachusetts State Archives and Commonwealth Museum next to the campus and the JFK Library and on December the MBTA renamed Columbia station as JFK UMass station
In McKee Berger Mansueto Inc MBM the company contracted to supervise the construction of the campus came under public scrutiny after its contract with the Commonwealth was criticized in a series of newspaper articles for being abnormally favorable towards MBM and a special legislative committee led by Amherst College President John William Ward was formed to investigate the contract A scandal erupted after it was learned MBM paid Massachusetts Senate Majority Leader Joseph DiCarlo and State Senator Ronald MacKenzie in exchange for a favorable report from the committee DiCarlo and MacKenzie were convicted of extortion Newspaper columnist Charles Pierce summarized the careless and negligent quality of MBM's construction projects unearthed by the Ward Commission's investigation as follows
Besides the Worcester jail with the cells that did not lock there was the auditorium at Boston State College in which the stage was not visible from a third of the seats and the library at Salem State College in which the walls were not sturdy enough to bear the weight of the books At the UMass Boston campus ground zero of the scandal school officials were forced to erect barricades to keep passerby from being brained by the bricks that kept falling off the side of the library Unsurprisingly a completely corrupt system had produced completely shoddy buildings that the taxpayers already fleeced once would have to pay to repair
In the st Massachusetts General Court voted to establish the Massachusetts Board of Regents of Higher Education with the authority to consolidate resources for public higher education in the state and in the Board decided to merge UMass Boston and Boston State College by Such a merger including the Massachusetts College of Art and Design as well had been proposed in the state legislature in when UMass Boston was initially founded Though the merger had allowed both schools a three year grace period to ease the transition a large cut in the state's higher education budget forced the Board of Regents to require a shotgun wedding merger to happen by September although the Board did allow for it to be delayed until January of the following year Boston State College had been in existence since and in the years of its existence mostly had a reputation as a teacher's college situated in between the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area with two of its other largest enrollments being in nursing and police administration These programs would transfer over to UMass Boston fully intact and would form the basis of the College of Education the College of Nursing and Health Sciences and the Criminal Justice program in the Sociology Department respectively
In Boston State College enrolled roughly students and despite the Boston State College students having a similar demographic profile to UMass Boston students many students expressed opposition to and disapproval of the merger Many of Boston State College's undergraduate academic departments and programs that had equivalents at UMass Boston were disbanded and as fewer of the Boston State faculty had PhDs than the UMass Boston faculty did the Board of Regents also decided to terminate the employment of full time faculty members part time teachers and of the administrators at Boston State College In the end however the merger boosted enrollment at UMass Boston by percent in one year from more than in areas of study in to more than in areas of study by and as Boston State College had more graduate programs than UMass Boston did at the time of the merger most of Boston State College's graduate programs made the transition and tripled the graduate student enrollment at UMass Boston By graduate students accounted for percent of the university's total enrollment and in the College of Nursing and Health Sciences was the ninth largest and was ranked as the th best undergraduate nursing program in the United States and third best in New England by U S News World Report
In construction began for the new Harbor Point Apartments complex to replace the original Columbia Point public housing project and was completed in By the s only families were living in the housing development in part because the Boston Housing Authority had allowed the buildings to deteriorate and be occupied by squatters and the public housing project had drawn comparisons to the Pruitt Igoe Apartments in St Louis and the Cabrini Green Homes in Chicago As a consequence the Boston city government leased the development on a year contract to a private developer composed of a tenant run community task force and the Corcoran Mullins Jennison Corporation that was supported by the university The housing development is now billed as luxury apartments

In Chancellor Gora was permanently succeeded by Michael F Collins the president and CEO of Caritas Christi Health Care On July Chancellor Collins ordered the immediate and permanent closure of the parking garage underneath the main campus causing a loss of parking spaces Two days later an article in The Boston Globe summarized the deterioration of the facility
The University of Massachusetts at Boston has closed an underground parking garage that has been decaying for decades Over the years the garage has become a dreary labyrinth with walls and floor so eroded from the salty environment that they look like a coral reef Nets hang from the ceiling to catch fragments of falling cement a problem linked to the use of low quality concrete in the construction
Chunks of concrete had been falling from the garage ceiling since the s and when Chancellor Collins ordered the closure spaces had already been lost due to ongoing repairs and rerouting of passenger and vehicular traffic Because of the salt water atmosphere and the road salt from vehicles the steel reinforcing bars embedded in the campus substructure concrete walls and ceiling became severely degraded and because all of the campus mechanical systems had run conduits through the substructure many of those systems could not be repaired and the damage was causing outages of the computer electrical heat and air conditioning equipment An engineering report indicated that to repair the garage such that it would be safe for parking would cost million On October the university began the process of creating a master plan to renew the campus

In May the Pioneer Institute released a white paper reviewing records obtained from the UMass System Controller's Office as well as other publicly available documents that concluded that Chancellor J Keith Motley and other UMass Boston administrators were scapegoated for the fiscal year million budget deficit and that instead the approval by the UMass System Board of Trustees of an accelerated year capital spending plan in December without assuring that capital reserves would be made available to pay for the plan as well as an error to a year campus reserve ratio estimate prepared by the UMass Central Budget Office and presented to the System Board of Trustees in April was the cause of the million in budget reductions implemented by interim Chancellor Barry Mills and that the reductions were made at the direction of the UMass Central Office Additionally the white paper states that KPMG's audit was not conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards nor reported in accordance with auditing standards prescribed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and that the acquisition of Mount Ida College by UMass Amherst in April was conducted by a wire transfer from the UMass System for million without being included on the previously approved university capital plan at the time the UMass Central Office ordered the budget reductions rather than UMass Amherst purchasing the Mount Ida campus with loanable funds to be repaid with interest and in contrast to how the transaction was described in a press statement issued by Meehan's office The following month interim Chancellor Katherine Newman issued a press statement disputing the findings of the white paper
