Introduced in March as a soft reboot of the version previously hosted on the Schmoes Know YouTube channel a separate YouTube channel owned and operated by Kristian Harloff and Mark Ellis now named Schmoedown Entertainment Network the Movie Trivia Schmoedown is a game show hosted by Harloff and Ellis where famous Collider or other YouTube cinema-related personalities engage in a film trivia competition
The show has a heavy professional wrestling influence in terms of storylines and gimmicks although the competition itself is legitimate
There are currently four divisions the singles teams Innergeekdom a division with emphasis on DC DC Extended Universe Wizarding World Marvel Marvel Cinematic Universe Star Trek Star Wars and Middle-earth questions although additionally Back to the Future Indiana Jones and non-DC or Marvel comic book movie questions are frequently asked as well and Star Wars-only
Despite the overhaul of the show's format in the move from Schmoes Know to Collider all of the matches from the previous incarnation are still counted for players' records
Starting in the Movie Trivia Schmoedown was moved back to the Schmoes Know YouTube channel
The Schmoes Know channel changed its name to the Schmoedown Entertainment Network and started a partnership with Skybound
The Schmoedown has turned itself into a movie trivia sport currently with eight factions The Usual Suspects managed by Samm Levine KOrruption managed by Shannon Barney The Stars managed by Roxy Striar The Den managed by Kate Mulligan SWAG managed by Winston Marshall The Quirky Mercs managed by Coy Jandreau The Finstock Exchange managed by Tom Dagnino and The Dungeon managed by John Kaiser
Each faction has players each competing in one or more of the four divisions for a chance to get the championship belts at the Schmoedown Spectacular in December
Currently the sport is being played virtually which has changed some of the game's format such as the buzzer round
As of the traditional format sees the opponents engage in a three-round match
in the first round they have to write down on a white board the answers to eight questions of different categories getting a point for every correct answer with the possibility of a bonus ninth question should they get all eight correct
in the second round they spin a wheel which will randomly land on a single category they may spin a second time should they feel that the category is not a strong one for them unless it lands on Opponents Choice
They will then answer up to four or six if teams questions in that category receiving two points for a correct answer and the added option of multiple choice which cuts down a correct answer to only one point as well as the looming risk of a competitor stealing points
the third round sees the choosing of three numbers from at random all of them containing a category that they have to answer a question from with each being worth two three and five points respectively
In the championship match format instead of third this is the fifth round of the contestChampionship matches feature two extra rounds
the waging round or the third round in championship match format where the competitors can wage from zero up to three of their earned points at that time and answer a question from another wheel-spun category getting an additional number of points the number being the same number they waged if they get it correct and losing those same points if they fail
the speed round or the fourth round in championship match format in which the competitors must hit the buzzer before their opponent and answer the given question correctly within two seconds also with the added risk of losing a point if they answer incorrectlyThe contestants that has the most accumulated points at the end of the final round wins
If the scores are level at this point there is a Sudden Death round in which all competitors are asked the same questions and must answer on their white boards with a point being awarded for each correct answer
If there is more than a ten-point lead before the final round the leader will win by knockout
If the competitor does make it to the final round but cannot correctly answer enough of the three questions to catch up to their opponent they lose by TKO
There is a challenge rule where the competitors can challenge a decision made by the judges
If the judges accept the challenge the same persons gets to keep the challenge and possibly use it again but if they do not then the contestants cannot challenge any other call in that respective game
There is also the JTE rule the name given to the rule that stipulates that the competitors may ask for a given question to be repeated up to three times per match
Triple Threat Fatal -Way and Fatal -Way structured the same way as regular matches but adapted for the number of participants involved ie in a Triple Threat each of the three competitors spins the wheel in the second round and steal opportunities are available for both opponents through white board writing instead of just spoken also the number of questions asked to a given competitor in Round drops from four to three
The first of this format was the Innergeekdom Fatal -Way title match at the Schmoedown Spectacular
Elimination match multiple participants are tested in a game of survival as they have to avoid being the contestant with the fewest accumulated points after a round of questions is asked or they are eliminated and there are eliminations every round
This is usually applicable to the older format of InnerGeekdom division Fatal -Way matches as well as the Free All
Free All an event based on WWE's Royal Rumble match where five of a high number of players the highest number of participants so far having been start at the table and as some get eliminated through the elimination process others - in random order - enter in their spots
The winner of the Free All gets a title shot of any kind anytime they desire
The inaugural edition took place in and it takes place annually in April
Retirement match The loser of this match has to retire from the Schmoedown either for a period of time or permanently
The first example was Josh Macuga vs
Finstock managed to escape retirement through a loop-hole
Loser Breaks Up match This is similar to the Retirement match but exclusive for the teams division where the losing team has to permanently break up
Iron Man match a -minute non-stop marathon of trivia questions being asked with the winner being the one with the most answered questions by the end of the time limit
The st one of its kind was Ken Napzok vs
Sam Witwer at the Schmoedown Spectacular IIThe Schmoedown has four annual big events
Free All the aforementioned Royal Rumble-esque event in April
Collider Collision a SummerSlam-inspired supercard that takes place in July
