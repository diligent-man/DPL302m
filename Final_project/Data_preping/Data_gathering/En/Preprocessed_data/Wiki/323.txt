Louis Gabriel Ambroise Vicomte de Bonald October November was a French counter revolutionary philosopher and politician He is mainly remembered for developing a theoretical framework from which French sociology would emerge
Bonald came from an ancient noble family of Provence Louis was born in the chateau of Le Monna a modest estate that served as the family seat the only son in his family Louis was heir to the family estate Le Monna is situated just east of the market town of Millau overlooking the Dourbie river His father Antoine Sébastien de Bonald died when Louis was four years old and the young boy would be brought up by his pious mother Anne née de Boyer du Bosc de Périe Like many in the provincial nobility of the time Anne was influenced by the Jansenists and brought up her son with a stern Catholic piety De Bonald was tutored at Le Monna until the age of eleven when he was sent to boarding school in Paris He would then move to the Oratorian College of Juilly at age fifteen at the behest of his mother The Oratorians were known for their rigor and grounded de Bonald in the classics as well as in mathematics philosophy and especially history The headmaster of the school Father Mandar was a friend of Swiss philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau and de Bonald was most likely acquainted with the writings of the philosophes early on
He left Juilly in and entered the musketeers the following year His unit was attached to King Louis XV at Versailles before being disbanded in After leaving the military de Bonald returned to his estates in his native region of Rouergue He assumed the life of a country gentleman and took an interest in growing his properties and making them as productive as possible He married a country nobleman’s daughter Elisabeth Marguerite de Guibal de Combescure and the two had seven children four of whom lived past childhood One of their sons Louis Jacques Maurice de Bonald would go on to become the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon His other son Victor would have a writing career of his own and would write a biography of his father
He was elected to the town council of Millau in and was appointed mayor by the province's royal governor in He was popular as mayor and after the introduction of election for local officials in rather than appointment he easily won reelection in February He was elected as a deputy to the departmental assembly later that year De Bonald was at first supportive of the French Revolution and its initial decentralizing tendencies and hoped the nobility would recover powers lost during the centralization of the th century He even lead the citizens of Millau in drafting a letter of congratulations to the National Assembly King Louis XVI and to finance minister Jacques Necker expressing the wish that this sacred title of citizen and the spirit of concord and fraternity would lead to a new sense of solidarity He managed to quell the Great Fear in his region and would earn the thanks of the National Assembly and he would be elected president of the departmental assembly soon after However he soured on the Revolution with the enactment of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in July Feeling unable to carry out the decrees of the Constitution in good conscience he resigned from his post in January
Fearing that his position as a former public official would make him the target of reprisals he emigrated with his two eldest sons leaving behind his wife mother and his remaining children in October and joined the army of the Prince of Condé He was within earshot of the Battle of Jemappes in November He soon settled in Heidelberg and later moved to Switzerland There he wrote his first important work the highly conservative Theorie du Pouvoir Politique et Religieux dans la Societe Civile Demontree par le Raisonnement et l'Histoire vols new ed Paris vols which the Directory condemned His exile would separate him from his family for more than a decade with only a brief reunion in
He returned to France in and largely spent the next five years in Paris in a sort of internal exile Napoleon was an admirer of de Bonald's writings and had him removed from the list of proscribed émigrés in This amnesty granted de Bonald a greater degree of freedom to travel and publish his writings He moved within literary and political circles and would make the acquittance of writers such as La Harpe Lacretelle and most importantly François René de Chateaubriand During this time he wrote a critical review of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith arguing that the true common good of a nation lies in a shared life of virtue and not simply in material prosperity He would strike up a long correspondence and friendship with the conservative Savoyard philosopher Joseph de Maistre however the two would never meet In he along with Chateaubriand and Joseph Fiévée edited the Mercure de France Two years later he was appointed counsellor of the Imperial University which he had often attacked previously
The Bourbon Restoration saw de Bonald's political fortunes increase He was made a member of the Royal Council for Public Instruction and in he was appointed to the French Academy by Louis XVIII From to de Bonald served as an elected deputy for Aveyron in the Chamber of Deputies A member of the Ultra royalist faction also known as Ultras his speeches were extremely conservative and he vigorously sought to undo the legislation passed in the wake of the Revolution He opposed the Charter of seeing it as giving too many concessions to the revolutionaries and enfeebling the government He sought strong protections for the traditional family and in successfully argued for the repeal of laws passed during the Revolution permitting divorce which afterwards remained illegal in France until
The Revolution had abolished the remainder of the medieval trade guilds affording little protection to workers The Le Chapelier Law of forbade workers the right to form workers' associations and prohibited strike actions De Bonald worked to reverse the Le Chapelier Law and reintroduce guilds but his efforts were unsuccessful and the right to form workers' associations would not be reintroduced in France until
He also continued his writing career during this time and his intellectual pursuits led to him visit many of Paris' Salons Both de Bonald and Chateaubriand frequented the salon of Juliette Récamier who drew from the leading literary and political circles of her day He along with Chateaubriand contributed to various newspapers and journals including The Correspondant a journal of French and British thinkers as well as Conservateur a newspaper dedicated to defending the position of the Ultras saw the publication of his Thoughts on Various Subjects and his Observations on Madame de Staël's Considerations on the Principle Events of the French Revolution in the following year
In de Bonald was made Minister of State and in the following year he was raised to the peerage by Louis XVIII a dignity which he had lost by refusing to take the required oath in This entitled de Bonald to sit in the Chamber of Peers the upper house of the French Parliament during the Bourbon Restoration In he argued strongly in favor of the Anti Sacrilege Act including its prescription of the death penalty under certain conditions In de Bonald briefly stepped away from politics due to the death of his wife
In the Prime Minister and leader of the Ultras Joseph de Villèle introduced a bill reestablishing the law of primogeniture at least for owners of large estates unless they chose otherwise The Revolution had radically changed inheritance law by mandating partitive inheritance where property is dispersed equally among heirs in order to break up aristocratic holdings The proposed law was met with fierce opposition from the liberal Doctrinaires the press and even from Dissident Ultras such as Chateaubriand De Bonald's On the Agricultural Family the Industrial Family and the Right of Primogeniture was written in defense of primogeniture agrarianism and the proposed law The government tried to manage popular outrage by attempting to pass a bill in December of that year curtailing the press having largely withdrawn censorship in This only inflamed tensions and the proposed changes to inheritance were dropped by the government
In Charles X created a commission on censorship and tasked de Bonald with presiding over it This position would lead to the end of his long friendship with Chateaubriand who opposed literary censorship De Bonald's own attitudes towards censorship were somewhat mixed he was in favor of taking a hard line on books since objectionable material in this form would be harder to take out of circulation however he felt newspapers and periodicals should enjoy a greater degree of freedom He felt that offending journalists and publishers should be first given a warning and then face legal prosecution if they continued to publish material detrimental to the public order Bonald felt that the censorship practices of the th century would be anachronistic in the th century and that the best way to combat error would be through the marketplace of ideas Bonald himself had voted against a proposed censorship law in as giving too much power to the government
He retired from the Chamber of Peers in Following the July Revolution and the institution of the liberal July Monarchy in he retired from public life for good and spent the remainder of his days on his estate at Le Monna
De Bonald's political philosophy rests on the assumptions of humanity's fallenness the need for strong government to repress man's evil tendencies and the belief that humans are inherently social creatures He opposed the individualistic and atomistic tendencies of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution At the heart of his political thought was the idea that the family was the basis of society and that institutions should work to protect it in its traditional form For this reason he opposed the secularization of marriage divorce and partitive inheritance He was also critical of the Industrial Revolution because of its negative effects on traditional patterns of family life
Bonald was also an early critic of laissez faire economics In he wrote a treatise critical of usury or the practice of lending at interest and in he wrote a critical review of the French edition of The Wealth of Nations He was likewise critical of Louis XVI's finance minister Anne Robert Jacques Turgot a physiocrat who liberalised France's grain trade and supported the suppression of the trade guilds Bonald criticised Turgot as a fanatical partisan of a materialistic politics Elsewhere he says wheat was not given to man to be an object of commerce but to nourish him Shaped by Tacitus and his condemnations of Roman decadence Bonald felt that economic liberalism and unrestrained wealth would undermine the Christian character of the French people and would lead men to become less generous and more self centered
Bonald was one of the leading writers of the theocratic or traditionalist school which included de Maistre Lamennais Ballanche and baron Ferdinand d'Eckstein The traditionalist school in reaction to the rationalists believed that human reason was incapable of even arriving at natural religion and that tradition the result of a primitive revelation was necessary to know both natural religion as well as the truths of supernatural revelation De Bonald believed that the principles of good governance could be deduced from history and sacred scripture His political thought is closely tied to his theory of the divine origin of language Since man learns to speak through imitation he believed that the first man must have learned to speak from God who announced all moral principles to this first man In his own words L'homme pense sa parole avant de parler sa pensée man thinks his speech before saying his thought the first language contained the essence of all truth These moral truths were then codified in Holy Scripture From this he deduces the existence of God the divine origin and consequent supreme authority of the Holy Scriptures and the infallibility of the Catholic Church
While this thought lies at the root of all his speculations there is a formula of constant application All relations may be stated as the triad of cause means and effect which he sees repeated throughout nature and society Thus in the universe he finds the First Cause as mover movement as the means and bodies as the result in the state power as the cause ministers as the means and subjects as the effects in the family the same relation is exemplified by father mother and children and in political society the monarch as cause ministersnobility as means and the subjects as effect These three terms bear specific relations to one another the first is to the second as the second to the third Thus in the great triad of the religious world—God the Mediator and Man—God is to the God Man as the God Man is to Man On this basis he constructed a system of political absolutism The sharing of power as in a democracy seemed ludicrous to de Bonald and the doctrine of the separation of powers tended towards anarchy The monarch rules for the good of society and thus represents the general will contrary to Rousseau whereas a multitude of individual wills even when united in purpose do not constitute the general will
The ideas of the traditionalist school would be condemned by the Catholic Church in papal encyclicals such as Mirari vos and Singulari Nos The conception of revelation advanced by the traditionalists would also be rejected at the First Vatican Council in the dogmatic constitution Dei Filius
Bonald published an anti Semitic text during the post French Revolutionary period Sur les juifs In it the philosophes are condemned for fashioning the intellectual tools used to justify Jewish emancipation during the Revolution Bonald accused French Jews of not becoming authentic French citizens and of being a disruptive force in traditional society Michele Battini writesAccording to Bonald the Constituent Assembly had committed the enormous mistake of knowingly putting laws in conflict with religion and customs but sooner or later the government would have to change its mind as would the friends of the blacks who regretted the haste with which they called for freedom for a people who had always been alien The Jews by their nature are a nation destined to remain alien to other peoples This foreignness appears—this seems the sense of the reference to the noirs —to be an objective fact permanent and physical and for this reason analogous to the racial difference with the blacksBonald called for the reversal of Jewish emancipation and endorsed new discriminatory measuressuch as the imposition of identifying marks on the clothes of the enemy who had become invisible because of emancipation The identification mark la marque distinctive would be fully justified by the need to identify those responsible for behavior hostile to the bien public Bonald's writings exercised a great deal of influence over conservative and French Catholic thought throughout the th century The French writer Honoré de Balzac considered himself to be an intellectual heir of Bonald and took up many Bonaldian themes in his writings once declaring that when it beheaded Louis XVI the Revolution beheaded in his person all fathers of families Bonald's influence carried on throughout the counter revolutionary tradition in the writings of Spanish conservative Juan Donoso Cortés and the ultramontane French journalist Louis Veuillot His writings also exerted a great influence over the corporatist philosophical tradition through Frédéric le Play and René de La Tour du Pin and through them he had an influence on the development of the principle of solidarity in Catholic social thought Bonald's direct influence fell into decline after World War I especially outside of French Catholic circles Since then he has generally suffered neglect at the hands of economic historians and historians of Catholic thought Bonald's thought has often drawn more positive attention from historians working within the Marxist or socialist tradition
Monarchy considers man in his ties with society a republic considers man independently of his relations to society
There was geometry in the world before Newton and philosophy before Descartes but before language there was absolutely nothing but bodies and their images because language is the necessary instrument of every intellectual operation nay the means of every moral existence
Man thinks his word before he speaks his thought or in other words man cannot speak his thought without thinking his word
The deist is a man who in his short existence has not had time to become an atheist
Absolute liberty of the press is a tax upon those who read It is demanded only by those who write
The cry 'Liberty equality fraternity or death' was much in vogue during the Revolution Liberty ended by covering France with prisons equality by multiplying titles and decorations and fraternity by dividing us Death alone prevailed
Wherever there are many machines to take the place of men many men will be mere machines The effects of machines in sparing men must be to diminish the population
