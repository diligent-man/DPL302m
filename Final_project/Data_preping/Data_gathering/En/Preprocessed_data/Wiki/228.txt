surgeon ernest cowell writing british official history great war described result saline solution battle somme disappointing
canadian surgeon recommended whole blood transfusion though volume used small even largest transfusion used litre
treatment shock wa based observation cowell walter bradford cannon
however plasma volume measurement suggested blood wa disappearing circulation could accounted for

treatment wa therefore aimed encouraging blood return circulation heating patient rubbing limb providing hot sweet tea intended increase circulation volume
large transfusion made possible development blood bank transformed many patients
alfred blalock proposed shock wa caused bleeding view accepted various authority by
war injury study grant reeve published recommended early transfusion large wound suggested existing theory inadequate
ruscoe clarke described observation birmingham accident hospital peacetime accident victim confirmed grant reeve's work provided evidence reject old capillary theory
work showed blood wa missing circulation often closed fracture open wound blood lost appeared proportional severity wound swelling injury frequently corresponded volume blood lost
blood loss open wound similarly matched blood lost circulation
blood loss consistently underestimated past provision large transfusion korean war saved people injury would otherwise survived
recommended significant blood loss occurred even extended period time patient transferred expert medical care receive immediate transfusion
